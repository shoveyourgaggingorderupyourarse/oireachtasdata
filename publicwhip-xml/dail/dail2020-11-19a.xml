This represents an increase of &euro;79 million, or 8%, on the 2020 allocation as published in the further Revised Estimates for my Department.  Those Revised Estimates included additional funding of &euro;183 million, secured during 2020, to deal with the impacts of Covid-19 and to ensure the survival and recovery of businesses and operations in the sectors for which I have ministerial responsibility.  The revised 2020 figures represented an increase of some 25% on the total comparable figure for the relevant programme areas in 2019.  In broad terms, the 2021 funding for these sectors will represent an increase of 35% on what was available to them in 2019 prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Our cultural institutions, theatres, tourist destinations, pubs, restaurants, sporting occasions and Gaeltacht communities have been severely impacted since the beginning of the pandemic in March.  The increased funding secured as part of budget 2021 is a testament to my commitment and that of the Government to ensure a range of robust funding streams and targeted measures are available to support resilience and recovery across these sectors, including a new &euro;55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses, &euro;50 million in support for the live entertainment industry, record funding of &euro;130 million for the Arts Council, &euro;8 million to provide for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall, more than &euro;78 million allocated to the Gaeltacht and Irish language sector, &euro;31.8 million for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, &euro;104.5 million for Sport Ireland, increased funding of &euro;40.7 million for TG4, and additional funding for Irish language broadcasting to meet New Decade, New Approach commitments.  As Minister, I am satisfied that the increase in funding to &euro;1.082 billion secured as part of budget 2021 will support resilience and recovery across the diverse sectors for which I have responsibility and allow them to thrive once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport, language and public service media.</p></speech>

That was not down to the Minister.  Rather, there was no proper scrutiny of the Revised Estimates.  That was just the nature of the way the meeting was handled.  I asked about the budget.  The Minister announced &euro;200 million of additional funding, but that did not reflect the Estimates budget book.  In the budget document, the gross Revised Estimates for 2020 amounted to just shy of &euro;1.003 billion.  The gross Estimate for 2021 was &euro;1.082 billion, representing an increase of &euro;79 million.  It is not that I am taking issue with the funding for Covid and so on in addition to core funding.  Rather, my issue is that the actual increase for 2021 is &euro;79 million.</p></speech>

This represents an increase of &euro;79 million, or 8%, on the 2020 allocation, as per the Revised Estimates voted for the Department on 8 October 2020.  The 2020 figures published as part of those further Revised Estimates included additional funding of &euro;183 million, which was secured during 2020 to deal with the impacts of Covid-19 and to ensure the survival and recovery of businesses and operations in sectors for which I have responsibility.  In broad terms, the 2021 funding for those sectors represents an increase of 35% on the 2019 levels.</p>  <p>  Some of the funding increases, such as the &euro;55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and the &euro;50 million for the live entertainment industry, are exclusively directed at interventions to mitigate the impact of Covid-19.  Other measures, such as the &euro;8 million for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra and funding to support the Irish language, are not Covid related but relate to the development of sectors generally and, in the case of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, recognise the Brexit-related challenges faced by its client companies.</p></speech>

When that is excluded, there is additional funding of just &euro;79 million for 2021.  It is not that I am taking issue with that funding, given that it is needed.  Plenty of businesses and sectors have fallen through the cracks, and that is a situation that must be addressed.  When the warranted and much-needed July stimulus package is excluded though, the Minister has secured just &euro;79 million for her Department for 2021.</p> <p>The budget document reflects the figures.  If they have been recycled from somewhere else or taken from another Department I ask her to tell us.  The budget document is in black and white and there is &euro;79 million in additional funding for 2021.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised the question of what is Covid spending and what is in the budget on a number of occasions.  A suite of funding measures, such as increased funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and Sport Ireland, represent an acknowledgement of the important role these organisations play generally in supporting the sector.  I know the Deputy has focused on what is Covid or non-Covid funding, but my focus is on giving support to the sectors that are struggling.  There is no precise Covid-19 allocation.  Rather, there is an increase in budget 2021 to reflect a mixture of supports for range of sectors which are impacted by Covid and Brexit or for which increased funding was deemed appropriate more generally.</p></speech>

The report included a recommendation that a universal basic income be piloted for a three-year period in the arts sector.  I very much welcome this report and thank the task force members for their time, expertise and commitment.</p>  <p>  The task force has made ten recommendations to aid the survival of the sector during Covid-19 and beyond under three themes: ensuring recovery; building resilience; and facing forward.  The ten recommendations seek to protect livelihoods, which is what the universal basic income pilot involves; mitigate income loss; ensure fair play for the makers of creative content; secure the viability of the live events industry; sustain local authority capacity to support arts and culture; ensure well-being; build sectoral capacity; make space for arts and live entertainment; provide more outdoor public spaces for cultural events; and address the environmental impact of arts, culture and event activities.  The task force report is extremely beneficial to the Government as we examine ways to help the arts and culture sector to emerge from this unprecedented position.  I will shortly establish an oversight committee for the appraisal of the task force's recommendations. </p>  <p>  On a broader level, the Government has already responded to the challenges facing the sector through a number of recent measures.  Some &euro;25 million was provided in June, including &euro;20 million for the Arts Council, as well as additional supports for regional museums.  A further &euro;29 million was announced in the July stimulus, including funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, our national cultural institutions, a music stimulus and supports for live performance.  Significant additional funding was announced in budget 2021, with &euro;130 million allocated to the Arts Council for 2021 and &euro;50 million for supports for life performance.  Tens of millions of euro in supports have been provided to those impacted in the arts, culture, performance and events sector through the pandemic unemployment scheme and various wage subsidy schemes.  Some people in those sectors have also availed of the commercial rates waivers and may avail of the Covid restrictions support scheme.</p></speech>

There is an urgency to this.  Many artists, musicians and those working in the creative world have adapted to their circumstances, but some have not been able to.  Some are in dire straits.  They are waiting for the oversight group to come up with how a basic income will be rolled out, such as its parameters and so on, while there is an urgency now.  How will the Minister roll out the basic income pilot scheme?  In the meantime, will she ensure that those artists and others working in creative industries can fully avail of the equivalent of what some of them enjoyed at the early stage of the Covid crisis, that is, the full pandemic unemployment payment while they are waiting for a basic income scheme?  While I do not fully agree with those types of schemes, the new scheme has yet to be rolled out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900004#B00700"><p>I can speak to the recommendations as they came from this task force, which comprised a broad range of people involved in the screen sector, the artistic community, our cultural institutions and the live event industry.  They identified ten key recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy said the universal basic income was a well-established proposal, long before the pandemic, and would involve a tax-free payment to residents of the State without reference to their means or availability for employment.  This would be a game changer for the community which is, as the Deputy rightly said, in dire straits.  We have to be prudent and do things properly.  Those who have artistic or creative work as their chief occupation often experience income insecurity and cash flow problems.  As the Deputy will know, financial stress can impede creativity.  The creation of art, whether that is music, live events or literature, requires practitioners to have the freedom to create.</p>  <p>  I have asked my Cabinet colleagues to assess all ten recommendations.  As the Deputy is aware, I led the Green Party negotiations and negotiated the commitment to the universal basic income in the programme for Government.  This report will feed into the national economic plan, which is also a commitment in the programme for Government.  I have started those conversations around universal basic income with my Cabinet colleagues.  I welcome this report because it accelerates the commitment to a universal basic income.  As the Deputy knows, a three-year pilot scheme has been sought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900004#B00800"><p>There is no doubt about the commitment of the Minister and those who have promoted it.  Some have not promoted it.  There should be a universal living wage.  We can deal with that another time.</p>  <p>  As the Minister said, this is a proposal from 2019 and is in the programme for Government.  It will not be rolled out within the next number of weeks or months because any such payments involve a series of mechanics.  I wish it could be done in the morning.  What can be done as an interim measure?  Those who wrote the report have already identified that 55,000 people will be affected.  In anticipation of the introduction of a basic income scheme, can the Minister roll out a temporary measure to cover those people until the scheme is in place?</p></speech>

In the interim, I hope he would know that I announced the successful applicants from the &euro;5 million pilot programme in the July stimulus package.  I will roll out &euro;50 million in the new year to help the sector.  The amount was increased to &euro;50 million because the &euro;5 million programme received &euro;16.5 million worth of applications.  This money will support artists and those working in the live event industry.  There is also unprecedented funding of &euro;130 million for the Arts Council.</p>  <p>  We have assessed the pilot programme.  I met representatives of the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland and the Event Production Industry Covid Working Group in recent weeks to assess the &euro;5 million pilot programme and examine what more we can do to support them and whether improvements can be made.  I have secured funding in budget 2021 to do that.</p></speech>

He has raised the issue of step dancing a number of times.</p>  <p>  The guidance set out in the Government's Plan for Living with Covid-19 specifies that no exercise or dance classes are allowed at levels 3, 4 or 5.  This precludes any exercise class, including gymnastics, and any type of dance class, including traditional, step, jazz or ballet.  Similarly, the guidance precludes any indoor gathering taking place at levels 3, 4 and 5 and, to date, there are no exemptions.  To provide clarity to the Deputy, there are no distinctions of the type he referenced in his question across levels 3, 4 and 5.  I acknowledge his feedback.  I have received a lot of correspondence about this.</p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation with a high incidence of the disease, widespread community transmission and a considerable number of hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to assess the current trajectory of Covid-19 and break transmission chains.</p> <p>This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus are minimised while allowing essential activities to continue.  Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities, including cultural activities.  At present, Ireland is at level 5 in our plan for living with Covid-19.  The public health risk at level 5 means we are all asked to stay at home, with very limited exceptions.<br/><br/>The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 give effect to level 5 restrictions currently under the plan.  The regulations list essential retail and services that may operate under level 5.  This list does not include private or any type of dance classes.  Under the regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible.  Where a service provider considers that it falls into the essential education category, for example, as part of a national curriculum or a specific State-sponsored course of study, it should refer to the Department of Education's guidance on the operation of education services.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>Similarly, the Health Act 1947 (Section 3 IA - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 7) Regulations, which applied when the country was under level 3 of the plan for living with Covid-19, did not allow any exercise or dance classes, irrespective of the form, such as Irish, jazz or ballet.<br/><br/>I fully understand the benefits that activities such as dance bring to people's overall health and well-being.  The measures in place to suppress the disease's transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking the right balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others.  Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests as much as possible.</p></speech>

Sports are allowed to go ahead in groups and people can practise.  Teachers and dancers recognise that the restrictions are necessary to curb the spread of Covid but this is totally unfair.  I have received 1,208 letters but one of them, from a six-year-old girl, is very striking.  She wrote that she misses and loves dance, and asked that she be let back to it so that she can dance, be happy and have fun.  It is vital that we protect our culture and heritage, and dance is a very important part of that.  What is the point of signing up to United Nations conventions if we are not going to allow the people the right?  Dancing schools are very safe environments.  The dancers are in pods and there are some very expensive and well-designed dance studios.  They are very well designed, safe and well ventilated.  The Minister of State may not be a dancer himself but he is well able to sidestep this issue, so he would be a good learner.</p></speech>

To be clear, there is no distinction at levels 3, 4 and 5 between indoor activity.  That is the context in which the Deputy raised the matter and he compared it to sport, but sport is allowed at level 3 in certain instances, outdoors in pods.  There is not, however, any distinction for any type of indoor activity relating to some of the comparative examples the Deputy gave.</p>  <p>  To be constructive, I am giving the Deputy the position as it is.  I encourage the groups and associations that have been in touch with him and are regularly in touch with me and the Minister to engage with the Arts Council, the Department and the document on living with Covid.  We will always engage with sectors on how the restrictions impact people.  We do not want to undermine what we have signed up to and subscribed to under the United Nations, as the Deputy outlined, but it is about having a basket of measures and a balancing act to protect public health while ensuring that important indoor activity, whether sport, dance or culture, will be promoted and enhanced.  I appreciate the Deputy's feedback and encourage the people who have sent him letters to continue to engage with the Department and the Arts Council.</p></speech>

A gymnastics school can operate under levels 3 and 4 but we cannot, so there is a discrepancy.  I urge the Minister of State to consider the physical, emotional, mental and pedological benefits that dance can bring to young people, and to allow the CLRG and other dance organisations to continue sharing their knowledge and expertise by advocating and permitting the continuation of Irish dance classes indoors and in socially distanced pods.  These are not reckless people but they want to go on with the excellent tuition they have.  Many of them danced as daoine &oacute;ga and went on to be world champions.  Look at Riverdance, Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; or the cultural activities of Comhaltas.  This is so important for us.  The Minister of State mentioned schools, where 30 kids are in a classroom with a teacher.  Many people do not excel at school but they might do so at dancing, art or music.  They too have to be catered for; we are not all going to be in academia.  This is very important for our culture, heritage and d&uacute;chas.  Going forward, we need this and will be proud of this.  If we are to deny these people a full year of tuition, however, we will lose them.</p>  <p>  I remind the Minister of State of the letter from the six-year-old girl.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil m&eacute; ag obair ar sin inniu.  I hope he will be in some way sympathetic and empathetic.  I ask him not to dance all over the UNESCO convention.  What is the point of signing up to it, with great fanfare, if we are not going to honour it?</p></speech>

We want to be constructive about this.  The longer that restrictions go on, particularly in levels 3 and 4 - I accept the Deputy's point - it limits important cultural activities and indoor sporting activities.  There is engagement between the Department and the groups and associations the Deputy mentioned to try to be helpful in that regard.  Nevertheless, the current position is as I have set out.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900006#D00800"><p>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, I established the arts and culture recovery task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the view of stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid-19 recovery and beyond.  The negative impact of the crisis on the arts, culture and live entertainment sectors has been well established and quantified over recent months in research undertaken by the Arts Council and my Department.  As an artist himself and from our numerous conversations about these matters, I know that Deputy Duffy is keenly aware of the devastating impact of the Covid-19 crisis on many of his friends and colleagues working in the sector.</p>  <p>  The task force has issued its report and I have brought it to the attention of my Government colleagues and arranged for its publication.  Under the chairmanship of Ms Clare Duignan, the members of the task force brought together a depth of knowledge and experience.  They produced their report in a matter of weeks and I am grateful to all of the members for their energy, commitment and insights.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to two specific recommendations in the report.  The proposal for a UBI scheme is the key recommendation.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government, as the Deputy noted, to request the Low Pay Commission, informed by a review of previous international pilot schemes, to examine the introduction of a pilot scheme in the lifetime of the Government.  While this is a matter for the commission, once requested by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine the matter, I am personally very supportive of the proposal, which reflects the commitment set out in the programme for Government.  I want to see the matter thoroughly examined in the context of the national economic plan.  It will ultimately be a decision for the Low Pay Commission, but there are clear reasons that the arts and culture sectors are the right sectors for such a pilot scheme.  There have been numerous trials of UBI in other countries, notably Finland, and even a recent call from 500 MPs, lords and local councillors for a trial in the UK.  France has had a scheme in place since 1936 that supports artists.</p>  <p>  The second recommendation the Deputy referred to is the sectoral capacity building and upskilling scheme for artists and creative workers aimed at recovery and renewal through professional development.  This is a measure around learning and development.  The task force recommended that a dedicated bespoke scheme of supports is required.  It is another proposal that I am anxious for the oversight group to examine.</p></speech>

The Green Party has campaigned for the introduction of universal basic income and successfully negotiated to have it included in the programme for Government.  The report sets out an initial pilot scheme for the arts and culture sector, which would be the first time the State will have such a programme.  The Green Party has always advocated for the vital role our artists play in maintaining a healthy society.  The &euro;4 million capacity building and upskilling funding is welcome.  From my participation in the sector as an artist, I believe artists are conduits who reflect society through their work.  They often become fused into the heartbeat of their communities.  This can bring various mental health issues and, in that regard, I highlight and welcome the Minding Creative Minds recommendation which aims to combat this.  Will the Minister discuss the measures she intends to take on mental health arising out the report?</p></speech>

This is based on programmes such as Minding Creative Minds, an organisation established to offer a free 24-7 well-being and support programme for the Irish music sector.  It provides access to an experienced team of trained counsellors and psychotherapists who can offer short-term intervention and advice covering practical, day-to-day issues that cause anxiety and stress.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 is bringing a lot of stress into all of our lives.  Many of us rely on arts and culture to provide some relief, but those who make the art also need support.  I am very supportive of this proposal and I have asked my officials to seek to progress it as soon as possible.  This issue needs to be addressed promptly.  Just as we miss attending live music gigs and going to theatres, our artists are really missing performing in front of audiences.  The interaction between musician and audience is a key part of maintaining positive mental health for artists.  They need that support and I will look to address it.</p></speech>

It is important to see the mental health of artists being supported through initiatives such as Minding Creative Minds.  I know the Minister has spent a considerable amount of time pursuing mental health resourcing generally in her time in this House.  Funding of our artists through upskilling and capacity building is essential for a vibrant and dynamic sector.  Having received funding in the past, I know at first hand how vital it can be, not only to assist creative professionals in their endeavours but also to help us better relate to one another through appreciation of our shared culture and art.</p> <p>With our colleagues in the Green Party, the Minister and I have long campaigned for the introduction of a universal basic income.  It is great to see a pilot scheme of this Green Party policy being acted upon by the Government.  Can the Minister give a firm timeline of when a UBI will be in place and operational?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, those who create artistic or creative work where it is their chief occupation often experience income insecurity and cash flow problems.  That was the case pre-Covid and it will be so post Covid.  That financial stress can impede creativity.  A 2018 review of pay and conditions in the performing arts by Theatre Forum found that 30% of artists and practitioners earn less than the national minimum wage and the circumstances in 2020, of course, are worse.  The Deputy referred to the programme for Government commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine that.  This is a key commitment in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The task force has suggested that a UBI pilot scheme would cost an additional &euro;2.5 million per annum over and above the current pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, cost per 1,000 participants.  We will need to look at other UBI models, such as those in Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and California.  The recommendation to undertake a pilot UBI scheme for the arts and culture community brings this debate forward.  I really welcome that, as it needs to be treated with the urgency it deserves.  I have started those conversations around UBI with my Cabinet colleagues.  Workers in the cultural sector need ongoing support if it is to avoid depletion of talent by migration away towards other sources of income.</p></speech>

I am acutely aware of the valuable source of reliable and trustworthy news that local radio offers in a time of uncertainty and with much disinformation in circulation.  Local radio also plays an important role in bringing communities together, strengthening their bonds of solidarity and mutual support.  I recognise the challenges faced by the sector due to Covid-19 and I am pleased the supports in 2020 have provided a valuable source of funding at this challenging time.</p>  <p>  During 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which is statutorily independent, held two closed rounds for radio targeted at the independent commercial and community radio sectors, respectively.  In June 2020, the BAI awarded &euro;2.5 million sound and vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of Covid-19.  This was in addition to a waiver of the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for the first and second quarters of 2020, which saved the sector &euro;1 million.  I secured &euro;839,000 in budget 2021 to compensate the BAI for this levy waiver.</p>  <p>  LMFM, which the Deputy and I are familiar with, was awarded &euro;95,000 under round 35 and a community radio station, Dundalk FM, was awarded &euro;16,945 under round 36.  In addition, the BAI distributed &euro;750,000 in a special round for community radio that Dundalk FM benefited from.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the sound and vision scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach.  In light of the ongoing challenge faced by the sector, I secured an additional &euro;2 million in Exchequer funding for the sound and vision scheme under the July stimulus package.  This has greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round for the scheme this year, round 37, bringing it to a value of &euro;4.5 million.</p>  <p>  The BAI continues to report to me quarterly on the impact of Covid-19 on the commercial radio sector.  For the Deputy's information, local radio has been included in the Government's current advertising campaign on resilience.</p>  <p>  The BAI is currently finalising the most recent round and no decisions regarding 2021 rounds have yet been made.  However, the BAI will be meeting with representatives of the commercial radio sector to discuss the approach to sound and vision in the new year.  I very much welcome that.  That engagement needs to happen.  I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how best we can support this sector.</p></speech>

The fund of &euro;2.5 million was available for Covid-related programming up until the end of the summer, but since then local radio stations have been in dire straits with a dramatic drop in revenue, and particularly under level 5 restrictions.</p>  <p>  There are serious concerns in the sector about the additional &euro;2 million that was allocated under the July stimulus.  Is it correct to say that this funding was a separate stream for elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the previous &euro;2.5 million Covid round?  This would mean that local radio stations are not in a position to avail of this round of funding.  I wonder if the Minister could clarify this.  It would mean, in fact, that they have had no additional help since the end of the summer, for this period and going into 2021.  Will the Minister consider making an additional grant available to local radio stations given their dire financial predicament?</p></speech>

I met with representatives of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland on Monday last, 16 November.  We had a productive discussion on the value of the supports the sector has received during 2020 and a follow-up meeting was held yesterday at official level.  I also met with the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, on Tuesday, and my officials will continue the engagement with the NUJ.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question, local radio stations are in a position to avail of this round.  The funding of &euro;2 million which was secured was allocated to the fund for the latest round, round 37.  This round was opened for applications on 8 September 2020, with a closing date of 7 October 2020.  The BAI will make decisions on the successful applicants over the coming weeks and thereafter it will be a matter for those awarded funding under the scheme to produce the programmes being supported.  The BAI will enter into contracts with successful applicants which will determine the manner in which the funds are drawn down and set out the timeline for same.</p>  <p>  If there is anything specifically that the Deputy needs information on, I can ask the BAI to engage directly with her too if that would be helpful.</p></speech>

Maybe she could clarify whether she intends to give that additional grant.</p>  <p>  The BAI levy, as we heard at the committee, is a significant cost to local radio stations.  They have received a waiver for the first and second quarters of this year but they are looking, given their financial predicament, to see if that can be waived again for the second part of this year and into 2021.

The particular support depends on the institutional arrangements of the individual or organisation and whether it is a sole trader or an incorporated entity.</p> <p>Detailed information on all supports is provided on <i>gov.ie</i>and a guide to business supports booklet giving details of the key supports and resources available to help businesses is available also.  Businesses may qualify for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which I launched earlier this month together with the Minister for Finance.  It is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by the level 3 or higher restrictions introduced by Government.  Qualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment in respect of an advanced credit for trading expenses for the period of the restrictions.  The scheme will operate until 31 March 2021.<br/><br/>In budget 2021 the Government announced the provision of a support of &euro;50 million for the live entertainment sector after a period of engagement between it and officials from my Department.  It is the first time this sector has received direct support and that tells us a lot about the impact of Covid-19.  The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders as a follow up to the &euro;5 million pilot scheme and I have significantly increased funding to the Arts Council in 2021 from &euro;80 million at the beginning of the year to &euro;130 million in 2021.  Since the onset of Covid-19, the Arts Council has extended its reach and in 2020 has provided grants to many individuals and organisations.  On the exact proposal or recommendation with the live events and the supports needed in the task force, I am engaging with it already on the &euro;50 million for the live entertainment sector to see how we can improve the &euro;5 million pilot to reach out more and support more.</p></speech>

The report itself, however, obviously influenced by the campaigning of groups like the Events Industry Alliance and the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC, points out that huge numbers of SMEs in the music and live entertainment sector will not qualify for the CRSS because they do not have rateable or public-facing premises and so on.  This, by the way, is the same point I have made about taxi drivers.  They are excluded from these supports and, in fact, they are probably the people who need the most.  It is all very well announcing schemes and having positive proposals from a task force but if they are not implemented it will not mean a hell of a lot to the people who are really on their knees.  More widely, it is worrying that there is, from what I can see, no timeline for the universal basic income pilot and in a number of other areas, it seems we are going to follow a task force report with an oversight committee.  When is it actually going to happen because it is urgent?</p></speech>

We met with the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, last week and we have met with representatives from EPIC.  We have asked them to consider what changes could be made to the &euro;5 million pilot scheme.  That is not just a scheme, we have seen it up and running.  Last weekend saw the first events from that &euro;5 million and there will be many more over the coming weeks and covering the Christmas period.  These include pantomimes, live performances and musicians performing all across the State.  I watched David Kitt play Mike the Pies on Tuesday and there are upcoming performances, including by Lisa Hannigan, Lantern events and the 4 of Us at the Spirit Store.  There is a list of instances where we can see this money actually being used and providing a much-needed platform for performers.  I am continuing the consultation with the sector to give careful consideration to how we can improve that &euro;50 million on foot of the &euro;5 million to help it, especially those who cannot access the CRSS.</p>  <p>  On the UBI, I launched that report this week, only 48 hours ago.  I am going to move with the oversight committee as a matter of priority.  I cannot provide a timeline immediately.  I want to do this properly.  We have one shot at this and I want to do it the right way.  I am hoping the &euro;50 million will provide the lifeline, as will the other supports I have given throughout the year.</p></speech>

The central point of what I said at the time was that life, without arts, music and culture, would not be worth living.  I am glad to find that sentiment has found its way into the title of the Minister's report.  However, while we have all these positive proposals, what has actually happened?  Many of the people who really need the help and are fighting for their lives are excluded from the CRSS.</p>  <p>  The PUP has been cut for many of the people impacted.  I would say that the Department has shelves full of reports on the need for pensions for people in the arts and all sorts of stuff that never happened.  Yes, we have made progress in having a few good proposals because of the campaigning by and desperation of those in the sector, but there has to be urgency in their delivery and the idea we are going to have another report on top of the last one is pretty worrying.</p></speech>

To clarify, it is not my report nor the Department's; this report belongs to those who work in the community, from screen producers to the live events industry to the artists and the cultural institutions.  It is their report.  These are their recommendations which they have brought to me.  It was part of the programme for Government commitment to set up that task force, which I very quickly did, and to get the report in a very quick timeline of six weeks.  The task force is to be commended on bringing it down to ten key proposals.  What have I done in a number of months?  I brought in the &euro;29 million in the July stimulus, &euro;130 million for the Arts Council in 2021 and &euro;50 million for a live event entertainment consultation.  The community this impacts welcomed this report.  It can trust, given my track record in four months in this position, that I am serious about giving the support to this community which I, like many in this House, feel is an essential part of our identity as a nation.</p></speech>

These sectors are integral to our society; supporting economic activity; and enhancing physical and societal well-being.  The public-facing and audience-driven nature of those sectors means that each time there is an escalation in the level applicable under the Plan for Living with Covid-19, these sectors are often the hardest hit.  My officials and I are acutely aware of the need to support our sectors through these challenging times and have been in regular and sustained contact with a broad range of stakeholders over the past weeks and months.  In addition to bilateral engagements with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies under the aegis of the Department, a number of task forces and consultative forums have been established in relation to the particular difficulties facing these sectors.  This includes the Tourism Recovery Task Force, the Tourism Hospitality Forum, the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force, and the Sports Monitoring Group.  These involve a broad range of stakeholders with experience and insight to develop sustainable road maps for the recovery of these sectors.  This engagement led to the very favourable outcomes achieved for these sectors in the context of the July stimulus and budget 2021.  I will continue this positive engagement with the sectors and consider the views and recommendations of these task forces and consultative forums in regard to any further necessary measures or supports required as a consequence of Covid-19.  That engagement is key to informing our decisions so we do the right things.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I put in place substantial measures in budget 2021 to support and strengthen the sectors.  This engagement with stakeholders has been key in providing a comprehensive response to the impact of Covid-19.  In tandem with these support measures, consultative groups were established in both the sport and culture sectors to ensure the necessary guidance and supports are in place to comply with the requirements of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19, including the Expert Group on the Return to Sport and the National Cultural Institutions Consultative Forum.  I am also engaging with the stakeholders across the broadcasting and media sector and the Deputy would have heard me describing some of the meetings that have happened this week earlier in the debate.  I note particularly the important advocacy role played by agencies under the aegis of my Department.  Agencies, including the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Sport Ireland, have worked diligently with my officials to raise awareness of the challenges facing our sectors and to identify ways to support them through this pandemic.</p>  <p>  The need for important public health measures such as social distancing has placed necessary limits on gatherings to protect public health.  Some of the key measures that have been introduced in 2020 to help the sectors within my Department's remit include and additional &euro;25 million for the Arts Council, a &euro;5 million live events pilot scheme, &euro;5 million to support the national cultural institutions, NCIs, and nationwide arts infrastructure.</p> <p>There is also a &euro;5 million company stabilisation support for Gaeltacht companies, the stay and spend tax credit initiative, a &euro;26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector, a &euro;10 million grant for coach tourism, &euro;40 million for the three main field sport bodies, namely, the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, and a &euro;15 million fund for sport governing bodies and clubs.  The universal income supports of the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme have been key to supporting all sectors throughout the crisis.  The extension of both of these schemes has provided some much needed certainty.</p></speech>

Has the Minister continued to monitor this, as it impacts more on some organisations than others and it impacts more on the income streams of some than others?  Having monitored the situation, to what degree will the Minister be in a position to offer further measures of support if required?</p></speech>

It is absolutely critical to provide the correct supports, for example, the &euro;50 million live events scheme, from which I hope some in the Deputy's constituency will benefit.  We are tweaking what happened with the &euro;5 million pilot scheme to find ways to reach those we did not reach..  We are looking to see how best we can implement the tourism recovery task force but the Deputy can already see that we have brought in a fund in the budget to provide support for strategic tourism businesses.  The supports and engagement will change with the ever-changing nature of Covid and all Ministers in every Department will have to be cognisant of finding the right supports and we will continue with this engagement to inform it.</p></speech>

It commits to increasing the visibility of our native language and its daily use in the community and to a series of measures which will help to achieve these objectives.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, and I are working together to achieve these important objectives.</p>  <p>  These measures will build on existing legislation, policies and schemes in place to support the language.  In relation to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, the primary objective the Official Languages Act 2003 is to ensure the improved provision of public services through the Irish language.  The Act provides for the delivery of public services in Irish in three ways.  These are through provisions of the Act, which are applicable to all public bodies under the Act, through regulations made by the Minister, which again are applicable to all public bodies under the Act, and through language schemes which are agreed with individual public bodies and which provide for an increase over time in the number and standard of services provided in Irish by these individual public bodies.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in strengthening the Irish language.  As the Deputy is aware, a Bill is currently before the House with a view to strengthening the 2003 Act.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, and I are of the same mind that this Bill, and the amendments therein, are very important to the Irish language and that they will help to strengthen the Irish language in the State system so that high quality Irish language services will be available to the Irish speaking and Gaeltacht communities. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific amendment raised in the question, the measure suggested is covered by the existing provisions of SI No. 391 of 2008.  Section 7(1) of this regulation provides that, in respect of stationery, the text in the Irish language shall appear first while, in respect of signage, excluding road signage which does not come within the scope of the Act, the text in the Irish language shall also appear first.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.  We will work constructively with every party and Member of the House.  Yesterday, I spoke to the Deputy's party colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, about trying to progress the official languages Bill through the House, and amendments will arise on strengthening the Bill from all Members and we will work constructively in this regard to get it right.</p></speech>

In Scotland, the decision has been delegated to local councils so if people go through Motherwell they will see Tobar na M&agrave;thar is written at the railway station.  If people drive through Wales the priority is the Welsh language.  People catching the ferry will see a sign for Abertawe but they might not necessarily know it is Swansea.  The Minister of State referred to SI No. 391 of 2008.  The difficulty with this and road signs is that the Irish language tends to be smaller and in italics, whereas the English language is in capital letters and much bigger.  For example, someone driving through east Limerick sees a sign for Oola, and this spelling is ridiculous.  What really should be there is the Irish language &Uacute;lla, which means apples, and this is what should be prioritised.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Martin, and I hope to meet the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who has a role in the legislative context, and the Minister for Transport on how guidelines are issued for road signage.  It has to be a visible language in our road signage and the Deputy has identified the issues that are there plain and simple with the example of Oola in east Limerick.  I share the Deputy's concerns about this.  We have to strengthen it in the context of the legislation we are progressing and the responsibilities that fall throughout Government with other Ministers who have responsibility for transport and for housing, heritage and local government.  We will shortly meet with both Ministers to discuss this matter and try to provide a new context and learn from examples, and the Deputy has mentioned Scotland and other places.</p></speech>

The regulation in Wales states that when a new sign is being erected, a sign is being renewed, or a notice is published or displayed that conveys the same information in Welsh and English, the Welsh language text must be positioned so it is likely to be read first.  This is the opposite of what happens here.  I am glad I can hear the enthusiasm of the Minister of State for this.  In Wales, it applies to all signs.  I can flesh it out during Private Members' time if the Minister of State wishes.  It can quite easily be done through changing the regulations so we do not drive through west Cork and see a sign for Snave, which is Sn&aacute;mh in Irish.  The intention of the regulations brought in was to ensure there is an understanding of what Brian Friel spoke about regarding the topography of the area.  This can be easily done through prioritising Irish.</p></speech>

We need to learn from comparative examples in our close neighbours.  The Deputy referenced Wales and Scotland.  We will engage with other Ministers who have regulations specifically referenced in this regard.  We will also engage with the committee.  We should improve this and change the current context, which in my view is not satisfactory if we want to have a living language and if it is our primary language as per the Constitution.</p> <p>It is clear there is a relative inferiority on road signs and that is not positive for the language.  However, with cross-government engagement and engagement across the House, we can provide changes in that regard.  In the first instance, we have to engage with our colleagues and then have a discussion on the regulations.  I appreciate the Deputy raising the issue.</p></speech>

As Shannon Group operates in both the aviation and tourism sectors, it has been severely impacted by Covid-19.  With regard to tourism, budget 2021 included a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the tourism sector and they are supplemented by the economy-wide business supports and social welfare measures.  The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by more than &euro;59 million, or 36%, over the initial 2020 allocation in budget 2020 to &euro;220.9 million.  Combined with other measures such as the Covid resilience support scheme, CRSS, and the rates waiver, the Government is helping to sustain businesses that have been most severely affected by the necessary public health restrictions.</p><p>As part of the budget package of measures, &euro;55 million has been provided for business continuity schemes for strategic tourism businesses to help them survive through the pandemic and be there to help drive the recovery.  This funding will be administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and focused on those strategic businesses.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently engaging with those tourism sectors in the design of funding schemes, taking into account the effect of other horizontal funding measures, such as CRSS.</p><p>The VAT rate for the sector is reduced to 9%, which will improve the competitiveness and viability of businesses.  Funding of &euro;5 million has also been provided for focused upskilling training to support business survival and recovery in the sector, and for the improvement of the digital presence and e-commerce capability of tourism businesses.  Investment in the tourism marketing fund has been maintained to ensure that Ireland is in a position to recover quickly, when it is safe for tourists to return from our key markets.</p><p>In response to the impacts of Covid-19, the Government has put in place a range of supports to help business and our citizens face the challenges presented by this global pandemic.  I would encourage the entity responsible for the management of the sites concerned to liaise with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on what State supports might be available.  Horizontal supports include the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the rates waiver, VAT warehousing and CRSS.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The tourism recovery task force undertook a comprehensive analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector and drew up a recovery plan containing more than 30 recommendations across a number of areas, designed to help the sector to survive and recover from the crisis out to 2023.  Its short-term recommendations informed the sector-specific measures adopted in the budget.  To help inform my ongoing response to the pandemic, I will shortly appoint an oversight group which will monitor the implementation of the recovery plan, as well as the recovery of the tourism sector in general.</p></speech>

Once again, the management of Shannon Group is saying that, due to the downturn in international tourism and ongoing loss-making, it will be forced to close iconic sites such as Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle from January onwards, and that these sites will remain closed until the start of the summer season.  Bunratty Castle dates back to the 15th century and King John's Castle to the 13th century.  The combined Shannon Heritage sites in the mid-west employ some 350 employees, with 145 of these working on a 12-month, all-year-round basis.  They are of strategic importance in the mid-west region and both sites enjoyed a bumper season of domestic tourism this summer.  If we close them, what chance are we giving our region?  If we close them, we cause immeasurable damage to the supply chains of the hotels, restaurants and bars which are already struggling.</p><p>The Department proposes to bring forward proposals to Cabinet on how Shannon Heritage sites can be run and managed in the near future.  The threat of closure gives added urgency to this, given we do not know what the future holds for Shannon Heritage.  We also need to know what will happen at Craggunowen Castle, Dunguaire Castle and Knappogue Castle.</p></speech>

It is open to Shannon Heritage to explore further the various support mechanisms now available to it, and I would encourage it to liaise with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on what State supports might be available.</p>  <p>  I know this is something the Deputy raised with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, earlier this week.  If there is funding available from his Department, that is a matter for him, and I know he has spoken on this issue and is aware of the challenges the company faces.  As part of the budget package of measures for various strategic tourism businesses, &euro;55 million has been provided for the business continuity scheme to help businesses survive through the pandemic and be there to help drive the recovery.

If these sites were closed again in January, it would cost the State in the region of &euro;1 million to keep the employees supported on unemployment payments.  As the cost of keeping them open is &euro;550,000, it does not make economic sense to close them.  There should already be a pot of money available to the Government to facilitate this.  The Government did the right thing to save jobs and avert closures of these iconic sites last August.  I again appeal to Mary Considine and her management team at the Shannon Group to engage with the Government, as the Minister has invited them to do, and once again strike such a deal.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by referencing the motto emblazoned across the Clare County crest - d&iacute;lis d&aacute;r n-oidhreachta; loyal to our heritage.  For the sake of workers, for the sake of tourism and for the sake of the mid-west region and its economy, we have to be loyal to our heritage sites at a time of need.</p></speech>

Within my remit, I can point to the extensive supports that have been introduced economy-wide and specifically within the tourism sector to support businesses, and which Shannon Heritage can avail of.  This is a very difficult time for Shannon Heritage and I am very aware of that.  I will liaise with my Cabinet colleagues to see how best they will continue the engagement.</p></speech>

This includes funding of &euro;450,000 for commitments made by the Southern Government under New Decade, New Approach.  The 2021 allocation, which is subject to further discussion with the Department for Communities in the North and the Deputy's colleague there, and to approval by the North South Ministerial Council, would allow Foras na Gaeilge, one of the agencies of An Foras Teanga, expand its language and cultural programmes to new areas and increase funding, where appropriate, for existing language groups, to include those funded under An Sc&eacute;im Pobal Gaeilge, SPG.</p>  <p>  A primary objective of the revised SPG will be to support Government policies, North and South: in the South, as set out in the Gaeltacht Act 2012 in respect of Irish language networks and Gaeltacht service towns; and in the North, as demonstrated in the strategy to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  The new scheme, the funding levels of which are currently being finalised by Foras na Gaeilge, will be advertised in the new year.  As part of a progressive approach, it is envisaged that the new scheme will be focused on the principles of language planning and that a long-term objective of the scheme would be that applicants eventually achieve recognition as an Irish language network.</p>  <p>  My Department currently approves language plans for Irish language networks and Gaeltacht service towns which can apply for a further &euro;80,000 per annum, through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or Foras na Gaeilge, depending on their location, for the plan's implementation on top of the funding received under SPG.  Due to their populations and size, the cities of Galway and Cork will be awarded an additional &euro;100,000 in total towards the implementation of their language plans.  All in all, therefore, this represents a significantly increased level of funding available to SPGs operating within Irish language networks and Gaeltacht service towns when compared to those operating outside these areas.</p></speech>

That would result in them being unable to continue employing an Irish language development officer.  I take the Minister of State's assurance that there are no plans to cut the funding of these schemes, despite the fact that the schemes have been very successful in promoting the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht.  I welcome the extra funding for Foras na Gaeilge in budget 2021.  It is imperative that the additional funding ensures that no difference will be made between any sc&eacute;im pobal Gaeilge, SPG, located in an area with an Irish language network or a Gaeltacht service town.</p></speech>

Preliminary consultation meetings were held by Foras na Gaeilge, in conjunction with Conradh na Gaeilge and Gl&oacute;r na nGael, with stakeholders in 2019.  Other preliminary meetings were held in June this year, which were attended by more than 80 people, on the recommendations of a consultation document.</p>  <p>  The criteria of the scheme will be based on the main language planning areas and on language planning principles, including the areas criteria in use by Foras na Gaeilge for the Irish language networks in the North and by the Government in the South for the language planning process.  I might go into further detail on that when I come back in but as the Deputy will know from the budgetary allocation for the entire Gaeltacht area, it is an expansionary budget to support the Irish language and the language planning officers.  Fears of cuts are mislaid.  I know in the Deputy's county of Mayo, where I have many family members, the importance of the language planning system.  We are working to try to put a long-term framework around that through Foras na Gaeilge.</p></speech>

From my engagement with the people involved I would argue that &euro;55,000 needs to be confirmed for each scheme in the new SPG.  There is a need for the Department to ensure that the increased funding in the budget is reflected in the funding that actually reaches the SPGs.  I would encourage the Minister to engage further with Foras na Gaeilge to make sure that this happens.  I thank him for the reassurances he has given and I take it as a commitment that there will be no differentiation between the moneys allocated.</p></speech>

There will be ongoing engagement with Foras na Gaeilge in the long-term planning process.  As I said, the Department is providing separate support for Sc&eacute;im Pobal Gaeilge.  We are being thorough around that.  We have to align it to the 20-year language planning process but in the context of workers and language planning officers, we are trying to retain, enhance and expand that concept across the country, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, some of which are in the Deputy's constituency where there is a strong essence of the language.  I hope that provides clarity.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy separately on it.  We are agreeing the Foras na Gaeilge funding through the North-South process.  We will have a meeting on that in the next couple of weeks when I hope we can get the budget agreed and ensure certainty for next year.</p></speech>

The Government is critically aware of the importance of a vibrant, diverse and independent media, which is essential to our democracy and to our cultural development.  The sector is undergoing fundamental change which extends well beyond the current Covid difficulties and there are significant and complex challenges to be faced to ensure a sustainable future for our local, regional and national media.  That is why the programme for Government committed to a Future of Media Commission and brought policy responsibility for media functions under the remit of my Department. </p>  <p>  The Government has moved quickly to establish the Future of Media Commission under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith.  The commission has already commenced its work and will examine all of these issues and consult widely with the sector.  I look forward to receiving the commission's report next year.</p>  <p>  In parallel to this development, I have been meeting the sector to discuss the longer-term issues impacting on its sustainability, as well as the more immediate challenges relating to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have already been put in place to support the sector.  In addition to the general Covid supports available to all businesses such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, waived the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for quarters 1 and 2 of 2020 saving the sector &euro;1 million, and I secured funding in budget 2021 to recoup the BAI for this waiver.  A special sound and vision funding round of &euro;2.5 million was provided to the commercial sector over the summer months.  There was also a special sound and vision round of &euro;750,000 for the community radio sector.  I have also provided  an additional &euro;2 million for sound and vision under the July stimulus package.  </p>  <p>  The BAI is reporting to me quarterly on the impacts on the commercial radio sector and these reviews will help to inform what, if any, additional measures may need to be taken in that sector. </p>  <p>  I am currently considering what further measures might be appropriate to support the sector through the Covid-19 pandemic and while task forces have been used across sectors such as tourism and culture, this would not necessarily be the most effective means to address the media sector, particularly when the Future of Media Commission has already commenced its work and is due to report within nine months.  I intend, however, to continue to engage closely with the sector to ensure that it is sustained through this challenging period.</p></reply>

Does the Minister have a particular date in mind because there are concerns that it will go right into 2022, which is a long time to wait for a sector that has been severely affected by the Covid-19 crisis?  The Minister stated that she had set up other Covid-19 task forces on tourism, etc., in her Department but it is something to consider given the serious issues facing the media.  We are talking about a short-term task force, literally to address their financial straits.  We had spoken earlier about the financial situation local radio is in given the dramatic loss in revenue.  We spoke also about the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's request to have the levy extended for the second half of this year and into next year, again due to its dire financial circumstances.  Would the Minister consider it given what I have outlined?</p></speech>

It has met twice since its establishment.  It has a strategic role in regard to the future vision, structuring and funding of media.  On when it will report, it is due to report within nine months.  That was announced on the date the commission was established.  That is an ambitious timescale given the complexity of the issues relating to the future of media but I have full confidence in the commission under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith.</p>  <p>  My approach to this sector is to engage directly with its representatives in bodies across the sector.  I met the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland representatives on Monday.  We had a productive discussion on the value of the supports to the sector received through 2020 and they outlined their proposals for additional supports for the sector.  I asked for the engagement to continue in recognition of the urgency of the situation and a follow-up meeting was held yesterday at official level.  I met also the National Union of Journalists on Tuesday of this week and my officials will also have a follow-up meeting with them.  I am undertaking to continue this close engagement to ensure the appropriate measures are put in place to support the sector through the crisis.</p></speech>

It would address the Covid-specific issues I have outlined, which have literally turned the sector upside down over the past nine months and which, unfortunately, will be with us for the foreseeable future.  The Minister said the commission will address the issues into the future in a long-term way but I am sure she has been lobbied by various stakeholders offering ideas and solutions and airing their problems and concerns that have yet to be addressed.  We had the media representatives before the Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and they echoed similar concerns.  As I said, they are concerned that there is no end date in terms of the report of the Future of Media Commission.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>They specifically expressed the need for something in the short term to deal with Covid-specific issues.

The Government has so far adopted an approach of refusing to answer questions about any of this but this is a really important matter.  It is not trivial.  It is a job that carries with it a salary in excess of &euro;220,000, which is paid by taxpayers.  Those taxpayers have a right to know how Mr. Justice Woulfe was appointed and who really made the decisions.  Refusing to answer the question simply will not cut it.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice needs to come before the D&aacute;il.  Three years ago, when the T&aacute;naiste was Taoiseach, the former Minister for Justice and Equality came to the D&aacute;il and answered questions.  There is no reason that it should not happen now.  The Green Party leader said this morning that he had no objection to this.  A Government Deputy said on the radio earlier that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, should come before the D&aacute;il to answer questions.  The entire Opposition is united in its demand for the Minister for Justice to come here to do that.  She needs to do so without delay.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also has serious questions to answer because in the vast majority of time that this issue was being dealt with by the Government, he was Taoiseach.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will enlighten us about his role.  We know that the only name to emerge from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, process was that out of the outgoing Attorney General, Mr. Justice S&eacute;amus Woulfe.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will acknowledge that Mr. Justice Woulfe is a long-time member of Fine Gael, a close political ally and a friend.  There were three other applications from existing judges.  They were presumably well qualified and experienced.  These would have in fact crossed the desk of the former Attorney General, Mr. Justice Woulfe.  Did the T&aacute;naiste discuss these with him?  Did he discuss them as Taoiseach with the former Minister for Justice and Equality or as T&aacute;naiste with the current Minister for Justice?  He knew that Mr. Justice Woulfe emerged from the JAAB process because he told the Fianna F&aacute;il leader and the Green Party leader, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that this was the case.  The Taoiseach said as much yesterday.  When did the T&aacute;naiste tell them that it was the case?  Why did he not tell them about the other three judges who were interested in the role?  Was he the one who took the decision to nominate the former Attorney General to the Cabinet for this position?</p>  <p>  Let us call a spade a spade.  People believe it was the T&aacute;naiste, as leader of Fine Gael, who reduced the number from four to one and brought that name before the Cabinet.  It is for that reason that he is avoiding the Minister for Justice coming in here, being held accountable and being asked questions about the process.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900012#K00300"><p>I believe the appointment of Mr. Justice S&eacute;amus Woulfe to the Supreme Court was a suitable appointment.  He is now a serving member of the Supreme Court and I hope that nobody is questioning his suitability to be a Supreme Court Justice, recognising the separation of powers and the need to uphold the Judiciary.  He had years of experience as a barrister and a senior counsel.  He was an excellent Attorney General.  He was competent, efficient and approachable, notwithstanding his recent issues.  He is certainly not the first Attorney General to be appointed to a superior court, nor will he be the last.  That is not just my opinion.  That was the opinion of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, to which he applied.  That board, chaired by the Chief Justice and including the presidents of the other courts, lay people, representatives of the Bar Council and the Law Society, all determined and agreed that S&eacute;amus Woulfe was a suitable person to appoint to the Supreme Court.  Just as the Taoiseach said, that was enough for him, and it was certainly enough for me.</p>  <p>  Under the Constitution, as I think everyone is aware, judges are nominated by the Government and appointed by the President.  That is a power and a responsibility that cannot be delegated to any other body.  In a democracy, it is right that judges are appointed by the democratically elected Government.  I would not like to see a situation where judges are appointed by other judges, by themselves, or by an unelected committee of some sort.  One needs to have a good process, a good advisory body to vet appointments and make sure they are appropriate and a system where people can apply to fill a vacancy.  We need further reform in this area and the Government plans to do that.  Ultimately the Government makes the decision on who will or will not be a judge, under the Constitution, and that cannot be delegated.  It should not be changed, in my view, in a democracy.</p>  <p>  As is the case with any senior public appointment that comes to the Cabinet, only one name is ever brought to the Cabinet.  There have been one or two exceptions, such as the recent issue with the European Commissioner, where a man and a woman were asked for, but almost always, if not always, just one name is brought to the Cabinet.  That applies to Secretaries General of Government Departments, chairs of State boards, to judges and to the Governor of the Central Bank.  It would not be appropriate for 20 people sitting around the Cabinet table to pore over a shortlist of names, discussing the merits and demerits of each candidate.  It would not be fair to them and it would probably discourage good people from applying.  That is why I would counsel against having that kind of debate in this Chamber, with us discussing the merits and demerits of different candidates.  Even if they are not named, that would be the wrong route to go down and would undermine the Judiciary, which we do not want to happen.</p>  <p>  On debate happening in the Chamber, Sinn F&eacute;in has Private Members' time next week.  It is open to Sinn F&eacute;in to use that Private Members' time next week if it wishes to.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, answered questions on this matter in a committee the other day.  Sinn F&eacute;in is free to use its time to discuss this but I would counsel against a situation which its party leader was walking into during the week, where we would start to talk about different candidates and their merits and demerits.  That would be a mistake.  Listening to the comments of the Deputy's party leader this week, that was the road she was looking for us to go down.  That would be wrong.  It would undermine the Judiciary.  It would not be an appropriate role for us, recognising the separation of powers.</p></speech>

He was Taoiseach.  He facilitated the then Minister for Justice and Equality coming here three years ago to answer questions on the process, not in Private Members' time.  That is what the Opposition and the leader of my party are looking for.  We asked the T&aacute;naiste specific questions, but he did not answer one of them.  When did he tell the leaders of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party that Mr. Justice Woulfe had come through the JAAB process?  Did he know of the other three applications that came from the judges, since there was a secondary process?  If so, who told him?  If he knew, why did he not tell any other Cabinet colleagues?  Did he discuss this issue with the former Minister for Justice and Equality or the current Minister for Justice?  Will he accept that while one name may be recommended to the Cabinet, in the past it has been common that the list of other applicants was also presented to the Cabinet?</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste stop obfuscating and trying to shy away from accountability?  He stood in this Chamber two weeks ago and said there would not be a problem with giving the documents relating to the controversy over documents he leaked.  Three weeks on, we do not have a shred of paper despite the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health saying that all of those documents would be made available.  What is the problem?  Is it not the case that the T&aacute;naiste does not want the Minister for Justice to answer direct questions from Members of the Opposition because there is an issue regarding the process that Deputy Varadkar, as Taoiseach, was overseeing, rather than the merits of the candidate?</p></speech>

That is not the practice.  One name is brought to the Cabinet, and that is the case for good reasons.  I think this specific vacancy arose in the Supreme Court in February.  It arose in the spring.  At the time, I was the Taoiseach of what people described as a caretaker Government.  We decided not to fill that vacancy.  We thought it was appropriate to wait until a new Government was formed to fill that vacancy.</p></speech>

As a person who was Taoiseach for three years and has been in government for a considerable length of time, like everyone in government or anyone who has ever been a justice spokesperson, I know the process.  There is the list from the JAAB.  There is a list of people who have expressed an interest in being promoted, and there is a third list of people who are eligible for promotion.  I knew those lists existed.  I did not know how many people were on them or the individual names.</p></speech>

I want to make four very clear points here.  First, the T&aacute;naiste has mentioned the separation of powers.  The very reason we have the separation of powers is why we need the Minister for Justice in here to answer questions, not in Private Members&rsquo; time but to take questions back and forward because the appointment of judges is an Executive function.  The Executive is accountable to these Houses.  To say that the separation of powers is any reason for not doing so, as has been stated by the Taoiseach, is bogus.</p>  <p>  The second issue relates to confidentiality.  Confidentiality, as I know having served in Cabinet, applies to the Cabinet room and to Cabinet papers.  Outside of that, it is not confidential.  Many of the questions we are asking are way outside of the Cabinet room.  The point on confidentiality is also bogus.</p>  <p>  I have heard also from the Taoiseach and indeed from the T&aacute;naiste today that it would be somehow wrong for us to question the Minister for Justice on the process, not on the merits or demerits of any candidate, for which the Executive is accountable to this House, and because we could not be trusted.  With all due respect, the very honourable gentleman sitting in the middle of this Chamber, the Ceann Comhairle, makes that decision, and not the Government.  That is also bogus.</p>  <p>  We have heard also the Taoiseach and indeed the T&aacute;naiste say that because Mr. Justice Woulfe came through the JAAB process, that is all we need to know.  JAAB makes a recommendation of those suitable, it does not make a recommendation, full stop.  That is also bogus.  We have four instances of bogus statements.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and the Government have a very big decision to make under our Constitution.  If the Minister for Justice does not come in here to answer questions, this Government does not have legitimacy and these Houses are not functioning.  The T&aacute;naiste is the Leader of Fine Gael which has a very proud history which I accept.  My party served in government on seven occasions, and I had the privilege once.  We know the way this works.  This has to be upheld and the Minister for Justice not coming in here does not uphold the most precious document we have in this country.  The Government may have a D&aacute;il majority and may keep pushing this out, but it will not go away.  The Government certainly does not have a moral majority.  The Minister has to come in here.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure that she comes in here next week?  Will he specifically answer questions on the following points?  He was a Minister, Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in governments that have appointed six Supreme Court judges.  Was he consulted by the Minister for Justice on this appointment?  Was he specifically aware that three other judges had applied?  These are questions that he has still not answered.  The T&aacute;naiste should think very carefully about his answers.</p></speech>

The Minister for Justice has acted correctly and appropriately and has upheld the Constitution in fulfilling her duties on this matter and every other matter.  If this is genuinely about the process and not about the suitability of individual candidates, here is exactly what happened.  When making judicial appointments the Minister for Justice considered recommendations from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and expressions of interest from serving members of the Judiciary and also a list of serving judges who had not expressed an interest in a vacant position but were also eligible for promotion.  The three lists that exist, which we all know about, have existed for years, if not decades.  Expressions of interest for court vacancies are sent to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on an ongoing basis and are then passed to the Department of Justice where they are kept on file for any current vacancies or future vacancies.  Lists of serving judges who have expressed an interest in being promoted to a higher court are kept for each court, with the exception of the District Court, which being the lowest jurisdiction is not a court that a serving judges can get promoted into.  The list of confidential expressions of interest is separate from the list of members of the Judiciary who are eligible for promotion but have not expressed an interest to the Government.</p>  <p>  It is the standard practice with judicial appointments that the Minister for Justice considers recommendations from the JAAB, expressions of interest from serving members of the Judiciary and judges who are eligible for promotion who have not expressed an interest.  On deciding to advise the President on whom to appoint to judicial office, the Government is obliged to first consider the persons recommended by the JAAB.  Discussions at Cabinet and with ministerial colleagues are confidential and Cabinet confidentiality is a constitutional requirement.  The Minister for Justice followed this process exactly and in accordance with the Cabinet Handbook consulted with me, the Taoiseach, the Attorney General and the Leader of the Green Party.</p></speech>

He knows that this is not going to go away.  What the T&aacute;naiste said there gives rise to a great deal of questions.  First, we have had contradictory statements from both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice.  When I asked him specifically when he, as Taoiseach, was consulted on this appointment he said, and I quote, that it was "likely" during programme for Government negotiations which took place when he was an ordinary Deputy.  The Minister said that she told the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach before the appointment.  On what date did that happen?  Specifically, did the T&aacute;naiste know and was he told that there were other judges who applied recently for this job?  Please answer that question.  Do not try to ignore it.  Why, if he was told, was the Taoiseach of Ireland or the Leader of the Green Party not consulted?</p>  <p>  Prior to this appointment, was any documentation shared with Cabinet members on the qualifications of judges to be appointed, that is, what would be a required to be a judge of, for example, the Supreme Court?</p></speech>

He asked the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, to fill that vacancy.  The process then ensued.  The JAAB, which is an independent body chaired by the Chief Justice and on which the Presidents of the courts sit on it along with others, made a recommendation.  Given that there was a new Government, that there had been an election and that there was an interim Government and Covid, that appointment was not made.  Having been appointed [this is the Minister, Deputy McEntee] at the end of June, after a number of weeks, I looked at the recommendation that had been made and other expressions of interest that often come for any of these positions.  Following that I spoke with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste [that is me], the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Attorney General, and on foot of that, a recommendation was made and a name was given to Cabinet.  There is only one name ever given to Cabinet.  There was a clear process.  As Minister for Justice I adhered to that process.  The person who was appointed came through an official process. </blockquote>  <p>That was the answer given by the Minister.</p></speech>

The Government obviously has a role in the appointment of a judge but it is the responsibility of the Opposition to hold the Government to account.  We should not be blocked in doing that.  As has been pointed out already, there has been precedent in the discussion in this Chamber of an Attorney General who was appointed to the Court of Appeal only in recent years.  We know that the vacancy arose in 2019 and that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board met earlier this year in March.</p> <p>We are aware that the role of JAAB is to vet for suitability and state who is appointable.  It is not the role of the board to recommend appointments, nor does it put candidates in pecking order where there are multiple applications, yet the Taoiseach has told us repeatedly that there was one recommendation made to the Cabinet and that the recommendation came through the JAAB process.  We are aware that judges do not go through the JAAB process, as we have already heard this morning, but we are aware that three judges specifically applied for the role.  They are, in theory, considered by way of a parallel process.  We are aware that most previous vacancies filled in the Supreme Court have been filled by those who have served as judges in lower courts.  Was the Chief Justice taking it at face value that a parallel process would equally be considered when the appointment was being considered?  Can the T&aacute;naiste outline how the parallel process is handled and weighted, if judicial experience is to be considered?  Who would have been involved in considering the two processes?  What criteria would be followed?  Did the T&aacute;naiste ask whether, or know, three judges had applied?  Did the former Attorney General know there were other applicants?  If he did and was an applicant himself, did he declare a conflict of interest at any point in the process?  I know it post-dated the appointment of the new Attorney General.</p> <p> The Taoiseach has said constantly that there was one recommendation, which came through JAAB.  He has been very specific about that.  He uses the phrase, "one recommendation comes through JAAB".  Is that the process?  Does the T&aacute;naiste concur with the Taoiseach?  What happens to those who apply through the other process?  Are they really considered?  What status is given to the experience of people who have served as judges in respect of this process?  How do we get the best outcome in filling the positions?  Will the T&aacute;naiste focus on what the Taoiseach has said during the week, that is, that there was one process and one name came through that process?  Does he concur with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900014#M00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Some of the questions she is asking me are questions of the Chief Justice and the former Attorney General.  I cannot answer questions on behalf of other people.  I certainly cannot answer questions on behalf of the Chief Justice, and I am not going to do so, but I will do my best to answer the questions the Deputy has asked of me.</p>  <p>  I should point out once again that the Social Democrats, the Deputy's party, has Private Members' time next week.  It has chosen to use it to discuss greyhounds.  That is an important issue and the party is very entitled to use its time to discuss greyhounds.  If it wished, however, it could use it to discuss this matter.  It has chosen not to.  It is important to point that out.</p>  <p>  How does the process work?  I am happy to tell the Deputy how it works.  It works as it has worked for years, and it is not a secret.  There are three tracks, essentially.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board makes a recommendation.  In this case, its sole recommendation was that Mr. Justice S&eacute;amus Woulfe was suitable for appointment to the Supreme Court.  There is also a list of names of judges who have expressed an interest at some point in the past in being promoted.  That is a rolling list.  It could be a letter sent in a few weeks previously.  It could have been sent in a few years previously.  Third, there is a list of judges who are eligible for promotion but who have not expressed an interest in being promoted.  Of course, as somebody who was Taoiseach for three years and in the Cabinet before that, I was aware of the existence of these three tracks.  I was not aware of who exactly was on each list, or what their names were.  I would never have been particularly aware of that in the course of my three years as Taoiseach.  What happens is that the Minister for Justice looks at the three lists, discusses them with the Attorney General and makes a recommendation.  The Minister discusses the matter with the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the other party leaders.  The Minister is also supposed to discuss it with the Minister for Finance but, in practice, that rarely happens.  After the discussions, the Minister brings one name to the Cabinet.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, did exactly what she was required to do under the Constitution and according to the Cabinet handbook.  She has fulfilled her duties exactly as she should have.</p></speech>

That is where it will go.  There is a reason only one name comes to the Cabinet, that is, because it is not appropriate for 20 people, let alone 160, to be poring over a shortlist of three, four or five names.  Inevitably, that would cause embarrassment for those who did not get the job or who got passed over.  Inevitably, it would discourage people from putting themselves forward for good jobs.  That is why only one name comes to the Cabinet and why we do not have a debate in Cabinet about the merits and demerits of individual appointments.

There is a bit of a war on teachers, both in elements of the media and in some of the political statements being made.  It is as if teachers are being told that the schools are safe, and that they should get over themselves, go in and do their work.  There is considerable worry among teachers, however.  I raised with the T&aacute;naiste recently the question of the forgotten families, the hundreds of children who stay at home because they have vulnerable siblings or parents.</p><p>Another very worrying point was brought to my attention yesterday in an email I received from a primary school teacher:</p> <blockquote> 	I am 28 weeks pregnant and have been advised by my doctor to go on Health and Safety Leave as I am unable to social distance [at school].  My doctor is getting this advice from The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, The Royal College of Midwives and the Faculty of Occupational Medicine.  In their produced document they state that women who are 28 weeks pregnant and beyond are at an increased risk of becoming severely ill should you contract COVID 19 [or, indeed, any other virus].  Therefore the clinical advice given is &hellip; particularly important for &hellip; women who are 28 weeks and beyond &hellip;.<br /><br />However I was denied Health and Safety Leave by Medmark (Occupational Health Care for teachers) [a private company engaged by the HSE] as they state they are taking their advice from the HSE.   </blockquote>  <p>Why is the HSE advising against the professional advice of these organisations?  Will the T&aacute;naiste - the future and former Taoiseach - consider the circumstances of the very vulnerable who are at risk of contracting viruses and becoming seriously ill as a result?  Will he try to get the HSE advice changed in line with best practice?</p><p>I started by saying there is a war on teachers.  I believe that is absolutely true but there also considerable worry among teachers, principals and others over the circumstances in their schools.  In the first instance, the definition of a close contact is very different for schools than it is for the rest of society.  We are constantly being told that schools are safe and that teachers should go in, work and keep them open.  We all want to keep schools open but we need to keep them open safely.  They are not magical places and the staff cannot do it all by themselves.  Yesterday, when Deputy Boyd Barrett raised this issue, the Taoiseach asked him to look to Denmark.  We would love to be like Denmark, which has a pupil-teacher ratio of about 10:1.  Ours is one of the highest in the European Union.  Also, some 80% of our schools are not properly ventilated and we do not have the ability to socially distance.  Therefore, this is a major issue.  We need to calm down on the attack on teachers because it is not just a matter of teachers but also of parents and the children I mentioned.  I would like the T&aacute;naiste to address those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900015#N00100"><p>Denmark is a fabulous and well-run country and has great public services.  However, it does have a significantly higher incidence of the virus than Ireland does now.  We need to bear that in mind.  Notwithstanding the numbers in recent days plateauing rather than continuing to fall, we are the third lowest now in Europe.  Only Iceland and Finland have a lower incidence of the virus than we do.  That is testimony to the work that Irish people and society have done in reducing the transmission of the virus.</p>  <p>  I believe teachers have done a fabulous job.  They have done an amazing job in my view in recent months in getting schools open, keeping them open and in dealing with cases and clusters as they arise.  I pay tribute to them for doing this work in recent weeks and months.  I have visited a couple of schools in recent weeks and it has been really impressive to see the way our teachers and boards of management have created a new normal environment for children in which to get their education.  We owe them a real debt of gratitude.</p>  <p>  Schools are safe places for teachers and children.  In a pandemic nowhere is 100% safe - not even a person's home is 100% safe.  Yet, as far as things go, schools are among the safest places in which to be during this pandemic.  That applies to the staff as well as the students.  We need to reassure people of that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Smith has raised a particular matter around HSE advice.  I would be happy to look into that further.  I do not know the details.  I would have thought that if someone is advised by a doctor to take health and safety leave or sick leave during pregnancy, that would be enough.  Certainly, when I was practising as a general practitioner, if a pregnant woman came into my surgery and I believed it was appropriate for her to take health and safety leave or sick leave, I would certify it.  I have never come across it being second-guessed by someone else.  If Deputy Smith wants to pass on some more details about that to me, I would be happy to have it explored and to see what the situation is.</p></speech>

I did pass on information to the T&aacute;naiste about the forgotten families.  It was a week or two ago but I have heard nothing back.  The T&aacute;naiste said he would check it out, what is happening with these 500 children who cannot access online services from schools because they are not supposed to be at home according to the official policy of the HSE and the Department of Education.  In fact, they are staying at home because they do not want to bring the virus back to vulnerable siblings or parents.  That is a big issue.  This alone indicates there is a problem in schools.</p>  <p>  The example I have given the T&aacute;naiste this morning indicates there is a problem with how Medmark is determining whether it is safe for teachers to go in.  This probably stems from the HSE advice but there is no doubt that principals, teachers and parents throughout this country are concerned about contact tracing and whether what is determined as a close contact in the schools is being met sufficiently.  I believe we have to look at it.</p>  <p>  We have to look at the ratio of children to teachers as well.  We have to look at the question of ventilation in our schools.  I know of one school in Mayo where a representative for the union kicked up about the ventilation.  Within days, those responsible put in the investment and they were able to improve it.  That should be done in 80% of our schools.  The question of sick leave for teachers has to be addressed.</p></speech>

I am engaging with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to see if we can find a solution.  I believe it is important for children who cannot attend school for health reasons to be provided for in some way, perhaps through an online access system or something like that.  I did receive that and I am going to follow up on it with the Minister, Deputy Foley.</p>  <p>  A great deal has been put in place to help schools manage the pandemic, not only all the extra funding and staffing but a dedicated telephone line that principals can use as well.  It operates even at weekends.  There are dedicated school teams in place to assist schools from a public health point of view.  As well as that, there is fast-tracking of testing in some cases.  I think a lot has been done to make our schools as safe as they possibly can be made during this pandemic.  That should be acknowledged.</p>  <p>  Deputy Smith makes a valid point on ventilation.  We know that in this pandemic outdoors is safer than indoors and a well-ventilated environment is safer than a poorly ventilated environment.  That is only common sense.  I believe we will have to look at our public buildings and see what we can do to improve ventilation where possible.  That might not always be possible, but where possible, we should try to do something.</p></speech>

He has left us after 40 years of service in our restaurants.  Members, staff and visitors have benefited from Brian's skills and dedication in the Oireachtas kitchen.</p>  <p>  Brian came to us from the old Hibernian Hotel.  After starting out in the Oireachtas kitchen as a pastry chef, he progressed to become a trained master butcher.  That was in the days when sides of beef and lamb were delivered here.</p>  <p>  Most of us at some point have enjoyed a sirloin steak expertly prepared by Brian.  I can personally attest to having enjoyed maybe too many of those over several years.  Brian has spent many long days and nights with his close-knit team in the kitchen, working to provide us all with breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in between.</p>  <p>  The work of a chef is stressful and physically demanding in any environment, but Brian has given 40 years of his life to such a role within a uniquely challenging environment of extended sittings, unexpected sittings and visiting dignitaries.  He has dealt with all of these with good humour and resilience, ensuring that, whatever is happening in the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers, at least no one will ever go hungry.  We wish him a long, enjoyable and happy retirement.</p></speech>

We know this was a major issue that dominated a lot of conversation in terms of out-of-control costs and delays relating to the building of the hospital.

He has denied that there is any other documentation outside of the Cabinet memo shared with Cabinet colleagues related to how judges are appointed.  I note that and it is interesting.  However, we will get there, slice by slice.  It is unfortunate but we will get there.  The document that was given to the Minister for Justice when she was appointed says that there is one appointment due to the Supreme Court.  However, there are two.

It is frustrating to see that many of the concerns we raised at the time are coming to fruition.  These concerns were relayed to the T&aacute;naiste and to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, unfortunately to no avail.  Our calls and concerns were ignored.  It is now clear that this project is a runaway train.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that it is time for the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to step in to control the costs that are ballooning with this hospital and to intervene to ensure the taxpayer gets good value for money and our children who are sick and need a good hospital to attend will have access to one?</p></speech>

It is a runaway train and I am delighted that Deputy Whitmore brought this up.  We in the Rural Independents brought a motion in 2016 and another in 2019, when it was not too late.  The T&aacute;naiste chose the site for this, against Connolly for Kids, against the sick children and their parents, against the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation and against everybody.  Now it has become a cancer in the body of the health situation.  It is a deep black hole and nothing is coming up only murkiness.  We have had Covid, Brexit and all the other distractions, including Mr. Justice Woulfe at the moment, but this is wrecking our health service and there is no accountability.  The T&aacute;naiste should be ashamed for having chosen that site.  It is the wrong place and will never be the right place.  One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.</p></speech>

I was a member of the Government that made that decision so I have to accept responsibility for it, but anybody who looks back at the record of the time will know what my view on it was.</p></speech>

As people may have seen, in the last number of days it has emerged that a group of men, it seems, collated thousands of pictures of over 500 women, apparently including some women under the age of 18, without their consent and shared them in a gross and disgusting abuse of those women.  There is an online petition and campaign led by some of these brave women speaking out about this abuse.

Everyone in this House knows the value of the work carers do and we want to make sure they have a pension in their retirement.  We appreciate there are many different types of carers: there are family carers, people who care for people who are not members of their family, carers who are in receipt of carer's allowance and carers who are not in receipt of carer's allowance.  It is not an homogenous group by any means so there cannot be an homogenous solution.  Some have a pension and others do not.  That is why we have to look at all the complexities of this.  One potential solution would be to allow people in receipt of carer's allowance to make a contribution to the State contributory pension.  That is one potential solution.

Numerous applications have gone in over the years and all have been turned down by the Government.  We have been waiting for 15 years on funding for the northern cross route.  The northern cross route is an integral part of the northern environs plan, which is a plan to see the construction of 7,000 homes on the north side of Drogheda.</p> <p>Without the construction of this integral part of the plan, the plan is unsustainable.  The northern cross route is vital infrastructure.</p> <p> I understand that a decision on funding from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, is due in the next few weeks.  We have been waiting for 15 years, numerous applications have been made and people have grown annoyed.  The houses' construction has been ongoing for years but the infrastructure is not there.  The Government has responsibility for providing funding for vital pieces of infrastructure so that towns of Drogheda's size have the potential to prosper.  That is called sustainable planning, which is what we hear Government representatives talking about day in, day out.

However, notwithstanding the fact that we ordered more doses than in previous years, demand has exceeded supply and we must prioritise those who are most at risk.  There are more doses available, but they have to be prioritised for obvious reasons.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we have not seen a great uptake in the flu vaccine for kids.  This is disappointing.  Only 20% or thereabouts of that vaccine has been used.  It is a nasal vaccine for children.  Unlike Covid, children are spreaders of the flu.  We would like to see more kids availing of the vaccine.

I agree that it would be a really nice gesture and a further sign of appreciation to nurses for the work they have done in recent months, but it could not just stop there.  What about junior doctors who pay their fees to the Irish Medical Council or paramedics who pay their fees to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC?

They say that the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, has not been increased since 2007, is a sham and is not fit for purpose.  Practice owners will survive without the medical card scheme, but dental nurses and associate dentists will not have jobs and patients will not have free dental treatment.

The Minister who took the question in 2017 announced a big investment for St. Brogan's College in Bandon which would alleviate the waiting list.  Up to 80 families have been refused entry to the school this year, which is at double the capacity.  Children cannot attend Hamilton High School in Bandon due to overcrowding. </p> <p> I spoke to many parents last week who are facing the same nightmare as last year.  Many were told by the education board last year to educate their children at home or take them to secondary school in Cork as there would be no room in Bandon.  Can the T&aacute;naiste guarantee me, on behalf of the people of Bandon, that the school will be able to accommodate their children September?  Can a complete assessment of educational needs be carried out so that plans can be put in place for a new stand-alone secondary school in Bandon, similar to Kinsale, Bantry and Skibbereen, which can cater for up to 2,000 children?</p></speech>

It is something that Senator Lombard has spoken to me about.  I will have to ask the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to give the Deputy an update.  It is always the case that we can find a school place for all children.  It is not always possible for them to be accommodated in the school of their first choice.  I will ask for an update on that for the Deputy.</p></speech>

There are approximately 20 residents in the home.  Unfortunately, it experienced an outbreak of Covid in early October and five patients died as a result.  The nursing home has taken a significant financial hit as a result of the outbreak.  The total cost of the outbreak, including hiring agency staff to alleviate the pressure placed on staff numbers and incurring additional Covid related costs, was &euro;72,000.  The nursing home received &euro;33,600 in assistance from the State.  This leaves a shortfall of &euro;38,000.</p>  <p>  The owner informed me that if a second outbreak was to occur, she would be left with no alternative but to have all patients admitted to hospital.  The nursing home stuck rigidly to HSE advice and has no complaints about this.  However, the cost of managing outbreaks like these are far in excess of the assistance nursing homes receive to do things right.  I ask that an invoice system be introduced for the costs incurred for nursing homes like this which are privately operated but have a majority of residents under the public system.  Nursing homes cannot be left at risk financially because they have done things right.</p></speech>

There are schemes in place to help private nursing homes deal with outbreaks where they occur.  Sometimes that involves staff being provided by the HSE and at other times it involves increases in the funding they receive under the nursing home support scheme.  There may well be cases where that is not adequate.  Perhaps if the Deputy wants to give me some more details on that or take it up with the Minister for Health we will see if anything can be done.</p></speech>

We have wonderful community pools and leisure centres around the country and children's swimming lessons are a vital part of the school curriculum.  What are we doing to provide guidance to schools?</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, under level 2 community pools and gyms are able to open with restrictions.  When we exit level 5, which it is to be hoped will happen shortly, it is very important that we take all of this into consideration because this is a huge part of the lives of children.  We need to consider this matter under health and safety guidelines.</p>  <p>  I want to pay tribute to all of the teachers and parents.  This has been a challenging time for the people of Ireland.

We will not know until the end of next week what level we will be at in December.  As she said, under level 2 pools can open.  I understand that they cannot under level 3.  As the Taoiseach said, it is more likely that we will be at some form of level 3 rather than level 2.  It is not that the levels are not closed to modification.  It is something we will have to take into account when the Government makes a decision next week on what we can and cannot do.</p></speech>

Those transport solutions need to be sustainable from an environmental and economic perspective.  We are making fundamental decisions as to how we invest in rail infrastructure, in particular in the west of Ireland over the coming years.</p>  <p>  We are doing that without all the information we require.  The former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, commissioned a report on the viability of extending a rail service from Athenry to Claremorris on the long disused western rail corridor.  He did not succeed in publishing that, despite the fact that it was presented to Irish Rail over a year ago by the consultants involved, which were paid a significant amount of money to carry out that review.  With a new Minister for Transport in place, we have still not seen the findings of that report.  If we are to make those investments we need to do so armed with all of the information necessary.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very keen on the development of commuter rail in cities like Cork, Limerick and Galway.  It makes a lot of sense.  I know Deputy Cannon is an advocate of twin tracking and improving the services to Athenry and Oranmore.  It is a good idea and where we should focus our rail investment.</p></speech>

Will the Government extend that further to ensure that workers will have certainty should they lose work in the new year if restrictions are reintroduced?

My recollection is that the pandemic unemployment payment will stay in place until March of next year.  It may not be open to new entrants from a certain point.  We would all agree that if we go back into further restrictions in the new year we would not want people to be unable to avail of the pandemic unemployment if they lost their jobs for a third time, which would be an extraordinary thing to happen to anybody.

I will give a brief explanation of what the Bill entails and why I believe it is necessary.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to a number of the changes that the Standards in Public Office Commission has called for in order to increase its powers of investigation and sanction around the area of lobbying.  These changes are called for in its legislative review in May 2019.  The Bill will seek to amend the principal Act, namely, the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.</p><p>There are nine sections in the Bill.  Section 1 is an interpretation and defines the principal Act as the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  Section 2 is an amendment to section 11 of the principal Act.  Under the Act, a representative body is only within the scope of the Act if it has one or more full-time employees.  Subsection (1) amends the definition of a representative body to cover those representative bodies that exist primarily to advocate on behalf of their members which do not have full-time employees.  This section also widens the definition of representative bodies to capture informal coalitions of business interests where same have been formed to lobby as a group of mutual industry interests.  Subsection (2) increases transparency in respect of lobby activities by requiring the members of a body coalition to be named in returns.</p> <p>This section gives effect to recommendation 1 of SIPO's submissions of May 2019.</p> <p> Section 3 amends section 11 of the principal Act.  Sections 11(1)(c) and 11(1)(d) of the Act require that an application to register must include information and contact information, respectively, about the applicant's business or main activities.  Section 11(1)(b), however, includes only a reference to carrying out business but omits any reference to main activities.  This section of the Bill will ensure that all appropriate contact information is provided for.  For the sake of completeness and consistency, section 11(1)(b) will be brought in line with sections 11(1)(c) and 11(1)(d) by the insertion of the words "main activities".  This section will give effect to recommendation 8 of Standards in Public Office Commission's submissions of May 2019.</p> <p> Section 4, on duties of designated public officials, will insert a new section into the Act relating to the duties of designated public officials, DPOs.  It will provide that where the DPO becomes aware that a person or body carrying out lobbying activity has failed to comply with the registration of lobbying activities, the DPO shall cease all communication with that person or body and inform them of the reason such communication has ceased.  Furthermore, the DPO shall inform SIPO of the cessation of communication.  Where the commission becomes aware of lobbying activity by a person or body that has failed to comply with the registration provisions of the Act, the commission can direct the DPO to cease communication.  Similarly, where the commission becomes aware of lobbying activity by a person or body that has been found guilty of a contravention in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the commission can direct the DPO to cease communication.  The commission has the authority to determine the duration of the cessation of communication in these circumstances and can determine when communication may be re-established.  This section will give effect to recommendations 18 and 19 of SIPO's submissions of May 2019.</p> <p> Section 5 is an amendment to section 16 of the principal Act.  Subsection (1) will amend the Act by directing that persons comply with the code of conduct rather than simply having to have regard to the code.  Subsection (2) will amend the Act by giving the commission power to investigate and report on breaches of the code of conduct.  The commission may now also consider whether a person or body has complied with the code of conduct when investigating or making a decision to prosecute an offence under section 20 of the Act.  Furthermore, an authorised officer appointed under section 19 of the Act shall take into consideration, when carrying out an investigation, whether a person carrying out lobbying activities has complied with the code of conduct.  This section also directs the commission to prepare an annual report specifically relating to the code of conduct and a copy of it to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than 30 June in the year following that to which it relates.  Subsection (2) will give effect to recommendations 10 and 11 of SIPO's submission.</p> <p> Section 6, an amendment to section 18 of the principal Act, will provide for further contraventions, including failing to follow the direction of the commission in respect of the cessation of communication contravening section 22(1), which provides for the cooling-off period after a DPO leaves office and where a person or body takes an action where its intended purpose is to void or circumvent the obligations imposed by the Act.</p> <p> Section 7 is an amendment to section 22 of the principal Act and will provide for a cooling-off period to be increased to two years.  Section 8 is an amendment to section 25 of the principal Act and will give effect to recommendation 15 of SIPO's submissions.  Section 9 concerns the Short Title and commencement of the Act.  It will provide that the principal Act and the Bill shall be construed together as one Act.  It will provide that the Act shall come into operation on such a day or days that the Minister may make by order and that such a day or days shall not be later than 90 days from the date on which the Act is signed into law.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900020#T00200"><p>I very much welcome the opportunity to make a statement on this important issue and to listen to the contributions of colleagues.  It is important to look at how we can come together to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is an area that I have prioritised since my appointment as Minister.  The Government as a whole is committed to combating domestic and sexual violence in all its forms and ensuring that anyone who is a victim of this most heinous type of abuse is empowered and supported to come forward to seek help.  We want people to know they will be listened to and to have confidence in the system and the people who work in it.  I hope our commitment in this area is evident in the programme for Government commitments, the considerations taken into account as priorities in the context of managing the pandemic, and the work being undertaken as a priority within my Department and in conjunction with other Departments, agencies and stakeholders.</p><p>Since I became Minister for Justice, I have sought to engage as much as possible with those working across the sector and with victims.  Unfortunately, due to the Covid restrictions, that has not been as easy as I would have liked.  I like to be able to travel to different counties to engage with people in their own workplaces, where they do fantastic work.  I would like to assure those working with victims and those who have advocated for change and reform in this area that, as restrictions are lifted, I am determined to meet them in person, if I have not done so already, and in the workplaces where they do so much good.</p><p>A number of issues have been highlighted in the engagements I have been able to have to date, such as when I met with people working on the crime victims helpline this week.  One of the points highlighted to me is that public information campaigns make a difference.  They are not everything but they do have an impact.  Requests for help from victims and those in vulnerable situations increase when information campaigns are under way and when there are advertisements on television, radio, social media and elsewhere.  We have said on a number of occasions throughout the pandemic that even as we asked people to stay at home because of the restrictions, we know that home is not necessarily a safe haven for everybody in the way that it is for many of us.  The Still Here campaign is about getting the message out that services continue to be available to victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence and - I want to emphasise this point - that Covid travel restrictions do not apply to anybody who is in a domestic abuse situation and is seeking help.  Further information on the organisations involved in the campaign can be found on the website, .</p><p>We are also midway through the No Excuses campaign, the Department of Justice's national awareness campaign to tackle domestic and sexual violence.  The campaign is a key action of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for 2016 to 2021.  We are moving to produce a third strategy.  The aims of the current campaign are to increase awareness of domestic and sexual violence, bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes, and activate bystanders with the aim of decreasing and preventing this type of violence.  On the latter point, we are asking friends, family and members of the community to look out for changes in behaviour which may indicate that a person is being abused.</p><p>We are all aware that domestic violence, unfortunately, has increased during the pandemic.  It is frightening to see the prevalence of this type of violence, which is mainly directed towards women.  In 2020, in response to the impact of the pandemic on front-line services funded by my Department, an additional &euro;327,590 in Covid-specific funding has been made available.  That funding has been used to help organisations adapt and continue their services during this period.  Much larger and more significant funding for the day-to-day running of these organisations is provided by Tusla.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been able to increase that funding, which he will talk about presently.  Under budget 2021, I have secured an additional &euro;400,000 to continue the Covid-specific funding that is helping organisations working to support victims of crime, including victims of domestic abuse.</p><p>While the Covid crisis has undoubtedly been an awful time for many, it has helped us to bring about some permanent changes which would otherwise have taken a little longer to achieve.  One of the first pieces of legislation I brought to this House as Minister for Justice enabled the courts to make greater use of live video links and remote hearings.  We had a welcome development in the past month when, for the first time, a domestic violence protection order was secured in the District Court by a woman via video link from her own kitchen. This is a really welcome development for many people.</p><p>Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority for the Garda Commissioner. I have spoken to him several times since my appointment about how the Department can work with garda&iacute; to find new ways of tackling this issue.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has shown its commitment in this area by completing the national roll-out of divisional protective services units in September.</p> <p>The divisional protective services units will support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime.  In addition, all serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged in front-line policing will receive specialist training for engaging with victims of sexual crime and vulnerable witnesses.</p> <p> Both of these are recommendations made in Supporting a Victim's Journey - A Plan to Help Victims and Vulnerable Witnesses in Sexual Violence Cases, which I launched recently.  It is a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the O'Malley recommendations.  There are, of course, a huge number of recommendations, 57 in total over four overarching themes, all of which I am fully committing to implementing and working on with the agencies, NGOs and, in particular, victims of these crimes.  The report outlines measures and supports to protect and help vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, giving full effect to the actions contained in Supporting a Victim's Journey.</p> <p> I am committed to ensuring that victims are supported, informed, respected and treated with the utmost compassion and professionalism by all who work within justice system and that everybody with whom they engage is trained at the highest level.  It is also important that not only victims feel as though they can come forward but those who are perpetrators of these crimes know that through our support of the victims they will be reported, charged and face the correct consequences.</p> <p> Combating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is not only about the Department of Justice.  It requires a variety of supports and services being available.  It requires a proactive and appropriate approach by our agencies such as the Garda, the courts, and the Legal Aid Board, it requires appropriately funded community services and, of course, it requires robust underpinning legislation to ensure that perpetrators are held to account for their actions.</p> <p> It is because of the need for a truly joined-up approach that this Government is committed to conducting an audit of how the services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are segmented across the different Government agencies.  I have just published a request for tender for a suitably qualified independent expert to undertake this audit who will, as part of his or her work, be required to take account of the views of those working at the front line.  The results of this independent audit will provide us with an independent comprehensive analysis to inform how we develop proposals for the most effective future infrastructure.   This is in line with our programme for Government commitment.  It will be completed by the end of March 2021.</p> <p> Domestic abuse is not only about violence.  Coercive and controlling behaviour, whilst more difficult to identify, can have a similarly devastating effect on victims.  The landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018, which came into force on 1 January 2019, created the offence of coercive control to recognise in law the devastating impact that emotional abuse can have on those upon whom it is inflicted.  It is everything from controlling what somebody can spend to who the person can engage with to what is on the person's phone and monitoring everything the person does.  The psychological impact this can have on people is devastating.  That is why it was welcome to see last week the first conviction before a jury in the State for the offence of coercive control.  It takes immense courage for somebody to come forward and follow through on such a prosecution and the bravery of the victim in this case is to be commended.  I hope that as more convictions follow, other victims of coercive control will feel confident to come forward.  No doubt my colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, will touch on this further.</p> <p> We have also seen in recent days the abuse and exploitation, mainly of women, where indecent images have been spread on the Internet.  I look forward to working with all Deputies in this House as we implement the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 before the end of the year.</p> <p> We all share a deep concern for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and a desire to provide the most effective system to support them.  I thanks the Deputies who are here today to discuss the range of actions across the justice sector and I welcome the opportunity to listen to their views or any suggestions or proposals in this area that they have.</p> <p> I urge all victims of domestic violence to reach out when it is safe to do so.  I also urge anyone who is concerned that these offences are being committed against a friend, a family member or a community to please report this to the authorities.  I assure the House that I am fully committed to combating domestic violence in all forms.  I will work with all my colleagues and with our dedicated community and voluntary organisations to ensure that we do so in a way that serves the needs of victims best.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900021#U00200"><p>I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this important topic.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice continues to work on delivering our vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  An important part of this is our ongoing and intensive efforts to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  We are improving our systems and processes to ensure they protect those at risk, support those who are victims, bring to justice those who inflict harm, and create a society that does not tolerate or turn a blind eye to any type of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is midway through a six-year, two-part national awareness campaign to tackle domestic and sexual violence.  It is designed to help people identify signs of domestic and sexual violence and to make us question our acceptance of some unacceptable behaviours and attitudes.  It features both male and female victims and the message was spread at a national and local level through partnerships with local radio stations.  This campaign has started important conversations about how, at an individual level and as a society, we have to change our attitudes if we want a country that does not tolerate any form of domestic or sexual violence.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the pandemic, we prioritised help for victims of domestic abuse.  We work collaboratively with front-line service providers and community groups on the Still Here campaign.  We increased funding for organisations offering support to victims to ensure they could continue their valuable work during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We worked with the Garda, the courts and the Legal Aid Board to ensure cases of domestic abuse and sexual violence would be prioritised, and this continues to be the case.</p>  <p>  I, too, welcome the recent conviction for coercive control and commend the victim for coming forward.  I hope it not only encourages other victims to do likewise but raises aware that coercive control is abuse and helps people to recognise that this is the case.</p>  <p>  We are planning for the future delivery of services and supports for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The audit of how responsibility is currently fragmented is a key part of this.  It will assist in developing proposals for the infrastructure needed to ensure we have a system that deals with all of the relevant issues in the most holistic and effective way possible.  The publication of the call for an independent expert to carry out this audit is a major step in delivering this commitment within the timeframe set, and the input of NGOs into the audit will help us design and build our future services around the victim's needs in the most comprehensive, compassionate and appropriate way.</p>  <p>  I also believe the implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey will also be instrumental.  It will create a criminal justice system that supports vulnerable victims and empowers them to report offences knowing they will be supported, informed and treated respectfully throughout the criminal justice process.  It would improve the way the criminal justice system operates in real and practical ways to make it work for vulnerable victims at every stage.</p>  <p>  The mapping of the victim's journey and the review of our grant schemes for organisations that work with victims are other important elements that will contribute to how we deliver our services in the future.  This work will ensure consistent support services are available for all victims throughout the State.</p>  <p>  The National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence is a whole-of-government approach and the review of the current strategy, which runs from 2016 to 2021, which will prioritise prevention and reduction, will include a national preventative strategy.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to combating all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, not only by doing what is required now but also by thoroughly reviewing how we do things to design more efficient and effective structures as we go forward.  We are working with the front-line service providers, listening to them and responding to what they are telling us is required.  I am proud of the work that the Department of Justice is doing.  Ambitious targets have been set that we are on course to deliver because, as both the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I have stressed, combating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority across the board.</p></speech>

More and more information is emerging about that.  We have not seen it to verify it yet.  However, the practice of publishing intimate images without consent is a major problem in Ireland today.  The effect on the victim is one of complete powerlessness, humiliation and indeed of permanency to them and their perception of their reputation.  It is an aggressive act and an assault on their person, even if there is no visible scar.</p>  <p>  I am proud to be a member of a justice committee having the privilege to work on Deputy Howlin's online harassment Bill, which makes this behaviour a specific criminal offence.  It is welcome, but some of this behaviour, that of sending unwanted intimate images, is already harassment under the criminal law and capable of being prosecuted already.  In those cases, what we need to see is the immediate co-operation of social media and telecommunications providers, not the delay of two or six months where garda&iacute; prosecuting cases request information, as occurred in a case with which I am very familiar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900022#V00100"><p>I thank the Minister for her opening remarks.  I noticed she mentioned the Still Here campaign.  I will briefly say that the issue the Minister needs to deal with is still here.  She needs to come in here and answer questions on how judicial appointments happen and what that process is.  I am referring to the process she handles rather than the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, process.  I invite her again to come into the Chamber at the earliest opportunity to answer questions and engage with the Oireachtas on what happened.</p>  <p>  I will move on.  The issues before us are very serious and the problems throughout the country at the moment with respect to domestic violence and people living in fear is something all of us are aware of.  Over the years, most of us in political life will have dealt with many people, unfortunately mainly women, who have been victims of domestic violence and indeed sexually-based violence.  Many of them are very fearful and usually one finds that they only come forward after years of suffering that abuse, neglect and coercion.  We need to create a society where it is unacceptable for that to happen and where it is normal for people to come forward on the first occasion it happens, not on the 100th or 200th occasion.  To do that, we have to ensure there are adequate resources in place that give people the confidence that they will be believed, the confidence that there will be action as a result of coming forward and the confidence that there are services in place for them.  One of the obvious services is, of course, the shelters women often have to go to.  In many areas of the country, and certainly in my own region, there is always a shortage.  I saw a recent report which I think stated that throughout the country there are nine women and children being turned away per day due to the absence of space in shelters or something of that nature.  That is something that needs to be addressed by the Oireachtas because we cannot continually leave these situations to charity.  That is what often happens, in that we must depend on charitable donations to various organisations in order to put measures like that in place.  This should be something the State is providing to people as a right.</p>  <p>  I raise also an issue the Minister is aware of, namely, the ruling on the use of mobile phone records as evidence in cases.  The Government has failed so far to introduce any legislation in regard to data retention to comply with the 2014 ruling of the European Court of Justice on data retention.  That is something that needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible because we all know of a sexually-based violence case where there is a conviction on the line at the moment because we have not dealt with this.  This has been going on for six years so I invite the Minister to enlighten us on what plans the Government has to deal with that and to put something in place to ensure that the Digital Rights Ireland ruling is complied with in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  The Still Here campaign and all the work that has been done around that is very welcome and is a move in the right direction but, as I said, we still have such a distance to go.  I think it was last week that we had a report which stated there were a number of cases where people came forward but did not want to proceed and progress the cases any further.  The reason they did not want to progress them any further was that they have seen all the data which shows that few cases are reported and that few cases are actually successful and go the full route.  That is why people do not have confidence.  We have to put the effort in to ensure we deliver for people.  One of the key things is that the first engagement people suffering domestic violence often have is with a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In many cases the garda&iacute; are excellent and do a great job but there are cases where they are not.  Adequate training, not just for garda&iacute; who specifically deal with this issue but for all Garda members, is one of the things that needs to happen as quickly as possible.  The State has huge responsibilities around all this.  Unfortunately the experience is that so many people have felt let down at the end of it all.</p>  <p>  I noted that in the Minister's opening remarks she spoke about working with all the other agencies, voluntary groups, community organisations and so on.  Many of those agencies do not have the staff or the resources.  One of the first things a woman has to do is to try to find a new place to live.  Very often they go to the local authority and the first obstacle they come up against is trying to get on the housing list.  When they get on the list, knowing that there is no house available, they are told to go through the housing assistance payment, HAP, process to try to find rented accommodation.  Sometimes the rented accommodation they find is not safe for them to go to.  There needs to be a dedicated person in each local authority to deal with people who are in those circumstances.  There are dedicated people in each local authority to deal with Travellers, for instance; it should be the same for dealing with people who are victims of domestic or sexually-based violence to ensure they get access where they need it.  The first thing they need is a house, a place to live.</p></speech>

I felt so low, I searched the house for pills for an overdose".  This is Siobhan&rsquo;s story, and her story told and retold thousands of times across the land because domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is an epidemic in our society; it is an insidious form of abuse that takes place all around us.</p>  <p>  The Victims&rsquo; Alliance has uncovered the leaking of thousands of personally-explicit images of Irish women, and some men, that have been shared on online forums without their knowledge.  Some of the mega files uploaded contain as many as 11,000 images.  This is a profound violation of women's and girls' rights and demonstrates again the inadequacy of Irish law in protecting them against such abuse.  Some 18 months have passed since the previous Minister for Justice secured Government support to amend the Labour Party&rsquo;s Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017.  Deputy Brendan Howlin is to be commended on his work on this legislation.  I have no doubt he is deeply frustrated, as are the rest of us, with the glacial pace at which this legislation is being progressed.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has committed to prioritise this legislation but her predecessor made the same commitment in May 2019, so the Minister must do better.</p>  <p>  Sexual harassment remains a constant in the lives of girls and women and, of course, the reality is that for so many the sexual harassment transitions to violence.  Some 41% of Irish women know someone in their circle of family or friends who has experienced intimate partner violence and there are so many victims who are too young, too afraid or too ashamed to tell anybody about the abuse that they suffer.  The Domestic Violence Act 2018 and Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Istanbul Convention were critical milestones in this State&rsquo;s armoury to combat domestic violence.  Criminalising coercive control has sent a strong message to victims that controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour is not only unacceptable, it is unlawful.  Completion of the divisional protective services units rollout is particularly welcome and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to be commended on Operation Faoiseamh.  Last week&rsquo;s conviction of an individual for offences contained within the Domestic Violence Act for the first time should give confidence to victims that the law does work.  However, this confidence is routinely undermined by the reality that this Government, like previous administrations, continues to get the fundamentals wrong when it comes to protecting women.</p>  <p>  Government is not listening to victims and is not listening to their advocates either.  I am deeply alarmed by the refusal of this Government, like that of the last, to fully acknowledge, let alone address, the shortfall in refuge places wrap-around services and related resources.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth continues to claim that the State&rsquo;s current provision of refuge places meets Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Istanbul Convention.  He argues that the State only needs to provide one refuge space for every 10,000 women in Ireland.  This is not true.  Ireland is the only European country to claim it only needs to provide the smaller number of refuge places and this is shameful.  The shortage of refuge and accompanying resources has been raised in this Chamber year after year with a depressing predictability.  Safe Ireland reported last week that between March and August this year 1,351 requests for refuge could not be met due to lack of space, and yet the Minister has confirmed that no allocation has been made by Tusla for additional refuge places either for this year or next.  Of the &euro;61 million allocation to Tusla for 2021 not one euro has been ring-fenced for domestic, sexual or gender-based violence.  The CEO of Tusla has indicated a significant portion of the additional funding for next year is already spent covering the organisation&rsquo;s existing deficit.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this today.  I acknowledge that in the budget the Minister prioritised funding for victims of domestic violence.  It is the first time in my memory that a Minister for Justice placed it front and centre of priorities, which is very welcome and has to be recognised.  She has set a standard for herself, which I am sure she will follow through and we will support her on it.  It is difficult but she is the first Minister I can remember who put domestic violence centre stage of the agenda.  This needs to be recognised because it has been insidious in our country for many years.  We need to tackle it and root it out.</p>  <p>  The world has experienced an incredible year in 2020, and we all know this, but one of the many things that shocked me during Covid is the number of news articles we have seen stating the levels of domestic abuse and how far and how quickly they shot up when we went into lockdown in March.  This was not a surprise for any member of the NGOs or charities on the front line dealing with victims of domestic abuse.  It pierced through some of the narrative early in the pandemic but not enough.</p>  <p>  We all know Covid has disrupted many aspects of our lives but for those living through violent domestic abuse situations it has done so even more.  Many victims of domestic violence feel they have nowhere to go now that many parts of society have locked down yet again.  Outlets that abuse victims may have in more normal times are no longer available and the long nights feel even longer for these victims of domestic abuse.  It is incredibly hard when they feel they have nowhere to turn during these hard times and dark nights.  The usual social circles and support networks they may have, and not many do, are that bit harder to reach when we are asked to minimise our contacts.</p>  <p>  I commend the work of Women's Aid, which has seen an increase of up to 39% in calls to its helpline over the course of the pandemic.  It has been operating in an environment in which is it difficult to get out to meet victims and provide one-on-one support to them.  Its ability to raise funds for its work has also been made incredibly difficult because of the pandemic.  These organisations are an absolute lifeline for so many women, but they are operating on diminished budgets because of the difficulty in fundraising during the pandemic.  This is why it was most welcome when the Minister mentioned the funding in the budget.</p>  <p>  The fact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been undertaking Operation Faoiseamh since April has offered some comfort to victims.  Since the beginning of the operation, the Garda has seen a 25% increase in reports of domestic violence and abuse.  Since the beginning of this year, we have seen cases of coercive control make their way through the courts.  This is something that is a positive development in our legal system, as difficult as those cases are to hear.  To see them come through our courts is welcome.  Non-violent domestic abuse can have lasting mental effects on many people, as has been referenced by other speakers.  Trapping people in violent and abusive relationships that make it impossible or dangerous to leave is a grim reality for many people.  Controlling behaviour can cause women and some men throughout the country to lead nothing but a shell of a life.</p>  <p>  Another issue that needs to be dealt with immediately by the Government is the passing of the Labour Party's harmful communications and harassment Bill.  I welcome the comments of Deputy McDonald in this regard.  We have been frustrated by the glacial pace.  Our justice spokesperson met the Minister in recent weeks and it will go to the committee on 1 December and we welcome this.  We do not want to see this as a false start but as progress to getting the Bill through the House.</p>  <p>  We have mentioned the data dump and the leaking of images.  I want to send a message to the perpetrators.  If men and lads think this is acceptable laddish behaviour or the behaviour that men accept, nothing could be further from the truth.  This has to be refuted by every man in the country.  They are the actions of a degenerate.  It is scummy and the lowest and most indecent act one human can commit upon another.  I hope that when our Bill goes through, with the support of the House, it will be a criminal act in the eyes of the law.  This is something we want to see pushed through.</p></speech>

Shocking and disturbing figures have been announced.  In the first six months of the pandemic, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na called to more than 27,000 domestic violence incidents.  I dread to think what the figure might be today, nine months on.  At the same time, the capacity in our refuges for women has decreased by 25% to comply with social distancing requirements.  Behind all of these staggering figures and statistics are real people, with vulnerable women and children living in constant fear.  In a report from Women's Aid, women disclose high levels of emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse from their partners, in some cases as a direct result of the lockdown and pandemic, which, of course, had to be introduced to slow the spread of the virus.  The mental health impact of domestic abuse on women has also been heightened during the restrictions, with some women reporting suicidal thoughts.</p>  <p>  Only this week, we heard from the CEO of Parentline, Aileen Hickey, about the growing problems for parents in experiencing anger and aggression from children.  There has been an increase of 27% from January to September this year.  She described parents feeling loneliness and embarrassment trying to cope and revealed the shocking figure of a 400% increase in parents availing of the non-violent resistance programme.</p>  <p>  The country was shocked to its core when the news filtered through of the murder of Clodagh Hawe and her three beautiful sons, Liam, Niall and Ryan.  This brought into sharp focus the lack of provision of refuge and support for women and families when they find themselves trapped in this position, particularly in County Cavan.  Our joint policing committee and many public representatives in our constituency have done their best to raise the important issue of the provision of a women's refuge in Cavan.  The joint policing committee wrote to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and Tusla in the summer requesting a refuge for women and families.  It is interesting to see that Tusla did respond, acknowledging the distinct gaps that exist in rural constituencies such as mine.  It acknowledged there is no emergency domestic accommodation for women experiencing this awful tragedy in their lives when it comes upon them.</p>  <p>  We are also aware that Tearmann Domestic Abuse Service in Monaghan does terrific work to support women and provides a wraparound service for families who need accommodation.  However, we do not have constant accommodation in a refuge.  We do not want to see any more deaths.  We do not want to see any more families experience what the Hawe family did.  We want to see a refuge in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Tully, and all of us feel very strongly about this particular issue.  We know there is a commitment under the Istanbul Convention and from Tusla that these facilities would be put in place.  The Minister has ring-fenced funding for domestic violence.  The closest accommodation for women and families in Cavan is in Navan, Dundalk or Drogheda, which are all miles away.  The Minister is from close to the constituency.  This is not practical for women or families who find themselves in this position.  I ask the Minister to work with the Tusla and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to close these gaps in constituencies such as Cavan-Monaghan so that accommodation and safe shelter is found for those women and families who find themselves in these horrific circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900023#W00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to today's debate on this very important issue.  Since the onset of the pandemic it became quickly apparent that domestic violence services were under intense pressure.  Safe Ireland recently published a new report, Tracking the Shadow Pandemic, which affirmed this.</p> <p>The report showed that a total of 3,450 women and 589 children who had never contacted a domestic violence service before looked for support and safety from abuse and coercive control during the first six months of Covid-19, from March to August.  I also understand that recent figures released by the Department show there has a been a 14% increase in the number of domestic abuse incidents reported to the Garda in 2020.  In my own county of Cork, in the first eight months of this year, 910 domestic violence cases were reported in the Cork city division, an 11% increase on the previous year; 448 cases were reported in the Cork north division, an increase of approximately 20%; and the figure in the Cork west division increased to 254 cases, an increase of almost 42%.  Although we do not yet have the year-end figures, unfortunately the total figure is likely to increase.  The Director of Public Prosecutions stated there has been an 87% increase so far this year in the number of files submitted to her office related to domestic violence or the breach of a court order.</p> <p> The Safe Ireland CEO, Ms Mary McDermott, highlighted the enormous strain on services throughout the country during the first lockdown and, unfortunately, that has continued throughout the second lockdown.  She states: "The study exposes, yet again, patterns of domestic violence heightened by this pandemic."  She also stated that, on average, there are 191 women and 288 children staying in domestic violence accommodation each month.  It is my understanding that 1,351 requests were made for refuge, or seven requests per day, and these could not be met as there was no space.  I know the Government has committed to making domestic violence a priority, and the Taoiseach stated previously that funding would not and should not be an issue.  However, I am concerned that for the organisations on the ground, none of this has been backed up with the resources and infrastructure a modern organisation needs.  I ask the Minister to commit to providing the additional funding and resources to ensure victims and their children are supported.</p> <p> Safe Ireland was gravely disappointed with the lack of targeted provisions in budget 2021 for women and children dealing with violence and abuse.  As legislators, this is something we need to review next year, given the demand and strain on these services throughout the pandemic.</p> <p> I take the opportunity to commend the dedication and commitment shown by organisations, like Safe Ireland, that have been operating under very difficult circumstances.  As I mentioned, the refuges were inundated but, as the CEO of Safe Ireland stated, services worked creatively to find alternative accommodation in the community.  They provide a vital service and this pandemic has highlighted the importance of the work they do.  In addition, great credit must be given to Garda programmes, like Operation Faoiseamh, which have helped to protect the most vulnerable in our society.</p> <p> The programme for Government contains a number of commitments in regard to domestic violence and sexual abuse.  There are numerous commitments, including the development of a third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, the conduct of an immediate audit to be concluded within nine months of the formation of Government, the implementation of a plan for future refuge space, the publication of a review of domestic violence accommodation provision, and other aims such as to adopt and implement a comprehensive strategy to combat the trafficking of women and girls.  I urge the Minister to take action on these immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900024#X00200"><p>Last week, Safe Ireland, working with 39 front-line services, presented a new report, Tracking the Shadow Pandemic, which traces the prevalence of domestic abuse and coercive control during the months from March - the start of the first lockdown - to August.  The figures are stark.  Over the six-month period, 3,450 women and 589 children contacted a domestic violence service for the first time.  Almost 34,000 helpline calls were answered, which is an average of 184 a day.</p>  <p>  During the six months from March to August, 1,351 requests for refuge could not be met.  Although service providers worked tirelessly to find accommodation in the community, one of the main reasons many women do not leave an abusive relationship is the shortage of available and affordable accommodation that could rehouse victims of abuse at short notice.  According to the Council of Europe, it is recommended there should be one refuge place per 10,000 people, meaning there should be 446 refuge places in Ireland, whereas there are only 143 currently, and even fewer due to Covid.  This is simply not good enough and it must be addressed as a matter of priority by the Government.  Otherwise, the number of women who suffer domestic abuse will continue to rise.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that not everybody in an abusive situation requires a refuge but they need options to live free from a violent partner.  Housing is the key requirement that needs to be made available to those fleeing domestic abuse.  One in four women become homeless as a result of domestic abuse.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, there is a severe lack of emergency accommodation available to at-risk women, as mentioned by Deputy Niamh Smyth.  Although it is a large rural constituency, it does not have a single refuge and there are only three staff employed to assist vulnerable women across the two counties.  Undoubtedly, it is one of the worst funded areas for domestic violence supports, a situation that cannot be allowed to continue. </p>  <p>  I commend the service provided by Tearmann Domestic Violence Services, which is excellent in the support it gives.   However, like all domestic violence services, it is at its wits' end dealing with the level of contacts it is receiving.</p>  <p>  Safe Ireland recommended in its prebudget submission that &euro;7.5 million was needed for domestic violence services.  Some &euro;61 million in additional funding has been allocated to Tusla, and while that does not come under the remit of the Minister for Justice, I ask whether any of this funding will be earmarked for Safe Ireland.  Within the Department of Justice, &euro;2.7 million in what is called additional funding has already been allocated to the new strategy, Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, a plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases.  Again, domestic violence services may be included in this but there is no clarity yet and they are looking for clarity in order to sustain current services and plan for services going forward.</p>  <p>  Funding is allocated to awareness training, which is very important.  People need to be informed early of the signs of controlling and coercive behaviour.  If somebody is continually contacting a person, it is not because they are madly in love - it is because they want to know exactly where the person is at every moment in time.  If a relationship is working, one partner should not fear the other.  Arguments, which every couple will have, should be about an issue and not become personal or aggressive.  Nobody should be walking on eggshells in a relationship.</p>  <p>  In addition, Safe Ireland has consistently looked for a resourced national service development plan to be led by Safe Ireland in consultation with front-line services.  This service development plan would be the start of a comprehensive national and long-term response to the enormous everyday problem of domestic abuse and coercive control.</p></speech>

Safe Ireland has rightly called it the shadow pandemic.  During the first six months of Covid, there was a massive increase in people fleeing domestic violence and 3,450 women and 589 children contacted domestic violence services for the first time.  The impact is being felt across the country.  West Cork Women Against Domestic Violence saw a 35% increase in calls.  We knew this was coming.  Advocates and support organisations warned us and sought emergency measures and additional funding months ago.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the initiatives taken by the Government, including some additional funding to organisations in the sector and the access to rent supplement for victims of domestic violence.  However, more must be done.  The Government needs to ensure additional capacity for the duration of the pandemic.  It is important to note issues around refuge spaces would not be as much of a problem if Ireland lived up to our commitments under the Istanbul Convention, which requires us to provide one refuge space for every 10,000 people in Ireland.  Unlike every other European country, we only provide one refuge space per 10,000 women and, needless to say, this means we provide 50% fewer refuge spaces than what is required.  Is it any wonder we are in a situation now where we do not have enough spaces?  This has to change.</p>  <p>  Clear infrastructure is necessary.  Responsibility for this area is spread across several Departments, which leads to confusion and abdication of responsibility.  The support organisations - the experts in this area - are looking for one Minister who leads the Government response.  Intersectional issues are relevant in this regard.  Regrettably, older women, women and girls with disabilities and those from migrant and ethnic minorities are more vulnerable.  Speaking at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, Dr. Rosaleen McDonagh highlighted the importance of intersectionality, and Ireland&rsquo;s appalling record on and relationship with disabled people.  Migrant or undocumented women and girls are also at increased risk due to Government policy.  For example, issues around translation in State services are a barrier and people are reluctant to approach garda&iacute; for fear of subsequent deportation.  We need firewalls between State services and immigration services.  Women, girls and other vulnerable populations need to be assured they can safely seek medical help, access social welfare and approach the police without fear of subsequent punitive action by the State.  We need an acceleration of the programme for Government commitment to regularising the status of undocumented people.  Policy choices by this and previous Governments are making more women vulnerable.  The Minister can change that.</p> <p>This week there have been serious issues with image-based crimes and so-called revenge porn.  There are online folders with thousands of images that have been taken and shared without consent.  This primarily affects young women, and some of them are underage.  I would like to send a clear message to anyone whose images have been shared without their consent: it is not your fault, you did not do anything wrong, and you are not to blame.  However, unfortunately, despite warnings about situations like this one, image-based sexual abuse is still not a crime here.  These violations of women have been facilitated by the State's inadequate policy and inaction.  There is legislation on this before the Committee on Justice that needs to be accelerated now.  I welcome what the Minister said about doing it in the next year, but it is not soon enough.  It has to happen now.</p> <p> This House must be clear that consent has to be at the heart of this.  Where consent is not present the law must step in.  Currently, there are incredible activists and support groups working on the issue to help victims.  The Minister needs to assure them today that this Government has their backs.  This House can move quickly, not before the end of the year but now.  We saw this yesterday with Dublin Zoo and we have seen it in the past with the banks.  I ask the Minister to move immediately to protect victims of what we all know is a crime but today is still not considered one.</p> <p> I am glad I am speaking to the Minister about this.  I admire the work she has been doing in relation to rape trials.  I ask her to please take action on this now.  We will all support the Minister.</p> <p> As a nation we also need to have an incredibly serious and difficult conversation on this and related issues.  Thousands of Irish men are sharing images of women and girls without their consent.  There are horrific levels of sexual violence in our colleges.  We all know victims of domestic abuse, rape or sexual assault, and this should not be the norm.  It is international men's day today.  I ask all men, if they see or receive an image being circulated without consent, to call it out.  They can and should speak up in WhatsApp groups, in conversation and in any given situation.  They should call it out.  When they do not, they are complicit, and they are supporting a culture that facilitates gender-based abuse.  We need zero tolerance.  To achieve that, we need men to act.</p></speech>

The global Covid pandemic shone a bright light on this darkness and we saw a staggering increase in the reporting of domestic violence.  Women's aid services engaged in 20,763 support contacts in 2019, during which 20,049 disclosures of domestic abuse against women and children were heard.  Women disclosed being beaten, strangled, burned, raped and having their lives threatened.  Others told that they were denied access to the family income to feed and clothe themselves and their children as they were being stalked and humiliated online.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, Women's Aid saw a 43% increase in response to the 24-hour national freephone helpline, between March to June 2019 and March to June 2020.  It also reported seeing a 71% increase in visits to the Women's Aid's website.  Many children were trapped with abusers and denied outlets that may have offered them respite in the face of abuse before.  Many women came up with ways to get in touch, calling from their cars, the garden shed, or from the bathroom where the shower was running, so that they would not be overheard.  The results of an independent survey of 937 victims and survivors outlined in an annual impact report for 2019 shows that despite improvements in public awareness and legislation, fear and stigma remain serious barriers to seeking help.  To see that the fear and stigma are still there in 2020 is worrying.  The pandemic has stretched Women's Aid's services to the limit and I ask that as part of our strategy to combat domestic violence, we follow through on the Government's commitment to audit and improve existing State responses to domestic and sexual violence, infrastructure and other reforms.</p>  <p>  A whole-of-government response is required to prevent domestic abuse, to protect those suffering and to hold perpetrators to account.  This must include a commitment to fully resource specialist domestic violence services, prioritise family law court reform, and legislate effectively to tackle the growing problem of online abuse.  In Ireland, we have come an incredibly long way.  We have criminalised domestic violence in the Domestic Violence Act 2018 and now domestic violence is a far greater crime than violence against a stranger.  We now have a robust legislative foundation that recognises and responds to the dangerous pattern of control, dominance, inequality and psychological abuse in the home.  Because of this Act, barriers for victims are breaking down, but there are still barriers.  There are days where we walk past many doors and we do not know what nightmares could lurk behind those doors.</p>  <p>  We need to ask questions about what we could do.  We also need to look at how we help victims in bad situations to get out and be free before it turns more sinister.  While there are services and supports, they are not enough, especially in housing.  Housing is one of the most significant issues faced in my constituency.  Urgently providing housing needs to be a priority and I know from working with Women's Aid and other agencies that it is not prioritised enough and more is needed.  We need to look at how we can listen to victims and help them after they have suffered.  We have come far with legislation but I think that we can come up with more.  The Domestic Violence Act should be extended so that it is not limited to persons who are in an intimate relationship.  The Act should also be amended to empower HSE safeguarding social workers to have authority to make applications directly to court for protection orders on behalf of vulnerable adults.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about Carlow.  I know earlier speakers spoke about women's refuges.  It concerns me that Carlow has been crying out for a women's refuge for years.  Carlow is growing.  I regularly deal with women in this situation.  We have a duty of care to these women to have a women's refuge, particularly with Covid where we can see that figures are rising.  We need to deliver on this.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that we will get a women's refuge for Carlow and surrounding areas.  I know that Kilkenny has Amber, which is a great service, and we have Women's Aid in Carlow.  The local authority recently got a small premises for emergency accommodation for two families, but that is not enough.  We need to make sure, in the times that we are living in, that we have those services and can give the most vulnerable women and children in our society a place where they know that they can go when they need help.</p>  <p>  We all welcome the biggest budget in the history of the State.  As a Government Deputy, I welcome it.  As a woman, I ask the Minister to make these women and children a priority, to make sure that every county in Ireland that needs a women's refuge gets one.  They are crying out for them and for services.  We need to look at all Departments to see where we can support those who are vulnerable to exit that situation safely and with support, and not just leave this violence with the Department of Justice.  We all have a role to play in combating domestic violence.  I will work with the Minister, as I know other Deputies in this room will.  We all want to make sure that we look after the most vulnerable in our community to help them, give them services and funding, so that they know that when they get sorted, they will not be there for a long time.  The services should be there for them so that they can access what we call a normal life under Covid.  They should be able to live a normal life in society, so that we do not pass a door every day wondering what is going on in a house that no one knows about.</p>  <p>  The Minister works hard and is committed to this.  I know that as a woman the Minister will deliver on this.</p></speech>

We have had a number of debates on domestic violence in this Chamber.  As we know, there has been a significant increase during Covid, or it has just highlighted it more rather than there being an increase.  Domestic violence and coercive control are unfortunately widespread.  It is often hidden.  The situations that people, mainly women, find themselves in are extremely complex.</p> <p>Between March and June of this year, 21,000 calls from women or from other concerned citizens were answered by various domestic violence services.  This is, unfortunately, a significant increase on the same period last year, but as I just pointed out earlier, it is possible that Covid-19 has just put it all into stark focus.</p> <p> Earlier this week my colleagues, Deputies McDonald and O&rsquo;Reilly announced that they would introduce legislation to create a statutory entitlement of up to ten days' paid leave in a 12 month period for employees as a consequence of domestic violence.  This would just be one small measure to help and assist mainly women in this situation.  There is a huge emotional, psychological and personal cost to domestic violence and it is devastating.  There are obviously also significant economic costs associated with this crime.  It is often due to financial and economic reasons that women find it so difficult to leave in the first place, particularly because there are often children involved and they are very worried about how they are going to be able to be provide, especially where the man has control of the finances or if they are on social welfare and are all part of the one claim.  Situations like that require us to have a lot more common sense and need to be able to be dealt with much more quickly if a woman is leaving such a situation.</p> <p> There is also, and some Members have touched on this, a direct correlation between domestic violence and homelessness.  Domestic abuse is the leading cause of homelessness for women and children in Ireland.  I find it so frustrating when dealing with people who are forced to leave their home, and in many situations that has to be the first step because it is the safest one and the only way for someone to get out with their children, that the man who has been involved in domestic violence is sitting at home on his own in a three-bedroom house while the lives of the women and children have been completely upended and they are stuck in a refuge somewhere.  I understand why it has to be a first step but we need to get much better at dealing with that situation more quickly for women so that they can be the person to return to the home much more quickly than we see happening currently.</p> <p> As legislators, it is incumbent on us to invest time and resources to create a framework and policies that seek to prevent domestic abuse.  We must have a long-term vision to protect women and children in this country.  I know, and I am even guilty of it myself sometimes when we talk about this debate, that we talk about the domestic violence services, but we need long-term thinking.  We need to realise that we have to try to break that link, where if a person is growing up in a domestic violence situation and those issues are not dealt with, that person will carry that into his or her own adulthood and possibly visit it upon his or her own children.  We need to realise and deal with that with counselling and supports in order that people can break that cycle.</p></speech>

It says that the creation and distribution of private sexual images without consent is not revenge porn but is image-based sexual abuse.  I learned this morning of a good friend and councillor of People before Profit who suffered from this a number of years ago when she was a student.  Clearly, it has been rumbling on for too long, but now it has been escalated to an extent that it is becoming viral.  Like any virus, it will spread unless we deal with it.  I add my voice to those calling on the Minister to deal with this urgently.  It is pretty sick behaviour of weird predators and we need to stamp it out.</p>  <p>  I will make a couple of points.  To tackle domestic violence seriously we need to understand its social roots.  It is not just a question of individual bad men. It is that, but it is also the product of a society that for centuries has treated women as second- and sometimes third-class citizens and, worse, at one stage regarded them as the property of men, in particular seeing wives as the property of husbands.  We all know what people can do with their private property.  They do what they like with it.  The days when we turn a blind eye to this and say it is only a domestic are over.  Women now are saying not just "Me Too" but "enough is enough".</p>  <p>  It is then asked why they do not leave these relationships.  That is the reaction that many people will get when the abuse of a woman or of a family is heard of.  Fear is one reason, the fear that if they do not succeed in getting away from the abuser, it will be worse for them.  They are right, because research shows that some of the most horrific cases of violence are against those who try to leave.</p>  <p>  There is another huge factor in that they have nowhere to go.  This situation has become worse during the pandemic, with about 2,000 women and 400 children each month since March seeking refuge from a violent situation.  The fact that support for vulnerable women and children is left to charities is an utter disgrace.  The State should and could adequately fund essential services, providing refuge in the immediate situation and support for women and children.  There are 63 organisations listed by the Minister&rsquo;s Department who receive funding.  It is a bit reminiscent of the Magdalen institutions where the State is wiping its hands.  This should be a fundamental role of State services without the reliance on charities.  Nine out of 26 counties have no refuge.  The entire domestic violence sector about a quarter of the funding that the racehorse and greyhound industry receives.  That is where we are at, and while I know that the Minister&rsquo;s Department is trying, it is not enough.</p></speech>

Of course, it is nothing of the sort.  Revenge?  Revenge for what?  Is it for breaking up with someone?  Is it pornography, when the person concerned never consented to the sharing of the image?  In some cases the person never consented to the picture being taken in the first place.  We need to stop victim blaming and we need to stop the language of victim blaming.  The finger has to be pointed here at the creeps who harvested these images and then put them up online.  The finger must also be pointed at State.</p>  <p>  In New York when an image-based sexual abuse scandal broke legislation was strengthened within 24 hours.  Here in Ireland, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill has been stuck in these Houses of the Oireachtas for a full three years with zero action or urgency from Government parties.  The wheels seem to be beginning to move now but the pressure needs to be kept up.  It took pressure from below on the streets of this country to start the change that resulted in the Repeal the Eighth campaign.  Congratulations to Megan, the young woman who started the mass petitioning on this issue, and good luck to the organisers of the online protest on Saturday week.  I hope that supporters of change can and do take to the streets on this issue very soon.</p></speech>

We have also seen a rapid growth in image-based sexual violence.  It is epitomised by this Discord server which has been uncovered which involves horrific abuse of women, including some under 18.  I was shocked when I asked the T&aacute;naiste about this earlier and he did not know that it is not currently a specific crime.  We need action immediately to ban this image-based sexual abuse.  It is time to tackle those distributing explicit images or videos of people without their consent.  We need that State action and we also need to challenge the sexist culture that allows anyone to think that it is in anyway acceptable or okay to share images or videos of people without their consent.  We are seeing the consequences of this in the suicide of Dara Quigley after the Garda shared her video.</p></speech>

We have seen a report tracking the shadow pandemic that shows that almost 3,500 women and almost 600 children who had never sought support or safety before are now reaching out to support services.  That is a huge number of people who are reaching out, on top of people who may already be linked in and who may already be trying to survive through lockdown and through these moments, and where any social supports that are so necessary and that are often cut off very deliberately by perpetrators are being cut off due to the lockdown.</p>  <p>  We all accept the idea that domestic violence is a very important issue and something that we need to respond to.  We have seen from excellent work by the Garda and from awareness-raising that it is an issue that we all need to be aware of and provide support to.</p> <p>Since 1996, 230 women in this country have died violently, with 61% having died in their own homes.  The numbers are terrifying.  I am not saying nobody is taking it seriously but this is where this kind of violence can lead us to.  It is a very dark place.  Long before we get to that, it is a dark place for the families and children involved.</p> <p> I am very glad to see both Ministers responsible for this area here in the Chamber.  I have been saying for a while to both of them and their predecessors that the divisional protective services units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are an excellent development and will provide an excellent service but I feel strongly that social workers, particularly duty social workers from Tusla, need to be seconded to and work full time in these units.  Domestic violence is a family problem; it affects the victims and their children.  We need different supports for different cases.  We need to acknowledge the affected children, who are suffering just as much.  They are victims also.  It is only by providing a link between the social work services and the Garda protective services units that we will ensure a holistic approach.  This is a really good model in terms of combatting child abuse generally and I hope it may be expanded to take in all issues where the work of social workers and the Garda overlaps.  It is a model that has worked in other countries quite well.  It is a model on which I wrote my thesis when doing my master's degree in social work, which was too long ago.  I have spoken to both Ministers about this and I acknowledge they are taking it very seriously, but I want to take the opportunity to put on record again that the model would comprise a very positive service innovation if we could deliver it.</p> <p> A positive innovation that we cannot deliver quickly enough, on which I know the Minister for Justice is working, is the new Family Courts Bill.  Often perpetrators make excuses for their behaviour, perhaps blaming alcohol or passing it off.  Sometimes we see judges, lawyers and garda&iacute; buying into this.  Specialist training in and sensitivity to domestic violence will help to address that.  Specialist judges and specialist family courts will help to provide safety and security such that the system will not re-traumatise victims.  I appreciate the Minister understands this and is working on this issue, but it is important to put it on the record.</p></speech>

Taking that issue alone, these statements could be entitled, "Why there should be no more national lockdowns".  If one suffers from domestic violence, the national lockdown makes one a prisoner, a hostage in one&rsquo;s own home.  We have all read the statistics indicating the incidence and reporting of domestic violence have increased this year.  Imagine for a second that one suffered abuse, physical or verbal, at the hands of a partner or parent and then heard the Government was contemplating six weeks of national lockdown.  Imagine how terrified one would be.</p>  <p>  No one has approached me personally on this but they have approached me on mental health issues.  People with existing, diagnosed conditions and others who fear they have been affected in some way by Covid-related issues despaired at the thought of level 5 for six weeks.  They look forward to the lifting of level 5 in just a couple of weeks, for December, but they know they are not going to enjoy the Christmas period because the threat of another lockdown will be hanging over them for the entire month.  As others go about meeting family and friends and enjoying the festive season, all they will see is the likelihood of another lockdown increasing.  That will do more incredible damage to them.</p>  <p>  To change policy is not to admit a policy is wrong but just to admit circumstances have changed.  They have changed.  The understanding of the virus and our ability to combat it have changed.  Our understanding of the damage of a lockdown, by comparison with the risks of the virus, has changed, and our expectations about a vaccine have changed.  Therefore, it is time we changed our plans.  The first lockdown, earlier this year, was the right thing to do.  We can all accept that now because we did not know what we were facing into and we had to move quickly to protect our citizens.  The current lockdown may be the right thing to do; it is too early to know.  However, what if we now committed to a strategy that involved no more lockdowns, or no more levels 4 and 5, and that took the word "lockdown" out of our Covid lexicon?  Knowing what we know now, what if we did that?  What if the Government said it would move heaven and earth to prevent another lockdown and keep us safe from Covid?  It can do both.  We are aware of what we are capable of as a country now given what we have done over the past year.  We know what we can do, that is, put rings of steel around communities that are vulnerable and increase our tracking and tracing, focusing on areas we know are at higher risk.  There are also other things we can do that could prevent us from having to go into a lockdown.  Imagine what it would mean to people if the Taoiseach made an address in December saying 2020 was tough but that 2021 would be better.  He could say it and mean it if we changed our policy to have a no-lockdown strategy while still doing everything we could to beat back this virus.  There are other ways, and it is time to debate them as we come out of level 5.</p></speech>

Men are also victims of such behaviour but, for the most part, it is women and their children who experience or witness it.  It is one of the greatest perversions of domestic violence that women, as they lie on the floor or curl up in a ball, think that their children are not at the receiving end.  They are, however, because the children are traumatised by what they know is happening to their mam.  In some cases, they believe they themselves are to blame, in the belief that if they were better, nicer or cleverer, their mam might be spared.  For so many women and children, home is not a refuge but a prison.  They are locked in, locked up, monitored and scrutinised.  Their belongings and sanity are ransacked, often by someone regarded as "a great fellow altogether" or "a pillar of the community" who looks like butter would not melt in his mouth.  We have seen it in the newspapers.</p>  <p>  The situation has been magnified by Covid-19 restrictions, leaving many women with no break from their bullying partners.  So many women and children are dreading Christmas, with the pursuit of the perfect Christmas magnifying every problem, every slight.  "My brother has a new car." &mdash; dig.  "My mother never had time for me." &mdash; punch.</p>  <p>  The refuges are wonderful and they are a miracle, a harbour in an unbearable storm.  I visited Teach Tearmainn in Kildare.  It is beautiful and it really does confer dignity immediately, along with protection, but we need more refuges.  Many women who have come to me have said that when they reached the stage of going to a refuge, they preferred to leave their county.  Therefore, every county needs a refuge.  A woman thinks about what is going to happen to her and her children in the longer term, fearing homelessness because of the housing crisis.  They would be homeless.  This is where domestic violence and abuse become State violence and abuse.  Our housing crisis is keeping women and children trapped inside four walls that are prisons, not homes.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome this debate and the initiatives the Government has taken, but we must do more.  The sharing of intimate pictures has been mentioned during this debate.  I remember standing outside the D&aacute;il a few years ago at a demonstration after the death of Ms Dara Quigley.  Her brother was speaking.  Dara's death was also a form of State violence.  It brought great shame to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I was talking about my dad having been a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last night.  When the incident concerning Dara occurred, I was never so ashamed.  I was glad that my dad was dead when it happened.  Dara was a brave star.  She was an ideological person working to shape a better future for society and she was let down by the State and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have to do better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900027#AA00400"><p>I am happy to be here to speak on what is a silent epidemic.  It has been prevalent in Ireland not just recently but for many generations.  When we speak about domestic violence, we need to contextualise it to a degree.  It includes abusive relationships, taking many different forms.  Included are the physical abuse of hitting, pushing, denying medical care, emotional abuse, manipulation, threats, name-calling, sexual abuse, rape, sexual assault, pressuring a person to have sex, and image-sharing, as has been discussed.  It also includes economic abuse, the withholding of funds to put someone in debt and deliberate neglect.</p> <p>One of the areas we should look at in the D&aacute;il this year is the issue of the school food programme.  Many schools are running it.  It provides a necessary function for children who are suffering neglect in their family homes.  All of these issues encompass coercive control, predominantly against women, but men suffer too in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.  Significant emotional damage occurs and results for victims.</p> <p> What is the nature of domestic violence?  Is it nature or nurture?  Can we look for it in our environment?  Does it come from our families?  Is it something we see?  Who are the victims?  We know they are wives.  They are also partners, children and adolescents.  In many cases, those who have been subjected to domestic violence may well find that they bring it into future relationships.  There are significant triggers which people in these situations talk about, including alcohol, other addictions, unemployment, jealousy, anxiety, suppressed rage, personality disorders and social-media related jealousy, which is a new phenomenon.  I would also highlight gambling.  Online gambling has been a silent epidemic that is bringing more and more financial hardship.  In itself this brings more domestic pressure.  The sufferer's state of mind is relevant, as is the fear that the person has.  There may be esteem issues.  The person may feel she is not worthy to counter someone who is predating on her in this way.  Shame, financial insecurity, vulnerability and previous psychological traumas that the person may have suffered may allow the person to continue to suffer in future and ensure the person will not see a new or genuine opportunity come along.</p> <p>,  Ireland has only one third of the recommended capacity of refuges - something which has been spoken about today.  Many are communal and therefore unsuitable in the context of a pandemic.  What role can the State play?  What about refuges and family law support?  I applaud the Garda for the ongoing operations.  I would like to see an increase in barring orders.  How does the PULSE system record domestic violence?  Should a register of offenders be complied?  I believe it should.  If we are going to have a sex offenders register, then we should have a domestic violence register as well.  We know that people who break the law in this way will probably do it in future.  It is likely the person will take it from one relationship to another.</p> <p> We know domestic violence has risen as a result of Covid-19.  Some 15% of women and 6% of men in Ireland have experienced severe domestic violence from a partner.  That most women in Ireland who have been killed were intentionally killed by a current or former intimate partner is a source of concern.</p> <p> Some of the Deputies have spoken about Safe Ireland and the results of the recent surveys.  It is no harm to restate briefly the results.  Some 3,450 women and 589 children contacted domestic violence services for the first time in recent months.  On average, at least 1,970 women and 411 children received support from a domestic violence service each month.  Some 33,941 helpline calls were answered representing an average of 184 calls per day.  We assume they are not all coming from the same households.  At least 150 households every day are looking for help.  On average, 191 women and 288 children were living in domestic violence accommodation each month.  We know they want to get out and have the opportunity to move on.  Some 1,350 requests for refuge could not be met due to a lack of space.  Those providing the services have worked tirelessly to create and find accommodation in the community.  The numbers are rising and the present lockdown, as has been discussed, is a difficult time for many.</p> <p> This all serves to highlight this problem in Ireland today.  It signals the personal stress in people's lives.  It signals the stress in our system and the State's response to deal with it.</p> <p> I will offer some things in terms of initiatives to combat domestic abuse.  As I have said, one proposal is an offenders' register.  I know legally it may be difficult but I believe if a person has abused and assaulted a partner in the home, that person should be recorded publicly.  People need to have the idea that this might be in the public domain.  We need pro-arrest policy continuation.  If garda&iacute; are called out to a door, they should nearly seek to arrest if there has been a significant case of assault.  The garda&iacute; should not return a woman to the situation knowing the consequences of lockdown and that someone has nowhere to go to vent frustration.</p> <p> We need to see the protection of women across all sectors on the road to recovery from social housing protection to education.  We must find education and access to healthcare and the criminal justice system.  We need a specific law.  I want to see legislation enacted on the sharing of images without consent.</p> <p> That is basically it.  I reiterate what the other Deputies have said.  Most important, what needs to be recognised about domestic violence is that it is a cowardly thing.  It is done by people with little esteem to people who may be suffering esteem issues.  Education, social services and integration can help but the State must give support.  We must do more to shine a light into this area.  We must show people they are not alone.  We must show that the State can create future opportunities outside the relationships that people may have.</p></speech>

Covid-19 and the ancillary restrictions have brought the issue of domestic violence sharply into focus.  The reality is that no community or parish has been immune.  In Longford, the team at Longford Women's Link provides a first-rate support service.  It has seen referrals and contacts spiral during the past year.  September and August in 2019 saw the team deal directly with 94 cases.  Yet, this year has seen a near 50% increase.  Over the same two months the team has dealt with 140 cases.  Unfortunately, that is heading towards three cases per day.  That only reflects those victims who have been able to come forward.  Unfortunately, there is a silent majority of mothers and sisters who are being subjected to violence, intimidation, coercion as well as mental, physical and online abuse.  We welcome the launch of the dedicated protected persons unit in the Longford Roscommon Garda division.  The unit is providing an important, informed and victim-focused service and support.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the statistics show that our mothers and sisters are among the least likely in Europe to come forward and report crimes of domestic abuse.  A victim blaming culture is often cited as the reason for this.  There is an urgent need for cultural change in how crimes of this nature are viewed.  I believe the consequences of Covid-19 have given all the agencies working in this area an opportunity to reflect on the challenges and difficulties facing victims in coming forward.  Tusla is undertaking a strategic review of emergency accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  This is a critical issue for us in Longford, where there is no dedicated refuge.  Instead, victims from throughout the midlands are dependent on the excellent Esker House facility in Athlone.  However, at that facility there are only four family units.  I hope the review will provide insight into the current distribution of services and unmet needs.  Certainly, based on the figures reported to us from Longford Women's Link, the region needs a dedicated refuge with the necessary facilities and supports for families caught in this nightmare.</p></speech>

I thank the two Ministers present for their obvious commitment and factual work on this.  I pay credit to my county colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  She has contributed a great deal of time, professionally as well as politically, not only to the issue of domestic abuse but coercive control as well.  It shows the power each of us have in the roles we hold.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, when we are dealing with this topic we know we all have constituents who have made representations to our offices and who need a transfer on the housing list.  They need to have a conversation about it because, ultimately, barring orders do not always have the required effect.  Prison sentences do not last forever.  Many people, nearly all of them women, are living in fear and their children are living in fear.  What will happen when the knock on the door comes or when the person might see someone in the street?  We need to bear that in mind with all our statements.  We need bear in mind not only the anecdotal evidence but the statistical evidence that we have all poured through.  Indeed, the statistics are shocking.  Deputy Funchion made the point earlier that perhaps they have always been there but now they are actually being reported.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>We know the reporting levels in Ireland are painfully low compared to other European jurisdictions.  The fact that reports to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are up 25% is a worry and perhaps those reports only scratch the surface.</p> <p> I will put one practical suggestion to the Minister.  The system used in the UK is the silent solution, whereby one makes a phone call but, as we have seen in the advertisements and we know the situations, one might not be in a position to talk through fear or anything else.  Simply pressing 55 on a mobile phone, however, alerts the police who make their way to the caller's location.  That is the sort of practical solution that may play a part in allowing or encouraging more people to come forward.  They should not have to come forward because these disgusting acts should not be happening.  They should not have been happening 50 years ago and they certainly should not be happening today.  Every one of us is right to stand here in this Oireachtas and condemn it from a height.</p> <p> I concur in the comments from Deputy Duncan Smith when it comes to the sharing of revenge porn and sexual abuse images.  I welcome the commitment by the Minister and the justice committee to proceed with this legislation as quickly as possible.  As Deputy Smith said earlier, there is a particular responsibility on men, particularly men of a similar vintage to me and Deputy Smith, to call this out, not just in the Chamber when we are speaking in refined parliamentary tones, but to call it out on WhatsApp and social media and to say to our peers, friends, acquaintances, the lads in the team or whoever it may be that this is not on.  The sharing of the personal, private details of a friend or someone who thought you were a friend, of a loved one, or of someone's sister, daughter or mother is abhorrent and disgusting.  It needs to end and we need to provide for legal ramifications for it.</p></speech>

It is timely that we are discussing this today on International Men's Day.  All men should have a sense of shame and abhorrence to see what has happened in recent days with the images that were shared on the Internet on different sites.  People can call it coercive control or revenge porn but there are no adjectives to describe it.  It is disgusting and abhorrent.  It is concerning to any of us who are parents or grandparents to know that these things can happen and that men can do this.  This seems to have been done in an organised fashion.  A lot of effort and intuition was put into it.</p>  <p>  The Minister must act.  We must act and cannot wait to act.  We acted in the banking crisis, we acted with Covid and we acted recently in health legislation.  The Minister brought in measures to allow vulture funds to use hearsay evidence.  This is shocking.  I am not saying anything personal to the Minister because I know she will act.  We have to act immediately to have legislation in place that stops these images being shared.  They are often, as previous speakers have said, taken in good faith.  They are sometimes taken with people under 18.  It is truly shocking and it must resonate with all of us in our core values.  It is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  I salute the Cuan Saor women's refuge in Clonmel and the Tipperary Rape Crisis Centre.  The volunteers who man those centres - there are some paid people as well - have to go out fundraising.  These are the only refuges people have and I salute the people there.  I know many of them from being involved in the day under the arches each September, where they do a huge fundraising campaign and raise awareness.  Musicians, singers and other talented people come along to entertain, people pay and there are bucket collections.  It is a shame they have to do that.  They should be funded.  I salute Geraldine Mullane, Breeda Bell, Verona Nugent and the many others who are involved in the huge organisation that day entails.  They could not have that day this year because of lockdown.</p>  <p>  When will we learn about lockdown?  Look at the trauma.  The figures that have been put out show a 25% increase.  I heard Deputy Eoghan Murphy with interest.  He was a member of the Cabinet when, as Shane Ross said, Dr. Holohan frightened the - I will not use the word Shane Ross used - out of Cabinet members.  We were all frightened but Dr. David Nabarro has said clearly that lockdowns do not work.  Lockdowns are regressive and particularly harmful to poorer people and people with less income.  Can Deputies imagine being in a house, flat or area where there is violence?  It can work both ways and some men are affected as well by domestic violence.  This is occurring during the dark, dreary, desperate days of lockdown at the moment with bad weather and short days, as we look forward to Christmas while being fed the line that we will have another lockdown after Christmas.  We need to listen to the WHO.  Ministers quote it when it suits them.  The WHO has said lockdowns do not work.  We know they do not work.  It is interesting to hear it coming from Deputy Eoghan Murphy and I welcome it because he was in the Cabinet that brought it in.</p>  <p>  I salute An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the country, especially in Tipperary under Chief Superintendent Derek Smart and superintendents including Denis Whelan in Cahir; Pat O'Connor, who has just retired; and Willie Leahy.</p>  <p>  When this new sexual unit was being set up some months ago, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was oversubscribed with interest from garda&iacute;.  They wanted 12 garda&iacute; and two sergeants.  I wish that unit well.  It is badly needed.</p>  <p>  Time has evolved and education is important.  It is a bad day when we do not learn something, but it was a horrific day when we learned about the events of recent days.  We must act in the coming weeks and not after Christmas.  We cannot leave it, especially with the crisis of lockdown.</p>  <p>  I salute all the garda&iacute; who gallantly join the force.  I pay tribute again to Sergeant Niall O'Halloran, who was laid to rest on Tuesday.  He was a great man who worked in the community.  He had the trust of the people and the people had his back.  They could call to his house and he dealt with issues sensitively, as all garda&iacute; do.  They need further education and we need stronger legislation.  We need emergency legislation there.  Unfortunately, when those units are set up, the community policing unit is affected and the traffic corps is diminished because the units recruit from within the force.  We need more garda&iacute; and I know the Government is recruiting more.  Issues are turning up now.  We have to deal with the issue of porn and other issues on the web.  Cybercrime is dangerous as well.  We have to deal with this sensibly and urgently.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce legislation to deal with this matter in the near future.  I am talking about days, not weeks, because we cannot face Christmas with this situation.  This will stir up more by being debated and put more fear into the people we are trying to help.</p></speech>

He is like a well-placed product who has come in on three occasions to sell a message on the lifting of lockdown.  In the context of this debate, I think it is a misuse of the time.  He was part of a Government that failed to deal with domestic violence, failed to prioritise it and failed to provide enough shelters.  Perhaps he might have addressed all those issues today.  That would have been welcome to me as a woman and an Independent Deputy.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister for Justice's written speech, as always.  I welcome the layout of it and I accept her bona fides when she says she is giving this priority.  The first District Court order by video link and the first conviction under the Domestic Violence Act 2018 are very welcome.  I welcome that the audit will be published and the Minister has given a date for that in March.  That is all positive.</p>  <p>  The figures are truly horrifying.  I have less than two and a half minutes so I will not go into them.  Without a doubt, they increased during Covid.  The victims are predominantly women and children.  However, any government that is seriously interested in dealing with domestic violence must provide sufficient refuges.  That is simple so I would like to have seen the Minister deal with that today in her speech in the first instance.  Different measures are used but, taking the measure in favour of the Government, we are still short of 45 refuges for women.  If we take another figure, we are 350 refuges short.  That is number one.  We cannot talk about dealing with domestic violence unless we have a sufficient number of safe places for women to go to.  They can be multifunctional.  When we have dealt with domestic violence, those refuges can be used for something else in the future so it is money well spent.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by talking about the cost of domestic violence.</p> <p>I am glad that we have moved on from the term "domestic incidents".  These are serious assaults and crimes and we should be talking about them as such.  A conservative estimate of their cost is more than &euro;2.3 billion per year.  I would like to see a cost-benefit analysis or some other analysis by the Parliamentary Budget Office or another group showing what domestic violence is costing us.</p></speech>

Since the statistics have been well aired, I will not repeat them.</p>  <p>  I thank the former Minister, Senator Doherty, the Government and the Department of Social Protection for putting in place the emergency rent supplement pilot programme for victims of domestic violence.  From speaking with many of those who work in the field, this speedy, non-means-tested avenue to help victims transition from abusive situations is working well locally.  One practitioner to whom I spoke stated that the responses from the Department had been open-hearted and generous.  The pilot is working in my constituency.  It is crucial that this programme be mainstreamed.</p>  <p>  There is good co-operation between the Departments of Social Protection and Justice, but notwithstanding the fact that combating domestic violence is a national priority, no money for it appears to have been ring-fenced in Tusla's budget and its domestic violence unit seems to have been abandoned.  This is what I have heard nationally and locally.  For example, we have heard of &euro;800,000 being provided, but fundraising that depended on the generosity of the public, corporations and artists raised &euro;500,000 during the same period.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The Minister is aware of another issue, but I want to raise it again.  The Sligo-Leitrim constituency does not have a dedicated domestic violence refuge, and there seems to be little to no progress in putting one in place.  There is good co-operation between local authorities, housing and homeless agencies and landlords, but we need a dedicated refuge.  Does the Minister have positive news for us in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900030#DD00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV.  I am grateful for the heartfelt and genuine contributions from Deputies across the House.  I had just joined the House when the first wave of Covid-19 restrictions were announced this year, and there was a concern shared by every Deputy and the general public at large about the restrictions' possible impact on people who were at risk of DSGBV, including the potentially volatile situations that lockdown created and the separation of vulnerable people from their support networks and the wider social services on which they relied.  It was a source of deep concern for us all.  There were specific risks for victims of domestic violence during Covid-19, for example, social isolation and their particular vulnerability.  These presented additional challenges in victims accessing supports.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the considerable work being done by the many voluntary organisations that work in this sector.  They have gone above and beyond in recent months to ensure that services and refuges are kept open.  The vital lifeline these represent for those at risk of DSGBV has remained in place.  The organisations have shown great care in supporting victims.</p>  <p>  We have seen a change in society's approach to the issue of DSGBV in recent months.  That is evident in the context of the Irish Women in Harmony campaign organised by Safe Ireland, but there has been a wider response within communities.  In my community in Dublin 15, various GAA clubs and Scouting Ireland groups raised money for the constituency's Sonas shelter.  Deputies would have seen similar instances in their own constituencies.</p>  <p>  Since its formation, the Government has made it clear that tackling DSGBV is a key priority for all of us.  Our programme for Government calls out the fact that there is an epidemic - that is the word we used - of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in this country.  It is a multifaceted problem that requires all arms of the State to work together to address the issue and support those who are experiencing such violence.  In the Government, the work is being led by the Minister, Deputy McEntee's Department and mine, but it involves all Departments and State agencies.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV and provides funding to more than 60 organisations across the country that support them.  Tusla supports emergency refuges in providing services for adults and children fleeing domestic violence and supports organisations involved in the provision of rape crisis services and a range of community-base domestic violence supports.</p>  <p>  At the time of budget 2021, I made it clear that I wanted to focus investment in these services, thereby supporting the most vulnerable in our community, particularly during Covid-19.  An increased provision for Tusla and the organisations it supports is central to this.  As part of budget 2021, my Department secured the largest increase in funding for Tusla since the agency's foundation.</p>  <p>  Recently, I engaged with my officials and Tusla's senior management on Tusla's business plan for 2021, which will determine how it funds the various services it provides across the country.  I emphasised to them the importance of resourcing DSGBV services to sustainable levels, particularly in the current circumstances.  In 2021, a total of &euro;30 million will be made available by my Department to Tusla to fund DSGBV services specifically.  This includes a &euro;2.7 million increase in core services, bringing core service provision to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of Covid-19.  This is a total increase of &euro;4.7 million for 2021 over the initial 2020 figure.  I am pleased that we have been able to announce a significant increase in DSGBV funding for next year.  I hope it will enable services to expand their vital supports for victims and their families.  The additional funding to Tusla in 2021 will also allow for increased levels of services to child victims or witnesses of DSGBV, which is a key aspect of our commitment under the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  While I understand that much of the media's focus in recent weeks has been on refuge capacity, which I will address in a moment, Tusla funds a wide range of services in this regard and it is important to note that more than 75% of referrals to its social workers involve domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that Tusla is undertaking a review of emergency accommodation nationwide.  This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation.  It is important that we provide funding where services are needed the most.  The review process involves consultation with key stakeholders.  The review's findings and the recommendations of the monitoring committee of the second national strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment in and development of services.  Tusla has advised me that the report will be published next April.</p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible.  I strongly support the work of Tusla and its funded service providers and I am committed to supporting the agency in meeting the needs of individuals who experience domestic violence.  I look forward to responding to Tusla's audit of refuge accommodation across the country and to it ensuring that new refuges are appropriately designed to avoid congregation.</p>  <p>  While funding will be crucial to our success in tackling DSGBV, it is imperative that we have the right structures in place to allow the Government to respond as effectively as possible.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, referenced this matter.  Under the programme for Government, we have committed to undertaking an audit of responsibility for DSGBV across Departments and State agencies.</p> <p>The procurement process to secure the expertise to conduct this audit is under way.  We expect that audit to be completed in the first quarter of 2021, and this Government will act on the basis of that audit.</p> <p> I take this opportunity to condemn image-based abuse.  Under no circumstances should any photographs of an intimate or sexual nature or any video be shared online without the consent of the individual involved.  This sexual exploitation is happening online and is incredibly harmful to those whose images have been shared in groups or posted online.  It is a violation of privacy and intimacy at the highest level.  There must be a zero tolerance approach to image-based abuse.</p> <p> Our programme for Government commits to the enactment of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill, which will be a positive step in preventing the sharing of intimate images online and combating this criminal and sexually abusive behaviour.  This is an issue where women are the primary targets and the outcome of this abuse can be catastrophic.  It can often have severe repercussions on a woman's mental health, family life and reputation.  Women face the constant threat of sexual abuse and violence and should not have to live in fear that this abuse could happen to them.  Without laws in place to combat these crimes, women can continue to be victims.</p> <p> Everyday sexism, sexual violence and the all-too-familiar framing of that sexual violence as the fault of the victim cannot continue.  There must come an end to victim blaming and victim shaming.  As part of my Department's remit on gender equality, including the national strategy for women and girls, we will work to tackle the culture of domestic and sexual gender-based violence and harassment in our country.</p> <p> I thank Deputies for their contributions.  As I said at the outset, I know that concern about the instances of DSGBV in our country is something that is genuinely shared by all Members of the House.  The programme for Government has identified the scale of the issue, and the Government is already implementing measures to better equip our country to deal with it.  We are outlining how we will better fund our services to support victims.  I am committed to working with my colleagues in government, in particular the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, with service providers and all those working the sector to provide the best possible help for those who need support and developing strategies that prevent domestic, sexual and gender-based violence from occurring in the first place.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900031#EE00500"><p>I very much welcome the opportunity to update the House on some of the work of the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science just under five months on from its creation and the formation of the Government.  I very much appreciate the support and interest from all sides of the Oireachtas for a new stand-alone Department to place a renewed focus on the further and higher education sectors and enhance and develop research and innovation.</p><p>The new Department has an annual budget of more than &euro;3 billion, the sixth largest budget allocation of any Department, and it is responsible for more than half of the Government's total expenditure on research and development through Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council and the Higher Education Authority.  In Ireland, we have 23 higher education institutions, including our universities, and a network of further education and training facilities throughout the country providing learning opportunities to more than 360,000 people every year.  The opportunity to enter education and training or to retrain or upskill has never been more important as we face the challenges brought on by Covid-19 and the future world of work which the pandemic has brought very much into the here and now.</p><p>I want to provide an update on some of the key areas which will be of interest to colleagues.  They are our work in further and higher education and training to provide places to meet the challenges of Covid 19; the apprenticeship and centralisation scheme; the development of a new adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills strategy; the priority of research, innovation and science during Covid and for the future; supports for students; and plans for the next semester at third level.  I will arrange for a copy of my speech to be circulated to Deputies.</p><p>In regard to our work in further and higher education to provide places to meet the challenge of Covid 19, budget 2021 built on the July stimulus by providing funding for 50,000 further education and training places in 2020-21 and for the extension of the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme for the first half of 2021.  The total package of &euro;118.5 million to upskill and reskill people directly responds to the impacts of the current pandemic and areas of key skills priority, in particular the climate agenda.  This includes additional places and skills to compete for those who have lost their jobs and in skills to advance for those in employment need to upskill or reskill.</p><p>Skillnet Ireland is showing real and tangible results in the areas where we need to see progress, with more than 40,000 people now enrolled in online training and education programmes since the emergence of Covid-19.  In excess of 200 candidates have enrolled in the new future in tech programme, providing skills pathways for those transitioning to the ICT sector, since its launch in September.  More than 1,000 people from in excess of 500 companies nationwide have undertaken Skillnet's clear customs training, which is a key element of getting Ireland Brexit ready in responding to the growing skills needs of Irish businesses and complementing other Government initiatives to facilitate smooth and efficient trade flows.</p><p>Recently, I announced more than 14,000 free or subsidised higher education places, funded in the July stimulus, which includes 11,597 places on short modular courses and 2,555 postgraduate places.  The postgraduate places are available in courses in a wide range of skills areas, including data analytics, environmental sciences, engineering, tourism and hospitality, ICT, and health and welfare, including medical technology.  Modular courses are short and focused and will be offered in a flexible manner, allowing people to gain important skills without taking a considerable period of time away from labour market.  Each module will be stand-alone so that participants can gain skills and put them into practice immediately in the workplace.  Modules are also accredited in such a way as to provide building blocks to a full qualification.  This is exactly the kind of approach we need to deliver tailored courses to suit the needs of enterprise and lifelong learning.  Details of these courses are available on <i>hea.ie.</i></p><p>The apprenticeship incentivisation scheme is showing a very strong uptake, and I can share with the House that the latest figures show that 965 employers have submitted claims in respect of 1,667 apprentices.  Apprenticeship registration figures for October show an increase of 196 new registrations compared with October last year, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach and the value of extending the scheme, which I expect will support another 4,000 apprentices next year.</p><p>While we have a long-standing relationship with apprenticeship programmes in this country, what is less well recognised is the rapid change in the system over the past five years.  When we think about apprenticeships, we often think about important and traditional craft apprenticeships such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians.  While these programmes still exist and are still successful, there are now more options than ever before available for apprentices, including access to education and training in partnership with different employers across the economy.  There are 58 different apprenticeships, ranging from two to four years in duration, and leading to qualifications at level 5 to level 10 in the national framework.  Some 33 of these were launched in the past five years and another three are due to launch by the end of this year.  They are in new and growing areas such as cybersecurity, wind turbine maintenance, technical artistry, accountancy, supply chain management, international financial services and insurance.  The first level 10 apprenticeship was also launched over the summer, leading to a principal engineer professional doctorate qualification.  We are working on a new plan that will see 10,000 new apprentices register every year by 2025, and we have recently completed a survey of apprentices as part of this consultation process.  We will launch by the end of this year our new action plan on apprenticeships.</p><p>In planning for the future and working to meet the challenges of the shift to remote and blended learning, we have a lot more to do to ensure that no one is left behind.</p> <p>I am genuinely worried about this.  Many people in Ireland are locked out of society and our economy, and one of the reasons relates to literacy, numeracy and digital skills.  One in five adults in Ireland struggles with reading everyday texts such as a paracetamol box, one in four struggles with using numbers, perhaps in comprehending an electricity bill, and one in two struggles with digital skills.  We cannot genuinely call ourselves inclusive and talk about a knowledge-based economy if we do not face up to these facts.  We need to talk about this much more.  We keep saying equity of access for all but these numbers are stark and worrying and should be a cause of concern.  We need to ensure we do everything possible to assist and improve those skills for people, which is why I have asked SOLAS, the further education and training authority, to lead in the development of a new ten-year adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy.  I announced a consultation process last week, which is available on the SOLAS website, and I ask all Oireachtas Members to help take this consultation into their communities and give us their feedback.  We do not need a glossy document; we need practical steps as to what we can do to get on top of this issue because it will leave people locked out of society and the economy if we do not get this right.</p> <p> I wish to pay tribute to our research community, which has worked over recent months to support national and international responses to the challenges of Covid-19.  I know that colleagues will join me and agree the importance of research, innovation and science has never been in such sharp relief.  The sector has played a key role in our response to the pandemic and the sector itself has not gone unaffected.  That is why I was pleased we were recently able to announce &euro;47 million to support contract researchers and research students, whose work has been seriously disrupted by the pandemic.  The establishment of the new Department comes at an exciting time for research, innovation and science, as we develop successors to central long-term strategies for the sector that are coming to conclusion.</p> <p> My Department will take charge of the implementation of Innovation 2020, which is due to conclude at the end of the year, and its successor.  Its overarching vision is for Ireland to become a global innovation leader driving a strong, sustainable economy and a better society, with a focus on talent, excellence and impact.  It is important to acknowledge we have achieved much in respect of Innovation 2020.  We are now the ninth most innovative country in the European Union and just a few weeks ago, our researchers reached the historic landmark of winning &euro;1 billion from Horizon 2020.  We now have the opportunity to take a fresh look at the pivotal role that research and innovation play, and will continue to play, in addressing the key economic and societal challenges we face, including climate change, digitisation and public health.  We need to see research as an opportunity to provide the answers to some of the big societal challenges we face.  The new strategy that my Department will deliver next year will reflect this.</p> <p> I am very much looking forward to my continued engagement with the sector as we seek to build on the additional &euro;29 million secured for research in the budget to support research responses to Covid-19, early-stage research careers and career pathways, excellent leading Irish investigators, scaling up and competing internationally, and building research partnerships.  Crucially, it will be an opportunity for greater North-South collaboration, which I see as vital.</p> <p> Immediately on the establishment of the Department, we began putting in place a major support package to assist the further and higher education sector and training support sector through the Covid crisis, along with new supports for students, including a doubling of the student assistance fund from &euro;8 million to &euro;16 million, and providing 17,000 laptops to students throughout the country who may require them.  Students have had a particularly hard time, considering the impact not only on their studies but also on their personal lives, their lives overall and their income, with many losing their jobs or not being able to access a part-time job.  I am also conscious that students may have had to buy additional equipment, such as a webcam, a desk, a chair or a computer, while experiencing a reduction in their income.</p> <p>  I am pleased that the Government this week approved a &euro;50 million once-off fund to support students, which we flagged in budget 2021.  This fund will ensure that students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up to their grant before Christmas, while students who do not avail of the grant can reduce their contribution fee payments by &euro;250 or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.  If a student is in receipt of a SUSI grant, he or she will get a &euro;250 payment before Christmas, but if not, and if the student is a full-time EU student in a publicly funded higher education institution, he or she will get a &euro;250 credit note.  That can be used to knock off any outstanding registration fees that are due for this year or it can be used for the next academic year's registration fees, or as a credit note for some of the costs experienced in college life.  We will write to each of our higher education institutions to put in place that detail and to communicate directly with students.  This is only a small step - I do not suggest it is any more - but I hope it will go a small way towards helping life a bit easier for people.  I am grateful to the dedicated staff of my Department, the Irish Universities Association, the Technological Higher Education Authority, Technological University Dublin, SUSI and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, for all their assistance in bringing this much-needed support to students.</p> <p> In addition to this funding and the doubling of the student assistance fund, we have increased the level of funding for the 1916 bursary refund to &euro;5 million per annum.  This will provide an additional 200 bursaries, bringing the total number for 2021 to 1,000 bursaries for the most disadvantaged students in our country.  We have secured an additional &euro;20 million in funding for SUSI next year to cover an increased number of applications to the scheme and allocated &euro;6 million to enhance SUSI support for postgraduates.  These supports were really taken back during the previous recession and need to be replenished, and this is the first step.  We have put in place the digital support scheme of &euro;15 million and, crucially - I am excited about this - for the first time ever, we have established a dedicated ring-fenced fund called the mitigating educational disadvantage fund of &euro;8 million, given to SOLAS, to engage with community education.  SOLAS will go out into our communities, through the education and training boards, and examine how it can support people who are providing education to learners at the greatest risk of disconnection from our education and training system.</p> <p> Crucially, we have increased the amount of money being spent on well-being and mental health by an additional &euro;3 million in recognition of the impact of Covid and the general need to improve those services.  I recognise, however, that it is important also to consider more widely how we can facilitate learners in different circumstances.  That is why I have announced a review of SUSI.  SUSI has done great work but it is not fit for purpose in many ways.  It does not recognise part-time learners or the cost of cr&egrave;che fees.  We need to have a conversation about this.  The review is almost under way and will commence this year.  It will report back to me next year in advance of the budget, and all Deputies, as well as students and everybody else, will have an opportunity to make their views known.</p> <p> Everyone in the House will be aware of the significant efforts made by students, institutions and staff in dealing with the impact of Covid-19 on the further and higher education sector.  The majority of semester one in further and higher education has been online for most people, although there have been exceptions for people who need to do practical work.  We have kept open our libraries and laboratories, as well as classes for people who need face-to-face teaching for a variety of reasons.  I am concerned that the necessary move to online and blended learning has been very difficult for some, particularly those in the first and final years of their courses.  We are now preparing for semester two and the new year.  Any decision we make will, of course, be made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer and the Department of Health and in line with the best public health advice available to us.  The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and I met the presidents of all our higher education institutions today and we will meet student representatives and union representatives tomorrow.  Our priority going into the new year will be to increase on-campus activity as much as and as safely as possible.  I would like to see more onsite activity for first and final-year students in particular.  These discussions are taking place with the institutions in my Department and I intend to provide certainty in respect of this next week.  Our priorities will be continuing programmes and activities that cannot take place online but this conversation needs to be about more than education.  It has to be about welfare, well-being and the first-year student sitting at home at the kitchen table or in the box room of a house who has not been on campus.  If it is safe to get such students there for some activity and engagement, there would be a great benefit, although we have to manage it carefully and do so in line with public health advice.  I heard a real enthusiasm and leadership from the presidents of our institutions in that regard today.  It cannot be impossible to see an improvement in the situation and that is what I am committed to doing too.  We want to create new ways to promote small-scale in-person contact, especially peer engagement, for new entrants to further and higher education.  That is important.  We need to do it in a way that gives our institutions flexibility and we cannot be overly prescriptive on it.  The safety and well-being of students and staff will be at the heart of all our decisions.</p> <p> I have tried just to touch on a small number of areas.  There are many others, in particular the exciting agenda for technological universities throughout our country.  I look forward to providing further updates to the House on these and many other matters in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900032#FF00200"><p>I thank the Minister for the update.  I welcome the &euro;250 being made available for each student.  It is important the Government recognises the difficult circumstances many students have been facing.  Despite the amazing efforts of third level educators and staff, as well as students' unions and what they have done throughout the country, remote learning has had a negative impact on the quality of the service provided.  I raised with the Minister a couple of weeks ago the concerns I have about blended learning and the impact that has.  I am afraid of the drop-out rates it might lead to.  It is regrettable that the Government has brought forward this as a once-off payment.  We have the highest fees in the EU and SUSI supports need to be increased, which will still be the case next year.</p> <p>I welcome the review of SUSI that is taking place and I would like to see it completed it sooner rather than later.  There are things we can do now, in terms of the communication between SUSI and the Department of Social Protection, to make it easier for students to access support.  Improvements can be made even without looking at the threshold fees and everything else that needs to be done around the reform of SUSI.  We certainly will work with the Minister on that.  We have much very valuable information, which I have submitted before, that comes directly from students.</p> <p> In regard to postgraduate students, will the Minister consider asking the universities to compensate them for the move to online teaching?  Irish universities have confirmed in recent weeks that they will not be offering face-to-face teaching before next summer, with the exception of some laboratory and practical sessions.  Graduate-entry medical students at University College Dublin are withholding their exorbitant fees and the university's Smurfit business school students are lobbying for a 30% reduction in fees.  We are talking about students who have handed over &euro;10,000 to &euro;18,000.  The experience they are getting online is not the one for which they signed up.  If we look at the colleges' prospectuses, marketing campaigns and open days, they describe the student experience as something really valuable.  Those students have paid for something they are not getting.  Will the Minister see whether something can be done in terms of compensating them?</p> <p> I want to raise the issue of student accommodation.  While the &euro;250 payment is very welcome, thousands of euro have been paid out by students and their families, either for on-campus accommodation or private accommodation, and they are not getting that money back.  The Minister said on the previous occasion in which we discussed this matter in the House that five of the seven universities had agreed to refund students for on-campus accommodation.  Since then, however, I have been contacted by a number of people who have been denied the refunds which their university supposedly agreed to issue.  My office has been in contact with the Minister about these cases.  It is unacceptable that public institutions continue to deny students these funds, particularly when the Minister has made a commitment to the D&aacute;il that refunds would be made.</p> <p> There is an ever greater issue in respect of private accommodation providers given that some 90% of student accommodation is provided by the private sector.  Private landlords are telling students that if they get somebody to take their place, the landlord will consider giving them their money back.  That is not good enough.  A clear message should be sent from Government that any student accommodation provider who fails to provide funds for unused accommodation will be denied access to any future financial supports or tax reliefs, whether related to the Covid-19 crisis or otherwise.  If emergency legislation is needed to give the Government the power to act, then it should be brought forward.  It is not good enough for the Minister for Housing, Local Heritage and Government to say there is nothing that can be done.  That is a complete abdication of responsibility.  We are talking about the most basic social solidarity at a time of public health emergency.</p> <p> The situation of student nurses and midwives must be addressed.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Health need to work together to resolve it.  Student nurses and midwives are working on the front line during the pandemic and they need, and deserve, to be paid accordingly.  Many of them had to give up part-time jobs due to the dangers of cross-contamination, and rightly so, but they were reliant on that income.  Not only are they not paid and unable to earn, they are expected to pay &euro;3,000 in fees.  We are telling them to give up their jobs and work for free but they still must pay the highest fees in the EU.  It is no wonder we have problems retaining nurses when this is how they are treated.  This issue must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> On the issue of apprenticeships, I acknowledge what has been done and what the Minister is trying to do in this area.  However, it is blatantly unacceptable that only two out of all the universities and institutes of technology and fewer than half of local authorities offer apprenticeship places.  It is important that the Government instruct educational institutions, councils and public bodies to play their part by employing apprentices.  We were told there would be more than 100 different apprentice programmes to choose from but, instead, there are only 58.  While I look forward to seeing the Minister's plan to address this situation, what we really need is action.  I thank the Minister for what he has done but there are real problems in this area that need to be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900033#GG00200"><p>I begin by acknowledging the experience of our third level students this year.  It has been an extremely difficult time in their young lives, when what should be their first taste of freedom is being spent locked away from the social life and contact they normally would have.  The vast majority of them are behaving brilliantly and doing their bit.  They are a credit to themselves and their families.  Unfortunately, they do not get any credit from those who hold their nose and criticise young people while enjoying coffees and drinks in the evening with their friends and families in mixed households.</p>  <p>  It is likewise hypocritical that in a country which prides itself on its commitment to equality, that this equality should not include the poor.  A survey conducted by my party colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, found that many families are having to put themselves in debt and deeper poverty to give their children the chance of a third level education.  This year, many families are experiencing further hardship by being forced to fork out outrageous rents for accommodation their children are not even using.  Deputy Conway-Walsh mentioned that there are many students in private rented accommodation who have been refused refunds.</p>  <p>  Too many families are excluded from or penalised by the SUSI grant system because its assessment criteria do not reflect the reality of the income available to households.  That has to change.  One might imagine that in a so-called republic of equality, a student from a poor background would have the same chance of accessing third level education as one from the leafier parts of the country.  That is simply not the case and this lack of equality will deteriorate further as a result of the severe economic impact on families of the Covid-19 crisis.  Maynooth University is in my home town and we are very lucky to have it.  It is, by any standards, an outstanding university that is doing its utmost to tackle the innate inequality inherent in third level education, including through the provision of opportunities for part-time study.  My party and I believe that grants should apply equally to part-time study.  Such funding should not be viewed as a cost but as an investment in our people's future and the future of the State.</p>  <p>  The Covid crisis has shown us the need for, and given us an opportunity to, reflect on our third level system and the urgent necessity to institute not only equality of access and support for the duration but additional supports and incentives for those who are struggling financially.  There is no place in the 21st century for 20th century thinking on educational opportunity.  It perpetuates a social and educational wrong whereby students from a poor background have to achieve twice as much to do even half as well as their better-off counterparts.  It is damaging and degrading for the people concerned and, indeed, for the State.</p></speech>

I wish them both well in their important work.  I recall the occasion, in 2015, when President Higgins gave the Edward Phelan International Labour Organization, ILO, lecture on the future of work.  I was at that lecture, which was held in the Royal College of Surgeons in St. Stephen's Green, as was Guy Ryder, the head of the ILO.  The President is an academic of long standing, having worked for many decades in NUI Galway.  In his lecture, he observed that, years ago, if an academic wanted to study the phenomenon of precarious work, he or she would have to leave his or her desk and do a field trip.  Now, it is not necessary for academics to leave their desks or their departments because the phenomenon is evident all around them.</p> <p> The Minister's attention will have been drawn to an analysis carried out by Noteworthy recently on working conditions in the third-level sector.  It backs up other evidence published in recent years which shows that precarious or casual work in the third-level sector amongst lecturers and researchers is endemic.  In fact, it has been normalised.  The Noteworthy work suggests that we have over 11,000 lecturers working on temporary or casual contracts.  Last week the case of an assistant lecturer in Technological University Dublin was brought to my attention.  I do not mind naming the institution.  The lecturer has been there since 2007.  Those who joined the organisation in the mid-2010s are leapfrogging him now because of changes to the incremental scale for them.  He has been making applications to make sure he is converted to a lecturer position.  He should be converted to such a position but this has not happened.  There is a deep unfairness and inequity in that.  This is not a unique case.  I use the case to illustrate a broader point.  This is a real issue in our third-level sector.</p> <p> This week ten years ago, everyone in this House will not need to be reminded, was the week that the troika came to our shores.  We all know about the stringent conditions that were attached to public funding and the resources available to us to invest in third-level education and other public services at that time and for a few years afterwards.  That lost few years of investment has very much impacted on our third and fourth level sector and has created what one might describe as a generation gap too.  There are many thousands of very experienced academics, lecturers and researchers who are tenured, who are in permanent positions and who enjoy a degree of certainty and security in terms of their pay and conditions, but many of the younger generation of academics do not enjoy the same terms and conditions.  We cannot build the kind of economy that I know the Minister wants to see and that I want to see, and the kind of society we want to see, if we ignore this problem and if we do not invest to retain and value our best researchers, lecturers and academics.</p> <p> This is about funding, which is a nettle we need to grasp.  Funding is the key.  No reference has been made in recent times to the Cassells report and the options contained in it.  To the best of my recollection, it was published in late 2015.  There are a number of options in it.  In my view, the clearest and most sensible option is to publicly fund our third-level institutions and to ensure that access is provided to everybody.  Making access available to everybody is the only way that we can create a decent, fair and, indeed, entrepreneurial society to make sure that everybody can achieve his or her ambition on a level playing pitch.</p> <p> I was the first ever member of my extended family to attend university and I had that opportunity because the State invested in me.  In the early to mid-1990s, the State decided that everybody should have such an opportunity, thanks to a decision made by Ms Niamh Bhreathnach as Minister for Education at the time that there would be free fees.  University gave me opportunities that my parents and grandparents did not have.  It is not that they would not have been capable of going to university but they did not have the opportunity because of financial circumstances.  Financial circumstances should not dictate who gets to university and who does not.  Making education free and affordable is a big question we will have to tackle in this House over the next period of time but it is an investment that is worth making in our society and economy.</p> <p> I support the remarks made about supporting our student nurses.  This is a running sore that needs to be addressed.  Tackling the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, question and a review of SUSI is important because SUSI, as it is presently constructed, does not properly capture the reality of working lives, employment conditions and how income is made up for so many families in this country.</p></speech>

I wish both the Minister and the Minister of State well, as I have done in the past.  I believe it is a step in the right direction to give as much access to third level as possible, particularly to those in the regions and those who do not have the wherewithal to attend third level.  It gives them the opportunity.  It also allows the Department a greater focus on what is required to bring greater numbers into the university sector.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the developments in relation to the technological universities.  Carlow and Waterford should move ahead quite quickly under the guidance of the recently appointed Mr. Boland and should reach recognition in January 2021.  I look forward to that.  The south-east region has suffered badly economically because of the lack of university status within it.  I know from experience that companies that wish to come and set up in Ireland look at the educational system and what is available, particularly the universities.  I have no doubt that the south-east region will benefit, not only Waterford and Carlow.  I know that Kilkenny is part of the plan for future - a campus of some sort there.  There is great opportunity.</p>  <p>  I am glad that Deputy Nash raised the issue of publicly funded education because we must look at a model that will give greater public funds to those who wish to attend third level.  As I finished my leaving certificate, it was not possible or affordable for me to attend third level.  In a sense, at that time it might not have had the same impact as now.</p>  <p>  Given the digital economy we are creating and the world as all of the markets merge, it is important that we have highly qualified people who can go into that marketplace, develop a footprint for Ireland abroad and attract the companies that will create a critical mass of employment in Ireland.  That can only be done through education.  I would support any move the Minister makes to increase the input of public funds to support students attending college.  Some of the really bright students often cannot get to college and yet, through their own initiatives, manage to rise to the top.  However, it is a battle when one does not have the qualifications behind one.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the amounts of money the Minister is giving to the universities to establish the newer ones and to keep funded the well-established universities as they move along in time.  I am positive about their development but we have to learn from the past.  The Minister stated that he met the presidents of the various institutions recently.  My concern is that we have had the universities before the Committee of Public Accounts on numerous occasions.  They have been late in submitting their accounts.  They have been less than spectacular in how they have described their expenditure and in many instances, there were controversies and scandals that were swept under the carpet by the State.  There was a cover-up in terms of how those issues arose within certain universities.  I am not painting them all with the one brush, but there were issues and those issues, by and large, were not addressed.  They were certainly ignored to facilitate the ongoing work of a university or, indeed, to facilitate individuals to progress in their jobs and get out the other side.  No one was found guilty, as it were, of the terribly poor governance that existed in some universities.  No one was found to be short in his or her delivery of protection for the employees of universities and yet there were many whistleblowers in the University of Limerick, Cork Institute of Technology and elsewhere.  I brought a case to the Minister's attention.  The Minister has taken much of the baggage from the Department of Education but, historically, there are issues.  They are not resolved.</p>  <p>  I am deeply disappointed that even as we debate this positive move in terms of third level, there are legacy issues from the past that the players at management level within some universities are simply not willing to deal with.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> We passed legislation in this House about whistleblowers.  We offered them protection.  Some of them came forward in good faith, wanting to improve the work ethic around them, their work environment generally, or to report directly a wrongdoing.  They have been vilified.  They have lost their jobs.  The individual named at the Committee of Public Accounts lost her job.  To this day State money is being used by that particular institute to drag the person through the courts, to deal with her in a very bad way and not to acknowledge at all the rights the person has as an employee of the institute in question.</p> <p> There is something we can do in real time in that, where we see money being wasted, it is important for the Minister to step in, call the university or institute out and ask what they are doing with the taxpayers' money we are giving them.  Some institutions have been funding highly paid solicitors, barristers and senior counsel to defend a position that is indefensible and to railroad someone in light of the legislation we passed in this House giving protection to whistleblowers.  They are making their lives absolutely impossible, taking their jobs from them, bringing on poor health, forcing them into a situation where the institutes are actually breaking the law by asking them to do certain things people simply should not be asked to do because it is illegal to do so.  However, because they have the power of the State behind them and a bottomless pit as far as resources are concerned, they are able to do this to individuals.</p> <p> I am asking the Minister, as I did before, and the Taoiseach as well, to call a halt to it, not to be afraid to say that enough is enough.  Unless the Minister or someone senior does so, if he does not take them out and make an example of them, they will continue to do it under the new arrangements for universities and institutes of technology.  Vice-presidents or presidents are not beyond accountability, and they have to be told that.  They have to be told that it is taxpayers' money that is keeping them in their job.  Those of them who are Accounting Officers or heads of finance and governance should be challenged on the quality of control they have in their finances or challenged on the quality of governance that they have.</p> <p> If we as legislators do not keep them on their toes through the Comptroller and Auditor General, who else is going to do it, rather than any of us standing back from a position and not taking on the system in favour of a whistleblower or someone who we know is truthful and honest and has done nothing wrong?  If we do not do it, who else will?  Those individuals cannot afford to go to court.  They take a huge risk in doing so and yet they set out with the right intentions to do right by the State and the institute that they respected.  Nobody should be allowed to play with public money in the way some of the institutions do, and the Minister must find some way to empower the Comptroller and Auditor General, who himself knows all about the background to education, because I understand he was part of the audit in his previous position.  All I am asking from the Minister is, on matters of governance and accountability and in legacy cases, that he not be afraid, that he has the power of this House and his position behind him to resolve the outstanding issues that the vested interests simply will not.</p></speech>

In the interests of full disclosure, my daughter is one of them.  They may be graduating at a time of great uncertainty, stress and anxiety, but their cap and gown in the kitchen or sitting room means just as much as any other one who has gone beforehand.</p>  <p>  I raise the case of two young men who live in my constituency.  Their names are Fionn and Phelim.  They are 18 years old.  Through an interfamily arrangement, they have lived with their grandparents since they were 16 years old.  All aspects of their lives have been formalised through their grandparents.  They have registered for medical cards based on their grandparents&rsquo; State pensions.  Their Revenue account is based at their grandparents as well the details required by their GP and bank.  This is the case with everything they have.  This year they received 423 and 444 points.  They are bright lads, to say the least.  One is now studying psychology, the other commerce.  One of them actually attends college through the Disability Access Route to Education, DARE, programme due to sight loss.</p>  <p>  An exceptional result and elation at their points was followed swiftly by devastation from SUSI, which told them that their application was being denied.  Evidence submitted to SUSI included a letter from the local community Garda sergeant detailing his knowledge and awareness of the family arrangement and how long those lads had been living with their grandparents.  For some reason this was not deemed adequate.  The boys have appealed and that is due to be heard on 4 December.  However, their fees are also due to be paid at the end of November.  Solicitors&rsquo; letters followed detailing the arrangements and still this was not classed as being sufficient.  These young lads were 18 when their application was submitted to SUSI.  There is no way they could have gone to court to get the guardianship SUSI was demanding.  This is a huge loophole that is grossly unfair and is causing huge distress.</p>  <p>  These young lads cannot be the only people in this position in this country.  I refer to a reply by the Minister to a parliamentary question which states, "Cases of genuine estrangement are relatively rare and almost always will involve exceptional circumstances unique to a particular family...".  I put it to the Minster that while "relatively rare" is somewhat of a broad base, what he will actually find is that the family courts involvement in cases like this is what is actually relatively rare, not the estrangement.  These young lads have ended up in this position through no fault of their own.  Their grandparents are doing their absolute best for them.  This is the reality of their lives, yet because of SUSI their grandparents, who are elderly people on State pensions, are now looking to take out a credit union loan to put their grandchildren through college.  These young lads have been through enough in their lives so far and this is something that really needs clarity.</p>  <p>  The Minister&rsquo;s reply goes on to state, "The scheme does not stipulate precisely how an awarding authority satisfies itself."  That is not really good enough.  We understand there must be flexibility and a level of common sense, but surely if these young lads have provided everything they have been asked for and done so willingly, then that willingness should be met at the other end as well rather than additional obstacles being put in front of them.  I want to reference something my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, brought up earlier.  I cannot be the only Deputy in this House who has had constituents contact them to say there is a problem with the Revenue Commissioners and SUSI speaking to each other.  Whether it is P21 details that have been double-counted or whatever the case may be, that lack of communication not only adds extra workload to SUSI but causes huge distress to families at a time when stress is already high.</p></speech>

I thank both the Minister and Minster of State for attending today wish them the very best in what is an incredibly important portfolio.  Some of the issues I will raise have already been touched on so I will try not to overlap and will try to develop some of them in my own way.</p>  <p>  I welcome the once-off Covid payment of &euro;250 for full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students.  It is very welcome and will alleviate some of the stress on some of the students, but I recognise it does not go far enough in some instances.  In particular, there has been an omission in respect of part-time students who do not avail of it, and I would like to see if we can potentially address that.  Perhaps the payment should not be a once-off and the Government could add an additional &euro;250 in the second semester, which again would go some way to alleviating a lot of the burdens which have been placed on third level students at the moment.</p>  <p>  On the issue of SUSI, which has been touched on quite well already by some of my colleagues, the Minister has committed to reviewing SUSI and I very much welcome that news.  What plans are there for the scale of the review and has any consideration been given to the engagement of students in it?  I am speaking not only of students who have successfully gone through the SUSI process but also those who contact our offices having not had such a positive experience of SUSI and who may not have been successful in the process.</p> <p>Their voices are necessary.  I am contacted quite regularly by students, as I am sure other Deputies are, on various issues related to SUSI.  I acknowledge the team on SUSI is absolutely fantastic and in our engagement with them they are always quick and prompt in their responses, and probably more so than most other Departments, I am guaranteed to speak to someone in SUSI who will get back to me and I commend this.  However, a lot of problems remain and they are legislative problems that we can address through working collaboratively in the House.  I will bring forward legislation in this regard in the coming months.</p> <p> SUSI has no ability to classify as independent students under the age of 23.  This creates a lot of issues for people who contact me.  They may be 22 and parents themselves.  They may be estranged from their parents.  I cannot ask SUSI to consider them as adults in their own right.   This is an omission.  This is further exacerbated by students not being able to be reclassified as dependents at any age unless they break their education for three years or re-enter education after a five-year break.  This is a flaw in the system and we can work together to address it.</p> <p> The legislation assumes that all students have family supports, such as a stable place to live, and it fails to acknowledge cases where students under the age of 23 may not live at home for positive reasons or negative reasons such as estrangement.  It actively discourages students from becoming independent.  The burden of providing proof of a change in circumstances for students, such as one parent leaving the home, can be incredibly confusing to navigate and places an emotional and financial burden on students.  An example has already been given of solicitor fees.  This is a little bit embarrassing for the students who come forward with it and we can address this.</p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Nash, raised a Noteworthy publication but I might develop it.  Noteworthy published a three-part article stemming from a six-month investigation by journalist Maria Delaney that revealed more than 11,200 lecturers are on temporary or casual contracts in Ireland's IT and university sector, in precarious employment with poor pay.  As is too often the case, this is not only a worker issue but a gender issue.  Only this year was the glass ceiling broken when the University of Limerick appointed Professor Kerstin Mey as its new president.  Professor Mey becomes the first woman to be appointed head of any Irish university, breaking a 428-year tradition.  While this is progress and welcome, at the same time the gender equality gap in our higher education sector is increasing and not decreasing.  In 2019, 71% of women worked in part-time temporary academic jobs in universities and the figure for institutes of technology was 63%.  Over the course of the pandemic, there has been an increase in papers authored by men, a repercussion of female researchers having to juggle other responsibilities, potentially childcare and the housework of academia as Dr. Theresa O'Keeffe, the head of sociology in UCD, pointed out, to describe duties such as academic teaching and administration, which is disproportionately given to female students.</p> <p> I want to highlight several issues that we might be able to address quickly.  Anyone who has worked, as I have, in higher education access and outreach education, knows that the burden of getting paperwork associated with the higher education access route and the disability access route to education is often cumbersome.  During the pandemic it will be especially difficult.  We need to work with higher education institutions to alleviate this and provide some degree of flexibility if we can.</p></speech>

I acknowledge this funding, in addition to access support and additional supports for well-being and mental health, is very important.  We can all agree students have experienced significant upheaval as a result of Covid-19 and this funding will provide some much-needed security at this difficult time.  I also welcome that a review of SUSI has been announced.  Many Deputies will agree the review is long overdue.  I have seen it throughout my constituency work in recent months where people have been left frustrated with the process.  Many students through no fault of their own have to leave home at 18 and often SUSI will not recognise this or it is very difficult to prove they are independent.  These students often feel abandoned by their families and the State and this is something we need to review.  Every individual case should be looked at on its own basis.</p>  <p>  Another issue I have raised previously in the D&aacute;il through parliamentary questions is student accommodation refunds.  It is welcome news that most universities have committed to providing refunds.  I understand some have not done so yet and I call on them today to review this.  I welcome the recent comments of the Minister, Deputy Harris, that he does not believe the policy on student accommodation is working.  I encourage him, the Minister of State and the Department to look at alternative funding models that could be developed.</p>  <p>  The Munster technological university will be formally established on 1 January.  This is a landmark development for the south west.  The new technological university will be formed by Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology, Tralee.  The university will cater for 18,000 students on five campuses at CIT Bishopstown, IT Tralee, CIT School of Music, Crawford College of Art and Design and the National Maritime College of Ireland in Ringaskiddy.  The establishment of the Munster technological university will stimulate a more balanced growth of population and employment throughout Ireland.  It will also help to make higher education more accessible.  This is great news for the region as a whole.  It will help us to continue to produce a well-educated and highly skilled workforce which, in turn, will lead to continued investment and attract new business to the region.</p>  <p>  To go back to the announcement of &euro;50 million, the Minister and Minister of State came before the education committee last week.  Some concerns were raised with regard to the credit note aspect.  In scenarios where students would appreciate the money upfront to facilitate distance learning, perhaps to help to purchase IT equipment or whatever the specific circumstances might be, I ask that they be taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I want to be parochial on a particular issue.  This year is the 100-year commemoration of two former lord mayors of Cork, Terence MacSwiney and Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain.  It made national news that there has been some disagreement about statues and who is more deserving of a statue, including other political figures.  I appeal to the Minister that if possible he considers a bursary in commemoration of both former lord mayors, given the significance of the centenary in Cork.  There would be no better way to commemorate both former lord mayors who were playwrights, political agitators and poets in their own right.  It would be a fitting way to commemorate the centenary.</p></speech>

It is critical for so many young people and those engaged in further education throughout the country.  I am conscious that I am the youngest Deputy in the House to speak about this issue.  I care deeply about it and I have worked in this area in the past, as the Minister is well aware.</p>  <p>  A particular issue I raised in the House this week was the library system in Ireland.  I have been engaging with officials in local government in Cork and elsewhere on proposed library developments in individual communities.  Something that has been discussed much in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in recent times is that so many students engaged in higher education and studying at home find it incredibly challenging to get a proper broadband connection, which is having a severe impact on their studies.  My constituency office is inundated, and I am sure other Deputies have a similar experience.  A potentially very good solution would be for the Department, along with the local authorities, to invest in our library systems.  The Department is new, and I am sure the Minister is looking for new ideas and ways he can improve higher education throughout the country to make sure there is balance nationally for urban and rural areas.  I spoke about the multidepartmental approach required for this because we need funds and we need the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to focus on the importance of projects such as those I have outlined.</p>  <p>  In many areas, students who are at home and struggling to get proper broadband connectivity to engage in their studies would be able to go to their local libraries.  There are many planned developments throughout the country.  There are two in my constituency, in Midleton and Youghal, that are ready to go but need funding and back-up at governmental level in support of local authorities.  This would transform people's ability to study and learn from home, with potential savings of thousands of euro for those who may be considering studying in cities such as Dublin or Cork, where accommodation is incredibly expensive.  We could potentially save those families the cost and expense of this.  They could put their SUSI money to good use in other ways to improve their studies.</p> <p>Many students are from certain backgrounds or may be in unfortunate financial circumstances and they find themselves in a situation where they have to work many hours that could otherwise be dedicated to their studies.  This is one route we should explore. </p> <p> I welcome the news about the top-up grant of &euro;250.  I know this will come as an enormous benefit to many students who are stuck for money and financial support.  I hope that, in the medium term and while the Covid situation evolves, we would consider such measures for next year as well.</p> <p> I welcome the Minister's news that he will work to improve SUSI.  I have outlined to him before in the House my sincere concerns about people fulfilling the SUSI criteria, particularly those Irish citizens who moved abroad and then returned home to Ireland.  I have raised individual cases with the Minister where people were locked outside the criteria.  It is an incredibly daunting task for them to go through appeals to try to obtain funding for their higher education, and this could potentially be the deciding factor in whether or not they are able to pursue their studies.  This is wrong.  We should be able to provide them with the supports they need.  The Minister has been working with me on an ongoing basis on that issue but perhaps he could put a renewed focus on it in the coming months.</p> <p> I wish the Minister well and thank him for all the work he has done so far.</p></speech>

I welcome also the establishment of the Department and the focus on third level and higher education.  The third level experience presents people with the opportunity to broaden their horizons and gain additional skills, and it is transformative in its nature.  A central theme needs to be around access and ensuring that all people, particularly people from disadvantaged backgrounds, have access.  I am thinking in particular of access programmes and postgraduate entry.  Several students have contacted me in recent weeks to outline the particular difficulties they are experiencing at this time in regard to postgraduate medicine and other courses which require a less conventional route through third level.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister's efforts to support the institutions in the very important work they do and the contribution they make.  I am a third level student myself on the Structured Population and Health-services Research Education, or SPHeRE, PhD programme.  Given his former capacity as Minister for Health, the Minister will know that NPHET and other groups such as HIQA are currently relying heavily on graduates from that programme in regard to population health epidemiology.  It is very important that we appreciate the value of those contributions.</p>  <p>  In terms of the effort to undertake basic research, I sometimes find academia can spend a lot of time having to justify its own existence and I want to make the point about the principle of basic research and its importance.  I also want to make the point about the opportunity for the new Department in regard to the role of the State in innovation.  There is sometimes an idea that it is for big pharma or for the private sector to take on and do this creative work.  Mariana Mazzucato and others have written about the entrepreneurial state, which is something we should be ambitious for because we need to take risks in our research.  I commend that approach and implore the Minister to take it up. </p>  <p>  I want to raise the issue of this year&rsquo;s first-year students.  I mentioned how going to third level education can broaden horizons.  Many people come from a local parish or town and are subjected to new influences and meet people from a wide range of backgrounds, which can be very liberating, if messy at times for some people.  However, with Covid-19, that has been completely restricted.  I received a letter from a parent who happens to be a primary school teacher married to a primary school principal, and who encourages the Minister to contact third level institutions and ask them to look at every opportunity to get young adults on campus.  Parents say they are living in their bedrooms with a laptop.  That is the experience they are having in first year, which is very different from the first year experience of their predecessors.  It is very tough on them and is affecting their mental health and their development.  I ask the Minister to consider the opportunities there are to get kids on campus more often.</p></speech>

Many of those things that we have learned the importance of during Covid-19, and which we should have known before, start with higher education.  There are the doctors, the nurses and the scientists we need to cope with a health crisis, the engineers, the architects and the apprentices we need to build infrastructure and the houses we so desperately need, and the arts and the humanities without which, frankly, we would all have gone off our heads over the past six months.  Yet, even before Covid, we were failing desperately to support and invest in the people who study these things at third level and postgraduate level.  We have the highest fees in Europe, now that Britain has gone, with accommodation costs absolutely out of control for students and a straightforward lack of affordable accommodation, or any accommodation, for students.  We had grants that were woefully inadequate and huge inequality in terms of access to third level, given 90% of people from Dublin 6 go to university while the figure is well under 20% in many working-class areas.</p>  <p>  If all of that was true before Covid, frankly, it has got worse since then because students now do not have the opportunities to work they might have had in order to supplement their income.  It is also true of postgraduate students who get paid nothing at all and who, even though they are key to delivering a research output in our universities, do not have proper contracts of employment.  Student nurses, who are literally holding the front line together, as many of the nurses, doctors and healthcare assistants are out sick with Covid, are being paid nothing now.  Having been acknowledged with healthcare assistant, HCA, payment for a couple of months, it was then pulled from them and the Government is resisting paying them. </p>  <p>  Some &euro;250 is a drop in the ocean in that situation.  There is no justification for fees and there never was.  There is even less justification in the context of blended learning, with most of it happening off campus amidst general uncertainty.  Fees for international students are absolutely outrageous, student nurses actually have to pay fees, when they should be paid and not have to pay fees, and postgraduate students are not paid, even though they are doing real work in real jobs.  A hell of a lot needs to be done to change the situation for our students and postgraduates and in regard to the proper funding of universities.</p></speech>

The picture that emerges is that Irish universities are increasingly reminiscent of Edwardian, &ldquo;Upstairs, Downstairs&rdquo; society, with extravagant salaries for a very small minority while those actually keeping the show on the road are struggling to get by.  Take the example of Trinity College, one of the top universities in the world.  That reputation is built on the backs of thousands of low paid lecturers and unpaid PhD researchers.  While it was found recently that the head of Trinity&rsquo;s salary and benefits are so high that they breach the approved limits, the same college employs more than 2,000 non-permanent and casual lecturers.  Across the country, there are more than 11,000 lecturers on temporary and casual contracts, and they are disproportionately women, often with no access to basic employment rights like maternity leave.  The great and the good of university officialdom are treated like royalty while those who do the teaching and the research are left to fight for scraps.</p><p>The impact of those short-term casual contracts is lecturers unable to get a mortgage and unsure if they can cover rent for the next month, with no right to sick pay or maternity leave.</p> <p>They are publicly funded universities involved in pushing a race to the bottom in working conditions.</p> <p> I also want to highlight the particular exploitation of postgraduate workers taking place.  Yesterday, I challenged the Taoiseach on the fact that postgraduate workers are currently expected to do hours of teaching work completely unpaid.  In response, he said that not all postgraduates are workers.  I also got a reply from the Minister that those hours spent teaching are not considered employment services.  That underlines the lack of respect that is shown to those workers.  Not only is their research work not considered work but many are not even paid for the teaching hours they do.  Shamefully, because they are not recognised as workers they are not even allowed to join a trade union.  That is the reason postgraduate workers are getting organised.  My office is assisting them by helping to draw them together and to campaign.  It is time to draw a line in the sand and demand respect and a living wage for postgraduate workers.</p></speech>

Much has been achieved to date and it is to be commended.</p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;50 million announced today for third level students for a once-off payment of &euro;250 to each student.  It was a welcome announcement for the almost 5,000 students of the Institute of Technology, Carlow and St. Patrick's College in Carlow.  I spoke to some students today and there was great excitement among them.</p>  <p>  As a Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny, I particularly welcome the progress made to date on the technological university for the south east, TUSE, and the work being carried out by the TUSEI consortium.  The investment in the south-east region is significant and the proposed establishment of the TUSE through the merging of the Institute of Technology, Carlow and Waterford Institute of Technology in creating critical mass will generate many opportunities for the region, including links with industry and enhanced access to education.</p>  <p>  I cannot let the opportunity pass without mentioning another excellent college, St. Patrick's College in Carlow, which plays a significant role in the higher education landscape in the south east region, with a concentrated expertise in the delivery of programmes in the arts, humanities and social science.  Founded in 1782, Carlow College has pursued its education mission over 238 years during which the regional, national and international context has been continually evolved and changed.  I fully understand and agree that the establishment of the technological university for the south east is the number one priority for the Minister, his Department and the Government.  However, I will also be looking for his support, and that of his Department, in ensuring that no stone is left unturned in progressing the full integration of St. Patrick's College in Carlow into the higher education system in the south east region.</p>  <p>  I am aware the Minister is as committed as I am to enshrine the provision of science, gender equality and multidisciplinary students across all regions of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's enthusiasm in supporting the efforts to enhance technological university status for Carlow and the south east.  This is a wonderful time in education.  A technological university for the south east, consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Carlow, is exciting.  It is great for the south east.  It is and has always been very important to me, and to Carlow in particular, that we can set out its stall for attracting foreign investment, foreign students, local investment and local students as well as wider community investment to improve towns and villages in the vicinity.  I also welcome the appointment of Mr. Tom Boland.</p>  <p>  I have been speaking to students, including today, and they very much need to get back on campus.  Most of them are working from home and it is an issue that has been raised with me in the past few months.</p>  <p>  I look forward to all the great plans the Minister's Department has for higher and further education in Carlow.  I will support him at every opportunity in that regard.  This is crucial for the south east and it will bring so much to the south east area and to my area of Carlow, where I met the Minister on several occasions and he was always very supportive.  Hopefully, we will deliver.  As the Minister said, 2022 is the timescale for having a technological university for the south east and that is excellent news.</p></speech>

I note with appreciation both Ministers appearing before the Oireachtas committee recently to create their Department so I express my congratulations on that point.  I believe it has to be formalised by the House but that will be a great day for both of them.  I know they will be very pleased to formally have a Department in which to work.</p>  <p>  I want to cover a few issues within the higher education sector.  I will start with the expansion of apprenticeships, which is very pleasing to hear.  It is a critical part of the training and third level offering from this State.  Seeing it prioritised is very pleasing because third level education is not for everybody and it is all the more important for us to ensure that we have a diversity of third level education available across all sectors of society.  If it is not recognised as a form of higher education perhaps it should be but its promotion as an alternative to further education is welcome.</p>  <p>  I have discussed previously in committee with the Ministers the knock-on effects of the pandemic on third level access in terms of courses.  I was very pleased to hear that the additional course places that were made available this year will be made available next year also.  I certainly hope that with a variety of issues arising in the near future such as Brexit and, hopefully, the exit of the situation we are in currently in terms of Covid-19, the third level institutions and the Department will be responsive to the necessary changes that most likely will arise in terms of third level choices and, as I mentioned, apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  That leads me to a point I made in committee, which is an important one.  Both the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science need to work collaboratively on what a leaving certificate that does not involve sitting a summer examination in the future might be because that conversation needs to be had by all the various parties involved.  It is worthy of having a conversation at this point given what Covid-19 has caused in terms of the class of 2020 and 2021.  I feel very sorry for the poor fifth year, now sixth year, students but at the same time they have a burden in this process also.</p>  <p>  I want to briefly mention the new literacy, numeracy and digital skills strategy the Minister has launched.  I look forward to getting more information on that but it is a worthy area for him to focus on given the 500,000 people who are estimated to be struggling on that front.  We need to support the work of the National Adult Literacy Agency, along with all of the other partners, in respect of ensuring that the policy is a success because additional adult education is crucial.  We see it in communities up and down the country and it would be worthy to spend some time on that.</p>  <p>  Colleagues have already mentioned the student supports that are available, some of which are in the positive category and some in the negative.  I want to recognise the gestural support the Minister has given to students up and down the country with the announcement of the &euro;50 million package, which will involve each student receiving approximately &euro;250.  That is worthwhile in recognising that students will have additional costs associated with learning from home.  Also, the digital access scheme is crucial in assisting those students and catering for third level education at home.</p>  <p>  I touched on it previously but the retraining and upskilling element of the Minister's Department is important in terms of recognising the change Brexit and Covid-19 will bring, the diversification that our jobs market will need to take and how responsive the third level institutions, and his Department, will be in dealing with that change and diversification.</p>  <p>  I look forward to further engagement with the Ministers in committee.  I am fortunate to be on that committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Paul Kehoe.</p></speech>

A number of Members have already spoken about the fact that we have some staffing issues in third level.  A number of people would be on precarious contracts.  That must be brought to a head from the point of view of sustainability and ensuring that people can put in all the effort and time they want to deliver education for our people.</p>  <p>That is something we need to deal with and take off the table.  I would like to talk specifically about Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT.  There are a number of favourable points for DkIT.  We are glad to have the institute in Dundalk.  The College Connect access programme is a good project which we would to see expanded.  It is not only about making journeys easier for people, sometimes those coming into third level from more disadvantaged backgrounds, but also building relationships with communities.  I also refer to the spectacular work done by places such as &Oacute; Fiaich College and other institutes that offer post-leaving certificate courses, which provide another vehicle for people who do not necessarily follow the traditional route of the leaving certificate to make it through to third level.  This is something that we need to look into.  We had the situation with the leaving certificate this year but in many cases, people see a black and white scenario.  There are many vehicles to get to where one wants to be in life and we need to work on that.</p> <p> A major issue for DkIT is the idea of technical university status.  I call on the Minister to ensure that his Department will work with all necessary stakeholders to deliver this.  I know there was a notion that DkIT was quite slow to engage about this and there was no room at the inn for a number of groupings of institutes of technology and former institutes of technology.  I know there are particular issues in the universities and complaints being dealt with, involving the Ombudsman.  I do not want to get into the details of that.  It is a necessity that DkIT does not fall behind.  I call on the Minister and Minister of State to use the Department to deliver technical university status for DkIT.</p> <p> In the last seconds that I have, I raise nursing and midwifery students.  For obvious reasons, many who would have previously worked part-time in health are not able to do that at this point or when doing work experience.  There is a small payment, including for travel.  We need to make sure that it is sped up.  While it usually paid retrospectively, we should pay it to them to make things easier for them to do vital work for themselves and us.</p></speech>

The correspondence states that the constituent's electrician apprenticeship is supposed to be a four year programme, but there is such a waiting list to move on to the next phase that apprentices such as this person will spend more than five years doing the apprenticeship.  My constituent and I want to know if the Minister will look into this and solve the problem so that the apprentice can qualify within the four years and start to earn his much-needed living.  All his exams have been completed in phase 6 and he has six months left in phase 7.  I hope the Minister will look into that and come up with a solution.</p>  <p>  On higher education in general, this is a sector which has grown rapidly in the past 20 years.  I am sure we can all remember the days when the junior certificate, or the intermediate certificate, as it was known, was as far as many students went in school, then doing the leaving certificate became the norm.  Nearly 60 years ago, the Government placed secondary education at the heart of Irish life.  This helped to improve people's life chances and helped many people out of poverty.  The fact that we now have a Minister with responsibility for higher education, with a dedicated Department, is evidence of the increased importance placed on higher education.</p>  <p>  If we want to ensure continued growth in this sector, all areas of Ireland must be catered for.  With that in mind, I draw attention to the university for the south east and the proposal to merge IT Carlow and Waterford IT under the technological university for the south east.  That has been talked about for years but, while I know there is progress, it is slow.  As the largest county in the south east in both population and area, a substantial university campus must be put in County Wexford as part of the university for the south east.</p>  <p>  Cost has been highlighted several times as one of the main difficulties apparent in third level education.  For example, the cost of accommodation in Dublin is astronomical and a grave difficulty for many families.  Second, there is a benefit to having a university in the area, which is the ability to attract foreign direct investment.  Unfortunately, County Wexford has been neglected by IDA Ireland for many years.  The most recent announcement is the first in years.  The number of IDA visits that happen in Wexford is constantly near the bottom of the list compared with the rest of the country.  It is unacceptable for such a big county with obvious location benefits.  The IDA visits are vital because they advertise the advantages of the location to companies considering investing and expanding in Ireland.  One of the main reasons Wexford is neglected is the absence of a university campus.</p>  <p>  In County Wexford, before Covid, we had makeshift car parks dotted along the roadsides where people met to carpool to head to Dublin to work.  More than 10,000 people leave Wexford daily to work outside the county.  I want highly skilled people in Wexford to have the option to go to college and work in Wexford, rather than leaving them stuck in traffic, spending the whole day in Dublin, and arriving home to their families later when their children have gone to bed.</p>  <p>  When Donogh O'Malley announced free secondary education for all he did not exclude any county.  Imagine if he decided to have free secondary education in only a few counties.  How much worse off would we be as a society today?  I ask the Minister to ensure that when it comes to a campus in Wexford as part of the university, we do not need to focus on the funds for it.</p></speech>

I was reminded of the sentence "an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea".  Is the Minister with responsibility for higher education a part-time Minister?  He is unable to attend the complete debate here.  The Deputies left in the Chamber represent thousands of people in our constituencies and many of them are interested in this issue.  For the Minister to hightail it before we have the opportunity to put our views to him is just not on, especially given that he was Minister for Health at the start of the year and he promised student nurses that he would pay them a wage for the work that they did on the front lines during the pandemic.  What followed was a Minister who stiffed staff in this country who were working in the most difficult situations.  It is beyond tight-fisted and actually cheap on the part of the Government not to pay the staff working in hospitals the income that the Minister promised.</p>  <p>  Many students are being given a bad name by people in the Oireachtas.  I know a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator who wanted to use the Army against students in Galway because they were congregating in Galway in the summer.  I want to talk about the fantastic students who are fighting for equality and campaigning.  I think of one student, Sonia, who has been campaigning on the phone with Deputies and in media, trying to get proper salaries and wages for student nurses.  I think of Cian Gallagher, another brilliant and driven student of politics in UCD, who is heading up a campaign relating to SUSI.  I commend him on that.  I would like to ask the Minister, if he was here, how many students who were promised a grant this summer have had that funding taken away or threatened to be taken away by SUSI.</p>  <p>  Another student was in touch with me recently who has been orphaned.  He was taking care of a guardian last year.  The college in question failed to inform SUSI that he was not able to continue.  He did not receive a cent of that grant but the university did.  When he went back to college this year, he was not afforded that grant any more.  Surely SUSI should ask the university for that money back and not the student himself.</p> <p>In a time of recession we need to keep students in education in this country and we need a Minister who will follow through on the promises that he made to student nurses earlier this year.

I welcome in particular the emphasis that this Minister and Minister of State placed on the training and skills facet of the Department and their commitment to prioritise lifelong learning, one of the aspects of education which we do not do well currently in this country.</p>  <p>  I will use my time, like many before me, to address the critical issue of the technological university of the south east, TUSE, a project with such importance to balanced regional development that it is specifically referenced twice within the programme for Government.  The Minister of State will acknowledge that the technological university, TU, model was conceived in response to the need and demand for a university to serve the needs of the 500,000 people who live in the south-east region and the fact that Waterford is the only city in the country without a university-status third level institution.</p>  <p>  I am old enough to remember when the Institute of technology, IT, structure was proposed as an answer to the same problem a generation ago.  What followed was a re-badging exercise where all regional technical colleges, RTCs, were upgraded with no net benefit to Waterford or to the south east.  It is much to the credit of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, that it has consistently remained first among equals and has managed to compete with universities despite the inequalities of funding opportunities.  I praise also WIT&rsquo;s place within our community, both geographically and socially.  Many of the students who graduate from WIT are the first in their families to attain a third level qualification.  This is true of my own family.  I also know as a matter of fact the great pride both staff and management place on this.</p>  <p>  We are not, however, competing on a level playing pitch.  As a region the south east accounts for 8.9% of the population but only 5% of the higher education income.  Of our young people who enter higher education, 59% of them leave the region in order to do so, which is in or around 11,000 students per annum.  This equates to a significant wealth transfer out of the south east but far more damaging is the loss of our young people and we see a pronounced demographic doughnut in the region characterised by a missing generation of 19 to 45 year olds.  Our young people are going away and in many cases are staying away.  Even in the TU model, a model designed to deliver a university to the south east, we see the disparity continue.  Since 2018, &euro;56 million has been spent on all TU processes.  Of that TUSE has only received &euro;8.1 million or 14%.  This is a lesser share than that allocated to either Dublin, Galway or Cork, all of which are regions with existing universities.  These figures themselves fail to capture the historical underinvestment in the Waterford campus and in particular in terms of the built infrastructure that lags far behind the higher education capital investment in other regions.</p>  <p>  President-elect Joe Biden has been quoted as saying: &ldquo;Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.&rdquo;  For generations we have been told in Waterford how valued we should be as the economic driver for the south-east region.  The historic Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, URDF, funding allocation last week for our north quays was a welcome signal that perhaps this Government might finally be putting our money where our mouth is.  This needs to be followed through with the adequate funding of the TUSE project.  If we are to grow our undergraduate and postgraduate capacity in the region, if we are to expand and improve the range of courses available, our region and its young people should accept no less.</p></speech>

It is timely that the emphasis is put on third and fourth level education for the simple reason that we face much competition in the workplace and will face greater competition in the future as our next-door neighbour moves away, as part of the Brexit issue.  We will now be expected to face more challenges and to become an anchor for people who wish, hopefully, to invest in this country and we will also be able to put in place the workforce that is qualified, competent, reliable and the best in the business.  It is possible to do so.</p>  <p>  I will briefly mention some of the issues already referred to by others in the debate, for instance, the issue of academic bullying.  That kind of thing should never happen at any level in any institution.  We are long enough in the tooth looking at these things to be able to say that nobody should expect to get away with that in institutions as august as those at third level.  Let us hope that adequate action is being taken to ensure that does not continue.</p>  <p>  References has also be made to the award of higher education grants.  I, like an Ceann Comhairle, strongly advocated years ago for free third level education in order to be able to give everybody an equal chance.  Unfortunately, the budgetary situation did not allow that to continue.  As a result this education is not as available as it could be.  However, there will always be people who say on the one hand or on the other but we should compare our situation with that of the United States.  The availability of third level education here is way ahead.  That is why we have an advantage.  In the United States, for example, it costs approximately $80,000 to receive a third level education, if one can get one, and there are many reasons why one cannot.  We need to move further and further away from that model and make third and fourth level education more available to the people who are in the community, not necessarily at any particular level, but everybody should have equal access.</p>  <p>  My last point is on the reluctance of some third level institutions to refund the accommodation element of the SUSI grant.  I do not understand this as this accommodation could not be taken up by students because of the lockdown, and rightly so.  Why could these institutions not have found a way to re-let their accommodation to somebody else?  It is not as if there were not people looking for accommodation in the country at the present time.  This could easily have been done on a short-term basis and they could have got their money from there.  Instead, some chose to apologise and state that they could not refund this money as this payment was already part of the agreement.  Circumstances of course changed where Covid-19 took off at a rate, and is still running.  I strongly urge those institutions that refused to refund the accommodation level of the grant to do so as a matter of great urgency.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss third level education in the round mainly.  I also want to raise the challenges that are facing many students in the price of student accommodation which is effectively acting as a barrier for many students who just cannot take up places in college.  We need to get to grips with that as this is excluding bright and gifted students.  We need to ensure that we have legislation in place to overcome all of this.</p>  <p>  The Government can announce millions in support and measure after measure to assist college students but all of that will be purely academic, pardon the pun, if people are priced out of going to college.  That is why we must return again and again to the core issue of educational inequality and disadvantage.  I already called on the Minister earlier this year to make immediate provision for the re-establishment of the education disadvantage committee which was set up under the Education Act 1998 and which did tremendous work.  It was good value for money and led to many initiatives that came into play today, such as the DEIS initiative.  This needs to be looked at.  I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Foley, at the Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science earlier in the week.  This would afford many students the opportunity of breaking out of that cycle of disadvantage and ensue that they had equal opportunities in this Republic.</p>  <p>  We have had the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s newly released report, A Spatial &amp;amp; Socio-Economic Profile of Higher Education Institutions in Ireland.  That report concluded that students from less well-off backgrounds and geographical areas continued to experience continuous and systematic levels of social and class disadvantage within our education system.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The report by the HEA makes for deeply disturbing reading in the sense we seem to have learned nothing over recent years when it comes to increasing educational opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The challenges students face at educational level are being translated into deep, highly unequal economic divisions.  Both the Minister and Minister of State must now accept that a new and imaginative approach is needed.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his portfolio.  I, too, am astounded that the Minister, Deputy Harris, could not have waited until the end of the debate.  Has he gone out to look into the black hole that is the children's hospital site?  Some legacy he has in that regard.  His absence is totally insulting to Deputies, smaller parties and groups who have waited in the queue.  He does not even believe we were worth listening to.  That has been his <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.</p><p>I want to talk about three issues, the first of which concerns university status for the south east.  This is badly needed.  The region is the poor relation.  The late Donogh O'Malley, a party colleague of the Minister of State's father and others, had great vision and inspiration regarding free education.  My God, look at it now.  Look at the stresses.  Hundreds of students and their parents have been on to me about having paid anything between &euro;4,000 and &euro;9,000 for college accommodation and now cannot get it back.  The Government has a majority.  It has a majority on the Business Committee also, as the Ceann Comhairle will know.  It should introduce legislation to address this matter.  It will find that nobody will oppose it.  Let the providers take 30% of the fees, or 40% at most, and give back 70% or 60% to the hard-pressed families.  The Government tells us we are experiencing a pandemic and it legislated to close down everything.  Why are the hard-working families being victimised, made perish and thrown to the wolves?</p><p>I support the staff in SUSI because they have a hard job to do.  They did their best.  I have a very good working relationship with them.  My office is very busy.  Geraldine in my office is on to the staff daily.</p><p>The student nurses have been betrayed.  They left their colleges and came home to work.  They put themselves on the front line and they were told they would be paid.  The Government Members have stood up here and elsewhere to applaud them but they refuse to pay them.  It is abject, disgraceful behaviour, and it is truly a reversal of the Government's promises.  Promises are meant to be broken, the Government will probably tell us, but the student nurses need to be paid.  They are at the front line working harder than many in the huge monstrosity that is the HSE.  The are willing to be at the front line.  They are losing the part-time work they had because they are not available to do it.  They have been badly mistreated.  The Minister of State has children himself and he will have college students shortly enough.  I have a student in college this year.  It is a very trying time.  Some students have only one lecture.  A student I encountered who wanted to travel to college had only five or six hours of tuition but they were spread over five days, meaning they had to travel on each of five days.  The universities and colleges need to get their act together and not have students in college for perhaps ten hours over five days.  It is unfair on the families and the students.  There is a lot to be sorted out in the third level sector.  I wish the Minister of State well with it.</p></speech>

He had some good news.  I was pleased to hear about the 58 new apprenticeship courses that are available, not only in traditional areas such as carpentry and plumbing but also in areas such as cybersecurity, accounting and supply chain management.  I was also very pleased to hear that Ireland is now the ninth most innovative country in Europe.  It really makes me proud to know I live in a country with so many innovative thinkers, doers and entrepreneurs across all sectors, building the foundations for today's and tomorrow's economy.</p><p>As a former teacher, I am particularly interested in the mitigating against educational disadvantage fund.  There are many excellent community education providers in my constituency, Sligo&ndash;Leitrim, and in south Donegal and north Roscommon who will make great use of this money.</p><p>Every time I speak in this House on higher education, I always speak of the technological university under the umbrella of the Connacht-Ulster Alliance.  For me, this is a top priority.  I am happy to report that my various contacts tell me that genuine progress is being made and that things appear to be going according to plan.  There is a tight schedule but those concerned are on schedule.</p><p>Not all is rosy in the higher education garden, however.  I would like to highlight a specific issue that has arisen in respect of Covid.  A constituent of mine who is doing a masters degree worked last year and now gets a contribution of &euro;2,000 towards her fees this year, but she lost her part-time job because of Covid and will be &euro;9,000 worse off at the end of 2020 than she was in 2019.  She cannot avail of the special grant rate, however, because the authorities are refusing to take her changed circumstances into account.  She may have to give up on her masters degree.  I ask that changed circumstances due to Covid be taken into consideration when assessing eligibility for the special grant rate.</p><p>I received a letter from a constituent who expresses in a way I never could many of the concerns of middle Ireland when it comes to higher education.  She states:</p> <blockquote> 	I am a mother off four young wonderful adults ranging from 19 to 27 three in education and one ... working.  One young lady whose fellowship was put on hold in US ... [got no] financial support  on returning ... in March.  Another young lady, a first year student ... never got ... on campus </blockquote>  <p>In good faith, this student's accommodation was booked because she was led to believe she would be on campus.  A contract was signed for &euro;8,800.  She remains at home but the accommodation company demands payment.  The constituent goes on:</p> <blockquote> 	Another Adult in ... second year studying from home ... no placements planned ... [yet] these are our future teachers!!!<br /><br />I now call my home a mini university, Bed Rooms are ... lecture rooms delivering lectures through zoom.  Sitting rooms are ... practical rooms for active/lab learnings.  The Kitchen is ... the canteen [and the front garden is the open-air campus].  I pay for ... lighting ... heating ... wifi ... internet [fees, books, etc.]<br /><br />I am their very committed mother, lecturer, counciler ... [offering support and trying to keep them balanced, encouraged and upbeat].  I am a one parent family who works ... [on the] front line. </blockquote>  <p>Her questions are: how long will we deprive these students of college life experiences?  What kind of education and life experiences are they getting?  How do we expect them to acquire skills to become empathetic nurses and doctors, future entrepreneurs, confident electricians, carpenters, future politicians and lawyers?  She finishes by saying, &quot;My question is simple what are we doing to [do to] support this generation ... and show them we care.&quot;  She signs herself &quot;A very concerned parent who has not a voice at this time&quot;.</p></speech>

My plan, and that of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and my Department, is to work in collaboration with our stakeholders, Oireachtas colleagues and many others.  I look forward to our continued engagement.  Nobody has to be reminded that education is not just primary school followed by secondary school, followed by going to college.  There are a number of paths in life.  It is up to me and my Department, working with others, to provide the kind of education a person wants, where he or she wants it.  In that regard, my focus as Minister of State is on skills development, including apprenticeships and further education.  Ensuring that everyone, including those groups that have been disadvantaged historically, has access to educational opportunities is vital.</p> <p>For example, we know that in Ireland, participation by members of the Traveller community in higher education remains far below where we want it to be.  The most recent data show only 61 Travellers are in higher education.  Approximately 1% of Travellers have third level education.</p> <p> Earlier, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, spoke about inclusion and equity of access, as have other Deputies this afternoon.  Our record on Traveller participation in further and higher education is not good enough from my perspective.  My Department has a plan to address this in partnership with the Traveller community.  I am pleased to say that as part of the plan we have secured &euro;300,000 in dormant accounts funding to safeguard Traveller participation and mitigate against the long-term damage that Covid-19 has caused.  The funding will be used to support technology and study spaces that people may need and to address any caring responsibilities or health and social impacts of the pandemic.</p> <p> In addition to this funding, there is also a once-off Covid-19 emergency fund of &euro;1.9 million to support the delivery of access and support services to vulnerable students from target groups.  The funding will assist access officers in educational institutions to implement supports to meet the needs of particularly vulnerable students.  Priority will be given to the national access plan target groups who have been most impacted by Covid-19.  The socioeconomic groups which have low participation in higher education include Travellers, first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time flexible learners, further education award-holder entrants, lone parents and ethnic minorities.</p> <p> All students have suffered as a result of Covid-19 but it is clear some face greater challenges than others.  We must ensure we do everything we can to help students stay in college during this difficult period.  The funding is part of the &euro;10 million access support package under the overall &euro;168 million Covid-19 funding package that is supporting return to education.  The overall goal is targeted measures in support of implementation of the national development plan for equity of access 2015-21 and the programme for access to higher education, PATH.  The objective is to attract and retain students from target groups.  We need to safeguard progress towards targets by ensuring successful transition to, and retention in, higher education during the Covid-19 period.</p> <p> Our students are our future and many of them are at a formative stage in their lives.  As we face the extraordinary challenges arising from the pandemic I am confident that each of them will rise to their current challenges as we work through the days and months ahead.  We must play our part to ensure that the student experience will help them to blossom by giving them confidence that the supports are available when they need them.</p> <p> It is not only students who access education who must be safeguarded.  We have a healthy apprenticeship programme in Ireland and it too must be accessible.  It is important that people know apprenticeships are for everyone no matter what age.  There is no age limit.  If a person has a disability, this can and will be accommodated.  Education and training providers offer learning and other supports to apprentices during their training.  Many employers also provide accommodation in the workplace to apprentices with disabilities.  Currently, a total of 535 apprentices have reported one or more disabilities.  They are receiving additional supports, as is appropriate.</p> <p> In line with the programme for Government, a new action plan for apprenticeships is in development to cover the period 2021 to 2025 with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025.  The plan will also set out how the apprentice population will more closely reflect the general population and offer targeted supports for under-represented groups.  Focused and detailed work on developing the plan is under way in my Department through a strongly consultative approach.  Over 60 submissions were received from stakeholders and are being supplemented with feedback from small and medium-sized employers through the regional skills fora and through feedback in the region from 3,500 apprentices through an online questionnaire.  All of this feedback as well as the review of the current position of the pathway findings and recommendations will be used to inform the new action plan to be finalised by year end.</p> <p> I am mindful of the challenges students have faced in respect of accommodation this year due to the financial pressures and the blended learning format of the 2020-21 academic year.  In recent months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the many challenges faced by students at this difficult time.  My Department, in consultation with key stakeholders, will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.  Refund or cancellation policies for student accommodation should be set out in the licence agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance, students should engage with their accommodation providers to see if an arrangement can be reached with regard to a refund.  If it is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the dispute resolution services of the Residential Tenancies Board.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and I have asked our higher education institutions with accommodation to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year as well as flexibility with regard to cancellation and refunds.  I hope the private providers will show some flexibility.  However, it is not within my power or that of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to issue instruction relating to the private rental market.</p> <p> I am acutely aware of the impact the pandemic has had on our students and I am keen to ensure the safety of our students and staff in further and higher education.  The majority of college will be online for this semester.  We are providing financial assistance, as the Minister, Deputy Harris, has outlined through the once-off &euro;50 million fund announced today.</p> <p> Finally, I wish to outline the supports provided to institutions to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This year my Department has brought the total devolved capital grant for higher education institutions for the 2020-21 academic year to &euro;40 million, a significant increase from the &euro;10 million annually provided in recent years.  This additional funding will help our colleges invest in additional works to help protect students and staff as we continue to fight this pandemic.  It will also support institutions in upgrading their campuses and equipment for the long-term.  The funding is expected to advance the development of high-end skills in the technological sector as well as facilitating building improvements to support health and safety works, information and communications technology equipment renewal and energy related upgrades.  The funding forms part of the ongoing capital investment in the higher education sector under Project Ireland 2040.  The 2021 allocation for infrastructure development in the further and higher education sectors, excluding research, is &euro;224.4 million.  This represents an increase of 53% on the &euro;147 million allocated for 2020.  The flexible funding provided through the devolved capital grant by my Department this year complements other large-scale capital investments in the sector and will help expand availability of student places and transform campus infrastructure in the coming years.</p> <p> I wish to speak briefly in respect of funding allocated to the University of Limerick, Mary Immaculate College and the Limerick Institute of Technology under the additional 2020 allocation.  Funding has been ringfenced for access services to assist higher education institutions in responding to the emerging challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Higher Education Authority has provisionally allocated to UL a Covid-19 support package of more than &euro;4.5 million.  Mary Immaculate College has been allocated more than &euro;300,000 and LIT more than &euro;1 million.  These allocations will cover mental health and well-being, ICT support for disadvantaged students, research extensions and a Covid-19 contingency fund for access services for each institution.  This funding is in addition to the recurring funding that each institution receives.  This year the figure for the University of Limerick is at least &euro;77 million, the figure for Mary Immaculate College is at least &euro;21 million and the figure for Limerick Institute of Technology is at least &euro;32 million.</p></speech>

Thousands of tonnes of peat have slid down into the river on the mountain.  This peat will make its way to the Derg river.  It has probably killed thousands of salmon at this stage, ultimately compromising the Mourne and the Foyle river systems.</p>  <p>  This is the culmination of a long planning history at this site where the development has been pushed on against the wishes of the community.  This site was part of a planning application that was initially submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2015 and was refused due to the work of the community highlighting that it was environmentally suspect.</p>  <p>  There is a serious issue regarding how applications are foisted on communities, and this is what we get.  During the planning phase of this wind farm, the local community told the developer that the ground conditions would make this site liable to slippage and it was ignored. </p> <p>The development was taken out of the initial application and applied for again to the board, when it was granted.  It has always been believed that this was just a first step in achieving the whole development.  It has inevitably led to the developer contacting the local community this week to say that he intends to submit an application in the coming months for the rest of the site, which was the original application.  This is blatant project splitting and was not called out by any official organisation.</p> <p> I am raising the issue of Meenbog, but the like has unfortunately been seen at other sites around the country, for example, Derrybrien in County Galway and Drumkeeran in County Leitrim.  At how many other sites will this happen?  Sadly, this is about the Government turning a blind eye to big, wealthy developers.  Local communities cannot rely on the Government to support them and their interests over the interests of developers in such cases.  They know that the Government will use An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure that applications are granted.  To add insult to injury, there is little or no control of developments after they have been given permission.  Developers can do as they please.  Even if planning permission promises to do X, Y and Z to protect the environment, there is no effective control to ensure that they do.  That is the end of the process and no one examines it from there on.  That is wrong.</p></speech>

This happened because of the disturbance of lands during the wind farm's construction.  In south Galway, the State has incurred fines of &euro;10.5 million, and rising, because of a massive landslide during a wind farm's construction.  The European Court of Justice found that Ireland had failed to assess properly the development's environmental effects on the locality.</p>  <p>  In the Delvin, Raharney and Ballivor areas of my constituency of Meath West, Bord na M&oacute;na and Gaeltec Utilities are in the process of applying for planning permission to erect 35 wind turbines ranging in height from 180 m to 200 m, some of the tallest in Europe, with a setback distance from many homes of only four times the height of the turbine and little regard for noise, flicker, the value of people's homes or the environmental effects.  Located beside one of the proposed wind farms is one of Ireland's leading bloodstock farms.  We talk about climate change and climate action, but what happened in Donegal and Galway did more in terms of damaging the climate than those wind farms could ever do to help it.</p>  <p>  If wind farms must be 600 ft to 650 ft tall to get the desired wind speeds, are these areas suitable for such developments?  Will the Minister of State put a hold on wind farm planning applications until there has been a full investigation into what happened in Donegal and Galway so that we avoid another environmental disaster in our areas or elsewhere?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900044#TT00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  We have all been taken aback by it and the scenes we have witnessed are shocking.  My Department and I are aware of last weekend's peat slide near the Meenbog wind farm, which is currently under construction close to Barnesmore Gap south of Ballybofey, County Donegal.  The matter is being actively investigated by a number of statutory agencies led by Donegal County Council, including the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Irish Water, the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and, having regard to the fact that the development is a transboundary project, Derry City and Strabane District Council and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.</p>  <p>  At this early stage, the precise cause of the peat slide is yet to be determined, be it the construction works on the wind farm, weather impacts, other factors or a combination of various elements.  I note Deputy Pringle's mention of the Shass Mountain peat slide, a report on which I have.  Initial investigations into the Meenbog incident by the agencies involved noted that, in addition to road construction works on the wind farm site where the peat slide occurred, there was heavy and persistent rainfall and build-up of water within the peat over the recent period, which may have contributed to the peat slippage.</p>  <p>  Investigations into the cause are ongoing, but the immediate focus of the agencies has been to ensure the putting in place of hardcore berms to prevent further peat slippage, stabilise the peat slippage in the form of dewatering to maintain the peat on site, and minimise impacts on local watercourses.  Once these measures are in place, the agencies will endeavour to determine the precise cause of the peat slide and then deal with breaches, if any, of planning and environmental requirements.</p>  <p>  I should also mention that the developers of the wind farm were requested by Donegal County Council to submit an action plan by yesterday detailing the engineering measures necessary to eliminate or limit the release of further polluting matter from the area where the peat slide occurred, prevent the release of material built up behind the improvised impoundment structure on site, and mitigate against the further dispersal of peat and sediment beyond the confines of the site.</p>  <p>  The wind farm development in question was granted permission through the strategic infrastructure development process operated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Under planning legislation, the decision on whether to grant permission for a strategic infrastructure development, with or without conditions, is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In making decisions on strategic infrastructure development applications, the board is required to have regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, the provisions of the development plan, any submission or observation received and relevant ministerial or Government policies, including guidelines issued by my Department.  The consideration of such applications also involves consideration of the requirements of the EU environmental impact assessment directive and the habitats directive.</p>  <p>  There is a mandatory requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment in respect of wind farm development projects of a certain scale, that is, if they consist of five or more turbines or have a power output greater than 5 MW.  This ensures that all environmental impacts, including potential hydrological impacts, of a proposed development are fully considered and assessed prior to the making of determinations on individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  A detailed environmental impact assessment, incorporating a peat and soil management plan and an assessment of the potential for a peat slide, was submitted as part of the planning application for the Meenbog wind farm to the board.  Arising from the peat slide and in accordance with the peat and soil management plan submitted as part of the planning application, all works on the wind farm have been temporarily ceased with the exception of those that relate to mitigating the impact of the peat slide and reducing the risk of further slides.  Furthermore, I am informed that Donegal County Council, in co-ordination with the Roads Service in Northern Ireland, put in place some temporary road closures in the area on precautionary grounds.  The multi-agency group is scheduled to reconvene today to review matters and further co-ordinate the response.</p>  <p>  I will point out that, as the Deputies are aware, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in respect of a particular case that a planning authority or the board may be concerned with except in specific and extreme circumstances, which do not apply in this instance.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it was the response we expected.  Interestingly, he outlined a long list of agencies and acronyms that are getting involved now.  Where were they during the planning stage?  I would be interested in knowing that.  I would also be interested in knowing what communications Donegal County Council had with the developer prior to what happened.</p>  <p>  There is a simple thing that we can do.  He who pays the piper calls the tune.  The developer got all of the surveys done.  He paid for them to be done.  I have yet to see an environmental impact statement that said the development should not proceed or should only proceed if significant safety procedures were put in place.  If I was paying for it, no one would tell me that I had to do that.  What we can do is decide that a developer should pay a local council to conduct environmental studies.  Perhaps then we will see real change.</p></speech>

I listened to the Taoiseach yesterday when he stated that the future of wind energy was offshore.  I agree with him.</p>  <p>  If turbines need to be 180 m to 200 m tall, which is twice the height of the Spire in Dublin, to get the requisite wind speeds because of the low-lying nature of the lands in question, surely these areas are not right for such developments.  The turbines in the Delvin, Raharney and Ballivor areas will be up to 150 ft taller than the ones in Donegal.  I would like to see the agencies mentioned getting involved in our planning process before it is too late, just as it was in Donegal.  Will the Minister of State address my points, please?</p></speech>

We have an excellent report, which I have read.  It has some very good recommendations that we can learn from.  There is no doubt that weather-related events seem to have had an impact, in particular a very dry spring followed by heavy rain falls in respect of Drumkeeran.</p> <p> As I indicated earlier, the matter is under investigation by a cross-Border multi-agency group. It is important that we allow it to do its work, as we did with Drumkeeran.  Its investigations are at a very early stage and the initial focus will deal with the immediate steps needed to remediate the site and minimise the environmental impacts in a similar manner to Drumkeeran.  It will endeavour to determine the cause of the peat slide and deal with the technical breaches in planning and environmental requirements after that.</p> <p> All works on the wind farm have ceased temporarily arising from the peat slide, with the exception of those that relate to mitigating the impact of the bog slide and reducing the risk of further slides.  I share the view of the Deputies that we need to give serious consideration to the location of wind farms, in particular where they could have a detrimental impact.  Perhaps in some cases we are offsetting the carbon saved with a large release of carbon through huge events such as bog and peat slides.  We need to stabilise and reconstruct our peatlands and boglands because they are, in their own right, probably the most important carbon sinks we have.</p> <p> I take on board the points raised by the Deputies and reassure them that we will continue this investigation and, it is to be hoped, come to a conclusion.  As we said, the report is useful in informing other events but we need to take a very serious look at land use management and its impact in this country.  That is something we are committed to doing in government.</p></speech>

There was almost a race to zone areas suitable for wind farms by local authorities, all of whom were acting with the best of intentions.  Some of the areas zoned are suitable but others are not.  The amount of carbon utilised in constructing wind farms does not render them nearly as effective.</p>  <p>  I will move on to the issue of a pyrite compensation scheme.  As the Minister of State knows, there are a couple of different pyrite schemes in place.  One is a broad scheme dealing with concrete.  One scheme was introduced this summer by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who travelled to Buncrana to announce a new defective concrete blocks scheme in August.  The scheme offers five remedial options.  Separate grant limits apply to each option, ranging from &euro;247,500 for the complete demolition and rebuilding of a dwelling to &euro;49,500 for the demolition and rebuilding of the outer leaf of affected walls only.  Funding is subject to option limits or 90% of the eligible works, whichever is the lesser.</p>  <p>  It is of course welcome that the scheme has been announced for Donegal and Mayo.  However, the problem is not, unfortunately, unique to Donegal and Mayo.  In my constituency, Clare, a number of houses have been found to be essentially crumbling, without exaggerating the matter, as a result of defective concrete blocks.  Owners have had engineers examine the dwellings and it has been found that it is as a result of pyrite in the concrete.</p>  <p>  One manufacturer of concrete blocks in the mid-west, that I do not intend to name in the House, links all of those buildings.  It is an issue which goes beyond Clare.  I understand 35 people are involved in an action group and approximately 33 houses have been identified in Clare.  Unfortunately, there is a belief that the problem extends outside of Clare to other areas in the mid-west because it is a result of concrete blocks from one particular manufacturer.</p>  <p>  If the Government saw fit to fund a scheme like this in respect of Mayo and Donegal, which I welcome, I see no reason whatsoever my constituents and any other constituents in the country who suffer from exactly the same problem should not be treated in exactly the same way by the Government.  It is a matter of basic equality.  I urge the Department to consider extending the scheme to Clare. </p>  <p>  I am raising this as a Topical Issue matter because I asked a parliamentary question of the Department and was told there were no plans to introduce a scheme.  That does not accord with what various Government representatives have said in the constituency.  I hope they are right, that the Minister is actively looking at this issue and that an announcement is imminent.  It is wrong and improper to differentiate between people with the same problem in Mayo and Donegal or in Clare.</p></speech>

It is very worrying for those affected.  The issue came to light in 2013 when significant cracking of external walls was recorded in houses in Donegal and Mayo.  An expert panel was established in 2016 to investigate the incidence and causes of this cracking.  As part of its work, the panel was asked to identify the numbers of dwellings which appeared to be affected by defects in the block work in Donegal and Mayo, to carry out a desktop study, which would include a consultation process with affected homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, industry stakeholders and other relevant parties, to establish the nature of the problem in the affected dwellings, and outline a range of technical options for remediation and the means by which those technical options could be applied;</p><p>The report, which was based on extensive research, investigations and analysis, was published in 2017.  It concluded that the reason for the widespread pattern cracking in the affected dwellings was primarily due to excessive amounts of deleterious materials in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks.  The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica and in Mayo it was primarily reactive pyrite.  In many of the affected dwellings, the problem appears to have been exacerbated by being in geographic areas of severe exposure to the elements and it seemed to be made worse by the extreme weather conditions of the winter we all remember in 2009-2010</p><p>The panel estimated that up to 4,800 private homes and 1,000 social homes in Donegal and 345 private homes and 17 social homes in Mayo could be affected.  It put forward a number of engineering solutions that have been incorporated in the defective concrete blocks scheme.  These range from removal and replacement of the outer leaf of affected walls only to the complete rebuilding of a dwelling.  Varying levels of grants are available depending on the remedial option recommended in the engineer's report or 90% of the eligible costs, whichever is the lesser.  Specific details can be accessed at .</p><p>The Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) Financial Assistance Regulations 2020 came into operation on 31 January 2020 and the scheme has been open for applications since the end of June 2020.  It provides for a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo only to carry out necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to the use of defective concrete blocks.  I must emphasise that it is not a compensation scheme and is very much a scheme of last resort for homeowners who have no other practical options.</p><p>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that a lot of work has gone into investigating and quantifying the extent of the problem in Donegal and Mayo and designing a response to address the issue.  While such a comprehensive analysis is not available for counties outside of Donegal and Mayo, in terms of Clare, departmental officials are in communication with Clare County Council regarding the evidential data requirements.  Any consideration of an extension to the defective concrete blocks grants scheme would require the same rigorous analysis as that carried out in Donegal and Mayo.  Therefore, speculation on any extension is premature at this point.  Again, I thank the Deputy for his interest in this issue.</p></speech>

Nobody could possibly take issue with that.  We have to establish that the problem arises from concrete blocks.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I believe that will be established in the facts of the cases in Clare.  Many of the homeowners have prepared detailed engineering studies.</p> <p> The majority of the homeowners in this instance are retirees and have family homes.  They have worked all their lives and paid the mortgages on them.  Like most people having paid their mortgage, they are retiring on a pension and they just do not have the money for the substantial works required.  It seems to me, having spoken to the people involved, that much of the difficulty became apparent when they insulated their homes, as was the correct thing to do and as was Government policy.  Because of the insulation put between the two layers, dampness built up and the pyrite in the concrete blocks interacted with that dampness, with the result that the walls have started to crumble.  It is not down to the very cold winter, as it may have been in other areas.  By and large - I am not speaking for everybody - it became apparent after they installed insulation.  There is no reason they should not have installed insulation.  In fact, it is recommended, so they were doing the right thing at all times.  Now, through no fault of their own, their homes are crumbling around them.</p> <p> I greatly welcome the fact the Department is liaising with Clare County Council with a view to establishing evidential data.  The Minister of State might confirm that, in the event that those data show that an extension of the scheme is warranted, the Department will not be found wanting.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity for Clare County Council to take the lead and, first, demonstrate that the issues in Clare are, in fact, due to the presence of excessive levels of deleterious materials, whether mica or pyrite, in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks.  Second, the council should quantify the extent of the problem in the area.</p>  <p>  Of assistance to Clare County Council in this regard will be the work completed in collaboration with the Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, and Engineers Ireland.  The NSAI has put in place a protocol for the assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials, namely, IS 465:2018.  Engineers Ireland has established a panel of engineers who have the necessary professional experience and completed specialist training on IS 465:2018.  Working within this framework, Clare County Council may be able to provide the evidential data necessary for the consideration of any extension of the scheme, which would be helpful to the Department in its deliberations.  The Department will continue - I give a commitment to that - working with Clare County Council in this regard to, I hope, reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p></speech>

Several constituents have contacted me this week over concerns that the service could cease at the end of the month.  Patients were told when attending this week that there is uncertainty about the future of the service, and none of those who attended this week was issued with a future appointment.  This problem has festered since the retirement of the dedicated diabetes nurse more than 18 months ago.  I understand she even deferred a decision on her retirement in the hope that the post could have been backfilled before she retired.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, nothing happened, and since then the service has been dependent on other nurses standing in and assisting the consultant.  As a consequence, dates for future appointments started to be pushed out.  First it was three months and it then became four months.  For those who attended this week, it was their first appointment in more than nine months, and now they face the prospect of no future appointments.  This is very difficult for people and especially parents who are trying to manage medication and treatment.  It simply cannot be allowed to continue.  In the event that the service is not fully restored, the only option for the many service users will be to attend Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin, which is simply unimaginable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900046#VV00500"><p>This vacancy was first advertised in December 2019.  This is not a new issue.  The management of the hospital knew this retirement was coming down the line.  In fairness to the nurse, she stayed on to support those families who are heavily reliant on the service and speak incredibly highly of the team in place there.</p>  <p>  I want to put this into perspective.  I spoke to the parent of a child with type 1 diabetes.  The family is absolutely distraught.  While speaking highly of the team, she said the nurse was the glue that held the team together for the family.  She was on the phone when the family went abroad and the child's bloods went out of sync and when she entered puberty, which also knocked her bloods out of sync.  The girl's most recent appointment was in January.  She had another scheduled for June, which was cancelled, and this week she was told that from the end of November, no further service will be available to her.</p>  <p>  This is devastating.  The constituents I spoke to are not just from Longford-Westmeath.  It is also children from Offaly and Laois.  The son of another lady I spoke to ended up having to attend the accident and emergency department due to an insulin overdose.  This is very serious stuff.  The specialist service at the moment cannot be allowed to stop.  It simply cannot be allowed to fail.  It is also the case that children whose diabetes is consistently well maintained are being told they cannot have access to insulin pumps because the service will not be available there any more.  There is no excuse for this happening.  The position of diabetes nurse is one of the toughest to fill.  This position should have been advertised much earlier than it was.  There is talk of possibly interviewing for the post in early December, but the patients have been told there will be no more service from the end of November.</p></speech>

People with diabetes run a greater risk of developing one or more severe health complications that can greatly impact on their independence and quality of life.  According to the HSE, it is estimated that there are more than 200,000 people with diabetes in Ireland.  It is estimated that approximately 33,000 of these have either type 1 diabetes or genetic or secondary causes of diabetes.  The remaining patients have type 2 diabetes.  A significant proportion of these patients remain undiagnosed.  Worryingly, it is expected that the number of people with type 2 diabetes will increase by 60% over the next ten to 15 years.</p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of an increasing prevalence of predominantly type 2 diabetes in the community, the HSE's national clinical programme for diabetes established a national diabetes working group, with the joint involvement of healthcare providers in primary, secondary and tertiary care sectors, to develop a national model of integrated care for type 2 diabetes. The national model of integrated care aims to reduce the proportion of diabetes-related mortality by 10%.  It also aims to reduce diabetes-related morbidity such as blindness and lower amputations.  In respect of paediatric diabetes services, the HSE developed a model of care for paediatrics and neonatology to underpin the delivery of healthcare for children both in the present and into the future.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar has a comprehensive diabetes and endocrinology service which is an integral part of the services provided by the hospital.  This service is supported by a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurse specialists, dieticians and administrative staff.  The service includes a rapid access diabetes service, general diabetes clinics, a young adult clinic, a diabetes in pregnancy clinic, a diabetes foot clinic and a community e-consultation service.  On the face of it, therefore, one might say that everything is perfect, but I take on board both of the Deputies' points about the diabetes nurse manager.</p>  <p>  My understanding, from a supplementary note I have just received, is that Deputy Clarke was correct in saying the position was first advertised on 20 December 2019 but that place was not filled at that time, and then Covid-19 happened.  The position was opened to applicants on 21 September 2020, with a closing date of 5 October 2020.  The interview board has been convened and interviews will take place in the coming weeks.</p> <p>That is the most up-to-date information I have.</p> <p> I appreciate the seriousness of this issue.  For the past four years, always on World Diabetes Day, I was to the fore in raising it in the D&aacute;il.  I am proud to say that, working with the Ceann Comhairle in the previous D&aacute;il, we managed to turn the lights on the right side of Leinster House blue to mark that occasion.  This is an issue that is very close to my own heart and I know how serious it is.  My understanding is that there should not be any cause for worry in regard to the service in Mullingar.  There is a comprehensive diabetes and endocrinology service in place and the recruitment of the person who will be the glue that holds everything together, as Deputy Clarke described it, is currently in process.</p></speech>

I welcome the commitment that the position is being advertised and will be filled.  I hope the delay in filling it will not affect the service in the interim.  We are all well aware that diabetes is a very costly issue for the health service.  The easiest and most effective way to deal with it is through personal management of the illness rather than expensive interventions.  In Longford alone, over a four-year period, there have been 24 cases of lower limb amputation as a direct result of diabetes.  In the same period, there were 124 cases of diabetes patients dealing with severe foot ulcers.  I am concerned that there has been a delay in filling the post but I accept the Minister of State's commitment that the service will not be affected.</p></speech>

Retaining the service at Mullingar makes sense not only from a moral point of view but also from a fiscal perspective.  Children learn very early to manage their diabetes and it is a habit that follows them into adulthood.  When they become adults, that habit reduces the cost to the HSE in terms of the number of hospitalisations and interventions needed.  However, an issue that has cropped up during this period is that there has been a distinct lack of information and no clarity given to parents and patients.  That creates a vacuum where misinformation can take hold and rumour can take over, which causes further stress and pressure for people.  We need a commitment that the service will not be impacted while the recruitment process is ongoing.  Heaven forbid that a nurse is not recruited.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister of State that we are facing an epidemic of diabetes.  I suffered from gestational diabetes.  In a response to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, we were told that there are 26.5 full-time equivalent diabetes nurse positions.  How do we manage an epidemic with that number?</p></speech>

I draw the Deputies' attention to the FreeStyle Libre device that is proving very successful in helping children and young adults to manage type 1 diabetes.  It is not an option to manage diabetes.  Given the prospective increase in the number of people who will be affected by this chronic health condition in the years ahead, it is a necessity.  The HSE has advised that the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar will build on the success of the very reputable diabetes service it currently provides.  Parents are concerned about the future of the service because it is a good service.  The HSE has assured me that a number of qualified applicants have been shortlisted for the position of paediatric diabetic nurse manager and the recruitment process for the post will be expedited to the greatest possible extent.</p>  <p>  Deputies may be interested to know that I received an email today confirming the setting up next week of an all-party committee on diabetes under the chairmanship of Deputy Devlin.  I was formerly chairman of the all-party committee on dementia which had a hugely successful engagement on the issues relevant to its remit.  The Acting Chairman often attended its meetings.  The most important point about all-party committees is that politics are left at the door.  Everybody involved wants to work together to devise the best possible way of affecting change.  I hope Deputies will support the inaugural meeting of the new committee next Tuesday.</p></speech>

The message is not tough enough and it is not cutting through.  The HSE's advertising campaign has become stale, predictable and it is not hitting home with the entire population.  Back in March, we knew very little about Covid-19 or the impact it would have on all of our lives.  The message then was that people should wash their hands, cough into their elbow and protect themselves and others.  After months of upheaval, a great deal of research and development and, unfortunately, more than 2,000 deaths, the message is to wash hands, cough into one's elbow and download the Covid tracker app.  It is stale, predictable and ineffective.</p><p>We can do better than this.  One of our nearest neighbours, Scotland, is doing better.  Its campaign emphasises the frightening ability of the virus to linger unseen.  It shows an asymptomatic woman who accidentally infects her grandfather with Covid-19.  The advertisement depicts the virus as a visible green gunk that transfers from her hands to the cupboard she opens to grab the teabags she uses to make him a cup to tea.  It shows her hugging her grandfather goodbye, oblivious to the damage she has done.  It closes with the stark warning, &quot;Do not pass coronavirus to those you love&quot;.  Australia has embraced very hard-hitting advertisements to ensure its message lands.  One of them begins with the words of a young man who infected his mother with the virus.  He says:</p> <blockquote> 	My  mum is in ICU with Covid.  We visited her a few weeks ago but I didn't know I had Covid.  I had no symptoms. </blockquote>  <p>In a short, sharp, 30-second advertisement, people are encouraged to be Covid safe and to save lives.</p><p>Here in Ireland, we are reminding people that Covid-19 is still a problem and encouraging them to wear face masks and wash their hands.  We can do better than that and we have done better than that.  One need only look to the HSE's QUIT campaign to see how effective advertisements can be.  Everyone in Ireland remembers the man talking to his daughter and promising to quit smoking.  Everyone remembers Gerry Collins.  When he sadly passed away, the HSE told his family that the advertisements in which he featured had helped more than 60,000 people attempt to give up smoking.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has also run hard-hitting campaigns to crack down on speeding and drink-driving.  It knows that the content shocks and scares people but, most important, it changes people's behaviour.  We do not like watching such advertisements but we all hear their message loud and clear.</p><p>Can the same be said of the Covid-9 campaign or, months on, is it white noise to us?  Has it become ineffective?  The RSA's Crashed Lives advertisements were rated by the public as the most influential factor in saving lives on Irish roads.  Can we say the same for the Covid-19 advertisements?  It is time to mix up our messaging and up our game.  It is more important now than ever, as we prepare to reduce restrictions, that we are hitting people with the right message, which is to remain Covid safe in order to safe lives.</p></speech>

She made a number of significant points about the effectiveness of hard-hitting advertisements and whether the ones currently being used have become ineffective at this stage.  As we all know, Covid fatigue has set in and that is a problem.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 is a new, highly infectious disease for which there is no cure and, as of yet, no vaccine, although there was some positive news in this regard earlier in the week.  The main tool we have to protect against the virus is adherence to the public health guidelines.  As the Deputy outlined, those guidelines ask us to wash our hands well and often, practise good cough and sneeze hygiene, wear face coverings in shops and on public transport, stay in one room if we are Covid positive, stay at home if we are a close contact of a confirmed case, physically distance by 2 m from others, and avoid crowds and crowded places.  As the only actions proven to work against the spread of Covid-19, these safe behaviours are the bedrock of the communications programmes of my Department and the HSE.  Throughout the pandemic, my Department has been working with a Covid-19 communications behavioural advisory group, comprising experts in driving behavioural change, to understand key population behaviours and drivers and inform our public communications activities.</p> <p>We all know that the virus has not changed since March.  It has not gone away.  It is still circulating in our community.  After the initial restrictions imposed in spring were eased, disease incidence began to rise as we all began to move around again.</p> <p> Over the past number of months, my Department and the HSE have, in close collaboration, developed numerous advertising campaigns to empower safe behaviours around Covid-19.  These campaigns, broadcast on digital platforms, radio and television and in print media include: Covid-19 symptoms and what to do; Covid tracker app; Covid-19 - cases to self-isolate and close contacts to restrict their movements; HSE Bubble campaign reinforcing the additive effect of the public health advice; the #HoldFirm campaign which addresses the fatigue that the public is feeling with level 5; and the Healthy Ireland building resilience campaign.  The government is also developing a communications campaign to inspire and empower young adults to live safely within the public health guidelines.  This campaign is being developed in consultation with stakeholders representing this cohort.</p> <p> All of this work is supported by regular opinion polling carried out by a research partner, Am&aacute;rach.  This is published weekly on my Department's website and shows the commitment in the advertising strategy to assessing how members of the general public are feeling, not only about the COVID-19 measures but on a range of issues relating to the pandemic.  This ensures the communications strategy has a strong baseline of evidence-based tracking to rely on.</p> <p> Underpinning all of the activity to which I refer is the consistent yellow look and feel of the Department of Health and HSE public health advice.  The distinctive yellow posters and public health logos were a strategic choice.  This branding has become synonymous with trusted public health advice and has been consistently used across all of the above crucial communications work.  However, I take on board the points that the Deputy has made.  People are fatigued with Covid and maybe they are also fatigued with the messaging that we are sending out.  I agree that, previously, hard-hitting advertisements have been very effective.</p></speech>

I would like the Minister of State to work with the HSE to review whether our advertisements are hitting our entire audience because I fear we are not reaching young people.  For many of them, their viewing platforms are social-media based.  They are not all sitting on the couch with their mams and dads waiting for the nine o'clock news to come on.  They are not all tuned in to current affairs programmes that dominate the airwaves.  They do not all consume their shows or their tunes via mainstream channels.  They stream and they share.  They use a variety of platforms to do that - far to many for us to target with our advertising strategy and ones that are not always possible to advertise on - but we know where they consume content and that means we know where to reach them.  All we have to do is target our strategy into social media.</p>  <p>  I recently tabled a parliamentary question seeking the current HSE Covid-19 advertising levels on social media and the numbers were stark.  The HSE has spent &euro;150,000 on online advertising but I do not think it has been spent wisely.  The HSE's social media strategy, in my opinion, is overly reliant on Twitter.  Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and Snapchat together only account for half of the HSE's activity on Twitter.  Are we hitting our full audience?  That is a legitimate question because that is marketing 101.  There is no point in targeting our message at one sector of society and leaving out the people who are most likely to be out and about in the community.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State know how many posts the HSE has put up on TikTok?  It put 1,300 up on Twitter, so how many would the Minister of State think it would have posted on TikTok - arguably the most popular app amongst young people?  Ten is the number of posts the HSE posted on TikTok.  Are we even trying?</p></speech>

I welcome all the input on what is an evolving communications programme.  I thank the Deputy because she has put a huge amount of work into preparing for this debate and pointing out where she feels there are some shortcomings in the advertising campaign.</p>  <p>  From the outset of this pandemic, the communication objective, as guided by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has been to build trust in the public health advice through open and transparent communication.  My Department and the HSE are committed to continuing the campaigns that have been so effective in driving down the incidence of Covid in our communities.  From the early campaigns focused on at-risk groups, proactive actions individuals can take to encouraging people to visit their GPs and emergency departments, it is clear that this considered messaging is working.</p>  <p>  I cannot overstate how much the response to this disease is in our own hands.  The main tool we have to help protect against the virus is adherence to the public health guidelines but I take on board the points the Deputy has made in respect of the &euro;150,000 online advertising budget, the ratio of posts, for example, as between Twitter and TikTok, and the amount of young people who use the latter platform and others mentioned.  I will certainly feed back the Deputy's information and data to the advertising section of the Department and the HSE.  I again thank the Deputy for the time she has spent on this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900048#XX00700"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall take note of the Report of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response entitled 'Special Committee on Covid-19 Response &ndash; Final Report', copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 8th October, 2020. </blockquote>  <p>I thank the Business Committee for scheduling a debate on the final report of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, which I had the honour of chairing earlier this year.  Before commencing with the recommendations, I would like to thank all members of the committee.  There were 19 of us who worked through the summer.  I see that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, both of whom were members of the committee before they were appointed to office, are present and I thank them.  They were replaced on the committee by other Deputies.  I thank all of the members of the committee for the courtesy with which we generally carried out our work.  It would be wrong to say that there was unanimity on everything - that is not the nature of a committee which has representatives from all parties and all groupings in the House - but there was a unanimity that we would proceed in a collegiate and courteous manner.  That was reflected right up to the end, which I, personally, am happy about.</p><p>There were a number of recommendations agreed.  Obviously, different members of and different political groupings on the committee had a different emphasis with regard to the recommendations but at the end of the day, it was a consensus document.  Even the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, who was a member of the committee, would have an emphasis on certain recommendations over others but that is the nature of a committee and we agree a consensus document at the end of it.</p><p>There is a tendency in this House - I am sure it is not unique to this Legislature - to have committees look at various issues and then say that they have been examined and we will park them.  I think everybody will agree we certainly do not have that luxury with Covid-19.  It is the issue which dominates every sector of Irish economy now and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The best way to proceed is to outline in brief the recommendations of the committee.  The first recommendation was:</p> <blockquote> 	That a public inquiry be established to investigate and report on all circumstances relating to each individual death from Covid-19 in nursing homes.  Draft terms of reference should be presented for consideration by the Joint Committee on Health by the end of 2020. </blockquote>  <p>It is obvious that time is ticking in that regard, if we are to proceed in that regard.  That is clear to me, and I think it was clear to all committee members.  As Chair, one of the more difficult things that I had to do was not to have an emphasis on individual deaths or on individual nursing homes in which there were deaths because clearly there is a huge void in people's lives and they need and deserve answers as to what happened.  It was not the role of the committee to look into that in anything like the detail required.  Obviously, it was not the role of this committee to make findings of fault with regard to anybody.</p> <p>It may be the case that there was not fault but equally it may be the case that there was.  We, as a Legislature, need to ensure those answers are provided to grieving relatives.  Of course, we know a lot more about Covid-19 now than we did then.  Any investigation must look at what was known or ought to have been known at the time particular decisions were made.  This includes decisions around discharging large numbers of elderly people in particular from acute hospitals into nursing homes.  We cannot judge actions by what we now know, only by what was known or ought to have been known at the time.<br/><br/>A second recommendation was that a review should be undertaken into the impact of privatisation on Ireland&rsquo;s nursing homes to ascertain its impact on nursing levels, expertise and qualifications of staff, medical and other facilities available in older people&rsquo;s care settings and the adequacy of funding to deliver optimal outcomes.  In that regard, it is important that that review take place to see what the impact the of undoubted increase in the size of the private sector has been.  It is also important to bear in mind that there were no disproportionate deaths.  Each death was tragic; as somebody who lost a relative at the start of this year in a nursing home, thankfully before Covid-19 arrived, I know what the void in one&rsquo;s life is like.  There was no evidence before the committee and it was specifically probed for, of any sort of disproportionality.  The proportion of deaths in private nursing homes versus public nursing homes was pretty much the same as the proportion of residents in private nursing homes versus public ones.<br/><br/>The third recommendation was &quot;That the State develop a system of testing and contact tracing with a turnaround time for testing that does not exceed 24 hours, and immediate tracing ... thereafter.&quot;  I will allow anybody else to speak on this issue because, unfortunately, we as a State have not succeeded in that regard.  Contact tracing in particular has been problematic and it was raised repeatedly at the committee.  There were three reports released before the final one, one of which was an interim report on testing and tracing that was released just before the summer vacation at the end of July.  This issue was highlighted in that report.  There was also an interim report on nursing homes which highlighted that we need to move away from a care model of people being cared for in congregated settings and towards a model of caring for people in their communities.  Covid-19 has shown up all of the structural weaknesses of society, from problems we have in the education sector with regard to the infrastructure of our schools etc., to the fact that we have an over-reliance on congregated settings.  I do not expect that will be solved overnight but policy needs to be oriented in that direction as we move forward.<br/><br/>In parallel there was also an expert group looking at Covid-19 in nursing homes established by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  It produced a report which came up with broadly similar recommendations to those the committee had in its interim report.  Indeed, the committee's fourth recommendation was:&quot;That an implementation plan be drawn up for the recommendations contained in the Report of the Covid-19 Nursing Home Expert Panel with a requirement for six-month progress reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas.&quot;<br/><br/>There was a further recommendation that the Government make provision for a statutory sick pay scheme to cater for low-paid workers such as those in nursing homes and meat plants, and make Covid-19 notifiable disease.  It is important to say that Covid-19 is now a notifiable disease but the first matter is one on which considerable progress remains to be made.  I am aware the Government has said it will look towards establishing statutory sick pay by the end of 2021.  The Labour Party has been instrumental in pushing that and I thank Deputy Duncan Smith for attending the debate tonight.<br/><br/>There was a recommendation that: </p><blockquote>	A full review of the regulatory frameworks in respect of HIQA and the HSA should be undertaken and include the adequacy of both the powers of and resources available to each body to carry out  reviews.  The review should also establish the precise ground under which regulations were removed that required (i) the &lsquo;person in charge&rsquo; of a nursing home to have formal gerontology qualification and (ii) the requirement for the presence of a registered nurse on duty at all times ... </blockquote> <p>A further recommendation we looked at in the interim report was that a medical officer be appointed in respect of each nursing home because there are medical officers in respect of some HSE facilities though not all.  It is almost an accident or a curiosity of their history and how they evolved.  In some nursing homes there are various residents who are still under the care of their GPs.  That GP has a duty of care to his patients but only to them, rather than to the broader community.  That is something that is important in the context of a pandemic and may have broader ramifications in treating influenza.  Thankfully, the nursing home in which my mother passed away has, to date, avoided Covid-19 but every year a number of patients die of influenza.  What we learn from Covid-19 does have repercussions for the treatment of other respiratory ailments.<br/><br/>The seventh recommendation was that &quot;The State should phase out support for facilities where residents do not have adequate self-isolation facilities and it should accelerate the capital works in all publicly owned facilities to ensure that all residents can live in self-contained units.&quot;  That is an important thing, as is the fact that moneys are paid in respect of new residents in nursing homes which have failed HIQA quality control standards.<br/><br/>There is another recommendation which is very important.  It calls for: &quot;An &lsquo;Inquire, Record and Report Inquiry (pursuant to section 7 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013)&rsquo;...&quot; into the operation of meat processing plants, including &quot;the use of agents to procure workers, to include the State&rsquo;s response in terms of protecting workers, [and] ensuring necessary food supplies to the general population, as well as ensuring fairness for primary producers&quot;.  This is because we know that at that time, meat plants were a hotspot of Covid transmission in Ireland, as they were in every other country.  It seems we in Ireland have a unique relationship with meat plants, a sort of light touch regime.  The Minister for Health may not agree with me but that is certainly my view on it and we need to look at its operation throughout this.<br/><br/>The following recommendation is a very important one, namely, &quot;Data relied upon by NPHET, its modelling code, as well as international evidence relied upon in making its recommendations ... should be published in full and a peer review commissioned.&quot;  The purpose of this is not to undermine NPHET in any way.  However, NPHET is all about science, and we are told that this is all about science but the essence of science, be it the establishment of a vaccine or be it a modelling code, is peer review.  The editor of <i>The Lancet</i>came out with a quite interesting tweet regarding some of the very recent developments on vaccines which could herald very good news but until they are peer-reviewed, we do not know.<br/><br/>Those are the main recommendations.</p></speech>

The committee&rsquo;s work has been invaluable in gathering information, questioning witnesses and in promoting a greater degree of understanding of this new virus.</p>  <p>  I am sure the House will also join me in thanking the many witnesses who made themselves available to the committee to assist it in its work, particularly in the context of the very difficult circumstances everyone has been labouring in this year.  I thank the committee's secretariat which has the onerous task of making us all look good.  We do our best to help it with it but I have no doubt that in this case the secretariat worked as hard as it always does in supporting members.  I note that while I was a founding member of the committee I sadly did not make it onto the Facebook page for the committee.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I have been disappeared by the secretariat in the report but I certainly thoroughly enjoyed my time on the committee.</p>  <p>  When the committee commenced its work in May we in Ireland were slowly coming out of the first wave of Covid-19, which had a very substantial impact right across the country and as we all know it led to a very significant loss of life, particularly amongst our older population.  As the committee submitted its report in early October we were starting to see an increase in cases emerging again.</p> <p>Thankfully, however, the measures that have been taken and the lessons learned during the first wave of the virus have enabled us, as a country, to drive down the levels of infection once more.  In fact, we are seeing more than a 90% reduction in fatalities in the second wave compared with the first.  This means that for every ten people who tragically lost their lives in the first wave, one life has been lost in the second.  By any measure, while every single loss of life is one too many, that level of life saved is an extraordinary improvement.  I pay tribute to our healthcare workers, our nursing home workers and every family and person who has done so much to keep people safe and alive.  Seeing more than 90% reduction in the level of fatality, which ultimately is what it is all about, is not down to any one person or group of people; it is a nation working together, shoulder by shoulder, to look out for each other and keep each other safe and it has worked incredibly well and the nation deserves thanks for that.</p> <p> With regard to our healthcare workers, I have just come from a visit to St. Vincent's University Hospital where I met the critical care, emergency medicine and laboratory teams.  These people and the dedicated professionals and healthcare workers throughout Ireland have been working night and day.  They have been innovating, learning and adapting at incredible speed in response to Covid.  I acknowledge once more the work they have done.</p> <p> It is clearly very important to focus on what we can do better but it is worth reflecting on the fact that we, as a nation, have managed to suppress this virus in recent weeks.  Our numbers have increased in the past week, and that is something we all need to work on, but right now we still have the third lowest rate of Covid per 100,000 population anywhere in Europe.  For every 100,000 people in Ireland, 114 tested positive in the past 14 days.  Many European countries are seeing multiples of this.  In France it is 789 and in Austria it is 1084.  In Italy, which suffered so terribly during the first wave, it is 799.  A number of European states have seen their hospital systems at maximum capacity and some countries have had to send patients to Germany for treatment when their own critical care resources were exhausted.  In Switzerland, the number of people in intensive care now from Covid is higher than it was during the first wave.  By any international standard, the people and healthcare workers of Ireland have done an incredible job in adapting and learning how to push this virus back and keep each other safe.</p> <p> The rise of the virus, of course, is why the Government has taken such extensive measures throughout the pandemic to limit transmission when it was required in order to ensure that we protected lives.  We did not have a situation in either the first or the second wave whereby our hospitals and critical care units were overrun.  However, many families here have been scarred by the pandemic and I want to take the opportunity to recognise their loss and pay tribute to them and to recognise those who have lost their lives.  As of yesterday, and as we all know, the number of fatalities from Covid-19 exceeded 2,000.  That was a very sobering moment.  As well as this very large loss of life, while some of those who have acquired Covid are alive, they are suffering from what is called long Covid.  Our understanding of this is still evolving but the medical literature is replete with information on the lingering and often debilitating effects of the disease.</p> <p> The report of the special committee contains a number of recommendations for the future design and provision of care for older people and I have to say it is a very welcome development.  A significant proportion of those who died were nursing home residents.  I have met some bereaved families and I know many of them are looking for answers.  I am sure they are all looking for answers.  They deserve answers.  Many factors have to be considered, I am looking at the best way to get them the answers they want, need and deserve.  Many of the challenges identified in the committee's report are reflected, as its Chairman said, in the nursing home expert panel report published in August.  Immediately following the publication of the expert panel's report the Minister of State and I moved to establish the implementation committee, and this includes an interagency oversight team and a reference group.  Work is progressing on the implementation of the recommendations and I acknowledge the leadership role the Minister of State is taking on this absolutely essential work.</p> <p> It is important to appreciate that approximately half of our nursing homes, and the Chairman of the committee made a similar point, have remained free of Covid-19.  Recognising the difficult landscape that Covid 19 has presented for long-term residential care settings, a series of enhanced measures have been agreed to support these settings and they are being actively monitored and implemented by HIQA and the HSE.  Clinical guidance, personal protective equipment, PPE, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control, training and quite considerable financial support have been provided to the public and private nursing home sector.  In addition to public health outbreak control teams, multidisciplinary clinical supports are in place at community healthcare organisation, CHO, level through 23 Covid-19 response teams, as well as outbreak control team, which respond to outbreaks as they occur.</p> <p> The committee's report also very rightly focuses on testing and tracing and there was an interim report to this end.  The more we work to push for the most extensive, quickest and comprehensive testing and tracing system the better.  Our testing programme has expanded considerably in recent times and we are now up to a capacity of 140,000 polymerase chain reaction, PCR, tests per week which, by international standards, puts us right up there as one of the highest in the world.  So far, there have been 1.8 million tests and we continue to undertake serial testing of all staff in nursing homes and food production, while also performing mass school testing where it is deemed appropriate.  The number of contact tracers has risen significantly and from mid-September to now we have seen an approximately 2.5 to three fold increase.  I want to see contact tracing being as quick as possible and as deep as possible, in terms of forward and backward contact tracing, so we can identify as quickly as possible the sources and deploy the outbreak control teams, find who is affected, support them, get them tested and isolate them.</p> <p> Most encouragingly, as colleagues are aware, we have seen the emergence of very positive results on at least two of the vaccine candidates in development.  I caution everyone, of course, as the public health experts keep cautioning me when I get excited by the results we are seeing, that a good deal of work, including some clinical validation from our own side, still needs to be done before we fully understand the effectiveness of the vaccines, for how long they may provide immunity, whether their effectiveness differs in different age groups and so forth.  For now, we have to rely on the tools immediately available to us, which are the use of face masks, social distancing protocols, respiratory hygiene and complying with the other public health measures.  These still remain vital.  If we do these things it gives us the best chance of continuing to suppress the virus.  I urge all Deputies to continue to promote the public health messaging that is so important.  I recognise the work and advocacy everyone here and every Deputy has shown and continues to show in an all-Oireachtas approach to supporting the public health measures and I thank them all very much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900050#ZZ00200"><p>I replaced the Minister of State on the Covid-19 committee when she was appointed to her role.  I thank the Chairman of the committee who did an excellent job.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the report, we have been a little premature bringing the work of the committee to a close.  We could probably have done with it being in place for longer, particularly in light of how things are with the virus.  We have seen Covid-19 cases increase as communities reopen, even though we are in lockdown.  I am troubled to see the rise in the number of cases.  The Minister referred to this matter.</p> <p>I am especially concerned about the figures suggesting that funerals could be the super-spreader event.  My heart breaks for those who have had to watch from afar as their loved ones got sick and passed away from this lethal virus.  They have not been able to celebrate the life or mourn the death of their loved one, surrounded by family and friends, as is so typical of an Irish funeral.  The virus has stripped us of a vital part of our grieving process.  If someone in our community passes away, we all want to show them the respect they deserve and we want to be there for their funeral.  Of course, we want to take precautions by wearing masks and so on but, for Irish people, it is part of our culture that we always go to funerals and we like to be there to support people.  That is a big thing for us.</p> <p> The Chairman went through the data and I have been going through them myself.  The data on contacts and outbreaks are forms of information which we should have in a safe place in order to investigate them, and that place is the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  This is why I wonder whether we should have kept the committee going, and perhaps the Minister needs to consider this.  I found the committee very informative when we were learning so much about this disease, but we still have a lot to learn.  I welcome and applaud all of the advances which have taken place in regard to vaccines, and I want to especially mention the Irish companies and scientists working hard in this area.</p> <p> We know we will be living with Covid but we cannot live with lockdowns which threaten our economy, although the number of cases is still rising.  In a few weeks, hopefully, we will move from level 5 to perhaps level 3 or level 2, although we are not sure yet what level it will be.  For me, the biggest issue dealt with by the special committee was testing and tracing and the speed at which this could be done, which was the greatest concern for all of us.  The Minister said that the quicker testing and tracing is done, the better.  Given the outbreaks in nursing homes and meat plants, we need to make sure we also have outbreak management.  We need a management team and we need to be stronger on that issue because it is so important we do not have big outbreaks like those that happened before.</p> <p> We cannot afford another lockdown.  If this one does not work, we risk losing businesses, losing the public and losing lives as well.  One issue I found challenging in the committee was access to information, and I know the public found this too.  We have had huge challenges.  While this report can only make recommendations based on hindsight, I know all of us will agree we were all learning.  The figures today are horrific, with 2,000 people having died from Covid and many families affected by that.  Even where people got Covid but did not pass away, thank God, many are severely affected and have pains and aches, and they are not able to work.  The side-effects of Covid have been very difficult and people are struggling.</p> <p> We are living in a different world.  All of us in the House have a duty of care to the Irish people and a duty to come in here and work together.  The worst that can happen is if we do not work together to find solutions.  We need to work as a team and do our best to make sure we do not have any more deaths from Covid.  That is the one thing I have learned from the Covid committee.  We were an all-party group and I believe we worked well together.  We were there to make sure we did our best to support the Irish people, to give as much information as possible and to try to help in any way we could.  We were all contacted by businesses and by different groups.  The economy was affected and businesses came to us, telling us they were not going to survive.  We had to be very careful on that issue.  We have to make sure that, when we get a vaccine, which I firmly believe we will, we are in a situation where the economy survives and we have jobs for people.  We have to be very careful of that.</p> <p> I thank the witnesses who came before the committee and gave us the best information they could.  Covid knows no boundaries.  Covid does not know political parties.  Covid does not know us and we do not know it.  However, the one thing we have learned from Covid is that we live from day to day.  Every day, I listen to the news to get the figures to know how many deaths there have been and how many are linked to certain areas and to my own area of Carlow.  That is the way our life has gone.  As we are trying to live with this, we have to try to live with it in a way that ensures people are not affected by it.  That is the duty of care we have.</p> <p> One of the biggest Covid issues for me was the hospital appointments missed, the disability services that were not open and the respite that could not be attended.  There was such a knock-on effect.  Nonetheless, all of us in the House were trying to do our best in our contacts with Ministers and in trying to get the information out there.  Perhaps we need to look at our messaging and advertisements, and to see if we can be more proactive.  However, I know everyone is trying to do their best.  All of us in the House are trying to work in our constituencies to make sure we can help with regard to information.  Whether it is for a pandemic unemployment payment or otherwise, all of us are trying to make sure we do our best.</p> <p> Mental health is an issue I am concerned about in the context of Covid-19.  Many people I have spoken to recently are very down and very affected by this.  We do not know what is going to happen.  Hopefully, when we move out of level 5 to lower level restrictions, we can get back as much normality as possible.  Christmas is coming and we have to be positive for the people of Ireland.  We are in level 5 for a reason, and that is to make sure we save lives.  This is what the Covid-19 committee was about.  It was about information and asking people to take self-responsibility.  All of us in the House and outside it have the responsibility to make sure we play our part and do our best to ensure no one we know in our areas dies.</p> <p> Everybody has gone through such an horrific time.  To me, 2020 will be remembered, in my time anyway, as one of the worst years in history, when we were trying to learn about and deal with something we never thought would come.  Earlier in the year, we were all getting ready for a general election.  We then got elected and then Covid came, a disease that none of us knew anything about.  All of us on the committee played our part as best we could to engage with our own areas and constituencies, while working at a national level through the Ministers to make sure we delivered what we could.  This is about information and recommendations, but if we learned one thing from this, it is that all of us are here to represent the people of Ireland.  We need to do that in unity.  We need to work together to make sure we have no more deaths in Ireland and that we look after the Irish people. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900051#AAA00300"><p>I welcome everybody to the Chamber and, in particular, the Chairman, Deputy McNamara, who did a very good job over the course of the months that the committee sat.  I cannot say I agreed with everything the Chairman said before, during and after the publication of the report, but he was a very diligent Chairman.  It was a very useful committee that sat at a very important time, and it played a very important role in terms of guiding the work of the Oireachtas at a crucial time.  I commend the Chairman on his work and all of the committee members.</p>  <p>  It is important for us to say it is too early to look back yet.  There has to be an element of look-back but the virus is still present, contagious and spreading and the cases are still too high.  Next week, we will have a debate in this Chamber on where we should be after 1 December in regard to restrictions.  I welcome the debate but it has to be said that it will come before NPHET advises the Government.  That will be key, in my view, to determining what we should do or not do.  People want a good Christmas and they deserve the very best Christmas we can give them, but we also have to be honest that it is not going to be the same as last year or the year before.  It is going to be different but let us make it the best one we possibly can.  However, that will throw up all sorts of issues, which I am sure we will debate next week.</p>  <p>  When we look at Covid, and take a step back and look at the committee's report, there are lessons we will have to learn and changes that will have to be made.  I want to deal with a number of issues and my colleagues will deal with others.  The first is nursing homes and the whole issue of care for older people and the elderly.  We saw there were real problems in nursing homes right across the State.  Far too many people died in nursing homes, some in very tragic circumstances where they did not see their families before they died.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>We know that issues relating to clinical governance and the lack of adult safeguarding protections that I believe we, as an Oireachtas, should advance and which I spoke to the Minister about need to be delivered upon.  Many reports have been done on nursing homes and we have to implement the recommendations.  We will also have to consider setting up processes that will allow families to get closure by finding out exactly what happened to their loves ones in nursing homes.  That will be an important part of the future when we progress.</p> <p> We should also learn lessons about hospital capacity.  We were caught in terms of ICU and acute bed capacity because the recommendations made in 2009 on ICU and hospital capacity were not implemented.  Let us make sure we never again get into the situation where we do not have enough ICU capacity.  I know we never got to a stage where there were not enough beds but we sailed far too close to the wind in that regard.</p> <p> Public health departments and specialists came front and centre, possibly for the first time in terms of how the public saw the work that they do.  They do very important work.  There are equal pay issues that need to be addressed, both for medical scientists and public health specialists.  That is an important area.</p> <p> On test and trace, we will have to look at a permanent unit that will examine how we respond to a pandemic.  We are not out of the woods yet.  This virus is still around but, hopefully, the vaccine will come on-stream and at some point we will be out of the woods.  We may be presented in the future with a different type of virus that might be better or worse in terms of the impact it will have on society.  We need to be prepared for that and learn all the lessons we most certainly have learned on the back of this pandemic.  Truth be known, we are still learning.</p> <p> On the Covid vaccine and the number of different trials, I share the Minister's enthusiasm but also his caution in that regard.  There is a good deal of work to be done.  The regulators have to certify the different formulas and types of vaccines being pursued.  What has been presented is good news.  The efficacy rates are very high, if the press releases are to be believed, but there is much work to be done.  This will be the most ambitious vaccine ever distributed in the history of the State.  We obtained 1.3 million doses of the influenza vaccine.  This will be multiples of that, at least 3 million and possibly 4 million.  It will raise distribution and administration issues.  Are GPs and pharmacies equipped to be able to roll it as quickly as it will need to be rolled out?  Do we need to consider pop-up centres, for example, across the State, as we did with testing?  Do we need to train staff to make all of that happen?  Those are the questions the high-level task force being put in place needs to deal with to make sure the infrastructure is in place because the Minister knows that, in all the current trials, most of the companies have already produced the vaccines.  There are billions of doses across all of those companies so as soon as they are certified, it will be a case of giving the green light and it will be all systems go.  We need to be prepared for that.  I hope to debate that issue with the Minister in the time ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900052#BBB00200"><p>I will refer briefly to a number of issues but I will start by thanking the Chairman, the secretariat and all of the staff who oversaw the implementation of the special committee and brought us together in a very challenging time.  In the early days, it must have been very tough for them to figure out the logistics of how we would meet but they did it and facilitated what I believe to be a very important committee.</p>  <p>  I will highlight a number of issues and focus on areas of particular difficulty as we move into the next phase, one of which is the restarting of non-Covid care.  We can all agree that Covid-19 exposed many of the challenges and deficiencies in the health system.  I will touch on three issues - direct provision, waiting lists and, briefly, the issue of image-based abuse.  Potentially hundreds of women and girls have been impacted by the leaking and sharing of images of them online without their consent.  We know that will have a serious impact on their mental health.  We see references in the report to the impact of the suspension of ongoing support services.  We know that Women's Aid has a help line, 1800 314900, which is extremely important and operates 24 hours a day, but those women will need ongoing support.  I want to put that issue on the Minister's agenda so that a facility can be put in place to ensure the mental health supports that are needed can be provided both while the Garda investigation is ongoing and in its aftermath.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the restarting of non-Covid care.  The waiting lists the Minister and I discussed on many occasions in this House did not go away.  If anything, we know they got much worse but I was shocked by how bad things had got when I was sent a letter from one of my constituents.  It is a referral letter from the HSE for a child, which states that it received the referral for the above-mentioned child to its early intervention team.  It further states that this was discussed by its referral committee and that it is accepting the child for an intake assessment but that, at present, there is a 44-month wait.  This is a young child in Donabate who needs an urgent intervention.  He has been assessed as needing early intervention.  It is a bit of a joke to call it early intervention if the child has to wait 44 months for it.  These are the challenges that will have to be faced.  The family fully understand the impact Covid-19 has had on the health service and waiting lists but I want to be able to tell them there is a plan in place and the 44-month waiting time referred to in the letter can be significantly improved upon.  We cannot continue to call it early intervention while children are left waiting for 44 months.  All of that time is lost when this child needs support to be able to engage in school and in the community when we get back to some sort of normality.  What will normality look like to a child who has to wait 44 months before early intervention takes place?  As I said, we should stop calling it early intervention.</p>  <p>  One of the other issues we raised as a committee was direct provision.  I raise an issue that made my blood run cold when I heard it.  Yesterday, in Balseskin reception centre, a man asked for mental health support.  He was put out.  He slept outside last night.  Today, thanks to one of the people from the fantastic group known as Fingal Communities Against Racism, an ambulance was called at 2.30 p.m.  The ambulance did not arrive until 6 p.m.  This man is severely distressed.  One of the issues we discussed as a committee was the particular challenges faced by people in direct provision.  We all agreed that it was awful and that changes had to be made.  We all shook our heads.  Collectively, we decided that this was not good enough and for a very brief period, people actually thought about the lived experience and the reality of what it is like for people living in direct provision.  I thought I knew a little bit about it but this has shocked me.</p>  <p>  I hope we can learn the lessons contained in the report.  I fear we will not but I genuinely hope we do and that we can take what we have learned and use it to build something better post-Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900052#BBB00300"><p>I join my colleagues in thanking the special committee, its Chairman and all the staff who were involved in producing this report.  While I was not a member of the committee, I was able to attend its meeting on mental health.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has highlighted all the frailties of years of underfunding and mismanagement across Departments, be that housing, health, small business, transport, education, community infrastructure and so on.  I could go on.  There is not a debate in this Chamber on any issue that does not raise the impact of decisions we make here on people's mental health.  Covid-19 has shone a spotlight on the shortcomings of our mental health services.  The Minister does not have to take my word for that.  He only has to read the statements of the witnesses who appeared before the special committee's meeting on mental health.</p>  <p>  What the report fails to say is that during the special committee's meeting on mental health, the CEO of the Mental Health Commission said that the mental health system in Ireland is not fit for purpose and is out of date.  He went on to tell the committee members that there is a need to invest properly in community services and to stop making excuses.  Other witnesses told the committee that we need to start investing properly in services for children or they will not improve to the degree they should at this stage and that mental health needs should be put higher on the agenda.</p> <p>This is a damning indictment of how mental health services have become the Cinderella of the health system.  We are 14 years on from A Vision for Change and have moved on to Sharing the Vision.  Ireland now finds itself in the middle of a pandemic that has placed additional demands on already overstretched mental health services.  The Covid pandemic is a time of worry, anxiety and concern and it can add to existing mental health conditions or cause people to experience mental health issues for the first time.  My phone has not stopped since this morning with people concerned about the impact Covid is having on their mental health, housing, waiting lists and other issues.</p> <p> This system was already at breaking point prior to Covid.  We had waiting lists to access care, limited out-of-hours supports and access to crisis intervention, an over-reliance on acute care for adults, a lack of mental health services in our community, children still being admitted to adult units, an increasing use of restrictive practices and an over-reliance on NGOs to provide the services that the Government should provide in the first place.</p> <p> We need to develop at 24-7 crisis service and rehabilitation and recovery teams in the community.  That would address the issue that my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, raised.  Mental health issues do not finish at 5 p.m. on a Friday and magically reappear at 9 a.m. on a Monday morning.  We need to place mental health on the same level as physical health.  For example, if one cuts one's head and goes to the emergency department, one will receive the appropriate treatment and aftercare that one needs when and where one needs it.  However, if one presents at the same hospital with an issue that is going on inside one's head, one will not necessarily receive the same treatment.  The follow-up care is often non-existent and too many people are falling between the gaps.</p> <p> Next Thursday, I will be introducing Second Stage of the Mental Health Parity of Esteem Bill 2020, which aims to address the balance between physical healthcare and mental healthcare.  Parity of esteem between mental and physical health will provide a holistic, whole-person response to everyone in need of care and support, with physical and mental needs treated equally.  The relationship between physical and mental health is such that poor mental health is linked with higher risks of physical health problems and poor physical health is linked with poor mental health.  If this change in attitude happens at the Minister's level, it will filter down to all levels of society and we will see the stigma often associated with mental health conditions lessened.  We need to break the stigma once and for all.  The effect of integration of mental health services with physical health services is particularly important.  This Bill will place a duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity to ensure that all organisations in our health system meet parity obligations regarding mental health.  Next Thursday, I hope that all parties and none will support the Bill moving to Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900053#CCC00200"><p>I thank the clerk to the committee and the secretariat for all the support that they gave us.  It was my first committee in this House and it was a learning and hothousing experience for me.  I thank the Chair of the committee, Deputy McNamara, who chaired the meetings throughout the committee's lifetime.  It was very fair.  We operated under tight time and speaking constraints.  Not only did members respect that but if people were deep into questioning, the Chair was good at allowing time when needed and pulling it back.  None of us, however experienced Deputies may be, have experienced a committee that operated under such tight time constraints.</p>  <p>  I will pick up on the story that Deputy O'Reilly told about Balseskin direct provision centre.  It is partly under the Minister for Health's remit and partly under that of the Minister for Justice.  That matter was brought to my attention today.  I rang the centre and said I am a Deputy for the area, said that I understood there was a gentleman outside who was in distress, and asked how I could help.  I was not adversarial because I knew there was a gentleman in a crisis situation outside.  I was told that whatever happens outside the gate was nothing to do with the person in the centre and to ring the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS.  I rang IPAS and got a voice message service that did not take any voice messages.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Reilly said, thanks to the work of Fingal Communities Against Racism and people related to that group, an ambulance was called and eventually that gentleman was taken into our health system.  Hopefully he is getting the care that he requires.  Not only did that highlight a failing of our direct provision system, it highlights a lack of care.  I know that in Ireland, if people knock on someone's door when in distress, someone will call an ambulance and help.  To think that one would knock on the door of an institution funded by the State and that someone would not even make a phone call for an ambulance is distressing.  I am getting away from the substance of the debate, which was not my intention, but it is worth raising and I would appreciate if the Minister could bring it to the attention of the Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor raised a point which I have been reflecting on in the last number of weeks about whether the committee finished its work too early.  I felt that the committee should have ended at the time and am on record as saying it, but perhaps I had a naive view of what the sectoral committees would be able to do with regard to Covid.  I regret that the committee ended because we are finding it difficult, amid the D&aacute;il schedule, to keep a focus on the different elements of Covid that continue to dominate our lives and the lives of our citizens and country.  We still have space for the committee.  One cannot put the toothpaste back in the jar, as they say, but that is a reflection I have since the committee ended its work.  It is a reflection on the great work that the committee did.  I learned a lot from my colleagues on the committee about rigorous questioning, getting information and compiling a report.  The recommendations in this report should not gather dust.</p>  <p>  A microelement of this is about the aviation industry.  We had an aviation task force that delivered results and recommendations about the aviation industry in July.  Those recommendations were not acted on.  The recommendations in this committee report are much fuller, broader and deeper, and need to be acted on.  The Minister knows that.  I am glad to see that the Government seems to be picking up the baton on sick pay.  Nursing homes have been mentioned.  There is a deep sense that work needs to be done as per the recommendations of this report.  I hope that is undertaken as and when it is appropriate, and in as speedy and sensitive a way as possible.</p>  <p>  On testing and tracing, what happens in early 2021 will be key.  I was encouraged by what the Minister said about resourcing testing and tracing.  He mentioned that we will have a two and a half to threefold increase in that.  I hope it is enough.  The Minister mentioned forward and retrospective testing, an area on which I think we will need to focus in early 2021.  When we come out of level 5 and go through December, whatever way December and Christmas go, which we will debate in the next week or so, January and February are key.  We are all getting a sense that level 5s and lockdowns will become increasingly difficult to endure for many people.  It will become increasingly difficult to keep a sense of discipline because people have lockdown fatigue.  That is a fact, which was mentioned at the start of this by the Chief Medical Officer and the previous Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  If we can get our testing right, resource it properly, and get testers into towns, villages, meat plants and direct provision centres when outbreaks emerge, and do retrospective testing to go after those people who have been in contact, including with pop-up testing centres, we can beat this and keep things open.  Whether places of worship, businesses or sports, that whole gamut will need to come back in 2021.  We need to ensure that public health remains at the centre.  If we resource our testing and tracing regime appropriately in 2021, we will continue to place public health and the health at the nation at the centre but also allow other things to open and stay open in a fuller capacity.  It is not as simple as that but that is a core element we need to focus on.  The Labour Party will support any moves that the Government can make to resource testing and tracing as much as it can.  The independent scientific advisory group, the Zero-Covid Island group as it has been called, has done much study.</p> <p>I do not agree with everything they say but they have done some really solid work on testing and tracing that should be examined and taken on board.  I thank all of my colleagues on the committee, the Chairman, the clerk and the secretariat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900054#DDD00200"><p>I will be taking Deputy Devlin's slot because Deputy Alan Farrell is unavailable for his slot.  As a result, my slot with the Acting Chairman will fall with the result that the Acting Chairman will receive an extra five minutes.</p>  <p>  It was a privilege to serve on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  While all reports have to be read in their context, which can often be difficult given the passage of time, even this report with the short period of time since it has been completed is difficult to read because of the speed with which that context has been changing.  It is worth reminding ourselves of that context.</p>  <p>  The first time I spoke in this Chamber was on 5 March.  At that stage we had eight confirmed cases, and one of community transmission in the North.  A local school in my area had just closed and there was widespread fear if not panic in the community.  That panic was not quite understood by other communities until the following days and weeks, when that fear would spread.  On that occasion, I said that we must approach Covid-19 as we would a war and that all the resources of the State, beyond those needed in peacetime, must be brought to bear to deal with it.  Interestingly, when Deputy McDonald followed me in that debate, she rejected my assessment.  She said that we were in uncharted territory but not in a war.  It demonstrates the difficulty that all of us had in predicting what was to come, which is the context of this report.</p>  <p>  The ninth recommendation of the committee, which relates to "Data relied upon by NPHET, its modelling code, as well as international evidence relied upon in making its recommendations", is an important one.  We have asked much of the Irish people.  The vast majority of people have adhered to and abided by our requests.  It is paramount that the evidence used by NPHET in making its recommendations is made available.  That is not to undermine NPHET but rather to support it in its recommendations.  The decisions made by the last Government in what we might call chapter 1 up to July, and the decisions made by the new Government in what we might call chapter 2 which we are still in, have all been about protecting lives and livelihoods.  It has been a difficult balance but it is one we have got right.  It has resulted in Ireland being in the third best position of any EU member state in how we have handled coronavirus, which is worth repeating because we do not give ourselves credit for it.  Yet it has been very difficult.  We must now consider what chapter 3 will look like and when it will begin.  When I put that question to Dr. Glynn at this committee&rsquo;s hearings in September, he accepted that if the virus is to be with us for longer than six to nine months, we will have to review how we live with it.  In the same way, we restricted activities and facilities in the initial stages of the AIDS epidemic before moving to a situation where we had education and safe practice.</p>  <p>  The tenth recommendation in the report deals with the communication of restrictions.  Each time we go into the world, there is a risk.  As we head into the world of this virus, we are concerned with managing that risk.  Initially, activities were judged on whether they allowed social distancing.  We then moved to a different phase in which some activities were not permitted, even though they allowed social distancing, because they involved mixing different households or bubbles.  That brings us into very difficult territory where we are making judgments about what is a good or a bad activity.  That is always a dangerous space for government, and one that governments never want to be in.  As in chapter 1 and chapter 2, we are in that space as we seek to save lives.  If we have to live with this virus for a longer period, and I hope we do not, perhaps we will be better off guiding people to have a prescribed number of contacts, or a prescribed level of social contacts, and allowing them to apply it.  Having a meal in a controlled environment is safe for me, my wife and my two children.  If I have a meal with four different people from four different households, and we are not wearing masks, it is not safe.  The risk is not the meal or the restaurants - it is the mixing of the households.  It is an impossible thing to legislate for or even control, but it is the secret to returning to normal life.</p>  <p>  Different people choose to do different things in their lives.  If this virus stays with us for a longer period, and I hope it does not, I worry that we may end up with the difficulty of the State dictating what is a desirable activity.  I know that is not the intention of any Member of the D&aacute;il, any member of the Government or any member of NPHET as we unravel the advice.  If the virus is to be with us for several months, we will need to give people more discretion in how they spend their own social contacts rather than the Government deciding how they spend them.</p>  <p>  I commend this report to the House.  I commend the Chairman and all the members of the committee.  I look forward to its recommendations being implemented.  Most importantly, I look forward to seeing the impact that this report, and the evidence we have gathered, will have on how we live with this virus.  Let us hope that we will have to live with it for a short time rather than a long time.</p></speech>

It is too important to pass without such a discussion.  I thank Deputy McNamara for his chairmanship of the committee.  I thank all the committee members from across the House who contributed so much over the many meetings we held.  I thank the witnesses for their insight, experience and expertise, which was invaluable in informing the committee and its report and in informing the public who watched intently the various discussions around Covid-19 and the challenges it presents.  I thank the secretariat and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas for facilitating all of the meetings.  I would say that the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response brought forward a pathway for this House to create the other committees of the House, such as the standing committees.  It showed a way of facilitating those committees, even through level 5 restrictions like those in place today.</p>  <p>  I especially thank my party colleagues who served on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response from the start on 7 May.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly; the Minister of State, Deputy Butler; the Minister, Deputy Foley; and Deputy John McGuinness for their contributions to this 108-page report.  It is important to remember that the committee met 67 times in public session over a 30-day period, receiving 275 submissions since 19 May.  This allowed the Oireachtas to prepare for future committees to be facilitated by the House.  It was an invaluable committee because it gave focus to the various issues and sectors impacted by Covid-19 at the time.</p>  <p>  Sadly, at the time of the report, we had lost 1,800 mainly older people to the virus.  Thankfully, as a country, as a society and as a Government we have learned much more about this virus and how to live with it, and we have published a plan for living with Covid-19, about which we have spoken previously in this House.  The attention paid to the testimony of witnesses at the time was quite moving.  It captured the attention of the public and indeed the media.  It was an outlet for people to ponder questions and considerations at the time of the first wave of the pandemic.  Little did we know we would see ourselves back here so quickly at level 5, but it illustrates the pace and infectious nature of this virus and the need for us to take heed of that.</p>  <p>  The first of the 11 recommendations, which is correctly No. 1, relates to nursing homes.  This was the single most discussed issue at the committee and is rightly noted as such in the report, especially since older people in this category accounted for 56% of all deaths from Covid-19 up to the time of the publication of the report.  Since the committee ceased its work, I have put questions to the HSE on the resources being given, particularly around nursing homes.  I am sure that resources and attention is being given to that cohort as we speak.  The committee's recommendation that "a public inquiry be established to investigate and report on all circumstances relating to each individual death from Covid-19 in nursing homes" is being examined by the Joint Committee on Health at present.</p>  <p>  The committee's second recommendation covers the need to review "the impact of privatisation of Ireland's nursing homes".  There will be many more challenges going forward but the issue of nursing home and residential care for the elderly and how that may arise in the future, pandemic or no pandemic, will involve many different Departments.</p> <p>Unlike then, but thankfully now, many hospital appointments and services continue to be offered.  During the first wave, this was one of the main issues the committee discussed.  I am very happy that, in the current wave, we have seen a total change regarding health services.  This is not to say that everything is perfect, because there are problems.  Community services, such as orthodontic services in my constituency, are affected by particularly long waiting lists.  We need to address these if there are going to be further restrictions.</p> <p> I wish to highlight some of the other recommendations, including on testing and tracing and the report of the nursing homes expert panel.  Recommendation 5 concerns the statutory sick pay scheme.  In that regard, the social protection payments are assisting.</p> <p> Recommendation 6 relates to a regulatory review of the framework of HIQA and the Health and Safety Authority.  That is an important element because, pandemic or no pandemic, we need to ensure both organisations are not crisscrossing each other, that they are fit for purpose and that they can implement any required changes to regulations or legislation.</p> <p> Recommendation 7 is about shared residential facilities, such as direct provision centres.  This needs to be tackled, irrespective of a pandemic.  Recommendations 8 to 11, inclusive, deal with many issues, such as meat-packing plants and, as my colleague Deputy McAuliffe referred to, the data relied upon by NPHET, which comprise an important aspect.</p> <p> Let me put in context where we are today.  The initial report from the Department of Health on 11 March stated that there were 43 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with nine new cases on that day.  Tonight, there are 429 confirmed cases and yesterday there were 379.  We are now obviously on the right trajectory, as the Minister said, but it is important for all of us in this House and the general public to adhere to public health guidelines in order that we can drive these numbers down.  I heard one of my colleagues say that the committee should have sat for longer but the body of work done was significant.  It was a privilege for me, as a new Deputy, to have served on it.  It is important that we all focus on the need to reduce the numbers, reduce our amount of social contact, take personal responsibility and adhere to the public health guidelines.</p></speech>

In addition, it has shown up certain weaknesses in society, particularly in the areas of healthcare and housing.  It has put a strain on a system that was already strained.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy McNamara, the secretariat of the committee and all the members, including some of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.  The committee dealt with work during a particularly rough period in our history.  It dealt with what none of us would have anticipated when we were elected to this D&aacute;il.  We are far from being through the woods.  The number of cases is too high.  While we may have lower numbers than many places throughout Europe, they are still too high.  Unfortunately, we have had over 2,000 deaths, which we never wanted to happen.  This has obviously meant pain and considerable loss for very many families.</p>  <p>  I want to deal with recommendation 1, on the public inquiry into the deaths in nursing homes.  A valid point is that we need to conduct our inquiry without a retrospective look based on what we now understand about the transmission of Covid-19 and dealing with it.  It will not come as any shock to the Minister that the issue I am going to talk about is Dealgan House and the unfortunate loss of 22 of its residents, resulting in great anguish for a large number of families.  I am aware that the Minister has met these families.  I welcome what he said in his speech in the sense that he is looking for a formula or mechanism - I do not want to put words in his mouth - for giving people the answers they need.  That is vital.  It is important that it happen as soon as possible.  Obviously, the families' ask is for a public inquiry.  They have been very tenacious and have had multiple meetings with multiple groups.  They have obtained freedom of information releases that have made national newspapers and national news.  I refer in particular to information they garnered from the HSE.  An awful lot of this is disputed.  I welcome the HIQA report into Dealgan House that mentioned some very positive aspects in respect of elder care.  That is to be welcomed.  If there are improvements regarding elder care, we will all support them but it is absolutely necessary that there be an investigative mechanism to give people the answers they need and ensure we learn everything that needs to be learned because there have been worries about several nursing homes.</p>  <p>  I welcome conversations I had with representatives from the HSE.  They spoke about the HSE now having a better set-up for communication, line management and dealing with issues in nursing homes.  On some level, that is an acceptance that there were difficulties but it is very positive.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 2 relates to the impact of privatisation.  We all have a changed view on healthcare.  It is a lot easier to sell the idea that we need universal healthcare that is free at the point of delivery from the cradle to the grave.  We acknowledge that there are difficulties with privatisation in that we do not necessarily have the staffing ratios and skill sets we would want.  These matters need to be addressed.  What we really need to do is ensure that recommendation 4 is implemented.  It concerns the recommendations of the expert panel on nursing homes.  Implementation is required as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  We have a difficulty in the sense that we have opted for a residential solution in respect of elder care.  We need to give people the facility, whether through home care packages or other measures, to avail of care within the community, where suitable.  We have a great number of difficulties and need to deal with them.  Covid-19 has shown up a number of these and we need action as soon as possible.  I ask that the Minister speak to the families about Dealgan House as soon as is practicable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900055#EEE00300"><p>I am also privileged to have served on the committee.  I thank all involved, including the secretariat, the witnesses and the Chairman, with whom I had very little dispute.  The only point on which he and I disagreed, which was unusual for me, concerned the definition of "experts".  I still hold the view that the definition of a true expert is the one who knows when to call in the experts.  I believe we had them and still have them.  NPHET did a remarkable job, coming from a standing start in circumstances we knew very little about to deal with a raging, voracious virus.  It is still raging in the way it was, or even worse.</p>  <p>  Those who criticise what happened in this jurisdiction should look at what happened in all the other jurisdictions that were held up as examples of best behaviour and best practice.  Unfortunately, they did not stand up.  Most, if not all, of the counter-evidence did not stand up.  The Ceann Comhairle will recall that the advice in adjoining jurisdictions was that the virus would dissipate after it had gone through the community.  It did not and still has not.  Many more people have tragically passed away.  We have seen this in our own communities, and we will continue to see it.</p>  <p>  At the beginning, I knew very few people who contracted the virus.  Tragically, the ones we knew about were the ones who passed away.  They died in very difficult circumstances in which family and friends could not be at their bedsides.</p> <p>Yet, I know many people, hundreds of people now - like everyone in the House - whose families have contracted the virus.  That tells me one thing.  This virus is voracious, insidious, invasive and ongoing.  If we want evidence, let us look at the way it was treated in the United States.  People decided, for what reason I do not know, that it was not a threat and that it would go away.  It has not gone away.  It still will not go away.  It is getting worse.</p> <p> The example of New Zealand was held up.  That country had a second devastating upsurge.  Severe action had to be taken.  The whole country was completely in lockdown.  It was the same in Australia and other countries across Europe.</p> <p> We should give credit to our people in this country, especially those on the front line in the health services.  We should give credit to everyone involved, including the Minister, the previous Minister and the nurses and doctors who were on the front line.  We should give credit to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is on the front line as well.  I had a discussion with the family of a garda in recent days.  In the course of an altercation or disturbance, the garda was infected with the disease.  I presume he was deliberately infected.  The family are isolating at present.  I acknowledge the work done by those in the front line who took their responsibilities seriously and took a good deal of criticism as well, let us face it.  However, they did their job.</p> <p> At this stage the debate has taken a new course.  This was always going to be the case.  We have to balance the issues, including the economic, social and health issues.  Each has to be balanced against the others.  This is a serious matter for all of us as members of society.  We can use all the evidence we have.  We can say that if we had more testing, we would have solved the problem.  That is not true.  In fact, we can test as much as we like.  If people do not observe the rules in terms of distancing and social engagement to a reasonable extent, then we are in trouble.  We can test as much as we like and as often as we like but it will not stop the virus from going ahead.</p> <p> What do we do now?  Everyone wants to celebrate Christmas - we all recognise that.  My advice is that we need to think carefully about the degree of celebration that goes on.  I agree there are certain commercial outlets and smaller shops in our provincial towns and villages that could open, since only small numbers will ever be in them in any event and they have the space to ensure distance.  I believe we have to reward some of those businesses by giving them scope to participate in commercial activity provided they can guarantee social distancing and observance of the rules and guidelines.  It is the same with restaurants and pubs and whatever.  Unless there is an absolute guarantee that they can do that, we will be held up to ridicule.  If politicians make a decision that allows further spread of the virus and another lockdown or shutdown, then we will be blamed for it.  That is a fact of life.  Those of us in Kildare had a double whammy because we had an interim lockdown as well.  I believe it was valuable in the sense that it shocked us into realising that this thing had not gone away, and it has not gone away.</p> <p> I will offer my words, for what they are worth.  I know what the pressure will be on now.  Everyone else in the House has received telephone calls and emails every day.  Some of them are highly critical of our administrators and some are critical of our advisers.  The reality is that if we do not want to take the advice of our scientific advisers, then we may not, but there will be consequences.  We all know now what the consequences will be.  We have had an illustration already.  More than 2,000 people have already died.  There are those who said at the beginning that it would not be serious and that people could recover from it.  People can recover, but they can die as well.  People can be left with a permanent mark or impact on their health.  We need to realise and wake up to the fact that we can do what we wish if we want to, but the point is that there are consequences.  Are we prepared to accept those consequences if we avoid and disregard the scientific advice?</p> <p> We all know who they are.  We have all watched them and worked with them before.  I believe they are excellent and have done an excellent job.  They are on a par with the best in the world today.  That cannot be disputed.  They were ahead of the posse in many cases.  They identified the rate of infection and what it would be like.  They anticipated everything and did their job.  It is now a matter for us to follow up.  If we decide to have a reopening of part of the economy to the best of our ability, then it has to be on strict grounds of compliance with the regulations.  We now know that if we are in company with a group of people, only one of whom was in a similar situation with people who were carriers during the previous fortnight or three weeks, then we will be infected as well.  We might as well realise that.  It is a fact.  There may be those who will say that on the one hand we might and on the other hand we might not or there is a chance that we might not.  There is a chance but it is a slim chance.</p> <p> I believe that fear generated a great deal of respect for our scientists in the first place.  We were all fearful that we could be next.  That applied to families and everyone.  There was strict adherence.  Then, after a while, we became complacent.  Familiarity became the basis of contempt.  That is not a basis and should not become a basis for our attitude in future.</p> <p> I hope that families throughout the country can have a festive celebration.  We all strive for that.  It is not necessary to wallow in it.  It is possible to socialise and have family reunions or drinks or whatever, but we have to recognise that we had better be careful that we do not paw each other to the extent that we will be spreading the virus to the ends of the earth.  Then people may all go home to their respective homes either in the country or outside it.  Then they and we have the ability to get it or they have the ability to spread it.</p> <p> I acknowledge the work of the Chairman and the members of the committee I worked with.  I acknowledge the work of the medical experts who we criticise so readily and the Minister whom some others criticise regularly.  We all get criticised for the things we do or that we fail to do when we should have done something and what we should not have done at the time we did it.  All in all, a great deal of credit is to be taken by those in their respective authorities for the work that has been done so far.  I hope they will continue to be successful.</p></speech>

It has put a spotlight on the adequacy and effectiveness of our social welfare rates.  It has shown how, very quickly, one Department can make major changes.  As soon as Covid hit, two things became clear.  People who had lost their jobs could not live on &euro;203 per week.  We could not expect a person out sick from work to wait for six days before accessing social welfare supports.  In fact, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, when introduced in March, was set at a rate almost 75% higher than the regular jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of &euro;203.  That in itself is recognition of the inadequacy of the &euro;203 payment.  That issue really needs to be looked at in respect of our social welfare system as a whole and how, at the least, people who rely on the social protection system should be protected from poverty.  That should be a basic aim but it is one we are not meeting.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise again the workers who were denied the PUP based on age.  It is age discrimination.  It is a great shame that when we start providing supports, especially in the midst of a global pandemic, we do so based on age.  I raised this issue with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, when this report was discussed at the committee some weeks ago.  The report states that 23% of taxi drivers, as an example, are 66 years and over.  People working beyond pension age in many cases are doing so because they cannot afford to retire and live on a non-contributory State pension.  Yet, they were cast aside in March when they lost their jobs and had to close their businesses.  To add to that, they were excluded from the enterprise support grant of up to &euro;1,000.</p> <p>The same can be said for young people at work, especially those who worked to make their way through college.  So many worked weekends, but there should have been some mechanism to give them a percentage of the PUP and make that support available to them.  The payment of arrears due needs to be accelerated.  There are people who waited weeks for the PUP due to issues.  When they eventually got it, they just got a week's worth of payment.  That has left people owed money and those arrears need to come into effect very quickly.  The closure of the PUP, which I raised with the T&aacute;naiste earlier on, to new applicants at the end of the year needs to be postponed to provide certainty for workers should there be additional restrictions in January.  I know nobody wants to see that but some workers will be worried over the Christmas period about the new year and we need to make sure the PUP is there for people should they need it.  Further plans to cut the PUP in the new year should also be abandoned.</p> <p> I noted, having raised the issue of the taxing of the PUP with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Humphreys, in committee last week, that the Government have gone out of their way to backdate tax owed on the PUP in the Finance Bill this week.  When the PUP was introduced in March, it came in under an urgent needs payment, which is not taxable, yet through the Finance Bill people will be taxed right back to March.  It is a great shame that the same effort does not go into taxing banks and vulture funds that goes into taxing ordinary people who will face a tax bill, some of which they did not expect.</p> <p> Going forward, when we look at returning to education and returning to work for many people whose jobs may not be there when we come to the end of this pandemic, we need to make that as easy as possible.  I am dealing with someone just now, for example, on jobseeker's who came back about eight months ago from New Zealand, wanted to get through on the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, had 147 days of the qualifying period and needs 156.  We need flexibility in the system when we are supporting people back into work or education.  We need to do everything possible to support those people. There has been some flexibility shown in relation to the PUP but we also need to see that for jobseekers.  Anyone who is willing to take up a scheme or a course should be able to do that easily and we should not be putting roadblocks in place.  I hope that flexibility will be there for those people hoping to return to work or education after this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900057#GGG00200"><p>It was hard work but a very interesting experience being on the committee.  I thank everybody who made an appearance before us because we heard some really telling reports.  There are many things we did not look at, least of all the schools because they had not returned and we did not have the experience of the return.  Maybe there is a case to be said for looking at them in future.</p>  <p>  For me, one of the most important things to come out of the committee was the public inquiry into what happened in the nursing homes.  We should remind ourselves that, up to the time we issued the report, 985 residents had died having contracted Covid-19, but what is interesting about that figure is that it is 56% of all the deaths in the State.  That is totally disproportionate because that group comprises 0.65% of the population.  That says something to us.  It was a trend around the world that older people were more vulnerable, the virus sought the vulnerability in people, and it exposed all the weaknesses in our public services.  It certainly exposed, I believe, the weaknesses in our care of the elderly.  Much of our time was taken up in looking at that, but the recommendation for a public inquiry to be established has to be taken very seriously by the Department of Health and any preparation to begin that needs to be undertaken without delay.</p>  <p>  The second part of that and linked to it is the privatized nature of the care of the elderly in this country.  We changed within ten to 12 years from having 80% of elderly care services in public control and 20% in private control to the precise opposite.  That was a shocking move but it was accelerated and encouraged by tax incentives and the idea that there was profit to be made - and all these homes in the private sector were for profit - out of the industry looking after the grey sector of our population.  That is pretty disgusting and I think they deserve better.</p>  <p>  The worrying thing is that there are many parts of this country where there are planning applications currently in process and they are not just for individuals like Mr. and Ms Smith or Murphy down the road to open homes, but for multinational corporations to invest in the care of the elderly.  Companies like Bartra Capital Property have planning applications in for hundreds of beds in premises that they want to use for care of the elderly, not because they love them but because there is a great deal of money to be made out of it.  One of the recommendations in the report is that we should look into moving into a publicly funded model in the community and, if we are serious about it, then that is what we should mean and planning applications like that should not be granted.  They should be halted because that is not the future for the care of the elderly.</p>  <p>  As I said, the systemic weaknesses in the provision of all our public services were highlighted: childcare, schooling, transport.  All of these systemic weaknesses had been in the system for years but it took a pandemic to highlight them.  That is part of what we are seeing here, particularly when it comes to workers' rights.  We did a lot of work around the professions in the care of the elderly and in the hospitals, including nurses, care workers, cleaners and so on, but also in the meat plants.  It has been revealed that 80% of workers in nursing homes who were engaged by agencies have absolutely no access to sick care provision or sick care leave.  We had people forcing themselves to go into work because they had no sick pay to rely on, knowing that they were either symptomatic or not feeling well or that infection was in the workplace, when they should be isolating.  Many of them, because of the low-pay regime and the lack of provision for workers' rights, were living in overcrowded, congregated settings where they were sharing homes with many people.  This is especially true of the meat plant industry, and one of the recommendations we have made here is a study of that industry to see at what level it operates, how it exploits workers and the need to implement a mandatory sick pay scheme.</p>  <p>  People have complemented Deputy Varadkar for putting out to public consultation how we do a sick pay scheme.  I do not think that is good enough.  We need to have a mandatory sick pay scheme for companies who are making vast profits and agencies who engage nurses and care workers and are making vast profits, and we need to do it sooner rather than later, as we are facing into a further spike in this pandemic.  For that reason, I  will bring a Bill to the House in the next week or two which will be all about mandatory sick pay schemes being forced on meat plants and those who use agency workers, particularly migrant agency workers who have no provision to access a sick pay scheme or cannot move employer.</p>  <p>  Healthcare workers have borne a huge burden and thousands of them are positive and are endangering their families because they have to go in and out to work in an environment where Covid is rampant.  A court order was given today in County Kerry to close down a nursing down in Listowel, so shocking was the report from HIQA of the carry-on in that nursing home.  I hope that is not typical but it happens.  Care workers have to work in these settings and they are not being protected.  When the nursing homes sector complains about HSE poaching, this is unfair to workers.  Workers should have a right to move to better conditions and better pay, and that is what is going on.  They are moving into the employment of the HSE because it is better, with guaranteed pay rates and sick pay.</p>  <p>  I will say a word on tracking and tracing.  It is totally inadequate.  We have seen the employment of trackers in recent weeks where they were offered zero-hour contracts and have no sick pay.  The laboratory scientists are taking ballots for strike action because they have industrial relations issues outstanding.  They have to be dealt with.  We cannot afford to have any of our trackers or tracers dealt with except with absolute respect, given such conditions that we can recruit and retain them and move to a strategy described by somebody as being like a fire brigade: where there is an outbreak, they move in, track the virus and they crush it.  If we think fires are a danger, we should surely think this virus is a danger and be in a position to use the restriction period to invest in those much-needed areas and to move quickly to crush the virus wherever it rears its ugly head.  It is happening now in nursing homes.</p></speech>

I then took up the mantle, which gave me my first opportunity as a new Deputy to experience the work of a committee.  I am grateful for being one of the first substitutes on the committee.</p> <p> I will move on to serious business.  Yesterday, the death toll from the virus surpassed 2,000 lives, a sad and sobering milestone for the country.  Despite the positive signs regarding a vaccine, it is too early to be excited.  As other Deputies have indicated, there is much ground yet to cover and many more decisions that require careful deliberation.</p> <p> As of 8 a.m., 285 Covid patients were hospitalised, of whom 33 were in ICU, with an additional 29 hospitalisations in the past 24 hours.  Figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, show that the number of virus outbreaks nearly doubled over the past week compared with the previous week.  There were 1,027 clusters this past week, up from 572 the previous week, and the number of outbreaks in private houses more than doubled to 954 from 443.  There were 20 workplace outbreaks, but the number of school-based outbreaks declined from 24 to ten.  Among the total number of workplace outbreaks during the pandemic, 89 have been in food and beverage facilities while 55 have been in meat, poultry or fish processing plants.</p> <p> I quote these statistics not to scaremonger or delegitimise the significant efforts made by all stakeholders, but to convey that this virus is still prevalent and as deadly as ever and still requires people to be cautious in their activities and to take all necessary precautions when they have to go to work, travel, go to school or whatever the case may be.</p> <p> The report examines the State's response to Covid-19 as it evolved from early 2020.  It undoubtedly highlights specific areas that require ongoing oversight and accountability, which will now be scrutinised by the various sectoral committees of the Oireachtas.  I sit on the education committee, and already we have had regular interactions with key stakeholders about how we deal with the virus in schools and ensure that they are as safe as they can be for our students.  As recently as this morning, various school staff representatives conveyed their concerns to us about ventilation in schools, social distancing measures and the health of staff and students.</p> <p> A key finding of the report was that the State became overly focused in February and March on preparing acute hospitals for the oncoming pandemic and failed to recognise the serious risk posed to our most vulnerable people, who were in our nursing homes.  The report succinctly details how there were delays in reacting to the deteriorating situation in nursing homes, especially in the provision of PPE and the replacement of staff.  Indeed, some of these concerns occur to this day.  While major efforts were made by nursing home staff, there are unanswered questions as to why some nursing homes were free of Covid while others were severely impacted in terms of deaths and sickness among residents and staff.</p> <p> The report's first recommendation - to investigate and report on all circumstances relating to each individual death from Covid-19 through a public inquiry - needs to be followed as quickly as possible.  There must be accountability for relatives who lost loved ones in these circumstances.  Failure to provide them with answers would only exacerbate the pain and suffering already being experienced by their families.</p> <p> The main theme running through the report relates to preparedness.  This will be necessary as we learn to live with Covid-19, which will be with us for some time to come until we find and supply an effective vaccine.  The State will experience periodic peaks and troughs in the incidence of the virus and it is necessary that our public health authorities be given every tool available to react to these fluctuations.  The committee was unanimous, in that if we are to avoid further lockdowns, a highly efficient and effective testing and tracing system is a prerequisite.  We must strive to do more.  Turnaround times need to be improved constantly and new forms of testing need to be considered.  Everything needs to be kept under constant review.  The State must aspire to facilitate ongoing, uninterrupted serial testing in all congregated settings.</p> <p> The report highlights the vulnerability of some of our low-paid workers and the need to provide for adequate sick pay entitlements for all.  I welcome the Government and Opposition's unanimity in pursuing this goal.  It is agreed that many workers attended work in congregated settings, meat factories, direct provision centres and so on out of fear that being absent from work would lead to a loss of income.  We need to ensure that adequate sick pay provision is one of the first measures that we implement on foot of the lessons learned during the crisis.</p> <p> Recommendation No. 7 in the report is that adequate self-isolation facilities need to be a prerequisite in all care settings.  Capital works in all publicly owned facilities need to be expedited to ensure that people can live in self-contained units and restrict themselves in communal settings if and when necessary.</p> <p> Meat plants emerged as significant infection hotspots.  While the meat industry is highly regulated in terms of food safety and hygiene, meat factories have highlighted that, just like nursing homes, the same level of regulation and protection does not extend to workers or their conditions of employment.</p> <p> It must be acknowledged that this crisis has been unprecedented.  It has posed a relentless number of challenges to us as a State and to wider society.  Emergency legislation, restrictions, lockdowns and other measures might not be palatable, but it needs to be acknowledged that all stakeholders have endeavoured to do their best throughout.  We must constantly appraise our performance during the pandemic in a non-partisan, collegial manner.  I thank the Chairman for ensuring that spirit prevailed throughout the committee's deliberations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1554" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900058#HHH00200"><p>I thank Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan for sharing his time.  I thank the committee's Chairman and other members for the important work they did at a critical time for this country.  I also thank the officials who helped them in that work, including the compiling of such a detailed and good report.</p>  <p>  I wish to make four points about the report.  First, it is important that the committee worked concurrently with our experience of the pandemic.  For major events such as the one we are still experiencing, we need at-the-time reporting, investigating and recording, but we also need work that reflects on what happened after some time has passed.  In this case, the first piece of work has been done by the committee.</p>  <p>  From my experience of the banking inquiry, that key witnesses had different recollections was interesting.  I am not just referring to key events that happened in the course of the banking crisis and the bailout.  Rather, they could not remember the sequence of meetings and who might have been present for certain decisions.  Sometimes, they had a difference of memory on the decisions that were taken.  That happens.  With the passage of time, memories change.  As such, it might be useful to conduct an oral investigation now with those who were key players when decisions were taken during the first phase of the pandemic.  I was a Minister in that Government, and I have to jog my memory to try to remember the sequence of certain events and decisions from only six months ago.  Such a recording would be useful - it would not be for publication, or perhaps it would be published years from now - to better inform future decision makers.</p>  <p>  Second, I did not get to follow every committee meeting, so something was not clear to me from reading the report, that is, the extent to which the committee examined the structure of the State's response to the pandemic.  I do not mean the decisions that were taken, but the forums or structures within which they were taken.  There was a Government decision on the best way to deal with emerging crises like pandemics, acts of terrorism and severe weather events, namely, the National Emergency Co-ordination Group, NECG.  I have spoken and written about this issue previously.  It is worth understanding now why we did not go with the NECG model, which was the recommended, tried and tested model, and instead went with a different model for making decisions.  By the way, this is not a criticism of what we did at the time.  The decision making process worked well then.  However, it would be useful to know why we did not go with the prepared response, as it were.  It would be useful to ask whether that response would be a better structure for those future decisions that must be taken in this pandemic.  That would be a good piece of work to do.</p>  <p>  Third, why is the committee no longer sitting?  We are still living through Covid-19 and trying to react to and manage the pandemic in our society.  Our citizens are still suffering not just the direct consequences of the virus, but also from some of the decisions we have taken to protect them from that virus.  Why was the committee not sitting when the Government introduced the new five level structure for dealing with the pandemic so that it could have a proper and detailed look at the structure?  Why is the committee not sitting now so that it could undertake a proper examination of potential alternatives to managing Covid into 2021?  Why is it not doing some of the heavy lifting that needs to be done in terms of preparing us for what we hope will be a freer life post level 5 lockdown?  I understand that the committee did important work and reported on same in a timely manner, which was excellent, but there is no reason for it not to be still sitting and asking some of these questions concurrently with the pandemic so that we could have the at-the-time, on-the-record reporting and investigation.</p>  <p>  Fourth, I wish to make a point relating to one or two of the recommendations in the report.  Some of them refer to the inquiries Act or to making an inquiry under that Act.  I made this point in a separate forum this week.  As someone who has experience of the Act, given that I was on the banking inquiry under it, it needs significant amendments.</p> <p>Work would need to be done to amend the Act so that a future inquiry would not run the risks the banking inquiry ran at certain points, such as not completing its work.  Amending the inquiries Act is not a small piece of work.  I imagine, in particular given the current working arrangements, it would take six to 12 months.  If inquiries are to be held under the Act in the future into things that have happened over the course of the past 12 months, that work should be done so that people can be prepared to sit on those inquiries in the future.</p></speech>

It was important for me to do this, particularly at a time Kildare was the only county in lockdown so that I could share the experience of my constituents.  Covid-19 has turned our world upside down.  We watched as strange situations like not being able to hold our loved ones or shake hands became the new normal.  My hope is that we will never consider changes like this in any way normal.</p>  <p>  A positive from the pandemic is an increase in the number of people who are walking and cycling in our communities.  We need to do all we can to ensure that this becomes the new normal and keep the momentum going so that those who can leave their cars behind for short journeys are encouraged to do so. </p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the front-line workers who kept everything going, especially in the dark days of the early summer when no end to this crisis was in sight.  This crisis has shown us the importance to our society of not only doctors and nurses, but retail workers and the entertainment and events industry that kept us entertained on social media, in particular during the initial lockdown. </p>  <p>  Our older people were disproportionately affected by this pandemic, especially those living in nursing homes.  I echo the first recommendation of the committee's report, namely, that a public inquiry be established to investigate and report on all circumstances relating to the individual deaths of Covid-19 patients in nursing homes.</p>  <p>  We need to ensure that we learn from the past.  We also need to reduce our over-reliance on private nursing homes by ensuring more public nursing homes are developed, as alluded to in the second recommendation in the report.  When announcing changes in restrictions,s we must also consider mental as well as physical health, in particular for older people.  They were told to cocoon.  For some reason, they felt that they had been promptly forgotten about by the Government. </p>  <p>  I urge the Government  to pull out all the stops to ensure this Christmas is as normal as possible under the circumstances.  Nobody does Christmas like Ireland, and we need to ensure that this special family time is preserved and everyone is given an opportunity to join in and enjoy it safely.</p></speech>

I pay special thanks to the Chairman, Deputy McNamara, and the secretariat.  I would also like to highlight my colleagues on the committee who were elevated to office, including the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  I am not sure where Deputy McGuinness went, but we certainly felt his loss from the committee.</p>  <p>  With regard the original proposition of the committee on the day it was formed, I said I wanted to be part of a committee that would be constructive and look forward.  I understood very well, as most people did, that there were significant failings in the Government and social response at that date but I felt we needed to keep looking forward because, as a number of Members said, we are not out of this yet by a long way.</p>  <p>  I would like to highlight some of the challenges that were discussed in the committee.  Early on we were faced with the PPE issue.  Great credit must go to private industry in Ireland, which liaised with and opened supply chains in Asia to the HSE to get PPE into the country. </p>  <p>  We must, of course, acknowledge our front-line staff and the heroism they displayed despite a significant lack of resources, some of which could not have been envisaged.  We also know the issues that arose in nursing homes, which were highlighted again during this debate.  This was a new learning experience.  Nobody could have foreseen what happened.  We tried to prioritise ICU beds and perhaps that led to a failure to transfer people from hospitals to nursing homes without having adequate testing in place.</p>  <p>  With respect to testing and tracing, I would like to mention Ireland's call, which was a huge response from Irish people at home and abroad.  Expats returned to Ireland.  We had more than 70,000 responses and it was a great shame that we did not utilise the people that responded to that appeal.  I am not sure that more than 800 or 900 people were employed as a result of it.  It was a significant bank of goodwill that we should have used, and we should continue to use it.</p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight the meat factories which, as has been said, have major difficulties with convection, conditioning and temperature.  The issue of congregated settings arose in direct provision centres and factories.</p>  <p>  I refer to an extraordinary deal that was done in the early stages of the pandemic with private hospitals for surge capacity.  It is a pity that the Minister for Health is not present or I would remind him how strident he was in calling for that deal to be examined.  Significant bed space was booked that was not ultimately required but the elective capacity available in private hospitals was not booked, which was definitely an own goal on the part of the Government.</p>  <p>  Other elective work has been deferred.  The committee examined travel and transport, including public transport issues, which led us to the issue of mask wearing, something we should have been doing from the start.  I asked for masks to be required at the end of March.</p>  <p>  Tom Parlon from the construction sector told us that there would be a 40% increase in the cost of building the children's hospital.  He might be proven right after all, if the current evidence is to be believed.</p>  <p>  It was important that we produced a interim report on the July stimulus.  There are many good initiatives in the stimulus, to which everybody contributed.  To be fair, the Government and Minister for Finance took on board some of what was said. </p>  <p>  We have learned a great deal about NPHET.  Deputy Murphy, who has left the Chamber, alluded this to the fact that it was in place.  I voiced my frustration in the committee quite a number of times, not necessarily with NPHET but with the way in which access to it is provided.  Dr. David Nabarro from WHO stated lockdowns are not a good step.  At the moment, we are going against that conventional advice but perhaps we are doing so because we have to.  I believe that we are doing so in large part because we do not have adequate testing and tracing or rapid testing in place.  The Minister has left the Chamber.  I asked him some weeks ago whether we could provide a platform for industry to engage directly with NPHET.  There are significant numbers of thought and business leaders and their opinions could have been heard.</p>  <p>  In respect of rapid testing, the T&aacute;naiste was before the enterprise committee yesterday and spoke about the HIQA report into some rapid testing measures, including antigen testing, which I raised with NPHET almost five months ago.  He said it appeared that, according to HIQA statements, it was not that efficacious.  That is extraordinary.  How many antigen tests were examined in a pool as opposed to some of the specifics?</p>  <p>  We produced interim reports on testing and tracing, nursing homes and stimulating enterprises, all of which was valuable work.  We also asked where we are now.  I hope that the Government takes on board the committee's recommendations.  I agree with Members who said that it is a pity that the committee has been disbanded.  We probably need it now more than ever.  Significant expertise was built up by Deputies and other senior experts in the committee.  It would be good to have that level of interrogation of our state of readiness at the moment.</p>  <p>  There are Covid pathways in hospitals, which is very good from the point of view of managing and trying to defend against the introduction of disease.  However, that has happened at a significant cost in terms of delays to other elective treatments.  We heard about people who are waiting on operations, in particular those who are awaiting diagnostic tests for cancer.  That is something that needs to be moved up the chain of importance in the HSE.  We must defend against Covid, but we must also find ways to deal with diagnostic cases.  I asked the Minister to consider increasing the hours available in our public hospitals where there is large capacity after 4 p.m. to carry out diagnostic tests and imaging if we can find the wherewithal with the workforce to do that.</p>  <p>  Beyond that, we also examined the future economic outlook.  We have taken on unprecedented levels of borrowing and also have unprecedented levels of mandated unemployment.  We need to think about what the economy will be like when we get out of this.</p> <p>The experience of a large proportion of our private indigenous and smaller SMEs - I remind everyone in the Chamber and anybody watching the debate - is completely at odds with what is happening in the public sector.  These people have been furloughed and indebted, and have experienced significant reductions in their pay.  They are not able to get out and socialise or open their businesses.  We must reconsider increased special measures, particularly for that sector, where a number of businesses have fallen through the cracks of the stimulus provided.</p> <p> Most of all, we need social solidarity.  We need to consider these further supports for the critical sectors while, at the same time, reflecting that we must get on top of the disease.  Testing and tracing is the key.  We will have to bring in rapid testing because it is quite likely, despite all the optimism, that vaccines in any numbers will not be here before April at the earliest .  We are going to have to deal with the issues of Covid for a long time.  It is the responsibility of everybody in the House and every citizen to try to ensure that this lockdown is the last we impose on the people.  We must find a way of living with and managing Covid, and keeping businesses some way able to operate, even in a very small way, as Deputy Durkan noted.  We must allow people in small businesses and private mom-and-pops to be able to get some income into their stores and to get some of their lives back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900060#KKK00200"><p>I welcome the debate and congratulate Deputy McNamara, on his performance as Chairman of the committee, his fairness and the way he dealt with the issues.  I also pay tribute to all those families who have lost loved ones in nursing homes or outside them to Covid-19.  <i>The Irish Times</i>today published the pictures of 100 people who are deceased.  Some of those families have contacted me.  It is a deeply difficult moment for them and we have to acknowledge that.</p><p>I acknowledge the fantastic work that nurses and home care assistants have done in nursing homes and hospitals.  Without them, the situation would have been much worse than it turned out to be.  Doctors and healthcare professionals were unstinting in their care, dedication and commitment.  I want also to mention the Army and the Defence Forces, which were very active behind the scenes and which were very helpful.  They are the unsung heroes, in many ways, because of what they have been doing.  Perhaps we ought to encourage them and allow the Minister for Defence to talk about all the fantastic work they have done.  I am not forgetting about agency nurses.  Agency nursing is a very difficult profession because it is uncertain and the pay is not always adequate.  They too did fantastic work, as did all the support services in the State and the public generally.</p><p>They were all the good things that happened and they make us stronger, not weaker.  They make us want to respect and will, hopefully, inspire young people to get involved in the caring careers.  In this pandemic, which came on us all throughout the world out of the blue, the response has been fantastic.  There are, however, serious issues and Covid has not gone away.  I agree with some speakers that the threat is ever-present, and I believe it is growing.  Covid is again stalking, regrettably and sadly, our nursing homes.  Let us examine those nursing homes and see what they are composed of.  There are 585 nursing homes and 31,969 beds.  Of those nursing homes, 115 have one or more restricted conditions, meaning they do not meet the full requirements of HIQA.  An unbelievable percentage, 34%, of premises are not compliant.  Perhaps the most frightening statistic of all is that 195 of those nursing homes are not compliant in fire safety.  That is a very serious issue.</p><p>All those facts are contained in the HIQA annual report for 2019.  That was last year but it was published in August of this year and it is the latest report we have.  We do not have many of the other figures that are due to be published by the authority soon.  These serious issues in the market must be addressed.  Of the investigations that HIQA carried out in respect of dementia, only 49% of the homes were fully compliant.  A total of 19% were moderately non-compliant, while about 5% had serious non-compliance.  For everyone who lies in a bed in a nursing home tonight, that is a poor return for their &euro;1,000 a week for their care.  There should be 100% compliance in all these issues and it is entirely unacceptable that this is the situation.</p><p>Many of those who work in nursing homes are poorly paid and have poor conditions of service.  Many of them are recent immigrants and have no proper sick pay.  They are vulnerable workers, have poor accommodation and many of them have to work in more than one location to make a living.  Their status in our society is too low and it is not acceptable.  There is a deep flaw at the heart of our long-term care and it is how we treat the people who work there.  Nevertheless, nursing home owners are well paid and the top 12 or 13 make hundreds of millions of euro every year.  It is interesting that 22 nursing homes changed hands in the past year, and it is people from outside of Ireland coming here to invest in the industry.  That raises a big red flag for me.  I agree with the view that we cannot allow the privatisation of nursing homes and care of the elderly to continue.  We must reverse that, as we are doing with respect to housing, and ensure that the HSE and the State step in.  We cannot have the exploitation of people, as is happening in what I accept is a small minority of nursing homes.</p><p>Today in the courts, in a case involving Oaklands Nursing Home in Listowel, which had six Covid-related deaths recently, the HSE and HIQA outlined that there were seven inspections this year.  The most recent one on the HIQA website, at 7 p.m. today when I looked at it, took place on 18 June.  We are now in November.  This was when the pandemic had hit and we all knew what had to be done, but what did not happen?  There was no person in charge, no social distancing, no clinical oversight and the food and nutrition were not adequate.  There was no appropriate and proper medical management.  The staff were wearing no surgical masks.  There was no management system in place to provide safe, appropriate and constant care, and there was poor and unacceptable infection control.  I reiterate that the date of that inspection was 18 June.  The draft report was issued to the nursing home on 9 July, with a deadline of 30 July to comply.  The chief inspector was not assured by the documentation supplied, but HIQA waited until today to go to court to take over that nursing home and six deaths occurred there.  Something is rotten at the heart of this system that allowed that to continue.  It is not for me to lay the blame but to explain the facts as I read them.  HIQA does a fantastic job and I will not take from anybody working there, but it is entirely unacceptable that this level of abuse of patients was allowed to continue for so long.</p><p>I warn those watching the debate that the virus is again stalking our nursing homes.  We must act now as a community.  I acknowledge the work that Dr. Tony Holohan is doing and I reiterate what NPHET is saying.  We are at a turning point now.  In fact, the curve has turned upwards, not down.  In New York, schools are being closed and people are being told not to travel at all for Thanksgiving, while in the UK, there are tens of thousands of cases every day.  We are at a very difficult point and must fully ensure that no effort is spared in helping these people, particularly in nursing homes.  One of the problems with the virus is that it has a severely negative impact on residents in nursing homes because meaningful socialisation has stopped.</p> <p>There is a very significant increase in mental health issues.  The incidence of dementia, depression and anxiety among residents has increased exponentially.  Loneliness, as we know, is also a problem.  Families who have loved ones in homes cannot see, visit or hug them.  That is hugely damaging to those relationships because it prevents families from expressing the love and care they have for their loved ones.  I accept that the current situation is extremely difficult for everybody but we need to put much more help in place for people in those situations.  In terms of media advertising, there should be advertisements for helplines, particularly for families of people in nursing homes.  Many of them are old and feeble themselves and they need that support.  We must do more for people at this difficult time, when more that 2,010 people have died of Covid, the majority of them in nursing homes.  As I said, the virus has not gone away.  In fact, it is surging again.</p> <p> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for listening to my concerns whenever I have met her to discuss them.  I extend the same thanks to the Minister for Health.  There must be an inquiry into Dealgan nursing home.  There are two nursing homes where events have given cause for serious concern during this awful pandemic, the latest being in Listowel and the first being the Dealgan home.  The latter is the only nursing home where there were practically no staff in place because most were out sick or had left.  Awful things happened there and the families need the truth about it.  The truth must be found for them and I believe the Minister of State is committed to finding it.  What happened is entirely unacceptable.  We have talked about it before and we will talk about it again.  I urge the Minister of State, if she can, to tell us what she is going to do about it.  It is three weeks since we had the meeting about it and the families want an investigation into what happened.</p> <p> The country has come a long way and we are now at a crossroads.  The danger is that the virus is on the rise again.  Our nursing home residents are extremely vulnerable in the short, dark, dank days and long nights we are facing into now.  I urge absolute vigilance at this time of serious risk for people.  In particular, there must be more action and greater commitment from HIQA in respect of nursing homes.</p></speech>

He put a huge amount of time and effort into his role and was a very fair Chairman throughout the whole period during which the committee met.  I thank the leader of the Rural Independent Group, Deputy Mattie McGrath, for allowing me to be part of the committee.  We worked very hard and diligently and the Minister was part of that during the early stages of the Covid crisis.</p>  <p>  I do not have time to discuss all the many issues that arose in the course of the committee's discussions.  Instead, I will refer to a few specific areas in which the State definitely failed in its response, at the cost of causing great difficulties for many people and, indeed, at the cost of lives lost.  Testing was an issue on which we had a great deal of discussion.  I made the case that it did not make sense for the Government to be sending swabs to Germany - even to the extent of purchasing a PC-12 aeroplane, at a cost of more than &euro;5 million, to transport them - when laboratories in Ireland were willing to do the testing.  A tiny bit of investment would have enabled them to do so.  There was one company in Bandon in west Cork that needed only to make small improvements for a tiny investment, but there was no interest in that.  It was all about looking elsewhere and what was happening in Germany was fierce dramatic at the time.  We also discussed rapid testing at airports and I tried to persuade the then Taoiseach that this was the way to go.  When I raised the matter on Leaders' Questions, he refused to consider it, which was the same response I got from some of the airports.  Now we are told it is the most important thing we have to put in place.</p>  <p>  We talked about nursing homes and community hospitals.  There was a lot of pointing of fingers at everybody else when the real culprit was, in fact, the State.  In the community hospital in Clonakilty in west Cork, a lot of people died from Covid.  That is not down to anything the staff did wrong.  They were failed by the State in that the hospital was not brought up to HIQA standards.  Year after year, when the deadline came up to improve the standards, successive Ministers chose to extend the deadline.  This failure to act cost people their lives.  We still have cases today where people are unable to get access to community hospitals because the bed numbers have been reduced.</p>  <p>  We need to move on and look at other issues that are being severely affected by the Covid crisis.  One of those issues is access to medicinal cannabis.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Health is no longer in the Chamber to hear what I am saying about this.  I spoke recently to Vera Twomey, who has been a great activist on this issue on behalf of her daughter, Ava.  There is talk now of access to the drug being suspended.  I ask the Minister of State to look into this issue.  There are a number of families who are affected by it.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, he has put a lot of effort into dealing with it.  I ask that the Minister of State at least return Ms Twomey's calls and try to resolve her difficulties.</p>  <p>  The cross-border health directive is another issue I would like to discuss.  Unfortunately, I am almost out of time.  A lot of people awaiting cataract operations are in danger of going blind.  The Minister needs to come into the D&aacute;il and tell us whether that scheme is going to continue.</p></speech>

I begin by thanking Deputy McNamara for doing, from what I saw of the proceedings, an excellent job as Chairman of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  I thank Deputies Michael Collins and O'Donoghue from our group for their diligent attendance at, and contribution to, the committee's work.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health said in his contribution at the start of this debate: "Our numbers have increased in the past week ... but right now we still have the third lowest rate of Covid per 100,000 population anywhere in Europe."  Why then is there all this fuss?  We have to consider the other health issues people are dealing with, including mental health problems.  I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health is in the Chamber.  There is not a mental health bed to be had in Tipperary.  People cannot access a long-stay bed anywhere.</p>  <p>  We must ask why the Minister did not stay in the Chamber to hear what we have to say.  Has he got something against us?  He was with us when he was in opposition, challenging the then Taoiseach and the then Minister for Health.  Now he is on the other side of the House, poacher become gamekeeper, and he has no interest in what we have to say.  He is showing total disrespect for us and for the House.</p>  <p>  Why must we have such a disproportionate response to the Covid pandemic?  It is a serious issue and a single death is one too many.  However, I do not trust the figures and I do not trust the PCR tests, and my concerns in that regard have been proven.  The Government will not let any of the scientists or medics with a contrary view within an ass's roar of the discussions.  We have a controlled Opposition, a controlled media and a controlled everything else.  It is time we let the people of Ireland live.  We in this House are fine because we are getting our wages the same as we always did, as are other public servants.  What about the unfortunate self-employed people?  What about the unfortunate people aged over 66 who are not able to live and do not have a penny?  What about the small and medium-sized businesses, as Deputy McNamara and others referred to, that are not getting anything?  The lifeblood is being squeezed out of them and they cannot get any bit of solace at all.  We need to have balance in our approach instead of this disproportionate impact on people.</p>  <p>  Of course we must live with the virus.  We are hoping for vaccines but, as other speakers said, I expect we will be waiting.  There are games being played by the big pharmaceutical companies, with the talk of being 95% ready or 95.5% ready.  It is a big game about who will be first over the line with the magic bullet.  That magic bullet will not be what the Government seems to think it can be.  The people of Ireland are depressed and downtrodden, with no bit of hope at all coming into Christmas.  People are wondering whether shops and other places will be open or closed.  Ordinary people want to get out and work.  One would think there is no end to the money the Government can throw out for different supports.</p>  <p>  The HSE is, and has been, dysfunctional.  I am disappointed with Deputy O'Dowd for singling out two particular nursing homes.  What about the HSE disasters?  Who put the patients with Covid into the nursing homes but the HSE?  It was not fit to manage this or any crisis.  We see what is happening with the children's hospital at this time.  It is an abomination and it is scandalous.  I have no faith in the Minister for Health.  It is nothing personal but I have no faith in him or the HSE, who are a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  The Minister told us in the convention centre that if he was an outsider, he would still be objecting and looking for answers, but he will not give any answers now that he is on the other side of the House.  I am fierce disappointed with the way he is treating this House.  No matter what debate he is taking, he is flying away from us like snow off a ditch in case we challenge him.  It is shameful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900062#MMM00100"><p>I thank the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response for doing this fierce body of work and the recommendations in it.  It looks like most of the recommendations will go to the select committees to be overseen and to make sure, where possible, that they are implemented.</p>  <p>  I was not a member of the committee.  I would have liked to have been, as I was on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and I know the amount of work that members get involved in with public representations and the wealth of knowledge that one learns from being a member of such committees, particularly in relation to how our services work.</p>  <p>  In approximately two weeks' time, extremely important decisions are expected to be made regarding what level of restrictions are required to hopefully continue to bring the Covid-19 pandemic under greater control.  The problem is we seem to be making these crucial decisions in the dark regarding which measures are most effective.  After eight to nine months, we seem to know little as to where the cases are occurring most frequently and where the risks of outbreaks are the highest.  When one sees community contact, we are effectively saying we do not know where it is.</p>  <p>  The pandemic has exposed many failings in our healthcare system and now we are seeing the consequences of the lack of funding, resources and, to put it bluntly, respect for those working on the key question of public health services.</p>  <p>  Many Deputies raised the need to track and trace, the need to hunt the virus down and the need to do this and that.  Public health specialists have a key role in the track and trace system.  They can identify common exposure events and uncover clusters.  They link apparently sporadic cases to one another.  They can get to the causes of outbreaks and make the risk assessments and advise accordingly.  Retrospective case control studies are crucial to the understanding of what works in terms of prevention and control and we should be on top of that now coming out of this second strict restriction.</p>  <p>  When the pandemic struck, our public health service had nowhere near the capacity to deal with it.  In a recent radio interview, Dr. Marie Casey in the mid-west stated that there are approximately 60 public health specialists, with 40 on the front line at present.  Scotland has three times the number of public health specialists and is actively recruiting at present.  We are not.  That is the madness.  That is what she said.  They also have bigger teams of staff working with them.  Here, we have no teams.  There is a major problem with recruitment due to the fact there are no teams.  There is no attraction to the specialty.  There has been a call overseas.  We have not got the response on that.  I have seen an article by a public health specialist in Queensland, Australia, who stated that while he would love to come back, it is not attractive to work in the specialty.</p>  <p>  These public health specialists have no right to take part in research programmes.  They have a single-point salary scale.  There is no movement for progression for these specialists.  There is a single-point salary scale with no prospect of promotion and despite lip service, consultant contracts have still not been drawn up.  The position of the director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been vacant for years.  No one is going near it.  It was filled for one or two months over the past two or three years.  It is just vacant, and that is the key role in public health in this country.</p>  <p>  A Crowe Horwath report that was completed in April 2018 was commissioned by the Government.  The recommendations contained within the Crowe Horwath Report were considered by the Department in the context of both Dr. Scally's recommendation and ongoing work in relation to Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Department stated that a process of engagement around implementation of these recommendations, including the development of a significantly different operational model for the delivery of public health medicine services, would commence with stakeholders early in 2019.  We have a situation where these workers are voting for industrial action because none of this has been implemented.  It has not even started.  It has not even gone to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding.  This is in the middle of a pandemic and coming out of this restriction and asking how will we deal with this over the next period.  The Government has much to answer for in relation to the past eight or nine months.</p>  <p>  The inadequacy of the situation leaves us in a situation where some restrictions will be lifted in December in a hit-and-miss scenario with another possible blanket lockdown necessary in January.  It is probably too late to correct the situation.  As we have said so many times in the D&aacute;il Chamber, lessons need to be learned but we are neither learning nor implementing them.  Deputies in this Chamber have stated that people must respond and take responsibility.  The Government must take responsibility.  The Government must implement what it can implement to the poor people and then explain to them what needs to be done, and the people will support it.</p>  <p>  In relation to track and trace, in general it seems we are still way off the HSE target of 800 contract tracers.  This led to the system being overwhelmed in October with anything from 10,000 to 15,000 people being asked to track and trace their own contacts.  I believe there needs to be many more than 800.  I am not an expert but I think that is the case.</p>  <p>  Finally, we have had good news of a possible effective vaccine being available early in the new year if it is peer reviewed and accepted.  However, a vaccine only works if sufficient numbers avail of it and there is a real question here about how available these vaccines will be internationally, and particularly to poorer countries.  Already, 80% of Pfizer and Moderna's output over 2021 has been bought up by the richest countries - the US, Canada, Japan, the UK and the EU - representing only 12% to 14% of the world population.  India and South Africa have made a proposal to the World Trade Organization, WTO, to suspend global trade rules on health products until widespread vaccination takes place and we achieve global herd immunity.  This would make companies such as Pfizer unable to defend their position to patent these vaccines for 20 years and allow the technology to be copied by other manufacturers.  The Government must take a firm stand on this issue supporting countries in the global south to put people's health before the profits of these pharmaceutical companies.  We cannot have the global rich taking all these vaccines.  I would be first in the queue but we cannot have a case like this where poor countries are being left isolated.  We need an international response to this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-19a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900062#MMM00200"><p>I thank all the Deputies for their contribution to this debate.  Covid-19 has dominated the lives of our people, and, indeed, people around the world, for most of this year and it is fitting and correct that the Oireachtas gives due consideration to the response that continues to be mounted by the State.</p>  <p>  The work of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response is one important area of the role which the Oireachtas has performed on this issue.  I acknowledge the work of the committee, the members and the secretariat, and, of course, the Chair, Deputy McNamara, for his efforts.  As the House will be aware, I was also a member of this committee prior to being appointed as Minister of State.  I have to say I found it to be a very effective committee.  Everybody who came in was always well prepared.  There was always huge demand for speaking time.  There was not a spare minute.  At that time, we had to leave the Chamber after two hours had passed.  I was happy to chair some of the sessions as well to give the Chairman a break because we were doing three, and sometimes four, sessions every day, such was the intensity of the committee at the time.  I compliment Deputy McNamara.  The Deputy was impartial when dealing with all the members of the committee, regardless of party and none, and I thank him for that.</p>  <p>  As the Minister for Health stated in his opening remarks, we have travelled a long road in relation to Covid-19.  It was only about a year ago that we saw the first cases of Covid start to emerge in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, in December and January.  None of us could have foreseen last Christmas what this Christmas might be like.</p>  <p>  Because there has been a huge amount of conversation tonight on nursing homes, I will focus on that part in the amount of time available.  It is important that we realise that a huge amount of work has been done in respect of nursing homes since the pandemic and its many challenges.  I wish to remember tonight that during the first spike of the pandemic, we lost 985 of our citizens in nursing homes.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to each and every one of their families.  When one is sitting down this Christmas and there is an empty chair at the table, that is when it hits home.  I know these people were resident in nursing homes but they would have been visited at Christmas time by family members.</p>  <p>  To be clear, we are providing a lot of assistance to nursing homes.</p>  <p>Up to &euro;92.5 million has been made available in 2020 to private and voluntary nursing homes under the temporary assistance payments scheme, TAPS, to contribute toward the costs incurred by private nursing homes in acting to suppress and manage Covid-19.  A further &euro;42 million has been made available up to June 2021.  Obviously nursing homes need more staff; they need more infection prevention and control.  They need a lot of supports in place in order to support their residents.</p> <p> Serial testing of all staff in nursing homes has been ongoing on a fortnightly basis since the end of June.  A total of 300,000 tests have taken place and it has proved really effective because if people who are asymptomatic are on the roster for a particular day, they can stay off work if they discover they have the virus to ensure they do not pass it on.</p> <p> We all know there were huge challenges with PPE provision at the start of the pandemic.  Deputy NcNamara will recall we heard about the issues with trying to get PPE in March, April and May.  Thankfully that has all been resolved and all nursing homes have an adequate supply.  When they have an outbreak there is absolutely no issue with getting PPE to them.</p> <p> A total of 23 Covid-19 response teams have been set up to provide multidisciplinary and expert advice in the event of an outbreak.  I am not going to mention any specific nursing homes, but when a home has difficulty, when their patients go down with Covid or their staff do, these disciplinary teams move in and are there to help and advise and it has made a difference.</p> <p> As we know, HSE staff have been redeployed to alleviate staff shortages.  There is also provision of accommodation for all healthcare workers affected by Covid-19 if they require it.</p> <p> Much good work has been done.  When we are talking of Covid, the most important thing is that we learn.  It is very important we learn from what has gone on previously and, as I said, I fully recognise the deep sense of grief and loss felt by families who have suffered a bereavement during the pandemic.  To reiterate what the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, said at the start, there are many families looking for answers and we are currently looking at the best way to get them those answers.</p></speech>

There were inevitably difficulties with accommodating a committee at a difficult time and when advice was novel, as it inevitably is in the context of a novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that both the Minister of State and the Minister have said they are looking at how answers will be given to families.  The committee obviously came to the very clear recommendation that a statutory inquiry is the way to do that.  If there is another way to do that we were not aware of it.  If there is then that is well and good but I think we are all agreed that they need answers and not at some indefinite point in the future.  They need and deserve answers.</p>  <p>  The committee also had a recommendation around an inquiry into meat plants.  Notwithstanding Deputy Eoghan Murphy's comments about the frailties of an inquiry, I am a little bit disappointed by the lack of any sort of movement towards looking at what happened.  What happened in meat plants was in some respects different from what happened in the rest of Europe, where there was also a lot of outbreaks in meat plants. We learned that in Ireland workers in meat plants are uniquely vulnerable.  They are made so by the work permit system under which they operate; they effectively work in conditions of bonded labour.  That is wrong and needs to be addressed.  Farmers were also treated very badly by meat plants at the time, although that is not unusual.  I should declare that I am a farmer myself.  We are used to being treated badly by meat plants but that does not mean it is right.  It is wrong and it needs to stop at some point.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned testing throughout his remarks, and an advancement in testing, and I welcome that.  He limited his comments however, to PCR testing.  I appreciate that even the Minister for Health does not have an endless amount of time to read everything but there is a new document being considered by EU leaders today.  It concerns a European Commission recommendation around rapid antigen testing.  I do not know what the outcome of it was; perhaps he will be able to find out from the Taoiseach.  PCR testing is the gold standard recommended by the WHO and everybody accepts that.  It has frailties however, and many of them.  It may be that it is the best type of testing there is, those frailties notwithstanding.  Among those frailties is the fact it is very expensive and it takes a lot of time.  It seems there is a role for rapid antigen testing, particularly perhaps, in seeking to open up our aviation sector on which we in Ireland are uniquely reliant.  I look forward to the Government expanding on that in conjunction with other EU member states.</p>  <p>  Various Members referred to the winding up of the committee and it would be remiss of me to not say that the committee did not decide we were sick of it and should wind up - it was wound up by a D&aacute;il motion put down by the Government.  That is democracy; it is a great privilege to live in a democracy, one we cannot take for granted, and one must accept the decisions of the majority.  I agree with Deputy Patricia Ryan that we cannot talk about a new normal.  The basic right to liberty and to live in a democracy are important and cannot be forgotten about.  In our response we need to ensure that we do not somehow fail to value what is truly important to us.  Deputy Cullinane said he disagreed with me but is it not a fantastic thing that we can disagree in our democracy and we can move on without vilifying and attacking each other?  We need to maintain that and it is important to debate our response to this as a State, a nation and a people in the D&aacute;il, and to hold the response to account more in this House.</p>  <p>  There was also discussion of proportionality.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that 2,000 people have now died with coronavirus in Ireland.  We do, however, need to get some more statistics, namely, who died, for how many of the 2,000 people who died was Covid the major cause of death and, even more important, how many of those contracted the virus in hospital after going there with something else.  These are important statistics and I do not seek them to minimise Covid-19 or to seek to say it is not important.  It is important, but so is so much else.  If the mortality rate in Ireland is approximately what it was this time last year, then 3,800 people will have died during the duration of this lockdown.  That is 3,800 people who may have died without seeing loved ones.  There are people who are not going to get a chance to say goodbye.  There are also people who die unexpectedly but how awful to not have seen a parent, sibling or loved one in the last month.  We need to reflect on that and maintain perspective.  It is important we maintain that proportion and our humanity, that which enables us to think we are made in the image and likeness of a divinity. </p>  <p>  I will finish by thanking people without whom the committee could not have run, particularly the clerks in the secretariat for all the work they did to enable the committee to sit, particularly during the summer vacation.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and indeed NPHET who came in during the summer vacation to answer questions.  Lastly, I thank the witnesses who gave of their time and of their expertise at a time when they were exceptionally busy.</p></speech>
