While inroads have been made with regard to sale and supply, the main drug supermarket and leading supplier of crack cocaine remains open on a near 24-7 basis.  I raised this issue last year and, in fairness, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, unlike her predecessor, listened to what we were saying and committed to take an action.  Action duly followed with the initiation of the joint Garda-Limerick City and County Council operation, namely, Operation Cop&oacute;g.  This combined operation has had some impact, with numerous arrest and seizures over the past 12 months.  The council also played a constructive role by demolishing some of the vacant properties that have been used for storing drugs.</p>  <p>  That said, one need only to walk into St. Mary's Park in Limerick, which I do regularly, to see what is happening.  Last Sunday, I visited most of the homes in the area.  One can clearly witness for oneself the sale of crack cocaine from the property to which I refer.  Local garda&iacute; have told me that they are not aware of anything like this in any other part of the State.  The issues of drug sales, accompanying crime and antisocial behaviour have been raised with the Minister for Justice, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach by me over the past 18 months.  While positive steps, such as the commencement of Operation Cop&oacute;g and the removal of restrictions on Garda overtime in Limerick, have been taken, more needs to be done.</p>  <p>  St. Mary's Park is a very old and very settled estate.  It is a welcoming estate where working families have lived for generations.  I am proud to call many of its residents my friends.  Yet it continues to be held hostage by drug gangs.  People who have lived in the estate all their lives have told me they are reluctant to walk past specific houses or to call the Garda.  Quite frankly, I can totally understand why this is the case.  St. Mary's Park is a small estate where everybody knows their neighbours, for better or for worse.  Despite Garda action, many residents believe that drugs gangs are now in control and can operate with impunity.  The customers are not from the community.  People travel from far and wide to get their drugs there.</p>  <p>  What would the Minister of State say to a constituent of his if they asked why the State is pursuing him to the ends of the earth for a minor infraction while the drug supermarket in question remains open continuously?  This is undermining support for the forces of law and order.  What would he say to those residents who need only look out the window and see the gangsters laughing and joking and often selling again less than an hour after a Garda raid?  What can he say to residents who have had planning applications for house extensions declined while others can construct security walls around their properties without planning permission?</p>  <p>  Let me be very clear as to what is happening in this estate.  The drug supermarket is not like some Amsterdam coffee house.  The main business is not hash; its main business is the sale of one of the most destructive and addictive drugs possible, namely, crack cocaine.  To give a flavour of just how addictive the drug is, a street outreach worker from Ana Liffey Drug Project in Limerick told me that one client told him that crack has brought him to places he thought he would never physically or mentally go.  Another outreach worker told me a client of hers would spend &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,000 per night.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the sale and supply of dangerous drugs does not happen in a vacuum.  The growth of drugs trade is quite often linked to disadvantage and poverty.  Youth unemployment is a major problem in Limerick.  Eight out of the ten unemployment black spots in the State are in my city of Limerick.</p>  <p>  We have reached a tipping point.  We have reached the point where those who are tired and frustrated will act as they see fit.  They see little impact from the State.  What they do see is smirking hoods preying on addicts.</p>  <p>  There was a time when we had 92 community garda&iacute; in Limerick.  They did incredible work.  They liaised with the community, spoke to young people and acted as a bulwark.  they helped to steer many away from crime, but the number of such officers has been cut by more than 60%.</p>  <p>  Some 12 months on, we are not seeing the results we had hoped for.  Crack cocaine remains prevalent in Limerick and in the wider mid-west.  Success in this matter can now only be measured by whether the forces of the State can permanently close this crack-dealing hub and take those who profit from the sale of drugs off our streets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200003#A00500"><p>I thank Deputy Quinlivan for raising this very important matter around the issue of Garda Operation Cop&oacute;g, the aim of which is to target the sale and supply of controlled drugs in Limerick.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the sustained and significant damage that drug dealing has on communities across the country.  Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to communities and safety.</p>  <p>  The continued destruction of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other State agencies tasked with responsibility in this regard.  A concerted effort has been made over the past year to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illicit drugs.  As Minister of State, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Cop&oacute;g commenced on 8 March 2021 to disrupt and target the sale and supply of controlled drugs in the St. Mary's Park area of Limerick city.  Additional resources were also allocated to the community policing unit in Mayorstone and dedicated solely to the St. Mary's Park area to provide a high-visibility policing presence and reassurance to the local community.  These community policing members work closely with the divisional drugs at Henry Street Garda station to target individuals who are involved in the sale and supply controlled drugs, with a particular focus on the sale of crack cocaine.  Operation Cop&oacute;g is supported by the regional dog unit, district crime units, the armed support unit and regular units.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a search operation was conducted as part of Operation Cop&oacute;g on 20 December 2021.  Search warrants were executed at a number of premises and properties in St. Mary's Park as part of this operation.  During the course of the operation, &euro;700 worth of suspected cocaine was seized, along with items used for the preparation of crack cocaine, including baking soda and chemical ammonia.  One man was arrested in relation to this investigation and appeared before Limerick District Court on 21 December 2021.  I understand that investigations into this matter are ongoing.  Operation Cop&oacute;g was initially planned for a three-month period.  However, I am advised it has been extended on a number of occasions due to operational policing demands.</p></speech>

In fairness, they have responded and made arrests and seizures.  I have no doubt that they share my frustration.  I speak to them on an almost daily basis regarding the continued operation of the drug supermarket.  They, in the main, have responded whenever I have raised concerns directly with them.  I thank them for this.</p>  <p>  The focus of our discussion is the Department of Justice's response to the issue in Limerick.  This is a very important part of the response but it is not the only aspect of it.  This is an issue that requires a cross-departmental response.</p>  <p>  I mentioned earlier that the scale of drug dealing does not happen in a vacuum.  Another important element of the rise of the sale of crack cocaine is the lack of funding for the drug and alcohol forum.  The Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum in Limerick had its funding cut every year from 2008 to 2014.  Despite the escalation of the drugs crisis, funding for many groups has been effectively frozen since 2014.  The lack of proper funding has severely affected the delivery of services for communities.  We need to restore funding to 2008 levels at least as soon as possible, while ensuring that the responsibility of implementing local drugs strategies remains local.  Failing to do this would be a big mistake.</p>  <p>  As already stated, local people are becoming despondent and need to see some tangible results, such as the closure of the infamous drug supermarket.</p> <p>Funding and outreach groups such as Ana Liffey Drug Project that could go and meet people in their own areas across Limerick would have a very positive impact and would be money well spent.  When I raised the issue last year the Minister responded positively.  She invited all local Oireachtas Members to meet with her in order to air their concerns and put forward solutions.  I would be amenable to meet with the Minister again in respect of this matter, which is of great importance to the people of Limerick.</p></speech>

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, GNDOCB, is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.  The bureau's work is supported by Garda divisional drugs units nationwide and by all garda&iacute; working in local communities.  The GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners.  Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and drug abuse.</p>  <p>  On 12 January, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued operation statistics on the work on the GNDOCB last year which included: cash seizures in 2021 of &euro;5,639,310 and &pound;38,571; cash forfeited to the State in 2021 of &euro;8,230,886 and &pound;142,520 and $23; and drug seizures valued at &euro;63,689,000, subject to analysis.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drug strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland.  The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels, international, national and local, involved in importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs including that of crack cocaine.</p>  <p>  I am assured that garda&iacute; continue to engage closely with Limerick City and County Council to support the regeneration work in St. Mary's Park and to explore enforcement options available to deal with specific individuals and properties involved in the sale and supply of controlled drugs.  Garda&iacute; also continue to liaise closely with residents and public representatives.  I will bring the Deputy's comments to the Minister's attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200004#B00400"><p>I am grateful for being given the opportunity to discuss this matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for being present.  I had the opportunity to raise this matter on Questions on Promised Legislation last Thursday when I referred to the report on south Kerry CAMHS as devastating reading, which it is.  At the time, I called for a full Garda investigation into the matter.  I am hopeful that progress is being made in that regard.  I also made the point that this failure in regard to south Kerry CAMHS has resulted in catastrophic outcomes for some children, which is at odds with the finding of the report, or certainly the wording of the finding of the report.  I stand over those comments.  I also called for the Government to make sure that every single child and family affected by the failures of CAMHS in south and indeed north Kerry, would immediately receive the care and support they need.  I also called for this catastrophic failure for children in both south and north Kerry and throughout the country, never to happen again.  We are yet to establish definitely throughout the country whether these failures are occurring, but certainly, anecdotal evidence in recent weeks is pointing to that unfortunate suggestion.  That needs to be established immediately, and interventions need to happen without delay.</p><p>I will read into the record a brief snip from an email I received this week from a concerned parent.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Dear Brendan, we request immediate support.  The CAMHS south Kerry LBR report was sent to us on Wednesday last and we have been left entirely alone to process the findings.  We need support.  We need immediate access to a consultant child psychiatrist, and not anyone from within CAMHS Kerry.  Our kids have ongoing needs and we are extremely dissatisfied with the level of so-called support they are receiving. </blockquote>  <p>That was just this week.  When we hear in the public domain that supports are being provided to families, that interventions are there, quite clearly this is not the only case but this is an example of the type of contact I am receiving this week, and I am sure other public representatives are also receiving.  This needs to be addressed immediately.  I call for an intensification of efforts to ensure that the children and families impacted by this gross failure in south and indeed north Kerry are addressed immediately and that the professional support that is quite clearly required by these families is provided.  It is just not good enough that any family or child would feel alone, particularly at this time, after everything we have learned.</p><p>In the brief time I have left, I want to raise the issue of the recruitment process.  Alarm bells surely must be ringing within the HSE in that this is another example of an appalling situation where the work of a professional medic has resulted in terrible outcomes for patients in Kerry.  We know that in recent years we had the scandal in the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry.  Around the same time we had the start of this particular failure in CAMHS.  I ask the Minister of State, are the recruitment processes within the HSE being examined?  It seems that the wrong people and totally inappropriate people are being appointed to these very responsible positions.  This is another example of a gross failure.  Is it going to be examined?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200004#B00700"><p>I thank Deputy Griffin for raising this important issue.  I know that I have the support of everyone in the House in working to address the challenges throughout our mental health system, in particular those arising from the report on CAMHS in south Kerry.  This is a priority for me and for the Government as a whole.</p>  <p>  As Members know, the report by Dr. Se&aacute;n Maskey was published last Wednesday.  Dr. Maskey is an independent consultant psychiatrist working out of Maudsley Hospital in London.  I wish to put on the record of the House that the report was completely independent.  Not one word was changed or redacted.  Sometimes in the HSE reports are not published, sometimes reports are redacted.  I welcome the fact that the full report was presented.  The HSE has considered the report, acknowledged the systemic failures that occurred over a sustained period and accepted the recommendations put forward.  There were many contributory factors which led to this catalogue of failures, including an absence of clinical oversight and appropriate governance and management structures. Work is under way to implement the full suite of recommendations as a matter of priority.  Deputy Griffin will be aware that there are 35 recommendations in the report - including an assessment of a reconfiguration of the service - six of which have already been implemented.  Implementation of a further 13 has commenced.  Implementation of the others has yet to commence.</p>  <p>  The HSE has met with 198 of the 240 young people affected and their families to discuss the deficits in their care and to provide them with key information and referral to any necessary services and supports.  I note what Deputy Griffin read into the record.  I spoke to Michael Fitzgerald, the chief officer, again last Friday and informed him that we must put in place all the supports these young people need, such as talk therapies, cognitive behaviour therapies and so forth.  Mr. Fitzgerald indicated that he will revert to me this week.  What must be put in place includes, as I said, counselling supports and appropriate services from within the area of child and adult mental health.</p>  <p>  The HSE apologised to each individual at the meetings to which I refer in person and, subsequently, in writing last Wednesday for any harm caused.  As part of the recommendations a full nationwide audit will be conducted of compliance within CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams.  I have also directed that there be an independently led prescribing audit in each of the CAMHS teams.  This will cover community and inpatient teams.  There will be a further independent audit of case files in north Kerry because we know that the relevant non-consultant hospital doctor worked in north Kerry for a time.  In addition, the HSE will commission qualitative research to identify the experiences of children, young people and their families using CAMHS nationwide.  It is important that we hear from service users all over the country, not only in Kerry, availing of all the supports from the 73 CAMHS teams.  I have directed that this three-stranded approach be subject to independent oversight.</p> <p>In addition, the Government has committed to a non-adversarial scheme for compensation for the children and their families affected by the matters that are the subject of the report.  I will ensure that the details of such a scheme are confirmed without delay.</p> <p> On a separate front, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Kerry is in receipt of the detailed and extensive final report, which will now be considered to see if there are grounds to commence a criminal investigation.  Although it is not appropriate to comment on human resources or industrial relations matters relating to any individual, the chief executive officer of the HSE has stated that disciplinary action will be taken if appropriate.</p> <p> I acknowledge that there are significant challenges in our mental health services.  The south Kerry CAMHS report is invaluable in addressing these.  The Deputy is quite right in speaking about recruitment.  There are 85 consultant psychiatrist posts funded for CAMHS and there are currently 79 such consultant psychiatrists in place.  There is a vacancy in six roles and Kerry is one of those.  The challenges are very stark when it comes to recruitment and it can take up to nine or ten months to fill a post.  On many occasions, the person is successful in attaining a post but we cannot get the other post backfilled, which can also cause significant delays.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200005#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I acknowledge, in particular, her reference to the non-adversarial process for trying to address the matter and support some of the families.  That is absolutely crucial.  There must be a review of recruitment.  I have put in a very detailed parliamentary question this week on the matter but there must be a review of what background checks were made.  Is this something that will happen again or can we be sure it will never happen again?  There must have been a failure somewhere in that recruitment process if certain individuals are getting into the positions and failing so clearly.  There are other factors but the recruitment process must be looked at.  Too many alarm bells have rung without a review happening in that regard.  Confidence in the system has gone and that is why exceptional measures in the context of intervention are required.  The support from within CAMHS is not good enough for people who have been so badly let down by this.  For the children who have been so badly neglected, it is crucial that this be rectified immediately.</p>  <p>  In the very brief time I have left, I will raise a very tragic case that came to my attention last September.  When I brought it to the attention of the HSE, an immediate review was undertaken.  I refer to the case of a child who attended Kerry CAMHS with their mother but who was turned away.  Two weeks later, the child took their own life.  Five months have passed since the review was initiated and the family has not got a conclusion.  These people deserve answers.  We speak about catastrophic impacts on children but this family has lost a child.  It has been five months since I brought this matter to the attention of the HSE.  I was guaranteed a review would happen.  We need this to be concluded now for the family to give these people some answers.</p></speech>

I offer my sincere condolences to the family.  I can only imagine what it has been like for them in the intervening five months of waiting.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is quite right that we need confidence in CAMHS both in Kerry and all over the country.  That is why I took a three-pronged approach in the audit.  The first audit relates to compliance and the standard operating procedures but we will look at everything, including configuration of teams.  Last week and this week, I heard across the floor of the D&aacute;il how some children are finding it difficult to access supports, depending on geographical location.  They are falling between two stools.  We are going to look at that again.  As I said, we are also going to speak with service users - children and young people - and that will be academic research done completely independently of the HSE.  The third element is the important prescribing audit.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised a very valid point.  It is something I have raised previously with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  It is very frustrating as a Minister of State to receive a budget but we find it very hard to recruit people.  We successfully recruited 53 staff to clinical positions in CAMHS last year throughout the country.  There is significant investment in CAMHS again.  It is very frustrating when it takes that length of time.  We can be up to eight, ten or even 12 months filling some posts.  For example, it took a year and a half to get a consultant psychologist into Wexford.  We have challenges in Donegal with dieticians.  A decision was taken by the HSE in 2016 when the choice was to leave the post vacant or put in a non-consultant hospital doctor without the experience but with oversight.  Unfortunately, the process fell down because the oversight was not available.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State is aware, the Neurological Alliance of Ireland has highlighted that we are 100 neurological nurses short of the HSE's own model of care, not to mention national best practice.  This is costing the HSE a great deal of money in the context of additional and unnecessary admissions, adjustments to care and medication.  There are only 42 whole-time equivalent specialist neurology nurses in the country, but we need in the region of 142.</p><p>In the north west of the country we have Sligo University Hospital in our constituency and Letterkenny University Hospital.  They offer services in the north west to a population of approximately 500,000 people.  We have the highest incidence in the country <i>per capita </i>of multiple sclerosis.  There are 2,000 people on the waiting list in the region and approximately 24,000 nationally.  As it stands, we have two neurologists and we should have seven.  We have no neurophysiologists and we should have two.  We have two multiple sclerosis nurses when we should have three to cover over 1,000 people dealing with multiple sclerosis.  We should have one movement disorder nurse and although we have one, it is shared with four geriatricians, so, in effect, it is 20% of one.  We have two epilepsy nurses when we should have four.  We should have three headache nurses but we have none.  We should have one rare disease nurse per 500,000 of population but we have none.  There are also issues around administrative support.</p><p>The reality is if we recruited these nurse specialists in neurology, we could have nurse-led clinics, rapid access clinics, telephone advisory consultations and outreach.  This would significantly improve the quality of care at lower cost, mainly by preventing unnecessary admissions to advice, information, support and counselling with the appropriate safeguards and adjustments in medication.</p><p>In preparing for this year's budget, the clinical programme asked for approval for 16 out of the shortfall of 100 posts.  There is a very strong rumour it will not even get approval for one post.  This is in a year where money was no object and no expense was spared.  Approximately &euro;20 billion is being made available to the HSE and the Secretary General gave himself an extra &euro;81,000 in pay, such is the importance of the distribution of that money to the HSE.  Approximately &euro;460,000 is being paid to the head of the HSE.  I am sure all of them are doing a wonderful job, but the reality on the ground is that where it counts in terms of clinical care for the patients, which is what all the money is for, what is the problem in recruiting and paying four additional neurology specialist nurses for our area?  As it happens, it is the area represented by three of the four Deputies in the Chamber now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200005#C00600"><p>I thank Deputy MacSharry for raising the matter of the recruitment of additional nurse specialists in neurology for Sligo University Hospital.</p> <p>The issue has come to the fore as part of a national campaign organised by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  I could be standing where the Deputy is standing and raising the exact same issue about the south east.  I compliment the alliance on bringing the challenges its members are facing to the fore.</p> <p> Neurology nurse specialists play an important role in triaging, assessing and providing ongoing support to neurological patients.  This in turn builds capacity within neurological services and allows for more timely access to efficient, equitable and quality care for patients.  I met a group of three consultants regarding Huntington's disease yesterday, which falls under this area also.</p> <p> The national clinical programme for neurology, in conjunction with the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, completed an all-Ireland survey of neurological services in 2020.  The survey highlighted that although all neurological centres have access to a designated clinical nurse specialist and-or an advanced nurse practitioner, the total number of neurology nurse specialists is significantly below, as the Deputy said, what is recommended by international guidelines.  The national clinical programme recognises the need to address this deficit to ensure the provision of efficient and timely care.</p> <p> An additional 16 clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners have been sought for 2022, as the Deputy stated, across different specialties and hospital groups.  While a final decision on funding is currently awaiting finalisation of the HSE service plan, the additional posts sanctioned will initially address the areas of greatest geographical inequity, and the sub-specialties that are most in need.  Plans to increase the overall number of neurology nurse specialists incrementally will then be developed to address the remaining needs.</p> <p> The national clinical programme for neurology recognises the value that skilled and highly trained nursing staff add to neurological services.  It has endeavoured to endorse this by focusing its current work streams and initiatives around nurse-led clinics, nurse liaison services and outreach programmes.  Examples of this include the headache programme and epilepsy outreach programme, both funded under the Sl&aacute;intecare innovation fund.</p> <p> These programmes involve reconfiguration of the management of these conditions, enabling clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners to lead and co-ordinate care of these conditions in the community.  This reduces reliance on consultant neurologists and tertiary services, in turn reducing waiting lists, allowing more timely access to services and improving the overall quality of care.</p> <p> The north-west regional consultant-led neurology service is based in Sligo University Hospital with a regional commitment to Letterkenny University Hospital.  The existing nursing staff currently in place at the neurology service at Sligo University Hospital includes two advanced nurse practitioners in epilepsy, three clinical nurse specialists in neurology and one candidate advanced nurse practitioner in movement disorders employed through community healthcare organisation services, working across both Sligo University Hospital and Sligo-Leitrim community services.</p> <p> In addition to the two existing consultant neurologists in place, the national clinical programme for neurology has recommended the appointment of a third consultant neurologist to help fulfil the neurology care needs of the population of the north west.  This post is expected to be filled in 2022.</p> <p> The bottom line today is in relation to the additional 16 clinical nurse specialists and the advanced nurse practitioners across different specialties with a final decision pending.  I give the Deputy a commitment I will raise it with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, because it is one I am hearing about all over the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200006#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.  As she said, she could quite easily be standing where I am today and if she was, I doubt she would be happy with that response.  I am conscious that undoubtedly if it was her constituency, she would be very much focused on trying to get the issue sorted.  I appreciate where she is coming from.  Two problems arise.  The first is 16 additional nurses were sought as part of budget 2022 with the decision pending in February for the service plan.  It has become the practice that the HSE service plan is published sometimes as far into the year as June or July, which is laughable.  No business could do that, certainly not one with &euro;20 billion in resources.  One hits the ground running on 1 January and recruits 16 additional nurses, otherwise it is the service plan for 2023 or 2024.</p><p>The other problem is the bottom line that we have less than 50% neurology nurses who are required in the country and the same is the case in Sligo even though we have the highest incidence of multiple sclerosis <i>per capita </i>in the country.  There is no urgency about this to the effect that we should get this sorted and get these people recruited.  If the Minister of State was to adopt the business analogy I used, she would save money because it would cut admissions, free-up otherwise much needed acute beds that are there for other reasons, and eat into the 2,000 on the waiting list, bearing in mind that within the region there are 10,000 with neurological conditions and 800,000 nationally.  We need to focus a little better on this issue.</p><p>I should have mentioned my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who I am sure would agree with this.  However, talk is cheap.  We could all acknowledge the need and all the rest of it, but where is the recruitment process and the staff?  I am sure the Neurological Alliance of Ireland does not want accolades or congratulations.  Like the rest of us, its members want to see results.</p></speech>

I can read a script here and read out the commitment to the national clinical programme for neurology, to meeting the needs of patients, as illustrated by the proposed appointment of a third consultant neurologist to help fulfil the neurology care needs of the population of the north west, but it needs to be backed up, as the Deputy said, by the nurses.</p>  <p>  The commitment of the Government to the provision of quality healthcare in Sligo University Hospital is underlined by the project for a multistorey ward block.  This is currently in detailed design stage and will consist of two additional 21-bed wards with single en suite rooms.  I will give the Deputy a commitment that I will raise that issue with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, this week and I will raise it with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  I am aware of the demand for these nurses.  We have to start incrementally.  I remember when I was fighting very hard to get dementia advisers in place and we had eight.  We built on it year on year and we ended up with the 28 we needed.  I will give the Deputy the commitment I will raise this issue as soon as possible and, hopefully, we can get such provision included in the service plan for 2022.</p></speech>

I raised this issue with the Taoiseach yesterday and he agreed it was a hammer blow for the community in Collooney, with a population of approximately 1,700, to lose 80 jobs.  It is a massive blow to the workers, their families and the surrounding community.</p>  <p>  We can talk all day about how bad it is.  The question is what will be done about this.  Perhaps one of the tiny bright lights on the scene is that there is a research and development facility there where there are 11 jobs.  The Taoiseach said that perhaps there was the potential for further investment.  We need to hear from the Minister of State today that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Minister responsible will put this issue high on their agenda and ensure there are replacement jobs.</p></speech>

Eighty jobs is a large number to be taken out of it.  This factory opened in 1984.  At that time there was a larger facility, Gowna, which has closed in the town, having at one time employed up to 700 people.  This factory has been there for a long time, it has sustained the community through very difficult times and it is very disappointing to see it close.  My colleague, councillor Thomas Healy, has been in touch with other Deputies asking that the four constituency Deputies work together along with representatives of the local community and that we would meet IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Minister to come up with a plan for the area because that is what we need.  We need to ensure there is a plan in place to deliver for the community to ensure the people there can have a sustainable future.  Sligo has great potential as an employment district and area but we need investment.  Part of that investment is about the health service that has been taken away from the community, which is a major problem for the area.</p></speech>

Braun Hospicare who are facing the loss of their jobs.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a jobs, enterprise and development programme for the coming year.  This programme talks about the creation and sustenance of high-quality enterprise and employment across all regions.  Obviously, the IDA has a key role to play in this regard.  It does great work, but that work could be better in the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region.  Total employment in BMW-area IDA client companies is 8,721 as opposed to 124,000 in Dublin.  There is a real disparity there.  As my colleague, an Teachta Martin Kenny, has referred to, we need a discussion in which the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the T&aacute;naiste, is involved.  Deputy Kenny will be convening such a meeting with local representatives, the IDA and other relevant stakeholders but we need to hear the Minister of State say this morning that she will fight like hell to save these jobs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200007#E00200"><p>I thank all of the Deputies.  I apologise for the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, who was not available this morning.  I will start by acknowledging that this is an extremely difficult and stressful time for the workers of B. Braun and their families.  The firm was a significant source of employment for Sligo and this news will have struck a heavy blow to the community there.  I understand that the company made this decision as it found it difficult to continue to scale its specific manufacturing operations in Ireland to remain competitive.  The Government, through IDA Ireland, worked closely with B. Braun to try to find a solution to the problems it faced.  Unfortunately, a solution could not be found and the company made the disappointing decision to move a significant portion of its operations to third parties.</p>  <p>  It will take approximately 18 months to fully wind down operations in the facility.  In the meantime, the IDA will work with the company to explore options for the future of the site.  It is likely that the site will be sold to an external party and the company has stated that it wants to ensure that it is sold to a buyer that can effectively use the site to help to create and grow jobs in the region.</p>  <p>  The redundancy package for the affected workers is yet to be confirmed but the Government, through the Department of Social Protection, will make all necessary State assistance available to the workers, including welfare entitlements, help with their job search, education and training.</p>  <p>  Direct questions were put as to the actions the Minister will take to help the affected workers.  IDA Ireland is directly engaged with B. Braun at both local and corporate levels and will work to ensure additional investment for the Sligo area so that these workers can get new jobs.  The fact that B. Braun will continue to operate in Sligo until 2023 provides time in which to seek alternative investment for the area.  The IDA will work to ensure that investment.  The Department has agreed a jobs loss response protocol with the Department of Social Protection.  This puts in place efforts to assist the workers, including welfare entitlements, job search assistance and upskilling needs opportunities.  Every State support will be made available to these workers when the time comes to help them to transition and find new employment opportunities.  I understand that B. Braun will be retaining its Sligo-based research and development team of 11 employees.  The company has insisted that more investment will come to this area, ensuring that its research and development operations in Sligo will continue in the years to come.</p>  <p>  Despite this unfortunate news, the pipeline for new jobs in Sligo remains strong.  Firms are continuing to commit to Sligo, with Advantio recently announcing that it will open its new European cybersecurity headquarters there.  The region will also see further development under Project Ireland 2040, including through the new N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin road and a significant &euro;13.7 million investment in the Institute of Technology Sligo.  This will help to bring more investment and more jobs into the region.  While it may be difficult to appreciate now, we have reason to be confident that, even in the current climate, we will find new opportunities for investment and for jobs in Sligo.</p></speech>

She talked about the pipeline for jobs in Sligo remaining strong.  However, the statistics show that is not the case.  In 2017, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation released a document looking at figures from the 2011 and 2016 censuses.  This showed the lowest increase of any county in the country, 2%, was to be seen in Sligo.  The national increase was 11%.  It is not just Sligo.  The surrounding counties, Leitrim, Roscommon and Mayo, had the second, third and fourth lowest increases.  The pipeline for jobs in Sligo and the surrounding counties is not strong.  Last week, I pointed out to the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, that almost 60% of the area of Sligo, including Collooney, will wait until 2025 or 2026 for connection under the national broadband plan.  This Government needs to look at the regions, including Sligo, and put something in place that will work.</p></speech>

Many of us are sending our children to college to get degrees but there are no jobs for graduates in the north west.  That is a problem that needs to be addressed.  The only way to regrow and facilitate work for people in the north west is to put the infrastructure and investment in.  Government has a key role to play in that.  I welcome what the Minister of State has said about the Departments being prepared to work with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and so on but we have heard that many times in the past and little has come of it.  The Minister of State will know that is the case in her own region as well.  We really need to make this different.  We need to put an infrastructure plan in place to ensure we can create new, sustainable, long-term jobs for people in that region.  The closure of this factory is a sign that we are going in the wrong direction and that we are moving backwards.</p></speech>

In the south west, it is more than 47,000 and, in the mid-west, it is more than 25,000.  As I have previously said, the figure for Dublin is 124,000.  Sligo and the other counties in the region need and deserve very specific attention because those figures show a very clear disparity.  The loss of these jobs has foregrounded something which the Deputies representing the area, particularly my colleague, Deputy Kenny, have been raising for a while, which is that disparity in treatment specifically with regard to the IDA.  I also welcome the commitment given that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are going to work together but this has been heard before.  We need to see the Minister responsible, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, taking this on, leading on it and ensuring action to back up those words.</p></speech>

I very much share their concern about the impact of this announcement.  In any area, the loss of 80 jobs is a massive blow to staff and the local community and will have knock-on effects on families.  IDA Ireland and B. Braun will collaboratively seek a buyer for the company&rsquo;s site.  I am hopeful that, given its size and location, it will prove appealing to companies looking to locate or expand in our country.  The T&aacute;naiste has asked the IDA to keep him regularly updated on its progress in finding a buyer.</p>  <p>  As difficult as it may be to appreciate right now, we have reason to be confident.  Firms are continuing to commit to Sligo.  I will give all of the Deputies here a commitment.  I will speak to my colleague later on today about the issues they have raised.  I take on board the point that it is very important for all stakeholders to work together.  There is a window of 18 months, which will pass very quickly, to try to bring in someone who will invest in the site, the workers and the area.</p></speech>

Cancer care is a very significant element of the health service.  It is really disappointing that the Minister is not present.  He is not in the country.  He is off at some business event.  That is a pity.  With the agreement of the House, I will share my time with Deputies Whitmore and Gannon.</p> <p>Every three minutes in Ireland, someone receives a cancer diagnosis.  Sitting in doctors' offices throughout the country, across every village, town and city, it is a largely indiscriminate disease.  Many patients say the minute they hear the word "cancer" it feels like the whole world has been turned upside down - like they are losing control.  Most of us at one point or another have thought about and worried about receiving this life-changing diagnosis, but most people have not thought about the cost associated with that diagnosis and the reason for that is that they should not need to.</p> <p> However, a cancer diagnosis comes with a hefty bill with some patients facing financial crisis alongside their treatment.  In a 2019 Irish Cancer Society survey into the experiences of cancer patients and survivors, one participant said, "It was like a bomb went off.  It cost a lot of money and has left me weak and in need of financial assistance."  Another said, "I am just 17 days into being diagnosed.  It is complete turmoil.  As it goes on the financial burden is sinking in."  This survey is filled with harrowing testimonies which paint a shameful picture, leaving no doubt that the State is failing cancer patients in many ways.</p> <p> The myriad of expenses, which are often unexpected, can at times feel endless - medication, GP visits, specialist dressings, travel, wigs and additional dental care to name but a few.  For the patients who do not meet the strict medical card income limits or cannot afford private health insurance, the financial strain is even greater.  They are essentially left adrift with no financial support at a time when their physical and psychological energy reserves are low.  As a 2018 report into health inequality in Europe put it, these patients are stuck in the twilight zone of the Irish health service.  They are at the sharp end of a two-tier system, incurring &euro;80 inpatient charges per hospital visit.  While this is capped at a maximum of &euro;800 per year, it should be noted that a high proportion of patients end up paying the maximum rate as their course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy requires more than ten visits a year.</p> <p> For many patients their first introduction to these inpatient charges is often upon receipt of an invoice.  Understandably, some newly diagnosed patients are not even aware that these charges exist.  They assume that their treatment is free, particularly the day services.  Last year one woman told the Irish Cancer Society that she found out about the inpatient charge the morning of her first chemotherapy session.  Imagine a patient learning about this unexpected cost just before their first chemotherapy session, as if they would not be frightened and stressed enough already.</p> <p> However, for many people it is the speed with which bills, reminders and even debt collector letters are issued that really distresses them.  Invoices often come through the door while patients are still recovering from the treatment they are being billed for.  In one case a patient received 19 separate correspondences from the hospital and debt collection agency.  It is quite remarkable how efficient the health service can be when it is owed money.</p> <p> The practice of hiring debt collectors is especially disgraceful in my view.  It is meant to intimidate patients who with everything else going on in their lives during treatment may just not have got around to paying, maybe they just do not have the money or maybe they are waiting for the outcome of their medical card application.  Frankly, the reason does not really matter.  What matters is the absolute lack of sensitivity and understanding being shown to cancer patients.  One cancer patient described the debt collector's relentless pursuit as bullying.  She was told that if she did not pay up, her name would be blacklisted with things like car loans, home loans or even mobile phone contracts.  Instead of winding down this deplorable practice, it appears that the HSE has actually intensified its pursuit of patients and spent more than &euro;4 million on debt-collection agencies.</p> <p> On top of this, many HSE-run hospitals are still charging exorbitant fees for their car parks, with the average cost for car parking for cancer patients at around &euro;62 per week.  Despite a programme for Government commitment to introduce a cap on hospital car parking charges and to introduce flexible passes where possible, nothing has really changed.  The Department of Health has failed to grasp this nettle after years of empty promises.  Following a 2018 review of car parking charges, the HSE signed off on a plan to cap car parking charges at &euro;10.  The plan was signed off by the HSE directorate in January 2019 and yet many hospitals are still not complying.</p> <p> For example, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda charges up to &euro;25 a day and there are many others doing likewise.  In total this blatant moneymaking exercise amounts to around &euro;12 million a year in income at HSE-run hospitals.  These car parking charges are especially high in urban areas where our eight designated cancer centres for individual cancer types are located.  The centres are in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick.  Many of these hospitals, of course, are known as voluntary hospitals.  They are public hospitals but they have the title of voluntary hospitals.  They have commercial private car parks which they operate as substantial money spinners and which place a heavy financial burden on patients.</p> <p> Of course, for those living outside these counties, the costs associated with their appointments are even more substantial.  When travel, parking, food, accommodation and items such as tolls and car servicing are included, the average cost is &euro;989 per year.  For many people this is the final straw.  Instead of focusing on their well-being, treatment and recovery, patients are worried about money; they should not be.  These extra and unnecessary charges are taking a considerable toll on cancer patients and their families.  We cannot stand by and allow them to continue any longer.</p> <p> While this motion is not a silver bullet, it is an important start.  We all know that abolishing inpatient charges for cancer patients and placing a cap on car parking charges is the very minimum that must be done.  Of course, the only way to fundamentally tackle the considerable financial challenges faced by cancer patients and indeed all patients is a system of universal healthcare, based on need and not ability to pay.  However, without real political leadership and a commitment to radically scaling up implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, we will need to continue to plaster over the cracks of our health service.</p> <p> With the stroke of a pen, the Minister could change that, allowing cancer patients the opportunity to focus on their health and not on the mounting debts.  It is time to accelerate reform of our health service, to view it as an essential public service and to remove the cost barriers for patients.  The Social Democrats believe this motion would be a good place to start, to make our health service more conscious of and more sensitive to the difficult circumstances that patients are in and to make it more empathetic.  Therefore, by removing inpatient charges for cancer patients, by ending the practice of hiring debt collectors and by capping car parking charges, cancer patients can be relieved of some of the financial worries and concentrate their energies on getting well.  It is the least they deserve and the very least that the Government should do.  I ask Government Members to support this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="10:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200008#F00200"><p>Every family in this country has been touched in one way or another by cancer.  It is a diagnosis that can send a person and their family into a state of shock, grief and despair.  It is often the start of a very long and difficult journey for everybody involved.  However, there is a second shock which people never expect and which comes as a complete bombshell to them and that is the shock of the cost of their cancer care.</p> <p>The people I speak to about this assume their care will be covered.  They never expect to be hit with these Bills.  The fact that they are does our country and State a disservice.  In Ireland those who do not have medical cards or private health insurance have these costs to cover.  When they are not capable of covering them the debt collectors can come in.  I do not know whether the Minister of State listened to the coverage this week on Newstalk.  There was quite a bit of it.  People rang in with stories of debt collectors knocking on their doors, putting horrible stress on them and their families at a time they are also trying to deal with their diagnosis.</p> <p> It is not just limited to adults getting a diagnosis of cancer.  Each year many children in our country are diagnosed with cancer.  When a child faces cancer there is a huge cost for the family.  The Irish Cancer Society estimates it can cost up to &euro;15,500 in hidden costs for a child with cancer.  This covers issues such as parking permits in hospitals, utility bills and services such as play therapy and counselling.  I have spoken to a few charities in my local area, including the Gavin Glynn Foundation which helps the families of children who travel overseas.  It has stated that when a child has cancer the average monthly cost is approximately &euro;1,300.  This is a lot to add on in hidden costs.</p> <p> There is also the loss of income.  In many cases carers have to give up their work in order to look after the children.  The costs associated with this range from education supports to one-off costs such as wigs and hair pieces.  Parents face additional day-to-day expenses such as food, clothing and mobile data.  When parents bring their children overseas the HSE covers the cost of the care of the child but the costs of accommodation and all of the add-ons are not covered by the HSE.  This can cost approximately &euro;15,000 per child, which is a huge amount of money.  This forces families to fundraise and set up GoFundMe accounts and put their energy into getting this money when it should be solely focused on the sick children and ensuring those children are getting the care and love they want to give them.</p> <p> I wish the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, were here.  He is very familiar with the many great charities we have in Wicklow that deal with cancer services.  This is replicated throughout the country.  When I spoke to them this week I was surprised at the stories I heard.  In one instance someone undergoing chemotherapy was missing his appointments because he could not afford the inpatient costs.  This should never happen.  Finances should not be a barrier to someone getting life-saving medical services.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, reviews this debate, takes it on board and speaks to the particular services who will tell him the real-life situations being faced by families through out Wicklow and the country.</p> <p> The reality is this is not going to get better.  We are seeing a huge increase in the number of cancer diagnoses since Covid.  Many local supports are still closed or dealing with very high-risk patients.  The new wave of cancer diagnosis has been described as another pandemic.  Late diagnosis cancer patients will be dealing with even more expensive cancer costs.  The State has a responsibility to pre-empt this pandemic wave of cancer diagnosis coming down the track.  People are seeing huge increases in the cost of living.  The State has a responsibility to pre-empt this and step in now to ensure those cancer patients and families who receive this devastating news are supported fully by the State and that hidden costs do not present barriers to them accessing care.</p></speech>

I also welcome Maria Fleming, who has been great advocate in Dublin Central and holds us all to account.  I value the work they have done and I am proud to welcome them to the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The Social Democrats are proud to table this motion to mark an important week for cancer action and awareness.  This Friday is World Cancer Day.  Cancer is inescapable.  There is not one person in the House or country who has emerged unscathed from the disease and its reach is growing.  By 2035 there is expected to be a doubling in the number of cancer cases.  An estimated 40% of the European population will face cancer at some point in their lives.  At the same time, the number of cancer survivors living through or after cancer treatment continues to increase year on year.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2019 almost 200,000 patients in Ireland were living with a cancer diagnosis.  I have not received a diagnosis of cancer.  I do not think anyone knows what their own reaction will be until they find themselves in the situation.  What struck me from reading the Irish Cancer Society's report on the cost of cancer and hearing from cancer patients, survivors and their advocates is how much financial concern immediately weighs on a person who receives a diagnosis.  No one's first thought after finding out they have a cancer diagnosis should be how they can afford it.  This is not mental arithmetic as a form of self-preservation or distraction.  It is not a translation into something more tangible or mundane because the thought of having cancer is too great.  It is because what we fail to speak about in society is that cancer comes at a great personal cost not only in terms of health, emotion and quality of life but also financial impact.</p>  <p>  The financial impacts are as real as the diagnosis itself.  The Irish Cancer Society's cost of cancer report clearly illustrates not only the new costs associated with cancer but the reduction in income that hits simultaneously.  I will read some direct quotes from cancer patients and survivors that highlight the devastating impact of the financial burden of cancer.  One said it was like "a bomb went off".  Another said "It's caused severe stress on us daily.  Going from two excellent long-term full-time careers to social welfare.  We even lost our house to the bank and I have missed appointments as we had no petrol to go".  Another patient said "but for the generosity of friends, family and neighbours, we would not have been able to provide food for our children.  The financial impact after a cancer diagnosis is immediate and significant."</p>  <p>  Last year, further research from the ESRI showed the main reason people return to work after a cancer diagnosis is out of financial necessity rather than feeling ready to return.  Once again, the financial implications overshadow what should be decisions made for the benefit of health and well-being.  Research published in 2018 specifically examining colorectal cancer survivors and associated financial hardship supports the Irish Cancer Society's research.  Of 496 respondents, 30% had no savings at the time of diagnosis.  Of those who did have savings almost 50% used some or all of their savings.</p>  <p>  There is no one type of cancer patient.  Cancer patients are young people with families, working professionals, people living in rural areas and people living in cities.  Stories of survival are becoming more commonplace but we know survival is different to thriving.  Our previous thinking and priorities when it comes to the cost of cancer, namely, dealing with treatment options, life expectancy and survival rates, need to change.  We need to be as concerned with the quality of life and the well-being of cancer survivors and patients as we are with treatment and survival rates.  Every aspect of navigating a cancer diagnosis in Ireland comes at a financial cost, including travelling to treatment.  People opt for public transport when travelling to and from chemotherapy despite knowing the nausea they feel.  This is because they cannot afford the exorbitant car parking fees and worry about how many hours are left on the meter when receiving their radiation therapy.  A total of 83% of patients incurred average car parking costs of &euro;64 per month.  Inpatient charges for chemotherapy and radiotherapy are &euro;80 per visit and capped at &euro;800 per year.  Not only is there a cost for these treatments but cancer patients will be chased if they fail or forget to make a payment.  After only 47 days, and with no clear guidance, a hospital can refer the debt to a debt collection agency.  This is a time when people are at their most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  Our motion supports a call from the Irish Cancer Society seeking to abolish the &euro;80 inpatient charge paid by patients at every chemotherapy or radiotherapy appointment.  It also seeks to stop the indignity of debt collectors being permitted to chase payments from cancer patients.  It seeks to make the Government honour its commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a cap to the maximum daily charge for car parking for patients and visitors at all public hospitals where possible and introduce flexible passes in all public hospitals for patients and their families.</p>  <p>  Last May, in response to a parliamentary question, the T&aacute;naiste said with regard to using debt collectors for unmet hospital payments that people have a social obligation to pay their bills and taxes and settle their debts because if they do not do so they pass those debts, bills and costs onto society and other people.  This is a Government that recognises a moral obligation for people to pay but not a moral obligation to provide affordable and accessible services.  Politics is about choices.  We can choose to be on the side of people who have experienced sickness and illness, who had no choice in getting ill, or we can choose to be on the side of those who believe people have to pay their debts regardless.  The Social Democrats stand for our society where people who get sick are cared for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200009#G00300"><p>I thank Deputies Shortall and Murphy and their colleagues for tabling the motion.</p> <p>It is a welcome opportunity to discuss what is set out in it.  The Deputy is quite right that every three minutes somebody gets that call.  Unfortunately, mine was one of the families that got the call 15 months ago when my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  Thankfully, he has come through it so far.  I understand the issues the Deputies have raised and, to be honest, I am surprised we are here alone discussing this.  I lost my father in 1995 to cancer and I have an uncle who is getting radiotherapy today.  There is not a family in Ireland that has not been closely affected.  Some families seem to travel that road a lot, but I doubt that any family will ever escape it.  Therefore, I welcome this debate.</p> <p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has asked me to express his thanks to the Irish Cancer Society, which, through its tireless work, has played such a vital role in helping to transform the experiences and outcomes of people affected by cancer.  That includes research such as the Real Cost of Cancer report.  This is something on which the House can agree.  The Minister looks forward to continuing to work closely with the society to further develop cancer care services and supports in the years ahead.</p> <p> The opening line of the motion is sobering and highlights the challenges we face today.  It is true that approximately 24,000 people are diagnosed with invasive cancer in Ireland each year, excluding the common but rarely fatal non-melanoma skin cancer.  The reality is that the overall number of cancers diagnosed has continued to increase due to our increasing and ageing population.  This underlines the importance of delivering on the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 with its focus on cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and patient supports.  The vision of the strategy is: &ldquo;Together we will strive to prevent cancer and work to improve the treatment, health and well-being, experiences and outcomes of those living with and beyond cancer".  It is about preventing cancer across our population, diagnosing cancer early, providing optimal care to people and maximising their quality of life.  The strategy provides a comprehensive ten-year roadmap for cancer services, and there has been significant progress on its implementation over the past four years.  Clear, evidence-based policy direction from the Department of Health and strong implementation by the HSE of its national cancer control programme have resulted in real improvements across all stages of the cancer continuum.</p> <p> We have the evidence to show that this approach is working. The most recent annual report published by the national cancer registry shows that the incidence of cancer per 100,000 people has fallen or at least stabilised in recent years and that survival rates for Irish cancer patients are continuing to improve.  Five-year net survival for patients diagnosed from 2014 to 2018 averaged 65%, up from 42% for those diagnosed from 1994 to 1999.  As the Deputies note in the motion, an estimated 200,000 people are living with and beyond cancer in Ireland today thanks to continued improvements in medical oncology, radiation oncology and surgical oncology services.</p> <p> However, we must recognise that the national cancer strategy is not concerned solely with advances in treatment but also with improving the quality of life for those living with cancer.  This is why the establishment and ongoing work of the cancer patient advisory committee is so important and why there is also a focus on providing grant funding and best practice guidelines for community cancer support centres and developing survivorship services, to support those living with and beyond cancer.  I am reminded of the Solas Cancer Support Centre in Waterford, with which Deputy Cullinane will be familiar.  It offers great support and services to people living with cancer and going through treatment.</p> <p> Such progress has only been possible due to the significant Government investment in cancer services in recent years.  Over budgets 2021 and 2022, some &euro;97 million in additional funding was allocated to cancer services, of which &euro;40 million was allocated specifically for the continued implementation of the national cancer strategy, building on the progress and momentum to date.  A further &euro;30 million was provided for new cancer drugs while &euro;12 million was set aside for screening services.  The remainder was used to ensure that cancer services continued to recover from the disruption caused by Covid-19.  It is important to set out for the House the extent of the Government&rsquo;s investment in cancer services in both financial and policy terms to clearly demonstrate our deep commitment to supporting the many thousands of people, and their families and carers, who are living with cancer in Ireland today.</p> <p> Nonetheless, despite the investments in cancer services, the Minister for Health is acutely aware of the financial difficulties that people can face following a cancer diagnosis.  It is true that cancer can place a financial burden on some individuals and their families through the combined impact of loss of income and additional costs associated with their treatment.  This issue is not confined to cancer patients.  Individuals diagnosed with other long-term illnesses may also have to cope with financial stresses as a result of being unwell.  It is for this reason that supports to ameliorate the costs of illness should be available to all rather than focused on those with particular conditions.  This is the principle behind the transition to universal healthcare envisaged by Sl&aacute;intecare, where people access the right services based on need and not ability to pay.</p> <p> With regard to inpatient health charges, under the Health Act 1970, as amended, all persons, irrespective of illness or condition, accessing public inpatient, including day-case, services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory inpatient daily charge, which is capped at a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 consecutive months.  However, there are exemptions from these charges for identified groups of people, including, but not limited to, people with full eligibility, that is, medical card holders.  As is the case for all patients, cancer patients can apply for a range of supports, including medical cards, and they are assessed under the criteria applying to all applicants.  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  Indeed, the Irish Cancer Society found that more than 80% of those diagnosed with cancer who apply for a medical card are successful, while medical cards are awarded without a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.  Individuals with a terminal illness who have been certified by their treating consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less to live are also now eligible for a medical card without a means assessment.  Everybody has welcomed that.  Beyond this, the HSE has discretion to reduce or waive inpatient charges in cases of excessive hardship while, in certain circumstances, the HSE may grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, where the applicant faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Further supports are available to individuals, including those provided by the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p> All patients require a responsive and compassionate health system to meet their medical needs.  I believe that is the underlying intent of the Deputies' motion, and it is what the Government is continuing to work towards in terms of delivering an affordable, accessible and quality health service for all.  As such, the Government does not intend to table a counter-motion.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will discuss progress being made on affordability later in the debate, as well as addressing some of the other issues raised by the Deputies in the motion.</p></speech>

I also thank the Irish Cancer Society for all the work it has done advocating on and highlighting this issue.  It is welcome that the Government is not tabling a counter-motion and will support our motion.  However, simply supporting it and not tabling a counter-motion is not enough.  There must be action on the motion, and I have not heard from the Minister of State that there will be any action.  In fact, what I heard from the Minister of State's most recent comments is a defence of the <i>status quo</i>, which is simply not good enough.  It is not listening to cancer patients and seeing the difficulties and stresses they are undergoing.</p><p>The motion calls for the abolition of the &euro;80 inpatient charge for all those receiving cancer treatment.  What is the Government's position on that?  If it is supporting the motion, when will it abolish the &euro;80 inpatient charge?  The motion specifically calls for the HSE to be directed to end the practice of using debt collectors.  There was no comment at all from the Minister of State on that unacceptable practice.  We have not received a commitment from the Minister of State regarding the car parking charges, which put a massive burden on people at the very time they do not need it.  It is welcome that the Government is not opposing the motion, but for that to mean anything there must be action from the Government.</p> <p>We need commitments from the Government and timescales on this issue, not a simple defence of the <i>status quo</i>.  That will not cut it.<br/><br/>The motion is about recognising people and the stress or trauma they go through when they receive a diagnosis.  It is about seeing the significant burden these financial charges place on such people at the very time they do not need them, while they are trying to deal with their diagnosis and treatment.  I appreciate there is empathy on this issue, but I do not think that point has been heard fully by the Government because, if it had been, we would be hearing about the actions it is going to take to address this issue, when it will abolish the charges and when it will call off the debt collectors.<br/><br/>We should pause and ask ourselves how we got to a situation, as a country and a people, where debt collectors are being sent after people with a cancer diagnosis at the very time they are at their most vulnerable and when they need the most support from the State.  That is the way in which they are being treated.  I do not believe that any Deputy supports that.  I do not think anyone in the country supports it.  That is not enough, however.  We have to change it into action and stop this terrible and inhumane practice.  We need to stop this brutal treatment of people that cannot be defended and was not defended in the comments of the Minister of State.  We have to act to make a change on that.  <br/><br/>The Irish Cancer Society states:</p><blockquote>	When thinking about cancer, people tend to focus on  the treatment options and chances of surviving the disease.  Not the families right across the country crushed by debt, struggling to make ends meet and facing an uncertain financial future.  Not a parent having to make the choice between paying for medication for themselves and putting food on the  table for their children.  Not the debt collectors working on behalf of hospitals, chasing cancer patients at their lowest physical and emotional point. Not those sitting in a cold house during chemo because the heating bills are just too high. </blockquote> <p>That is the reality into which people are being placed by the State and the lack of action on this issue.<br/><br/>Hospital parking charges, to which reference was made, are a significant extra cost and burden.  A cancer patient stated: </p><blockquote>	I stayed in hospital for 115 days and during that time, my wife Trish came to visit me five days a week.  It cost her almost &euro;1,200 in parking charges alone in that time. ... If she was able to get free parking, or even a reduced rate, it would have been a great help to us. </blockquote> <p>A wife visiting her husband who was in hospital with cancer was charged &euro;1,200.  That is inhumane.  It needs to change and we need action from the Government on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="10:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200011#J00200"><p>One in two people will develop cancer during their lifetime.  Getting a cancer diagnosis is overwhelming and terrifying.  Many or most, if not all, of us have lost loved ones to cancer but we also know many people who have survived.  Screenings, improved treatment and excellent care are all increasing survival rates.  However, this comes at a deep physical, emotional and, disgracefully, financial cost.  This financial cost is callous and uncaring.  Not only are cancer patients charged for their care but hospitals use debt collectors to pursue individuals and families dealing with the turmoil and toll of cancer.  Patients without a medical card or private health insurance are charged for inpatient treatment, including life-saving chemotherapy and radiotherapy, at a cost of &euro;80 per visit.  There are numerous other costs, such as medication, counselling, childcare, wigs, heating and outrageous parking fees in hospitals.  The Irish Cancer Society estimates the average cost to a person diagnosed with cancer is &euro;756 a month but can be over &euro;1,000 in some cases.  At the same time, people are faced with a loss in income of more than &euro;1,500 a month on average.  The Minister and the HSE know all of this.  The inadequacy of the response to the lived reality of cancer patients and survivors is truly staggering.</p>  <p>  This awful and terrifying disease is made even worse by Government health policy.  This has to stop and it can stop today.  In the words of a constituent who contacted me on Monday, "The cost of cancer is a disgrace when people are at their most vulnerable."  The Government should support our motion to provide relief and support for the thousands of people who are currently undergoing treatment and the thousands more who will do so in future.   It should abolish the &euro;80 inpatient charge, direct the HSE to end the practice of using debt collectors and honour the programme for Government commitment to cap daily charges for car parking at public hospitals and introduce flexible passes for patients and their families.  The constituent who described to me the impact of the cost of cancer care outlined how his medical bills skyrocketed as he had to pay for medicines, pain relief, GP bills and much more.  He eventually got a medical card after months of wrangling and, as he described it, fighting with the HSE.  The State does not need to make cancer even more difficult for people and their families.</p>  <p>  Cancer support services are also desperately underfunded.  I recently visited Cork ARC house in Bantry which provides a range of support and care for people diagnosed with cancer and their families, from vital information and advice to counselling, wigs, art therapy for children and practical supports.  In 2021, it had more than 1,500 active users, up from 1,200 in 2020, and it provided more than 10,000 services.  Truly disgracefully, Cork ARC Cancer Support House receives only &euro;45,000 annually in HSE funding towards the centres in Cork city and west Cork.  That represents just 5% of its overall income, the remainder of which is fundraised.  This is an incredible service that makes an immeasurable difference in the lives of cancer patients and their families during and after treatment, yet it receives only 5% of its income from the HSE.  It is rightly seeking an increase in funding to ensure its services can expand and continue to meet the ever-increasing demand.</p>  <p>  Cancer can have long-term cost and life-altering impacts for which patients too often have to pay.  This week, I was contacted by a young person who had to have a hand amputated due to cancer.  She quickly realised that public-funded healthcare and support falls so far short of what is required.  She does not qualify for a primary medical certificate to allow her to purchase and adapt a car as she had one hand amputated, rather than the criteria of two hands.  She is forced into getting and adapting a car herself to allow her return to work and care for her child.  In addition, the public cover of prosthetics in Ireland is the worst in Europe.  She will need three prostheses in the first year but the public system only covers one.  The cost is shocking for this woman who wants to recover, get back to work and live a full life.</p>  <p>  The cost of cancer care, however, is a Government choice.  There is not a person in Ireland who is not affected by cancer.  There is not a person in Ireland who opposes reducing the cost of care, so why would the Government do so?  I sincerely hope the Government will go further than not proposing a countermotion today.</p></speech>

I thank the Social Democrats and An Teachta Shortall for bringing forward this important motion.  Obviously, Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting it and we will continue to advocate for the removal of hospital inpatient charges, car parking charges and other taxes on being sick on a phased basis, balancing medical and financial need.  My party believes in a single-tier universal healthcare system that delivers care when and where it is needed on the basis of need and not the ability to pay.</p>  <p>  I will deal with the substantial issues raised in the motion in a moment.  It is important to reflect on the wider context of where we are in our healthcare system and fundamental promises that were made by the political system to which all parties signed up in the form of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>We have not addressed the issue of reducing the cost of healthcare to any great satisfaction.  We have not moved in any great regard on delivering universal primary care, starting with universal GP care, which is moving at a snail's pace.  What was provided for in the budget for six and seven year-olds is still not in place because of ongoing talks with the Irish Medical Organisation and GPs.  We have real crisis with GP capacity.  The Government has not even started to address many issues that need to be sorted, including looking at demographics and demand in the context of capacity.  We have not moved on decoupling private medicine from public hospitals and we have not moved substantially on waiting lists, which are going up.  Despite the big promise made to all patients, including cancer patients, that we would deliver a better healthcare system, we have not made the strides forward that we need to make, although I am aware that we have been through a pandemic in recent years.  This is without getting into regionalisation and other issues that are important to the delivery of the necessary reforms.</p> <p> No patient, but especially someone with a terminal cancer diagnosis, should be hounded, threatened and terrified by debt collectors.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and other colleagues in the House have seen some of the letters sent to patients by debt collectors.  They are nothing short of intimidation and they put additional stress on patients who may already have financial difficulties and are already dealing with the stress of cancer.  The HSE spends nearly &euro;4.5 million on debt collectors each year.  This sounds like the furthest thing from a health system that is supposed to be moving to a universal healthcare model.  We have to end this practice, particularly for patients with cancer and chronic conditions.</p> <p> A cancer diagnosis is a life-altering event.  Nearly one in two people will develop cancer during his or her life.  The rate of cancer is equivalent to someone being diagnosed in the State every three minutes.  Every hour, a person dies from cancer.  Cancers are the leading cause of death, with nearly one in three deaths linked to cancer each year.  Cancer is a massive burden on the individual, his or her family, the wider community and society.  We experience it collectively and either personally or through someone we love.</p> <p> As the Minister of State will be aware, a cancer diagnosis can be devastating physically, mentally and emotionally but also financially for the person who has cancer and his or her wider family.  Thousands of cancer patients face into a financial burden in the region of &euro;700 to &euro;800 per month, which is nearly &euro;10,000 a year.  At the same time, many are left out of work or on reduced hours.  The average household can lose out on &euro;18,000 per year, which can devastate any household at the wrong moment.  Obviously, low-income households are particularly vulnerable.  Consider any family dealing with a cancer diagnosis and the additional stress of associated financial costs.  How could the Minister of State justify setting a debt collector on them and tolerate the sending of threatening letters in an attempt to recoup a small amount of money, at most a couple of hundred euro, from a family that is already struggling with so much?  Given its prevalence and potential severity, it is only right that beating cancer and supporting people with cancer is a top priority for us individually, the political system and the wider community health system.</p> <p> I appreciate that in the past couple of budgets additional funding was made available for the national cancer strategy.  I commended the Minister for Health on putting forward additional spend.  However, many of the key performance indicators in the national cancer strategy have still not been met or have not been implemented.  These will require further resourcing and support over the next years.  There is a lot more work to do, in particular to catch up on the pandemic backlog and the cancers missed over the past two years, but also to deliver the top-class cancer treatments that are available to private patients in the State to public patients through a model similar to the National Health Service in Britain.</p> <p> While cancer services in the State remain one of the better performing parts of the healthcare service, thanks to the efforts of the medical and healthcare professionals in that field, unfortunately a lot of progress remains to be made.  In particular, access to innovative new treatments must be expanded, as well as access to therapeutic clinical trials.  The cancer strategy set a target that 6% of patients would have access to clinical trials but only 3% of cancer patients have access to such trials.  In a recent meeting I had with the working group for an all-island cancer research institute, cancer researchers stressed the need to reach and beat that target.  Medics want it, patients want it and research needs it.  I was told by this group that up to one in five cancer patients in England have access to all clinical trials.  Denmark provides access to trials at a rate three times higher than we do.  For all patients, particularly those with severe and complex cancers, we must do better at attracting clinical trials and enabling patients to access them.  This can be done on an all-island basis to access to maximise access and trial availability.  Patient advocates on both sides of the Border have been calling for this.</p> <p> Wealth should not determine a cancer outcome, or any health outcome for that matter, but we know it does.  Despite the investments in other cancer strategies to date, access to life-changing treatment for some severe cancers remains restricted and only accessible to private patients.  A public patient seeking access to immunotherapy to prevent the recurrence of melanoma, for example, with the same condition as a private patient, faces a constrained system where the first option is often restricted to "watch and wait".</p> <p> We also have a huge problem in the public system with diagnostics.  Rather than more outsourcing and giving more money to the private sector to do more diagnostics, we need more investment in community diagnostics to properly equip GPs to improve their access to diagnostics.  Perhaps because of the ideology of the parties in government, we have got into the habit of outsourcing everything.  We outsource diagnostics and treatment to the private sector and we outsource the hiring of staff rather than properly investing in the public system, as we need to do.</p> <p> I thank my colleagues in the Social Democrats for tabling this motion and again putting the very important issue of cancer on the political agenda.</p></speech>

The Minister of State may recall that around the time it was first broadcast, a meme was doing the rounds known as "Breaking Bad UK edition".  It showed the character Walter, having been diagnosed with incurable lung cancer, asking "This will bankrupt me, how will I pay my bills?"  The doctor replied, "The government will pay your bills; what kind of barbaric society would allow a person's health to hinge on their wealth?"  While we may not have a system that is quite as invidious, inequitable and, in some respects, vicious as the American healthcare system, which deprives people of their livelihoods and prosperity, our system is not too hot either.</p>  <p>  I welcome the motion proposed by the Social Democrats.  It clearly reflects that there is a huge impact on people's income when they have a diagnosis of cancer.  This is completely wrong.  This is one of the most stressful worrying and frightening times of a person's life.  Very often the person is out of work and his or her income is hugely affected.  Quality of life, including that of the person's family, is hugely affected.  At the same time, the person must deal with the impact of all the additional costs and if the person cannot afford to pay those costs, the prospect of debt collectors coming to pursue those costs.  That is absolutely unacceptable and in some ways it may not be so far from the invidious US model.</p>  <p>  Cancer patients are charged &euro;80 per inpatient visit.  Many of them have to attend hospital ten times or more per year, meaning charges of &euro;800, with some as high as &euro;1,000.  This motion seeks to abolish this &euro;80 charge.  Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with this proposal.  On top of those costs, we could throw in the costs of parking, food and all the rest of it.</p>  <p>  Another issue that we encounter in our office concerns primary medical certificates for cancer patients.  The radical decision by the board involved in this area, which recently came to light, clearly illustrated the frustration its members felt.  A constituent who contacted our office had to have her arm amputated because she was diagnosed with clear cell sarcoma.  She needs to adapt her car to maintain her independence, which is vitally to her quality of life.  The woman does not qualify for the primary medical certificate because she has only had one arm amputated rather than both arms.  That is absurd and disgusting.</p>  <p>  Ireland is the only country in Europe that does not cover the costs of prosthetics for people who require them. </p> <p>This woman will require three prostheses in the shape of her arm during the year.  She is covered for one prosthetic from Cork University Hospital and her health insurance covers her for up to &euro;2,000 per annum.  That will not come near the cost of one, let alone two, prostheses<b>. </b>That is another example of the impact our healthcare system has.<br/><br/>Returning to the example I gave and that meme, the NHS is not perfect but it is a system based on the public good.  That is what we need to work towards.  We need an Irish national healthcare service that is available free at the point of access so people are not deprived of care, delayed care or broken financially because they fall sick.  As the meme indicated, what kind of barbaric society would allow a person's healthcare to hinge on their wealth?  We are not in the same position as the United States - there is no question about that - but we have a long way to go if we are to have a healthcare system that is fair, humane and does not ensure that wealth is the key determinant of how healthy one is.</p></speech>

Diagnosis of cancer is devastating for an individual and his or her family.  It is a shock to the system.  It is unacceptable that in the midst of this upset, fear, anger and sickness, the HSE is sending debt collectors' letters to people.  The HSE has spent over &euro;4 million on these debt collecting agencies for cancer patients since 2013.  That is a shameful indictment of the treatment of cancer patients in this State.</p>  <p>  We often look to America and its healthcare system.  Obviously, our system is better in caring than that but for these cancer patients, it is not.  That these patients receive debt collection agencies' letters while in the midst of chemotherapy is unacceptable.  The HSE gives people 37 days before the debt collectors contact them.  That means they have less than six weeks from admission to hospital before these debt collecting agencies knock on their doors.</p>  <p>  For some people, &euro;800 is not small money.  There are so many hidden costs to a cancer diagnosis.  There is time off work for the patient and family members, the costs of transport, medicine and, for some people, wigs because of the effects of chemotherapy.  For some people, a bill of &euro;800 arriving to the door is not affordable and it is like a dagger, on top of everything else when they are struggling and at their most vulnerable, to have debt collection agencies at their door.  It undermines these individuals that, on top of this terrible illness, they and their families have this cost.  There is a human side to this.  This practice is wrong and it must stop.</p>  <p>  I raise the delay in care in cancer treatments during Covid-19.  A neighbour and friend of mine's wife contacted me last week to say her husband was sick last August and September and had to wait two months for a scan, which revealed a tumour in his brain requiring an emergency operation.  Up to the weekend, the couple were waiting for contact for the operation to be done.  It is a tumour on the brain.  There was a delay because of Covid-19 for access to scanning and another delay for access to emergency surgery.</p>  <p>  The Opposition has highlighted since the start of the pandemic the importance of cancer patients and other seriously ill people not falling through the cracks because of Covid.  My thoughts and prayers go out to this man, Tom, and his family for what they are going through.  Coupled with this weight on the family, families receive bills and have debt collectors chasing them down.</p>  <p>  The requirement to pay car parking charges when going into hospital for chemotherapy, surgery or clinics has to change.  That has to stop.</p></speech>

I think every Member of the House agrees, from a human point of view, on where we need to get to and that we are not starting from where we want to be.  Plenty has been said about the need to move properly to Sl&aacute;intecare and a universal healthcare system that is free at the point of entry and provides care from cradle to grave.  All those statements we make from time to time can seem somewhat trite but it is about a decent health system that works for our people.</p>  <p>  On the medical card, we have all engaged on cases where somebody did not get a medical card as of right while suffering from cancer.  We play the game, make the effort, try to get the card one way or another and eventually end up in that position because it is hard to refuse someone in those circumstances.  However, it is a whole rigmarole that is not necessary, does not make sense and creates further hassle and effort for a family going through something difficult.  The focus of patients should be on protecting their health and getting through an incredibly difficult process, such as radiation treatment or chemotherapy.  </p>  <p>  I think everybody is in agreement that the debt collection stuff has to stop.  It is wrong for people under pressure to have this kind of communication or interaction for small money.  Some of these debts should not accrue in any case.  We need to get to that point.</p>  <p>  Deputy Gould was trying to get onto the issue of car parking.  That goes without saying.  For many of us, it is a nuisance to land at the hospital and have to find change, a card or whatever.  It can be relatively expensive but for people will live with it if it is a once-off charge.  However, for people going through constant day-by-day or week-by-week treatment, it is not okay to put this extra cost on them.  There is the added issue that some of these are private car parks.  It is not beyond the ability of the Government to find a solution to this problem.  Rather than us making political points in relation to this matter, it would be far better if it were taken off the agenda and delivered on. </p>  <p>  We all know of people suffering from cancer.  I have been dealing with friends of mine recently and some, unfortunately, have passed since.  They got the best of care but there are difficulties.  We need to look at the systems we operate.  Sometimes the family arrange to bring the person to hospital for treatment and then all of a sudden it is cancelled.  Communication is imperfect and some of that is because the database systems and systems between doctor, patient and administrator are not perfect.  There are difficulties but the matter needs to be rectified as soon as possible because it is costing time, causing plain and, in some cases, probably having bad ripple effects that need to be taken into account.</p>  <p>  There are a number of simple steps that just need to be take so we have better cancer care for our people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="10:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200013#L00300"><p>I thank Deputy Shortall and the Social Democrats for bringing this excellent motion, which crystallises clearly the problems with the cost of cancer care.  We have been speaking a great deal in this country in recent months about the cost of living.  This motion speaks dramatically to the cost of trying to stay alive.</p>  <p>  When people are diagnosed with cancer, their first thoughts should be about their treatment, the impact on themselves, their families, loved ones and friends and the journey ahead.  However, for many one of the first thoughts is about whether they can afford the treatment.</p> <p>The majority of people suffering from cancer are going through the public system.  That is where these costs are being incurred, not through elective treatment options.  The Irish Cancer Society's research is excellent and clear and paints a vivid picture of the challenges that these people and their families face.<br/><br/>I will speak about the costs in a moment because they have been well laid out by others.  People who are facing into cancer are not incurring those costs with their pre-diagnosis incomes remaining static.  According to a survey by the Irish Cancer Society, the average drop in income for cancer patients is &euro;1,500 per month, which is &euro;18,000 per year.  Not only are they facing increased expenses, but also a dramatic decrease in their incomes due to an inability to work or other reasons related to cancer.  Having to pay for vital treatment and meet other costs while their incomes are decimated is a double whammy for people at their most vulnerable time.<br/><br/>The debt collection situation has to change.  The Government has to be unequivocal on this.  I received a response to a parliamentary question that set out the amount spent on debt collectors year on year up to 2020.  Starting at &euro;439,000 in 2013, it increased to &euro;532,000, &euro;567,000 and then &euro;585,000.  In 2017, it was &euro;603,000.  It then decreased to &euro;573,000 but was &euro;687,000 in 2019.  The spend in the year to date was &euro;386,000 by September 2020, which is the latest figure I have, but in 2020 it was on course to being well over &euro;500,000.  Some &euro;4.3 million of HSE money went to debt collectors.  The HSE is invoking its national financial regulation NFR-25, which sets out that, if a patient has not paid an invoice within 40 days of it being issued, the patient will get a notice to refer to a debt collection agency within a week.  Someone's debt is being sent to a debt collection agency six to seven weeks following an unpaid invoice relating to cancer treatment or another health treatment.  We have dealt with constituents with unpaid utility bills, Sky Sports subscriptions and the like that have taken longer to get to debt collection stage.  What is happening is immoral and has to stop.<br/><br/>As I stated the week before last when the Government did not oppose an Independents 4 Change motion, not opposing a motion or not tabling an amendment to it is not the same as supporting it or acting on any of its recommendations.  The proposers of this motion would accept progress being made on even one, two or three of its requests, but what we got from the Minister of State was just a setting out of the <i>status quo</i>.  That is not good enough.  Tea and sympathy are not required; we are talking about real costs.  The &euro;80 inpatient charge has to end.  The car parking charges have to end.  Some hospitals have reduced their car parking charges or provide parking for free, but they are the exception to the rule.  Hospitals are operating without a national policy on this matter.  In 2018, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, commissioned a report on parking charges.  It was finalised in 2018 but has not yet been published.  There is no excuse for that except an intransigence to tackle what many would consider to be reasonably low-hanging fruit in terms of reducing costs for people undergoing cancer care.  Some of the car parks are private, which creates complications, but those are not insurmountable.  The outsourcing of car park provision to private companies over the years is another example of the privatisation by creep of our health service.  Once they are privatised, we say that we do not have responsibility for parking, but we should.  It is vital.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan articulated the case of a wife visiting her husband while he was getting cancer treatment and incurring over &euro;1,000 in car parking charges.  We cannot stand over that.  Nor can our health service.<br/><br/>The figures have been well laid out, including the inpatient charge and the additional home bills.  There are additional home heating, electricity and telecom bills for people undergoing or recovering from therapies.  We do not need to discuss current gas and electricity bills again.  They are outrageous.  The Opposition has made practical proposals to reduce them.  When someone's income has been reduced by &euro;1,500 per month on average and his or her costs are increasing across a range of areas just because he or she has been among the unlucky one in two people to be impacted by a cancer diagnosis, these are the issues that we need to tackle quickly if we are to have a health service of which we are proud.<br/><br/>The motion is wonderful and makes clear requests.  Even if all of them cannot be delivered as soon as possible, the Government could at least make a contribution by achieving progress in respect of one or two of them.  Unfortunately, we have not got that.  We will get tea and sympathy from the Government rather than real change, and that is disappointing.</p></speech>

It breaks down the stealth charges that people are incurring during one of the most traumatic times in their lives.</p>  <p>  It is good to see people in the Public Gallery for the first time in a long while.  It warms every Deputy's heart.</p>  <p>  The charges are stark.  I am unsure as to whether any member of the Government could justify such costs for someone with a cancer diagnosis.  The list goes on: day charges, car park charges and so forth.  I received a letter from a constituent recently.  I will refer to some of it.  It was from a lady who was going through chemotherapy at the time.  During the chemotherapy, she got a letter from a debt collector telling her that she owed a certain amount of money and the collector wanted it as soon as possible.  A country cannot call itself civilised if it is chasing down people in the middle of chemotherapy over charges for a public service.  It is ludicrous.  I do not know who makes this stuff up.</p>  <p>  I try not to personalise issues in politics or anywhere else but Mr. Paul Reid earns &euro;420,000 per year.  That is ten times what a nurse earns.  That cannot be justified.  I do not care if Mr. Reid can speak 20 languages.  He does not justify that incredible amount of money while nurses, the lady in Dublin Mid-West and other people who are going through similar situations have to pay these costs.</p>  <p>  Let us break it down.  We are talking about someone who is in the middle of a diagnosis and going through a very stressful time, who cannot work because of the diagnosis and who is now incurring extra costs.  If someone can justify that, I would like to hear it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, could not justify it.  I am curious as to what her response would be to someone in that situation.</p></speech>

The problems in healthcare on this island are not accidental.  They are not to do with personnel; they are structural in nature.  They are the consequence of years of underfunding of our public health system, cuts, privatisation from below and neoliberal management.  That neoliberal management seeks at every opportunity, which is demonstrated by the debate today, to extract money from people, even for things as essential as healthcare needs, through the application of charges for treatment and parking in hospitals.  To add insult to injury, debt collectors are brought in on the act to extract their cut from ordinary people's requirement for healthcare.</p><p>In our budget statement, we called for the abolition of all inpatient and emergency department charges for public patients.  According to a reply to a parliamentary question in respect of the matter, the cost involved would be &euro;20 million.  This was part of our proposals for a universal single-tier national health service free at the point of use and funded by means of progressive taxation.  The removal of charges is also a Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation.  Nonetheless, those charges remain.This is deeply regressive and morally bankrupt; the charges should go.</p><p>The HSE doubles down on the inequity of these charges by using debt collectors to pursue patients in respect of those that remain unpaid.  Rachel Morrogh, director of advocacy and external affairs at the Irish Cancer Society recently stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The Irish Cancer Society has heard from patients about the distress and anxiety that contact from a debt-collection agency chasing payment for hospital charges brings [and understandably so].<br /><br />The worries and fears that are naturally brought on by cancer diagnosis are compounded by this practice and we want it to end. </blockquote>  <p>An <i>Irish Examiner</i>report in December told of a Ms Cogavin who was diagnosed at 48 with breast cancer.  She said that a debt letter followed her out of the hospital after her surgery to remove a tumour.  She said:</p> <blockquote> 	As soon as I went home, the bill followed you out from the hospital, whatever it was, two, three nights I stayed.  They billed me up to &euro;240 in inpatient charges.<br /><br />As a newly diagnosed cancer patient, you're so angry and your entire existence is all over the place, and you have people chasing you for money. </blockquote>  <p>This is scandalous.  We also learned from the <i>Irish Independent</i>recently that the HSE spent more than &euro;568,000 on debt collectors to pursue patients for unpaid hospital bills during the pandemic.  Charges for hospital care are regressive and immoral, and the HSE must immediately end the use of debt collection agencies to pursue outstanding charges and all related debts should be cancelled.</p><p>I also want to refer to the issue of-----</p></speech>

I also want to refer to the issue of parking charges.  It is more than three years since a &euro;10-per-day cap on parking at hospitals was promised.  Fianna F&aacute;il went further and promised free parking, but this regressive tax on sick people and their relatives and friends who are faced with inadequate public transport infrastructure remains in place.  According to the <i>Irish Independent</i>in early January, the HSE generates &euro;12 million per annum from car parking charges.  It can cost &euro;15 a day to part in St James&rsquo;s Hospital and the Mater hospital and &euro;14.50 at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  Hospital parking charges were abolished in recent years in Scotland and Wales and they should be abolished here.</p><p>It is time for the Government to stop charging for essential healthcare and for transport to allow people to access it.  It is also time to stop harassing cancer patients and others with debt collectors, particularly as these patients have more than enough to be dealing with.  We support the motion and thank the Social Democrats for bringing it forward.</p></speech>

Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Canney are sharing an eight-minute slot equally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="11:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200015#N00500"><p>I am glad that the Minister of State is here to hear what I am going to say because it has all to do with her own part of the world and I know that I am speaking to the converted.</p>  <p>  The probability of receiving a timely diagnosis of cancer and of surviving the disease differs substantially across Europe.  Because of the major inequity in the access to cancer diagnostics and treatments, the chances of surviving cancer are reduced in the west of Ireland relative to the rest of the country and Europe.  That is a fact.</p>  <p>  The Saolta cancer centre, based in the model 4 hospital at University Hospital Galway, UHG, delivers a programme of cancer care to an overall catchment of approximately 1 million people across the area for which the Saolta Hospital Group has responsibility.  This includes Connacht and Donegal, with substantial numbers from the Clare, Tipperary, Limerick and the midlands, including Longford, Offaly and Westmeath.  The Saolta region consists of some of the most rural and deprived areas nationally.  Those areas are associated with the western seaboard.  Saolta has a larger, older population compared with the position nationally.  Cancer is a leading cause of premature mortality in the region in which the Saolta Hospital Group operates.</p>  <p>  According to the National Cancer Registry Ireland, cancer patients from this region have the worst cancer outcomes in Ireland.  In addition, with the impact of Covid-19, the mortality rate is estimated to increase by 20% due to delayed diagnosis and the lack of access.  This implies that more patients will die from cancer than from Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Cancer services in the Saolta group were working at full capacity and above, with no resilience within the cancer programme to deliver a safe staffed and sustainable service, prior to Covid-19.  While Ireland introduced a national cancer control programme in 2006 and designated eight cancer centres, the cancer programme for the west has not received any infrastructural support over the past 12 years and has not been able to develop into a sustainable, staffed, secure programme.  The lack of resilience within the cancer programme can be strongly linked to what is described as serial underinvestment in infrastructure for the development of cancer services at UHG and at the model 3 hospitals across the region.</p>  <p> A review of the national service plan of historical capital expenditure in the period 2017 to 2021 demonstrates that only 7% of the national infrastructural investment was allocated to Saolta.</p>  <p>  The 2019 KPMG options appraisal for UHG highlighted serious deficits in cancer infrastructure at the hospital and specifically identified critical interim developments that need immediate investment because those buildings were classified as being unacceptable in their present condition.  KPMG recommended that the ambulatory cancer care centre be progressed as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  The case for investment in cancer infrastructure is self-evident and requires fast-tracking and urgent action in order that we might optimise and improve outcomes for our population.  Such action will not be sufficient, however, because Covid-19 has exposed other infrastructural deficits at UHG in the context of a lack of inpatient beds, dedicated cancer theatres and ICU capacity and at the model 3 hospitals across the Saolta region.</p>  <p>  A person with cancer in the west of Ireland should expect the same outcome as any other patient in Ireland or Europe.  In the absence of the required infrastructure to develop the cancer care programme this is not possible, regardless of what efficiencies are put in place in the hospitals.  We need to ensure that patients in the west of Ireland have an equitable chance of early diagnosis and appropriate and timely access to the comprehensive cancer care programme and the cancer centre for complex therapies, including surgery and radiotherapy.  The national development plan contains this and its words needs to be actioned immediately.</p></speech>

One of the next worst sentences that anybody will hear in the health service is being asked if one has private insurance or public insurance.  If you have private insurance, you are likely to get an appointment in the next fortnight for your condition but if you just have public insurance, you are likely to be put into a lottery and will never know when you will be reached.  Another aspect of this is that, typically, it is going to be the same doctor, hospital and treatment that is received by both patients.  It is just that one is prioritised and the other is deprioritised.</p>  <p>  A scandal emerged in 2019 when the VHI stated that it would be offering new drugs to its members for the treatment of advanced melanoma, breast cancer and lung cancer.  Professor John Crown kicked up a serious fuss at the time.</p> <p>This was the first time the State was going to allow private patients to receive a cancer drug but refuse access to it for public patients.  Professor Crown quite poignantly and publicly asked the Government what he should say the following day in his clinic to breast cancer patients in the public system who could not have access to this particular drug.  In the week the scandal broke, my office was contacted by a woman who was suffering from stage 3 breast cancer.  She was receiving therapy and treatment in hospital.  She developed an allergy to a particular drug and, as a result, she was left in limbo without treatment for some time.  Her family was deeply upset by the news that the alternative drug was available in another hospital up the road but was not available to that young mother in the public hospital.  We in Aont&uacute; fought hard for that woman.  Thank God she is in remission now.</p> <p> We need to know if that to which I refer has come to an end.  Are treatments available to some citizens and not to others in the State?  The facts of the matter are quite incredible.  There is a 12% differential in the survival rates for breast cancer between the public and private systems.  If 100 women are diagnosed with breast cancer while in private hospitals, seven of them will sadly die according to the statistics.  If, however, 100 women are diagnosed in public hospitals, 19 of them will die.  That is according to the most recent statistics from the Department of Health.  That is incredibly wrong.  It means that 12 women extra out of 100 will die because they are in the public system, which is absolutely criminal.  We cannot persist with a situation that allows such an economic and life expectancy divide to exist in this country.  According to the statistics from National Cancer Registry Ireland, lung cancer survival rates are also significantly worse in the most socio-economically deprived groups compared to the least socio-economically deprived groups.  Again, there is a massive divide.</p> <p> We in Aont&uacute; have introduced a Bill that will be debated on 17 February.  I hope the Government will support it.  If passed, it will mean that there will no longer be parking costs for patients in hospitals.  This will relieve some of the economic pressure that is currently faced by patients.  We do not have a cure for cancer, but we should be doing the best we can to reduce the fatalities caused by cancer.  If a woman in Sweden is diagnosed with breast cancer, she is 7% more likely to survive for five years than a woman diagnosed with breast cancer in Ireland.  In Britain, someone diagnosed with cancer is 5% more likely to survive for five years than someone diagnosed in Ireland.  We need an all-Ireland approach to this matter.  Currently, some Covid-19 antivirals are available in the North but not in the South.  This is of particular concern to some haemato-oncology patients who are particularly vulnerable to Covid.  I call on the Government to address this.</p></speech>

I want to begin by commending the Irish Cancer Society on the fantastic work it does all year round, every year.  I deal with many families whose loved ones have received a shock diagnosis.  I commend the Irish Cancer Society on the information it provides and on  the dedicated nurse line which deserves a special mention this morning.  It is very professional.  Without it, we would be at a loss in our constituency offices regarding where to direct patients and families.</p>  <p>  Cancer always comes with a cost, be it emotional, psychological or financial.  The degree of that cost and the impact it has on individuals and families is something we in this House can all do something about.  I have been raising the issue of eliminating hospital car parking fees for cancer patients for a number of years.  Last September, I engaged with the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform as part of my efforts to have public hospital car parking charges for cancer patients abolished.  This followed a meeting I had in my constituency with a representative of the Irish Cancer Society, Siobhan Hayes, who is based in County Laois.  The society has been advocating for the provision of &euro;5 million to public hospitals to reduce the cost of car parking charges for cancer patients.  It is also calling for a reduction in the drugs payment scheme cap to a maximum payment of &euro;100 a month, and a maximum payment of &euro;72 a month for single-headed households.  Those changes need to be taken on board.  It was very clear to me following my meeting with the Irish Cancer Society that the stress and challenges created by car parking fees have to be tackled once and for all.  It is very doable and we should all endeavour to resolve it.</p></speech>

I will be supporting it.  I support everything that has been said so far.  The family of Padraig and Elaine Clifford have paid a very high price, leaving four children behind them.  This young couple died within four months of each other.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight the plight of Karin O'Shea, a 27-year-old girl from Kilgarvan who is a personal friend of our family and best friends with my daughter, Theresa.  I even brought her to school.  This girl has gone around with Lyme disease undiagnosed for more than 12 years.  The problem is that the Department does not recognise Lyme disease and will not accept results of blood tests from Germany or other countries.  Testing in Ireland is inaccurate.  We have only one Lyme disease consultant here.  That individual can only offer antibiotics.  Irish patients have no other option but to seek treatment abroad.  Such treatment is not covered by the cross-border treatment abroad scheme because general practitioners here are not allowed to sign off on it.  There is not enough education about ticks in Ireland.  Many people are going around with undiagnosed Lyme disease.  Not everyone comes out in a bull's eye rash.  More must be done to educate people about other symptoms, like muscle pain, tiredness and headaches, because early diagnosis can make a big difference in curing this terrible disease.  This lovely girl's whole life is in turmoil.  She had to give up her job teaching at St. Brendan's College in Killarney.  The cost of four weeks' treatment in Germany is &euro;35,000 and she has embarked on a GoFundMe campaign to help her access this treatment.</p></speech>

Screening was paused in 2020 and CervicalCheck, BowelScreen and BreastCheck did not get back into operation for some time.  BreastCheck cancer screening is currently running one year behind.  The Irish Cancer Society has stated that 250,000 fewer people were screened for cancer in 2020 compared with the previous year.  We have a cancer crisis in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My mother died from cancer in 1984.  Hers was a late diagnosis.  During the pandemic, we have lived with cancer in our house.  I have seen first-hand and experienced watching a loved one going for their treatment.  When I see that general practitioners cannot get appointments for people for cancer screening, it cuts straight through me.  I have lived with it.  My good friend went to three public hospitals for late diagnosis because she had no private insurance.  She had to pay &euro;1,000 for a private hospital to tell her she had cancer.  As stated, she went to three public hospitals.  That woman left a husband and two children behind her.  I consider us to be the lucky ones in that we have received the treatment and are working with it.  I hate to see people not getting diagnosed or not getting screened.  It is not right.</p></speech>

I thank the Irish Cancer Society for the excellent work it has been doing.  I thank all the Kerry branches of the society, including in Kenmare and the excellent group in Killarney.  One of my close friends, Eugene O'Sullivan, has worked so hard.  I thank other people like Brendan Ferris in Beaufort, who organises the Threshing Cancer event every year.  It was affected by Covid in the past couple of years but, hopefully, it will be back again.  I thank people like Jay Galvin and all those who operate the Kerry link bus.  It is so important for carrying cancer patients to Cork.</p> <p>This vital service is run on the basis of volunteerism and fundraising.  It is such an important service to provide.  I wish to thank the drivers, the helpers and everybody involved in the Kerry link bus service.  I could not praise it enough if I lived forever.</p> <p>I must say that whether you are in Ballinskelligs, Ballyferriter, Ballyduff or Ballsbrige, if you get the diagnosis of cancer, you should have excellent treatment.  You should be taken care of at a centre of excellence and have the best of what is available in order to get the most positive outcome.</p> <p> I thank our doctors, nurses and other specialists who deal with cancer patients on a daily basis.  I humbly mean that.  When it comes to us as legislators supporting people who have cancer, we must ensure that the simple things, including adequate healthcare, are provided.  Last week, I asked the Taoiseach to give people who have a diagnosis of cancer and automatic right to medical cards for a period of three months in order to let them started with their medical treatment.  There are also issues with car parking charges.  Of course, any person who is parking a car while they go into hospital to get cancer treatment should not have to pay for it.  This is not a luxury; it is an absolute necessity.  I thank everybody who is involved in caring for people who have cancer.</p></speech>

What is proposed in the motion should have really gone without saying.  The fact that people who are diagnosed with cancer are not only faced with monetary hurdles but are actively hindered and hounded by their own Government is a resounding disgrace.  Surely, the &euro;4.3 million that has been thrown into debt collection could have been the subject of a more humane, not to mention a more efficient and effective, purpose. Perhaps I am misled in thinking the HSE has no other areas that require funding.  The very idea of a debt collector in any instance would be more than enough to scare, intimidate and stress any regular person.  I ask the Minister of State to imagine that level of fear and upset being laid on the shoulders of a person who is in the midst of battling one of life's most physically and emotionally draining challenges.  In fact, the horrendous thing is that it affects not only individuals, although that is bad enough, but also their families.</p>  <p>  A recent report by the Irish Cancer Society, The Real Cost of Cancer, notes the disastrous lived impact that a cancer diagnosis has on a person, their family and their income and finances.  If the cancer patient is an adult, they are often unable to work or have to reduce their hours significantly.  Understandably, this is due to feeling unwell and to the impact of treatments.  The Irish Cancer Society has also reported increasing problems for cancer patients applying for discretionary medical cards.  This is completely unacceptable.  The medical system is clearly not serving the people it was set up to serve and needs a complete overhaul. It is based on an antiquated 1970s piece of legislation that is just not fit for purpose.  It should be the objective of every  Government to have it repealed and removed.</p>  <p>  In the unthinkable situations faced by so many Irish families where a child has been diagnosed with cancer, more often than not, one parent will cease work in order to be able to care for their child.  For those fortunate enough to be unaware of the realities of cancer treatment and care, it does not limit itself to check-ups and a day in hospital to receive the treatment in question.  For many, particularly in rural areas in counties such as Donegal, even just receiving treatment means travelling to a larger hospital located hours away.  This undoubtedly gives rise to parking fees and food, drink and often accommodation costs.  There are voluntary transport providers who provide the transport for patients from County Donegal to Galway on the aptly-named cancer bus.  It is a vitally important and a very good service that the patients rely on.  The service relies on fundraising.  In this day and age, it does not bear thinking about.</p>  <p>  In the children's hospitals, limited parental accommodation is offered.  While the organisations that fund and run these accommodations are providing hugely important support to families desperately in need, there are still ancillary costs involved.  When the illness and treatment is ongoing, these costs accrue.  The report of the Irish Cancer Society notes that monthly costs can run up to beyond &euro;1,000.  Even without the additional costs involved, the Irish Cancer Society notes that cancer patients face a loss of &euro;1,500 per month on average.  That means that people facing one of life's toughest battles are already feeling financial strain before additional costs even begin to add up.</p>  <p>  At present, the supports that help in the everyday reality of those in the midst of cancer treatment, are offered by NGOs.  I applaud the volunteer driver service and the NGOs that provide night nurse care when a patient is terminal and care has reached the end-of-life stage.  These are all exceptionally helpful.  However, it saddens and angers me that while we have charities and NGOs providing empathetic support, the Government is not only failing to do likewise, but it is actively adding to the huge burden that cancer patients and their families face.  Is it not enough to hear the dreaded words "It is cancer", and the emotional toll that takes on a person and their loved ones?  Is it not enough that the harsh reality is that when people face cancer, not only do their finances cease to improve but they are reduced considerably?</p>  <p>  I support this motion and call on the Government to: abolish parking rates or, at the very least, implement the promised cap on parking payments; ensure a complete overhaul of the medical card system; put an end to debt collections; and scrap the ridiculous &euro;80 inpatient charge for cancer patients.</p></speech>

I welcome the motion.  It is a very basic and modest motion.  It calls for the abolition of the &euro;80 inpatient car parking charge, for a stop to be put to the abominable practice of using debt collectors and for a follow-up in respect of the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a cap on car parking charges.  I note that the Minister of State is nodding.  She has been put in the position in which she finds herself because the senior Minister is absent.  I might come back in a moment and comment on why he is in Dubai and on the privatisation of the health service and the marketisation of it and of medicinal products.  If I have an opportunity, I will come back to that matter.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that what this motion highlights is the inequity in our health system, and not just, unfortunately, for people who are suffering from cancer.  As with all Deputies, I have somebody in my mind who is very close to me and is suffering from cancer.  I am also thinking of a member of my family who died.   All of this is irrelevant because, in a sense, all of us could offer similar anecdotes.  The reason we have a national cancer strategy is to avoid that.   All the inequities have been highlighted repeatedly. That is what Sl&aacute;intecare was about.   The board was established to deliver a health service that was fit for service.  I emphasise that I am using the word "service".  I am not referring to a product or a company, but a health service to serve everybody equally, because that is what we deserve as human beings and citizens.</p>  <p>  It is significant that we are doing this debate today, especially as this Friday, 4 February, is World Cancer Day, which is an annual event led by the Union for International Cancer Control, of which the National Cancer Control Programme and the Irish Cancer Society are members.  Objective No. 23 of the national cancer care strategy, which is underfunded and which is not being implemented properly, is to "Reduce inequalities in five year survival for: - all cancers combined ...".  The cancers are then listed out.  The target for the objective is to have no greater than a 3% difference in the survival rate between those who are most seriously disadvantage in society and those are not, thereby reducing the distinction in survival rates.  I will not use the word "deprived" because I do not like it.</p>  <p>  In 2019 and 2020, the official position was that survival is 11.4% lower in among disadvantaged communities and patients than it is among those who are not disadvantaged.  We could use this benchmark for everything that we talk about in terms of health.  It was already mentioned by Deputy Gino Kenny in the context of the geographical differences throughout the country and survival rates.  I come from Galway, which is supposedly a city that has a hospital that is a centre of excellence, where somebody very close to me could not get an MRI scan even though they had stage 4 cancer.</p>  <p>  I will not go on, because I would not be able to.  I will stick to the issue, namely, that this motion focuses and puts a spotlight on the much bigger issue that we are commodifying and making products of our health system.  The senior Minister is off in Dubai at an expo, where, I understand, the difficulty is that companies are upset because they do not have enough three access to the HSE in the context of selling their products.  The Minister should be at home here talking about the importance of universal healthcare service for all, including patients who have cancer that we all know about, and not off in Dubai.   It is simply unacceptable.  We have been through all of this and the criticisms and limitations of health service before.  That is why we brought in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Deputy Shortall did a great job as chairperson, as did the relevant committee, in producing the action plan.  They did so in order that we could avoid these type of excuses for debates in which we share anecdotes about who has suffered in our families.  It is important to share those stories; I am not belittling it at all.  However, we should be beyond that in terms of strategy and implementation of it.  That is why the Minister should be here to be held to account.</p></speech>

It is greatly appreciated.  We all have cancer care groups in our communities.  I could talk about Gort and Ballinasloe and all the Deputies have them in their constituencies as well.  That relief valve is important in our communities, especially for those of us who live in rural areas.  We depend on those groups because they are a means of supporting people in the community and act as the access point to information and understanding in this regard.  We talk about the local bus link and those people who volunteer to drive cars as well.  We cannot have a motion like this and not acknowledge their existence and what those people do to support families.</p>  <p>  As we have already heard, this Government has prioritised the delivery of the national cancer strategy and invested significantly in improved services and supports for cancer patients, including the provision of almost &euro;100 million in new development funding in the last two years alone.  This funding has enabled improvements such as the development and launch of Ireland&rsquo;s first national skin cancer prevention plan; new referral pathways for patients with suspected cancer; the appointment of national clinical leads in psycho-oncology, cancer nursing and children, adolescents and young adults; the opening of a new radiation oncology facility in Cork and the construction of a new facility in Galway; further centralisation of cancer surgery in the eight designated centres; the repatriation of the CAR-T targeted immunotherapy services to Ireland; and increased use of previously-approved cancer drugs with increased patient numbers.</p>  <p>  We are also continuing to develop survivorship services, including psycho-oncology services, to improve the quality of life of those living with and beyond cancer.  Patients consistently identified the psychological impact of cancer as one of the most enduring challenges of a cancer diagnosis, which can occur at any point in the cancer experience.  I do not want to labour the point about progress being made and I understand that this debate is focused on the financial challenges facing some people with cancer.  It is important, however, that the House does not lose sight of the improvements in cancer care made in recent years, even as Deputies rightly seek to identify areas where we can improve further.</p>  <p>  One of the areas of improvement identified by Deputies is hospital car parking charges.  These charges are often highlighted as an additional burden on cancer patients and others who must attend hospitals frequently.  That is why the programme for Government commits to introducing a cap on the maximum daily charge for car parking for patients and visitors to all public hospitals, where possible, as well as to the introduction of flexible passes for patients and their families.  This subject arose when I met with the local patient advocate from the Irish Cancer Society.  In my experience, it was a burden, as was even trying to find a space in the local hospital car park.  Designated spaces should be provided to ensure ease of access, because we are talking about very frail people who need to move from the car to the oncology unit.  Therefore, not only should parking charges be capped, but parking should also be designated and in a more appropriate setting.  Spaces should not be at the back of the car park which can mean patients might have to walk 300 m when they do not have the strength to do so.</p>  <p>  How this commitment can best be addressed is being considered, taking into account existing arrangements.  While this process is ongoing, the HSE has advised that hospitals which currently charge car parking fees are cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs.  Many hospitals have introduced maximum daily fixed parking charges and have reduced parking rates for long-term patients and visitors where the full rate would cause hardship.  Having said that, it is only as good as it is communicated at local level.  There must be better and clearer communication from local hospitals regarding how people can access those supports.  That would be a help in itself.  The use of debt collection services has also been referred to.  Debt collection is managed at a local hospital level and the Minister has been assured by the HSE that any such activity is managed in a socially responsible, ethical, efficient and cost-efficient way.</p>  <p>  This debate has highlighted the financial burden that long-term illnesses, such as cancer, can place on individuals and their families.  It has also shown that help is available and we must ensure that people know how to access those supports, whether applying for a medical card or seeking other assistance.  The Government is taking steps to address longstanding issues of affordability in access to healthcare.  Budget 2022 again provided significant funding towards achieving universal health care and its three pillars of affordability, quality and accessibility, as envisaged by the programme for Government.  Specific affordability measures being advanced under budget 2022 include the extension of GP care without charges to children aged six and seven; the abolition of inpatient charges for children aged 16 or less; dedicated funding of &euro;30 million to ensure access for patients to new innovative medicines; a reduction in the drugs payment scheme, DPS, threshold to &euro;100 per month from 1 January; and the provision of additional funding to enable progress to be made in addressing issues around access to community dental health services for medical card patients in 2022.  The reduction in the DPS threshold and funding for innovative medicines may benefit cancer patients more directly, but the other measures will also ease the financial pressure on individuals with cancer and their families, depending on their circumstances.  Moreover, in line with commitments made in the Department of Health&rsquo;s statement of strategy, a review of the eligibility and charges system is planned.  This reflects the fact that eligibility and some charges have been highlighted as a potential obstacle to patient access to healthcare.</p>  <p>  Our current system successfully protects many people from financial hardship due to illness, but clearly there are gaps that we must address.  The Minister for Health is committed to addressing those eligibility anomalies or barriers to ensure the health system cares for those in greatest need first.  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare policy, however, the Minister believes that this aim is best achieved through a systemic and strategic approach to universal healthcare.  It is generally acknowledged that Ireland has an unusually complex system of entitlements to publicly-financed health services.  A focus on waiving fees or charges for individuals based on a particular medical condition would only increase that complexity, while potentially also creating issues of equity and, indeed, feasibility.  The Government is instead committed to continuing to make progressive steps towards the provision of universal health care in the months and years ahead.</p>  <p>  We have shown what is possible in our response to Covid-19 by providing universal access to testing, diagnosis and treatment for Covid-19 without charge and extending free teleconsultations for all Covid-related symptoms to the whole population.  It is incumbent on us to learn from that experience and to develop services so that people with cancer, or indeed other illnesses, can access the right services based on need and not on the ability to pay.  The Government will continue to invest in our health service and will work to improve protection and supports for those on lower incomes, while continuing to expand capacity and service provision.  The implementation of the structural reforms we are progressing will ensure that all patients, including those with cancer, will get faster and more efficient treatment, regardless of means.</p></speech>

I also welcome the return of people to the Gallery who have a particular interest in this area.  I acknowledge Erica Tierney.  She is the patient advocate in my area and we chat regularly.</p>  <p>  We purposely kept this motion narrow and focused because we think this is something that can be done.  The Minister of State said she would have liked to have deviated from the script and I wish that she had.</p> <p>I did not hear the opposition to debt collectors or immediacy regarding scrapping the inpatient charge.  The Minister of State said that will come within the context of a review.  There is no amendment opposing the motion, but neither am I hearing that the Government is going to do something in the immediate term, in particular regarding debt collectors and inpatient charges.  <br/><br/>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her family well.  I had a very similar experience on a couple of occasions in our household and I know what it is like when it comes.  It is a bolt out of the blue because we all assume good health and this comes as a complete shock.  When somebody gets a diagnosis, there is very often surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  People think about things like their own survival.  The last thing they think about is the financial implication, until they are forced to.  The last thing people expect is a bill.  I could not get over actually seeing such a bill.  I am sure that is how others feel.  I do not think people expect to see a debt collector at their door.  It is inhumane and has to stop.<br/><br/>There is a reality facing cancer patients.  When we talk about medical cards, we need to ask who is being impacted by what we are trying to do here.  There are people who do not have health insurance and do not qualify for a medical card.  I accept that there are fully discretionary medical cards, but they take quite a bit of time to get and are not always granted.  We are discussing the group in the middle, which is very often looking at their household income and wondering what they can cut out, because of housing costs, the increase in the cost of living and all of that.  Very often, health insurance is not an option for people in that group.  The qualifying criteria for a medical card for a single person living alone is &euro;184.  That is below the minimum social welfare rate.  The qualifying criteria for a medical card for a household with two adults and two children is &euro;342.  The qualifying criteria for medical cards involve very low levels of income.<br/><br/>Last year I received a response on the take from parking charges in hospitals.  In University Hospital Galway, the take in 2019 was &euro;1.4 million.  The following year, the take was &euro;630,000.  The difference was that visitors were not allowed visit the hospital because of Covid.  Those figures show these charges affect patients.  In Waterford, the take went from &euro;1.2 million in 2019 to &euro;469,000 in 2020.  Covid has given us that piece of data.  This is not exclusive to cancer care, but it gives us a picture of the kind of money involved.  I was told there are no parking charges in ten hospitals and charges can vary considerably depending on the hospitals.  Some hospitals have introduced a cap, and I want to acknowledge that.<br/><br/>Cancer is very stressful and stress does not help health outcomes.  We need to consider what it is like for a person facing that financial burden.  When Sl&aacute;intecare was introduced, it was expected this would be one of the things that would be dealt with in year one, but we are still not hearing when inpatient charges will be dispensed with.  We want people to focus on their recovery when they get a diagnosis.  <br/><br/>A study by the ESRI found that almost half of all cancer patients found their cancer prospects were negatively impacted by their work environment, with the highest negative impacts reported by women, younger workers, the self-employed and those in the public service, which is of concern.  We need to examine what exactly that involves.  The same study found that the financial impact of cancer was driving cancer patients back to the workforce long before they were ready, which is not good for healthcare outcomes.  <br/><br/>A survey by the Marie Keating Foundation found that more than half of patients focus more on financial difficulties than their own treatment, recovery and well-being.  I understand the conference in Dubai is about wellness and well-being.  We would like to introduce a bit of that into the care of our cancer patients.  I find the facts as odds with why the conference was prioritised in the way it was.  I thank both Ministers of State for being here.<br/><br/>The St. Vincent de Paul told us it has received 1,400 requests for assistance since 2019 from people who are struggling financially with a cancer diagnosis.  It told us it recently began supporting a one-parent family with three children, the second youngest of whom is being treated for cancer and is required to attend weekly appointments in Dublin.  The parent had no childcare so all three children had to travel to hospital, costing about &euro;90 in petrol, tolls, parking and specialist snacks for the child that is ill, before the family car broke down and the parent had to take out a loan.  That is the kind of thing that completely throws a family.  When people have to give up work because they are caring for a family member, we can see the kind of costs that are involved.<br/><br/>Our motion is not so wide that what is proposed is not achievable.  It looks for a very deliberate and limited changes to ensure that people will not have debt collectors on their doorsteps and inpatient charges are dispensed with.  I do not think people expect to see that kind of bill coming to the door, in addition to their diagnosis.  I would also like to acknowledge the work done by the <i>Irish Examiner</i>in a series which described people's personal experiences.  People understand things better when they hear about the personal experiences of others, but it should not come to that.<br/><br/>The past two years of the pandemic have been incredible, and we all know that.  We know there will be late diagnoses and the number of people who are impacted by cancer will escalate rather than reduce.  The last thing we want to do is have people miss care and appointments because the financial burden does not allow them to do that.<br/><br/>The &euro;80 inpatient charge needs to go and parking charges, at the very minimum, need to be reduced.  I accept that ownership is not straightforward, and the nature of our health service means the system is quite fragmented, there are voluntary hospitals which are not under the HSE and so on.  If there is a will there is a way to deal with this and reduce the burden.  Car parking charges are a significant burden on households and individuals.  I would like to have heard something very focused from the Minister of State and for her to provide timelines.  I did not hear that today.  That aspect is very disappointing.  We will follow up on this.</p></speech>

She is from Tallaght in Dublin and she has spina bifida.  She has been waiting for more than a year and a half for corrective surgery.  As a result of this wait, Ava lives in considerable and daily pain because her feet have turned in on themselves and her condition is worsening.  Her mother says that it is increasingly difficult for Ava to hold her splint in place.  She needs this to keep her feet straight.  Ava says it is increasingly difficult for her to do everyday things.  Her feet keep getting caught in her pants when she tries to dress herself and she does not want anyone to see her feet.  Ava, like every child, simply wants to do the things that her friends do.  She so badly needs this operation.  She said, "It would make my feet straight and I can tell everybody that my feet are normal."  Ava's story is not unique.  Some 90,000 children are on some form of waiting list.  Hundreds of children wait for years for urgent, life-changing orthopaedic surgery for conditions like spina bifida and scoliosis.  Many children with spina bifida wait for between one and four years.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;na Keightley of the Spina Bifida Paediatric Advocacy Group outlined what this means for these children, stating, "They are having open sores and wounds.  They are having skin breakdown and infection.  There is extreme mental distress to their families and to the children themselves and some of them have actually become inoperable," because they have waited for so long.  They are inoperable, having waited for a procedure to which they are entitled, but now it is too late for them.  Orthopaedic consultant Dr. Connor Green told the Joint Committee on Health in November that children's potential is being destroyed, physically and psychologically, because of all of this.  Due to the wait, children who once walked independently are now in wheelchairs.  This is a failure of vulnerable children.</p>  <p>  Time is of the essence.  The longer these children wait for surgical intervention, the more complex the procedures they eventually need.  The wait is ruining their chance and right to a normal life, free of pain.  It is not good enough for them to be simply let be.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r don Rialtas gn&iacute;omh a dh&eacute;anamh i gcomhair na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; ag fanacht ar obr&aacute;id&iacute; spina bifida agus scoliosis.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin p&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhaint as na liosta&iacute; feithimh.  Chinnteodh infheist&iacute;ocht de &euro;5 milli&uacute;n go bhfaigheadh na p&aacute;ist&iacute; seo na hobr&aacute;id&iacute; at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il go g&eacute;ar uathu.</p>  <p>  The Government could act today to end the agonising wait for these children, to get them off the waiting lists and ensure that they have the life-changing procedures they desperately need.  For a relatively modest investment of &euro;5 million, the additional capacity necessary could be delivered to clear these lists.  This funding request has been with the Government and Minister for Health for two years.  I want to know why this money has not been allocated.  It is the best &euro;5 million the Government could spend.  It would make a huge difference to children's lives, free them from serious pain, improve their long-term outcomes, and relieve their families of the most immense stress and worry.  Children should not have to display their agony, shed their tears on national television, or protest outside the D&aacute;il to get the healthcare they need and which they are fully entitled to.</p></speech>

I express my deepest sympathies to Mary and to the family on the death of Noel Treacy, who had a long and distinguished public life.  He came into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1982.  He served as Minister in many portfolios, including at the Department of the Taoiseach and in roles with responsibility for European affairs and education and science.  Aire tiomanta agus f&iacute;or-scrupallach a bh&iacute; ann.  He performed a great public service throughout his life.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.  Again, I express my deepest sympathies to Mary and the family.</p>  <p>  I saw the piece on RT&Eacute; at the weekend about children waiting for surgery and orthopaedic surgery.  Additional funding has been made available to the health service and the HSE to address waiting times and waiting lists, for Crumlin, Temple Street and Cappagh.  Children's Health Ireland, CHI, has the capacity to free up space so that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis and spinal fusion, can be carried out at CHI sites.  It is not and should not be an issue of funding.  It is unacceptable that children have to wait for so long for urgent surgery.  Covid impacted on it.  Hospitals received instructions prior to Christmas relating to public health advice to prioritise, for public health reasons, the capacity within hospitals for Covid and issues relating to the Omicron variant and during earlier surges.  In 2022, &euro;350 million has been made available to improve waiting times.  That includes &euro;150 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Whatever immediate capacity measures can be developed should be developed, because the funding is there to do it.</p>  <p>  I listened to Dr. Connor Green on the radio during the week.  He stated that it is a priority that they be treated on CHI sites to facilitate follow-up on treatment for the child who has had surgery.  I have sought a meeting with Children's Health Ireland about this, as well as with the HSE.  Anything that can be done to reduce these waiting times for those who need urgent surgery has to and should be done.  I want to get a proper assessment of waiting times for children on the list, how long individual children are waiting, and the reasons for that.</p></speech>

Immediately after the election the Government set up a Commission on Pensions which published its report last October.  The trade union-led campaign, Stop 67, was successful in the interim and the proposed increase was stopped.  The commission report proposed to freeze the pension age until 2028 and then to begin phased increases by increments of three months to reach 67 by 2031 and then to rise by three months every two years to hit 68 by 2039.  As part of the next steps, the Government also sought the views of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection.  The commission's report was referred to the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment which is to bring recommendations for implementation by the end of March.</p>  <p>  Today the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, in its response to the report of the Commission on Pensions, made a series of landmark recommendations which are clearly at odds with the recommendations of the Commission on Pensions last October.  Today's report proposes that the State pension age should not rise beyond the age of 66.  It makes the very important point that this cross-party committee of the House which looked at the facts is unconvinced that the gradual increase in the pension age would have any meaningful impact on the fiscal position of the Social Insurance Fund.  It proposes to boost funding for the Social Insurance Fund with a series of PRSI increases.  It also calls for a ban on the use of mandatory retirement ages.  One of the most important recommendations is that we should now build flexibility into our pension system to allow those with 40 years of contributions to access a State pension at the age of 65.  Many people now approaching retirement age started working in their teens and in some cases, have worked for 40 or 50 years since then, paying their taxes and social contributions.</p>  <p>  Will the Government accept the recommendation of the cross-party committee that the pension age should stay at its current age of 66?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that legislation will be brought forward to ban the use of mandatory retirement clauses?  Will the Government act to allow those with 40 years of contributions to access their pension at 65, as recommended by the all-party committee?</p></speech>

As a former member of Government, Deputy Howlin realises the enormous issue facing society because we are living longer, which is a good thing.  In the last 50 years, the transformation of health has been extraordinary.  In the last 100 years the average life span has increased by 25 years in this country, which is quite a dramatic transformation from when the State was founded.  In the last 20 years in particular, survival rates from heart disease, cancer and stroke have been dramatically transformed.  It is a good story that we are living longer but it clearly has implications for pensions and for how we sustain society in the context of longer lives, thanks be to God, and greater access to healthcare, interventions and so on.  That was the work of the Commission on Pensions which was established and the Cabinet committee referred its report to the Oireachtas, which is what was agreed.  The Oireachtas has now considered it and made its report.</p>  <p>  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare is also relevant.  The findings of the Commission on Pensions will also be examined by the Commission on Taxation and Welfare because it is all interrelated in terms of how we sustain the system.  I have not read the cross-party committee's report in detail but look forward to doing so.  I think Deputy Howlin said that it is suggesting PRSI increases.  That is interesting.</p></speech>

I understand, by the way, why that would be a recommendation.  The Cabinet committee will look at this after the publication of the report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  We said we would look at the pensions issue six months after we got the Commission on Pensions report, which will be the end of March.  We intend to come back to the House on that.</p>  <p>  We support the banning of mandatory retirement clauses.  People should be allowed to continue to work if that is their wish and their choice.  That makes sense relative to the fact that we are living longer.  There will not be any easy choices here.  Politicians tend to reach for the easy choices, if we are all honest.  Not every Oireachtas committee goes for the pain option.  I have been there.</p></speech>

When I was in opposition the last time, the only committee that did its work honourably, or at least the majority did, was the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  It made recommendations that were not palatable electorally but Oireachtas committees are not often disposed to making recommendations that are electorally unpalatable.  That said, I will read the report and I accept the points made regarding the core principles.  We need to engage further.</p></speech>

I have served in government in the past and this is a difficult decision.  It is not an easy decision but the fact that an all-party committee looked at this and came up with solutions that are fiscally sound is something that must carry weight in this House.</p>  <p>  Covid has changed the way we look at work and our attitudes to work location, flexibility and the nature of work itself.  It should also change our attitude to and fixed policies on pensions, pension age and so on.  A very coherent argument was made by the Chairman of the Oireachtas committee, Deputy Naughten, this morning and I ask the Government to approach this with a very open mind and not to focus on what was done in the past or on people's position in the past.  Instead, it should say that in the post-Covid era, everything is up for review.  Hopefully we can agree that we can have the recommendations of the all-party committee accepted.</p></speech>

It did genuine, bona fide work.</p> <p>It is work that will feed in.  The joint committee has examined that.  The Deputy made the point that it is fiscally sound.  That will be examined.  It has to be fiscally sound.  There is no point pretending to future generations or leaving them short because this generation has not devised policy responses that guarantee and sustain pensions well into the future and decades ahead.  That has to be a core objective of the entire House.

The families and individuals living in St. Helen's Court will face an application by a vulture fund, Mill Street Projects, to evict them into homelessness this Friday.  These are decent, ordinary working people who have done absolutely nothing wrong.  They have always paid their rent.  They are still paying their rent.  They have never been guilty of any anti-social behaviour.  They had a community, one that has been wrecked.  There used to be 20 tenants in it but others have been bullied out by two successive vulture funds.  The tenants have been tortured by these vulture funds over four years and now face homelessness.  This is because of the Government's refusal to ban no-fault evictions.  There is no justification that should allow the law to facilitate a vulture fund, for no other reason than profit, to put people on the street but our law allows it.</p>  <p>  There is absolutely no justification for the fact that in the same block there are 12 and now maybe 15 empty apartments beside the apartments from which these tenants are now to be evicted which the landlord claimed at the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, it wanted to rent but, strangely enough, it will not rent to the tenants it is about to evict.  Those apartments have been allowed to sit there for two years.  I have flagged this again and again.  Why are compulsory purchase powers not used to get hold of these empty apartments that could not only prevent people going on the street but could house 12 to 15 other families?  What alternatives are available to these tenants?</p>  <p>  Under the HAP limits, the individuals in St. Helen's Court can seek a maximum rent of &euro;990 for a one-bedroom apartment.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire today, the cheapest one-bedroom apartment is &euro;1,300.  The next one is &euro;1,600 and the next one after than is &euro;1,900.  The maximum the families can look for is &euro;1,900 for a three-bedroom apartment.  The cheapest available in D&uacute;n Laoghaire at the moment is &euro;2,400.  All of these tenants are goosed and will be forced into homelessness because we have failed to protect not just these tenants but any other tenants faced with this situation.</p></speech>

In particular, the Tyrrelstown amendment provides that where a landlord proposes to sell ten or more units in a single development at the same time, that sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ</i>, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>The Deputy, to be fair to him, has raised the situation in St. Helen's Court involving five tenants or families, which is unacceptable.  Under existing constitutional frameworks, there is a balance to be struck in terms of how far we can go in legislation.  Any proposals that would just remove a landlord's right to terminate a tenancy could be subject to and would carry the risk of constitutional challenge.  We have asked the housing commission to prioritise consideration of a constitutional amendment regarding a referendum on housing in respect of these issues.  Fundamentally, that is where we have to go to ensure that situations like this one do not happen in the manner that it is happening.</p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has told the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that it will do everything it possibly can to ensure the five families do not fall into homelessness as a result of what is transpiring with the landlord in this case.  The commission on housing is looking at issues around tenure, standards, sustainability and quality of life.  As the Deputy will know, the Government has provided for tenancies of unlimited duration through the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021, which means that all new tenancies created on or after 11 June 2022 would become tenancies of unlimited duration after six consecutive months of occupation under the tenancy without a valid notice of termination having been served.</p><p>Anything that can possibly be done, we are doing within the legal constraints to protect tenants as much as we possibly can.  We have committed in the programme for Government to a referendum on housing.  That work is being prioritised by the housing commission.  It is fundamental to the core issue the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

There will be a solidarity rally on Friday.</p>  <p>  None of the things the Taoiseach has just mentioned would protect these tenants.  The tenancies of indefinite duration still allow a vulture fund to evict tenants under these circumstances.  I do not buy the constitutional obstacles to protecting tenants.  During Covid the Government brought in an eviction ban under pressure.  What happened?  The number of people going into homelessness fell from over 10,000 to 7,000 and would have kept falling except for the fact the Government lifted that ban.  It was able to do it during Covid; it can do it now.  Why does it not do it?</p>  <p>  The Tyrrelstown amendment provides that if there are more than ten tenants in a multi-unit complex, they cannot be evicted.  This vulture fund tried to evict ten, did not get away with it, came back and evicted fewer than ten and then bullied the rest out.  If it can be done for ten tenants, it can be done for anybody.   The Government must protect them from unfair evictions.  It should not allow vulture funds to evict people for profit and it must control rents so that the landlords cannot charge these extortionate rents.</p></speech>

It was possible during Covid because of lockdown and the 5 km rule.  The legal advice was that in that context, in a lockdown scenario, one could do it but one could not do it outside of that where people could move to get alternative accommodation.  When people were restricted to the 5 km rule the legal judgment was made that we could freeze evictions.  That was the legal advice presented to us in that regard.</p>  <p>  On ten houses versus five, again it was a question of balance in terms of how at risk would one be constitutionally and open to challenge if one did anything less because there are competing rights here in terms of the Constitution and the law.</p></speech>

The Minster for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, intervened with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and told it that under no circumstances should the Shannon LNG project be given planning permission because it would be in opposition to the programme for Government and the commitment not to import LNG.  The Minister believes the project would not make sense because it would conflict with the programme for Government.  The T&aacute;naiste said last week, as quoted in the newspapers at the weekend, that the Government would not prevent the Shannon LNG project from going ahead if it received planning permission.  I need to know what the Taoiseach's position is.

The reason for the refusal was the Irish Water report in the planning in which it stated that water supply deficiencies are too high in the Clonakilty area to allow extra development.  In my time as a councillor between 2004 and 2016, water problems in Clonakilty were being seriously recognised.  Cork County Council developed a strategy to augment the supply to Clonakilty by drawing water from Curraghalicky Lake at Drinagh via a new pipeline.  However, when Irish Water took over the running of water and sewerage these plans were abandoned.  This has been a disaster for future growth in Clonakilty.  To make matters worse, the county development plan is zoning more grounds for development in Clonakilty at the cost of rural surrounds when the council knows full well that no development can now take place due to lack of water.  This is a huge blow not only to Clonakilty but to the surrounding areas of Timoleague and Rosscarbery as the growth of one of west Cork's biggest towns is now at a standstill.  Will the Taoiseach, through his office, immediately work with Irish Water to find the funds for a new water scheme for Clonakilty and its surrounding areas?</p></speech>

Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan has been raising this issue with me for some months now and has outlined and articulated the problem.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is also engaging with Irish Water on this issue, which seems to be a different scheme from the one the Deputy is talking about.  Irish Water is talking about a major connection between Bandon, I think, and Clonakilty and says the length of time that will take is considerable.  There are a number of towns in west Cork that will be similarly impacted with respect to the speed of getting connections and so on.  Therefore, we will engage with Irish Water on this question.</p></speech>

The existing 25 beds in the Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit will be transferred to Nenagh in order to justify a bigger unit.  The HSE has consistently ignored all representations to correct this absurd and unacceptable situation.  It is obviously running the show and is dictating policy.  The Ministers with responsibility appear to have no say or zero influence with the HSE.  Is it the policy of the Government to downgrade the Dean Maxwell unit?  Will the Taoiseach please tell the people of Roscrea he is not going to stand back and allow the HSE to close the long-stay unit?  On behalf of the people of Roscrea, I am asking him to insist on the HSE investing in a modern facility offering a broad range of services, one which caters for the needs of older people and incorporates a bed complement for residential care for the people of the town.  I also ask that the day centre be reopened.  It has not opened since Covid, which is causing considerable disruption for people and anger.</p></speech>

I am not talking about bushes that are alive.  These are bushes that were cut during the winter season and are then piled up and usually burned in the spring when they dry out a bit.  As a result of the non-signing of the derogation, they will now have to be mulched.  I ask Deputies to excuse me for being slightly out of breath.  I was running late.  The bushes will be mulched using vehicles with diesel engines so I question the benefit to the environment.  This is a huge inconvenience to farmers and there has been no lead-in time.  I ask the Taoiseach whether this derogation will be signed because until now, his Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has declined to sign it.</p></speech>

The latest phases in major road upgrades around the country for this year have been shelved by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, citing insufficient funding.  These include the N4 Mullingar to Longford upgrade, which has now been more than 20 years in gestation.  It is a critical piece of infrastructure for the region and, given the road's inclusion in the national development plan, NDP, there was a realistic expectation locally that this road would proceed.  Will An Taoiseach indicate whether additional funding can be provided to ensure that the next phase of this road upgrade proceeds as hoped?</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, a whole range of projects have been at different stages of development, whether it be route appraisal and so on.  We will have to engage with the Department and TII with a view to how these projects can be progressed.  Some only have to move to route selection, which would not entail a whole lot of money in the short term.  I am of the view that planning of projects should continue.  A difficulty may eventually come when we get to the end of the planning stage, but so many people have their lands sterile, for example, without having any indication as to when their lands can be utilised for one purpose or another.  They are waiting to see if they will be subject to compulsory purchase order or whatever.  It is not fair to people to be kept waiting so long.  In addition, there is the issue of actually getting the roads done.</p></speech>

Would that be an opportunity for us to have serious consideration of putting in place very serious consequences for any such future attacks on women in Ireland?</p></speech>

Legislation was one of the areas raised, along with others.  The Oireachtas should look at this through the Joint Committee on Justice.  I know that the families of women who have been murdered are very aggrieved at the current situation in respect of their being alerted to parole requests, for example.  There needs to be a more victim-centred approach to all of this.  Sentencing for this violence should be hard, strong and very clear.  Again, I favour the justice committee examining the issue in more detail.</p></speech>

The lofty words spoken at those launches about commitment to rural, regional and all-Ireland development actually count for very little when compared with the failure to deliver the infrastructure projects our regions require.  We recently learned that the actions of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Government have resulted in the TII stalling the next planning phase of the Clontibret to the Border N2 road scheme, for example.  Money was diverted from that project to pet projects of the Minister.  The actions of TII at the behest of the Government could permanently condemn a project that was a key component of several peace process talks and is an integral infrastructure project for a region that has no rail network and a pathetic level of public transport options.  Will the Taoiseach outline today whether he will ensure that this decision is reversed and the funding for this infrastructure project will be restored?</p></speech>

Since the Government took up office significant inroads have been made, including the provision of new bed blocks.  Many good things are happening, but there is still a very acute problem with trolley numbers.  On 26 January, this number again broke national records with 111 people waiting for beds.  The situation has been described by the Irish Nurse and Midwives Organisation's Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha as being "out of control."  In recent days, Tony O'Brien, the former director general of the HSE, recommended that the mid-west, and UHL specifically, have an elective-only hospital.  Sl&aacute;intecare has recommended elective hospitals for Galway, Cork and Dublin.  I am asking the Taoiseach, as helmsman of the Government, to try to push for the mid-west to have its own elective hospital to end once and for all the incessant waiting times crisis we have in the region.</p></speech>

In the health service generally, capital projects are moving too slowly.  The elective process has gone on for five or six years through different working parties, in addition to people, consultants and administrators having different views.  The Government has taken a decision to press ahead with elective-only hospitals for Cork, Galway and, latterly, Dublin.  My advice to the Deputy is to look at State-owned land and to come up with a very clear focus for the region.  We will then go after it and get it done.</p></speech>

I have appealed to the T&aacute;naiste to engage with the company to explore all avenues as a means to protect those jobs.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to take a proactive approach and to engage with the company to ensure that every single cost-saving exercise is being explored to try to save those jobs.

We have moved on very substantially since then, but despite the fact that the Irish Central Bank reports to the European Central Bank, as do all others in the EU 27, we now have the worst reputation in the world in process, procedure and turnaround time.  If it continues the way it is going, the Central Bank will be the only bank left in Ireland.  Is it the intention that it will face the public and begin to offer retail services?

A decision was taken by the Oireachtas in respect of taking competition out of the Central Bank's remit.  There are issues in terms of bank competition in Ireland.  We know that.  There are other issues as well, but I do not have time now to go into the detail.</p></speech>

I thank the Government and previous Governments for their support of that airport.  I know that the Taoiseach personally recognises the importance of it.  On behalf of everyone working at that excellent facility, from the ladies who make the tea to those operating the controls in the tower and so on, I ask that the Taoiseach would ensure it is always supported.  There are great plans for the future growth of the airport.  It is of massive importance for us from an economic point of view and a connectivity point of view be that with Germany or other parts of Europe.  Connected to Dublin, it is our hub in terms of travel around the world.  One can travel to Australia from Farranfore airport if you get two aeroplanes.  It is our step to the rest of the world and the step from the rest of world to us.  The importance of it can never be underestimated.  I am asking for continued support from the Taoiseach and the Government for the airport.</p></speech>

The airport is very valuable and important to the economic development of the region and to the social life of the region.  With the development of the Munster Technological University, there are great opportunities and synergies to be had in terms of increased investment in Tralee Munster Technology University, along with the airport.  We are fully behind that.</p></speech>

While the scheme is very welcome, there are thousands of people excluded from it.  I had a meeting with some of them yesterday.  These are people who have made lives here and for various reasons are excluded.  For example, people who have been temporarily documented within the past four years cannot avail of it, those who have expired student permissions will not qualify and those who are on temporary visas and have cases in the EU treaty rights division are also excluded.  These are thousands of people who, by right, should be able to avail of the scheme but cannot.  The scheme is being described as a "once in a generation scheme".  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to amend the scheme to ensure that all these people are included.</p></speech>

I think we should get on with this scheme.  Migration policy is evolving.  It is a very progressive and important scheme.  We will continue to evaluate it as it is progressed and rolled out.  It is a ground breaking scheme relative to how we have dealt with this issue in the past.  Lessons can be learned as we roll it out and we can get greater analysis as to what the true situation is out there in respect of the people the Deputy has identified this morning.</p></speech>

Across the globe, biodiversity, nature and wildlife are in peril, nowhere more so than in Ireland.  Climate change, habitat loss, habitat destruction and illegal poisoning have all led to a point where 54 of all bird species are now red listed, which means they are critically endangered.  There has been an 81% loss in wetland species over a 50-year period.  We need to act now.  We need to convene a citizens' assembly now because we need to start addressing this biodiversity crisis straightaway.</p></speech>

I know he has a life-long commitment to this area.  In that context, I intend to bring to Cabinet shortly proposals for a citizens' assembly on biodiversity.  It is absolutely critical that we move on this and that we move with speed and conviction.  I intend to do that.</p></speech>

The programme for Government sets out a clear commitment to these vital services within our communities.  In Laois-Offaly, my constituency, there is a serious problem in that services there have not resumed.  It has been brought to my attention that the services in Abbeyleix, Mountmellick and Portlaoise are all closed.  We have been informed that the services at Abbeyleix hospital are to be relocated.  This has come as a huge shock because it is such a vital and important service within our community.  I ask the Taoiseach to take action to ensure that these services are reopened as urgently as possible.</p></speech>

This is a much-needed programme that was proposed in the Nolan and Geiran reports.  It is an excellent mechanism of support for communities and a grassroots, ground-up way of dealing with issues.  Is the Government committed to rolling out this programme and, if so, when will it be rolled out and when will we see it for other areas?  In recent weeks, Deputies, councillors and local activists have been meeting with great concern around an increase in anti-social behaviour, violence and criminality in parts of Dublin South Central.  It has been described as being on a knife-edge and could very much go the wrong way.  When will the place-based leadership development programme be rolled out to other areas?  There are several areas I know that desperately need it.</p></speech>

It comes three weeks after the awful murder of Ashling Murphy.  There was another attack last week on a woman in Kilkenny.  Our thoughts are with these women and their families.  Violence against women is an epidemic.  We are all agreed that consistent action is needed to eliminate it.  The women of Cork and Ireland need to know that they are safe on the streets, in their homes and everywhere.</p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, this House passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion which proposed the establishment of a dedicated unit in the Department of An Taoiseach to co-ordinate a gender-based violence strategy and delivery of actions.  What is the timeline for the delivery of this unit?  It would be a big step forward.</p></speech>

Approximately a fortnight ago, it was announced in the House that the Minister for Justice would lead on policy and services in respect of violence against women and that a new strategy will be published, hopefully, in March.  There will then be accountability to the Department of An Taoiseach and the Cabinet subcommittee and there will be a unit in my Department to co-ordinate the work of all Departments.  It has to be a whole-of-Government response to this issue to make sure that the targets within the strategy that will be published by the Minister for Justice will be fulfilled and followed through.</p></speech>

I congratulate and thank the Government - I should say our Government - for the belated wisdom in amending the Department of Transport's provisional tender questionnaire for the Irish Coast Guard air and sea rescue services.  It comes as a great relief to all of us in the south east who rely on this service.  It begs the question as to whether a larger strategic game is being played here.  There was no committee of inquiry and no business case analysis.  It was amazing how quickly the questionnaire could be amended.  To be fair, I do not think there was anything to fear from the Department of Transport in terms of it looking for a reduction in helicopters because I do not think it can be done.  Rather, what was afoot here was the putting down of a marker that the Department wants the flexibility to close Waterford Airport.</p> <p>It was interesting listening to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae ask for support for Kerry Airport.  In the past year, as the Taoiseach knows, the Government has withdrawn &euro;350,000 in stopgap funding and excluded Waterford Airport from aviation supports totalling &euro;180 million.  I say this against the backdrop of capital spending in the State that is now cresting &euro;10 billion.  The south east represents 10% of the country's population and yet we are on course at present to get 2% of the capital funding.  Plans for our new engineering buildings at Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology appear to have been mothballed.  There is no further funding to build on the existing land banks we have.  The new engineering building for Waterford Institute of Technology was promised in 2009 and committed to again in 2014.  Improvements to the N24 and N25 - vital arterial routes in a region with limited public transport options -  are required, but these have been quietly withdrawn in the past few weeks.  We have had little progress is developing 24-7 cardiac care.  The north quays project is currently stalled.  The boundary extension to Waterford was gerrymandered some time ago.</p> <p> The list goes on.  The south east has 10% of the people but 2% of the national capital budget.  That does social, economic and cultural damage.  I have a plain question for the Taoiseach.  Is he gunning for our airport?  Will it survive his watch?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200026#Y00200"><p>That last assertion is ridiculous.  No one is gunning for anybody.  The Government does not want to close any airport; it has no interest in closing any airport.  The Minister amended the tender requirements for search and rescue to specify that four bases, in Dublin, Shannon, Sligo and Waterford, would be provided for.  It depends on the lens through which one looks at things.  I think the Deputy is developing a conspiracy theory that does not stack up in respect of the specific issue of a tender for search and rescue.</p>  <p>  The Government allocated &euro;100 million in supports from the urban regeneration and development fund for two projects in Waterford, namely, those relating to Waterford city north quays and Tramore town centre.  It is not the Government's fault that there has been a difficulty in respect of one of those projects.  The Government allocates funding to local authorities on the basis of projects that are submitted to Government.  It is then up to the local authorities and people on the ground to execute those projects and to spend their allocations.  The Government showed its commitment by allocating substantial and record funding under the urban regeneration and development fund.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, along with the T&aacute;naiste, will shortly publish a new south-east regional enterprise plan.  That is a bottom-up plan that has been developed by local stakeholders, including the local authorities, enterprise agencies, local enterprise offices, regional skills fora and education and training institutes in the region.  The plan is progressing very well.  The south-east steering committee will meet next month to sign off on the strategic objectives and supporting actions.  It is then intended to publish the plan.</p>  <p>  There are 74 IDA Ireland client companies now in the south-east region.  These employ 13,461 people.  The foreign direct investment performance in the region has been strong over the past five years.  Employment has risen among IDA Ireland client companies by 24%.  The main clusters in the region, as the Deputy knows, are high-value manufacturing, with more than 10,000 jobs in the life sciences cluster of companies spread right across the region.  That will grow.  The level of foreign direct investment has been positive and that is reflected in the south east.  The region has very important clusters now in technology, engineering and industrial technologies, and international financial services, which are complemented by research centres.  Repligen announced 130 jobs in Waterford in August 2021.  Bausch + Lomb announced 130 jobs in July 2021.  Horizon Therapeutics announced 90 jobs in June 2021.  Trilateral Research announced 40 jobs in Waterford in November 2020.  CSC announced 75 jobs in Wexford in November 2020.  State Street announced 400 jobs in September 2021.  There is also the technological university for the south east.  Great progress has been made on that.  We are hoping all parties are working towards its establishment on 1 May 2022.  Funding has also been provided.  A catheterisation laboratory has also been announced for University Hospital Waterford.</p></speech>

I absolutely concur with that.  The issue I am talking about is an infrastructural piece, which is Waterford Airport.  The Taoiseach accused me of developing conspiracy theories.  I put it to him that &euro;350,000 in annual stopgap funding has been withdrawn and that the airport was excluded from &euro;180 million worth of aviation sector funding.  This is in respect of an airport that is privately supported.  I ask the Taoiseach to give a clear commitment to Waterford Airport.  If he does that, I will not bring the matter up again on the Order of Business.  That is what people want to hear.  Waterford is mentioned in the programme for Government as being the strategic driver of the south-east region.  How are we to do that if we are not to get investment in strategic infrastructure?  I ask the Taoiseach to give a commitment to the future economic support of Waterford regional airport.</p></speech>

We know that payments to healthcare professionals and organisations can create conflicts of interest.  Evidence shows that receipt of payments from the pharmaceutical industry, for example, is associated with higher prescribing rates, higher prescribing costs, increased use of specific drug classes, including opioids, and lower prescribing quality, with consequent impact on health outcomes and, in public health systems, on the public purse.  The popular programme &quot;Dopesick&quot; highlighted an extreme case to great effect in the context of the opioid epidemic in the United States.  In Ireland, tens of millions of euros are paid to healthcare professionals and organisations each year by the pharmaceutical industry.  While a voluntary register of these payments is currently in place, recent research conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland found that the identity of many recipients is anonymous, while other payments may not be reported at all.  Payments from medical equipment suppliers or medical device companies are also excluded.</p><p>The current voluntary system is inadequate.  It is not fit for purpose.  The Healthcare (Transparent Payments) Bill is needed to bring Ireland in line with international best practice and is a measure in the interest of professionals, organisations and the general public.  This legislation would require pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment suppliers to declare all payments to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, on an annual basis and provides for penalties for failure to do so.  The Bill also provides for the HPRA to establish and maintain the register and to ensure it is searchable and accessible to the public.  Such a system will enhance transparency, public trust and ethical standards, while providing a regulated environment for productive collaboration.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We know fees are paid to healthcare professionals or organisations for a range of reasons, including consultancy, speaking events, analysis and medical writing, with no proper record of the payments made and their purpose.  Gifts can also come in the form of conferences and payments for travel, accommodation and registration costs.  Evidence shows that in other jurisdictions, payments and gifts from the pharmaceutical industry are associated with higher prescribing rates and costs for certain products, increased use of specific drug classes and products and lower prescribing quality.  The opioid crisis in the United States, fuelled by payments, gifts and misleading information from a pharmaceutical corporation to prescribers, highlights the need for controls and transparency.</p> <p>A voluntary register exists but it has no teeth.  It is maintained by the pharmaceutical sector and not a regulatory body.  Research from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, found that the identify of many recipients remained anonymous and that other payments were likely not being recorded at all.</p> <p> A huge amount of work needs to be done to create a better culture of transparency in the HSE.  That is for sure.  This deals with a very specific issue, however.  I hope that when we move the Bill on Second Stage, it will be supported by Government.</p></speech>

The Cabinet committee last met on Thursday, 9 December.  It is currently scheduled to meet next on Monday, 28 February.</p>  <p>  In addition to meetings of the full Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I meet with Ministers on an individual basis to focus on different issues.  I meet regularly with the Minister for Health to discuss priorities in the area of health, including Sl&aacute;intecare and, in particular, our management and response to Covid-19.  The health sector faced significant challenges this winter with the surge of the Omicron variant we saw over the Christmas period.  We will now refocus our efforts on the resumption of non-Covid health and social care and progress commitments to reform the health service.</p>  <p>  The year 2022 will see the biggest ever investment in the health system to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, reduce waiting lists, increase capacity, protect the most vulnerable and address inequalities.  Over the coming weeks and months, work will continue to advance a number of priority programmes of work identified in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023, including progressing six new regional health areas, the multiannual waiting list reduction plan and taking steps towards the establishment of elective care centres in counties Dublin, Cork and Galway.</p>  <p>  We will continue our investment in an expanded public health service and embed the lessons learned in the pandemic into community and primary care services.  In this regard, the Minister for Health last week announced the establishment of a public health reform expert advisory group.  The expert group will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic in Ireland, with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically.  The expert group will then examine the key components of the existing delivery models for public health in Ireland, with a view to recommending an appropriate operating model to develop and oversee the delivery of public health in Ireland into the future.</p></reply>

I invite the Taoiseach to confirm for the House that he will instruct the Minister for Health and the HSE to release the necessary funding as a matter of urgency to ensure that this list is cleared and these children have the care they need.</p>  <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of St. Brigid's District Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir.  It was closed in the midst of Covid-19 with the promise that it would be reopened.  Locals have learned that this reopening is not now going to happen.  I commend their campaigning efforts.  In fact, the local campaigners will be before the Joint Committee on Public Petitions today.  They have gathered 11,000 signatures in support of reopening the hospital and seek a meeting with the Taoiseach.

He may have seen this morning the audit of strokes in Ireland, which is a really interesting piece of work highlighting the challenges facing stroke treatment.  Will that be discussed at the Cabinet committee on health to ensure that we improve our responses?</p>  <p>  Over the weekend, concerns were expressed by Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, representatives and other organisations about the need to attract specialists into our regional hospitals, in particular, specialist consultants.  It is becoming increasingly challenging to get consultants to take up positions in regional hospitals.  There is no sense in us piling into the city hospitals when we have really good regional hospitals and health infrastructure regionally.  I ask that a focus be given in terms of enhancing packages to attract people.</p></speech>

One aspect of this, and I have been trying to point this out for a long time, is that CAMHS gets overrun, and often with referrals that probably should not even go to it, because of the lack of community psychology and talk, occupational, speech and language therapy.  This is not just for child and adolescent community psychology, or the lack of it, but also for others.</p>  <p>  I am aware of a case at the moment of a man whose doctors referred him for psychology.  He was told by community psychology in my area that he will have to wait six years for a psychologist.  What happened to primary care?  It does not exist in the area of psychology.  As I have raised repeatedly with the Taoiseach, why do we make it difficult for young people who want to be psychologists to qualify because we do not fund educational and counselling psychology?  We have massive fees of up to &euro;15,000 and similar obstacles in the area of psychiatry for people being qualified.</p></speech>

She has spina bifida, which results in her feet being turned inward making everyday tasks very difficult.  Putting on her shoes on a daily basis is a challenge.  She needs help to put on her trousers.  She has been left waiting for more than a year and a half for corrective surgery with her condition worsening on a daily basis.  Imagine what it is like for her and her family.  They do not even have a date for surgery to look forward to.  Worse still, if her condition continues to deteriorate, it could end up being inoperable.  She is just one of 649 children waiting for surgery, including 56 children with spina bifida.  It is a national scandal.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's earlier response seemed to suggest it is not the Government's problem and that the hospitals have the funds so why do they not just do it?  I put it to the Taoiseach that this does not make any sense.  We need to provide the resources to clear the waiting lists rapidly and build a top-quality Irish national health service.</p></speech>

The programme made a request last year that the HSE would fund posts for at least two new neurology nurses at CUH this year.  The HSE decided not do so.</p>  <p>  This underfunding impacts negatively on the lives of people with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease and others.  It is happening on the watch of the Taoiseach and a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Health.  Will the Taoiseach agree with me that what is happening here falls short of what should be acceptable in a civilized society?  Will he undertake to look very closely at this situation as we head towards the Estimates process this year?</p></speech>

That is on top of the increase last November of &euro;3,000.</p> <p>That is on top of the additional &euro;81,000 on which the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the T&aacute;naiste collectively agreed, without any process, rationale or justification.  There is no justification.  His salary now stands at &euro;297,869.  Compare that to the head of the British NHS, whose salary is &pound;199,000.  Does the Taoiseach recognise just how disgusting this scenario is when he is looking for plaudits for giving front-line healthcare workers &euro;1,000?  He has done virtually nothing for all those workers and families who are struggling to make ends meet.  Yet, he took &euro;87,000 of their money and handed it to one of the highest paid civil servants in the world.  Does the Taoiseach regret his role in this grubby affair?  Will he now move to restore the salary to the Secretary General level at a rate that was based on some level of process?</p></speech>

Government is responsible overall for the delivery of healthcare.  The point I was making earlier was that the funding has been allocated.  A figure of &euro;5 million is not an issue.  I want to make that clear.  Since 2018, which was before I came into office, to be fair, an extra &euro;9 million had been allocated each year to the HSE specifically for the funding of orthopaedic services.  This additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 extra staff in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.</p>  <p>  Improving capacity to allow for additional activity is the key enabler to improve waiting times.  Proposals by the HSE under the waiting list action plan are for funding to extend theatre capacity in Crumlin and in Temple Street.  There has been additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh since April 2021 for day case surgery.  CHI has advised that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting time for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients.</p>  <p>  In 2022, CHI was planning to undertake a range of inpatient day case and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.  There is also planning for additional orthopaedic scoliosis theatre sessions using private facilities that were supported to HSE procurement agreements.  Huge funding has been provided to the health service, both in 2020 during Covid-19 and in 2021, and I mean non-Covid-19 health expenditures.  There was a &euro;600 million allocation given very early in the winter of last year with a view to ensuring that capacity would be increased right along the line.</p>  <p>  We have said repeatedly to the health service operators that where they can get capacity quickly, whether this is theatre capacity or bed capacity, please go and do so.  We said the same for recruiting staff.  A record number of staff was recruited last year because of that extra funding.  This figure was less than they said they were hoping to recruit.  The health service had resources to recruit more last year.  However, because there is obviously a huge demand on key positions and so on, they were not in the position to recruit as many as they would have liked to.  Yet, they still managed to recruit a record number in any one year.  Likewise, the same happened in 2020.</p>  <p>  That said, as far as I am concerned, anything that can be done to make sure that Ava Cahill gets her operation and that other children are not waiting in an inordinate length of time has to be the priority.  It is not about funding.  They need to get the capacity in place so that they can do whatever can be done in the shortest possible term to get it done.</p></speech>

Since stroke units came in well over a decade ago, they have been transformative in terms of the impact on survival from strokes, improvements and prevention.  I heard the consultant on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning in relation to this.  We will examine that audit.  Those clinical strategies are the most effective in health.  While they do not get the same headlines, they have proven to be the most effective way to improve health, prevent injury and prevent disease through cardiovascular strategies, cancer strategies and stroke strategies.  They have been the most effective in improving healthcare and survival rates in this country.  The Deputy is absolutely correct about the challenges facing all of us in attracting specialists to the regions.  That is a both an academic and an advanced medicine problem.  Many consultants and clinicians want to be in centres of tertiary care so that they can get experience, as well as for their career development and so on.  That is where the magnet is.</p>  <p>  The hospital groups are now developing strategies, including a bespoke model, if you like, to enable those at the centre to provide services to hospitals within the group.  I believe that is the way forward.  We need to engage with the colleges, such as various colleges of anaesthesia, surgery or whatever, to tell them that we need new models to ensure that we can maintain and retain capacity in the regional hospitals.  That is an ongoing challenge to health here and all over the world, but particularly in Ireland in our rural and regional areas.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on community.  There has been a 19% reduction in waiting times in primary care for psychology for under 18-year-olds.  There has been additional investment put into the primary care psychological services.  That is a 19% reduction among under 18-year-olds years who have been waiting more than 12 months to access primary care psychology.  We need to do more in relation to that.</p></speech>

It had its first meeting on 29 October 2020.  The Cabinet committee last met on 4 March 2021.  The meeting scheduled for Monday, 29 November 2021 had to be postponed.  Relevant issues arising on Brexit and Northern Ireland are regularly considered at meetings of the full Cabinet.  For example, after the meeting that was scheduled for 29 November 2021 was postponed, Cabinet considered two comprehensive memos on the North-South co-operation, as well as on the shared island initiative in December.  The next meeting of the committee has now been scheduled for Thursday, 24 February.  The Cabinet committee on Europe also discusses related matters.</p>  <p>  In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I also meet with Ministers on an individual basis to focus on particular issues, where required.</p></reply>

It is important and I am glad to hear it is resuming at the end of the month.</p>  <p>  I very much hope by the end of the month that we still have an Executive in Stormont.  I hope that the idle threats being made on a daily basis by certain members do not come to fruition.  The latest by the North's agriculture minister is in regard to stopping checks altogether.  Acting unilaterally is yet another indication of the disappointing approach taken to an international agreement by so many parties.</p>  <p>  As a supplementary question, will the Taoiseach in his response expand on the preparation that has been made at Cabinet level for any political eventualities leading up to the Assembly elections in the North in May?  It is important this Government plays the most important role within the EU with the UK and with the Executive in Northern Ireland to ensure Brexit issues are kept front and centre.  There is a concerning level of drift.  As Europe and the UK understandably get distracted with other areas, it lands on Dublin.  It lands on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government to ensure this remains a centre focus.</p></speech>

As has been said previously, the party leadership continues to issue threats to the North's political stability.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that these actions do not serve anybody in the North well.  What is his view on, and the Government's response to, the DUP's boycotting of the North-South Ministerial Council?  What recent engagements have the Taoiseach or officials had with their British counterparts in respect of the proposed amnesty legislation?  What was the outcome of these discussions?</p>  <p>  This week marks two years since Britain formally Brexited, or exited from the European Union, bringing the North with it despite majority support there for remain.  The resumption of talks at the joint working committee on the withdrawal agreement on 21 February signals another crunch point for the North.  What actions is the Government taking at a bilateral or European level to advance observer status for the North at a European level?</p>  <p>  Where stands the Government's outstanding commitment to a referendum on presidential voting rights?  There is cross-party support for voting rights to be extended to citizens living beyond this State.  When does the Taoiseach expect the Minister to bring heads of Bill to the Government for approval?</p></speech>

What analysis is being undertaken by the Cabinet committee on the effects of Brexit on the Republic of Ireland?  Some headlines in recent weeks have made reference to the effective end of the so-called land bridge, in that there has been a dramatic fall in Irish lorries using British ports and a rise in direct ferry routes to mainland Europe.  Goods imports from Britain to the Republic have decreased by 20%.  At the same time, cross-Border trade has increased substantially while exports from the Republic into Britain have increased by 20%.  These statistics are compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  We need to establish what is going on here.  We are also told that Brexit has boosted international banks based in Ireland to the tune of over &euro;500 billion and that Ireland is in second place behind Germany when it comes to the value of assets relocated to EU banks from UK banks after Brexit.  We are all agreed that there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  Has the Cabinet committee been able to consider a comprehensive report on the effects of Brexit one year on?  What do the statistics tell us about the fallout from Brexit at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200029#BB00300"><p>The Taoiseach referred earlier to the pension age in the North being increased to 66, which is certainly not a good thing.  I would suggest that hiding behind that fact is not an excuse for not returning the pension age to 65.  This is a point I have often made to the Taoiseach.  Surely if we want to encourage people to be part of a united Ireland, we need to make being part of a united Ireland a more attractive option.  It should be a better and different place for ordinary people and that is a good reason for us to restore the pension age to 65.  In any event, raising the pension age was simply an austerity measure that was brought in during an economic crisis precipitated by bankers and developers, an emergency which has now passed.  In France, the pension age is 62, while it is 65 in Belgium, 62 in Malta and 65 in Austria.  There is simply no justification for raising the pension age.  We should restore it to 65 in the interests of fairness for working people.</p></speech>

We cover the Brexit issue at the EU Cabinet committee as well and we have had meetings with the key Ministers and party leaders in the context of the EU and in respect of key moments for Brexit.  I have met the British Prime Minister on the protocol issues specifically and made matters very clear.  There was a very energetic engagement at the time of COP26 when there was commentary to the effect that Article 16 might be invoked.  Our engagement was sustained across Government and all Ministers involved had an impact on the re-evaluation of that by the British Government.  The British Government retains the right to do what it feels it needs to do but I accept the Foreign Secretary's statement that it is committed to reaching a resolution of the protocol issues through negotiation with the European Union process.  There are challenges with regard to timelines and in that respect there is a need to bring these discussions and negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom to a positive conclusion that creates an environment within Northern Ireland where the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement can work to the fullest extent possible.  On the preparation for what might happen, we have to be aware of self-fulfilling prophecies.  All our focus and attention is on the institutions staying intact and I have been very consistent on that with anyone I have met.  People should fulfil all aspects of those institutions, including North-South engagement.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge that there is an issue with the protocol.  Unionist political parties have raised that and parties representing nationalism, to use a broad term, have also said they do not have an issue if restrictions are reduced and if we can make the operation of the protocol more efficient.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič engaged in very good faith with the Northern Ireland parties and continues to do so with the British Government.  The EU has made very significant advances on the earlier position on a number of fronts.  The issue of the protocol is a constant focus of the Government and there is constant engagement at multilateral levels or multilayered levels between the European, British and Irish Administrations.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, is also working on this with the Foreign Secretary.  Primarily it is still a negotiation between the European Union and the United Kingdom as this is an agreement they had entered into.</p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald raised the matter of the DUP.  As I said, we acknowledge that there are issues but in our view it is not right that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are not fulfilled, particularly the North-South dimension and the sectoral meetings.  That is wrong.  No positive agenda at all is served by the breakdown of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  The people want politicians to work on their behalf and to work for them.  The Commission has listened and I will continue to engage on the matter.  I met with the Orange Order on Monday and had a lengthy and frank discussion about the protocol.  The benefits of the protocol are beginning to manifest themselves.</p>  <p>  I have written formally to the British Prime Minster, as I said yesterday in my speech dealing with legacy.  I have also spoken to him, of course.  I recently met the British ambassador and had a lengthy discussion where I made very clear again the absolute necessity not to take unilateral action in relation to legacy and to respect the views of the families of victims.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey's point is very valid and important.  It is early days yet in some respects with Brexit.  There will be a need for a much more comprehensive analysis of the impact of Brexit.  Some of Brexit has not happened yet, such as export controls.  We still have unfettered access to the UK market and customs or regulatory frameworks.  The Deputy's earlier statistics are correct.  When I was at the British-Irish Council the Welsh First Minister was very concerned about the drop in trade and the volume of trade coming from Holyhead.  Irish businesses have adapted very quickly and are now taking the direct route to the Continent so there is a huge worry in Wales about the impact on its ports.</p> <p>Even though it is a year on, it is still early days as to how this will settle and the protocol is important in that respect.  More than that, with regard to the banking issue, benefits have come our way in some respects.  Overall, we do not agree with Brexit and think it was a wrong thing to do from a policy perspective.</p> <p> In terms of Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution on the pension age, the point I was making and I do not want to go into it, was that a decision was taken to raise it to 66.  Much work is to be done to make sure we have a sustainable pension for the coming 30 to 50 years.  That is the work of the Pensions Commission and the Commission on Taxation on Welfare and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands which has produced a report to feed into that process.</p> <p> It is not about making Northern Ireland more attractive-----</p></speech>

The core activities of the Department are set out in the statement of strategy and include delivering the executive functions of the Taoiseach and Government and supporting me as Head of Government to carry out my duties and implement the Government's priorities over the coming period.</p>  <p>  My Department engages with the formulation and implementation of Government policy, especially through the Cabinet committee structure and ten such committees have been established by this Government to reflect the full range of policy areas that it will work on during its lifetime.  In carrying out the responsibilities associated with his role, the Secretary General of my Department may also attend a range of cross-government groups, including the ten Cabinet committees established by the Government.</p>  <p>  The groups currently chaired by the Secretary General of my Department include the Secretary General post-Cabinet briefing; Civil Service management board; climate action delivery board which is co-chaired with the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications; Housing for All delivery group; Secretary General Brexit group; Covid-19 oversight group; high-level steering board on policing reform; national security committee; north-east inner city oversight group; senior officials group on commemorations; senior officials group on the Creative Ireland programme; cross-government group on the creation of a national memorial and records centre; and national economic and social council.

This is an important commitment by the Government and its delivery will ensure that Ireland meets its moral and human rights obligations to the women and children who endured institutional abuse overseen by the State.  The Government's action plan for mother and baby home survivors commits funding to support this process.  Will the Taoiseach confirm the budget allocated for this year and next?  Will he state when he expects the Secretary General to conclude his work on what role the Oireachtas will have in this process?</p><p>I also want to raise the views of the special rapporteur on child protection on the final report of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.  Professor Conor O'Mahony advises that: </p> <blockquote> 	Any redress scheme which excludes children who were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, forced labour [or] medical experimentation in [through] non-consensual vaccine trials would be inherently defective and a denial of the right to an effective remedy. </blockquote>  <p>Yet, this is precisely what the Government has done by applying an arbitrary timeframe to enable access to the scheme.  The special rapporteur recommends that:</p> <blockquote> 	redress for rights violations in foster homes should not be confined to children who were [boarded out] as an exit pathway from Mother and Baby Homes or County Homes, but should encompass all children who experienced ill-treatment or forced labour in foster homes. </blockquote>  <p>Has the Taoiseach considered extending access to the redress scheme, following publication of the Annual Report of the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection?</p></speech>

The families who lost their loved ones in the Stardust have been waiting almost 41 years for truth and justice.  It is completely unacceptable that their grief and trauma has been compounded by uncertainties and delays around the inquest.  No venue is confirmed for when the inquest will take place and no arrangements are in place to ensure there will be a jury for it.  When will a venue for the inquest be confirmed?  Will the Juries Act 1976 be amended to ensure a jury will be in place for the inquest?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has to look at this again.  I will give him a simple example.</p>  <p>  I have raised ACTS with him a few times, the door-to-door transport service for people in wheelchairs and with disabilities in my area.  It could go under at the end of this month for the lack of &euro;50,000 and the replacement of some of its buses.  That voluntary-run, door-to-door service is advertised on Transport for Ireland as a service available for people with mobility problems who cannot use the normal transport system.  It does not get one cent from the Department of Transport and is about to collapse, because it is voluntary run, for the lack of &euro;50,000 for running costs and money to replace some of its buses for some of the most vulnerable people.</p>  <p>  Why on earth is there no joined-up thinking between transport and disability, for example, to maintain an absolutely critical service for such vulnerable people?  That is an example of why we need the Taoiseach's Department to spearhead the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and a cohesive approach to disability services.</p></speech>

Does that include Secretaries General under this Government?  One such civil servant has now got two pay rises in the past four months.  His wages have jumped more than &euro;80,000 to almost &euro;300,000, which is almost as much as those of the President of the United States.  He got a 36% raise, while low-paid public sector workers are told to make do with 1% and private sector workers have to gear up for industrial action, just to fight for a raise above the rate of inflation.  How can the Taoiseach justify this gross inequality?  Will he act to cut the bloated salaries of those at the very top of the Civil Service or, at the very least, will he support similar rises for ordinary workers across both the public and private sectors?</p></speech>

There has been considerable engagement with survivors and former residents.  Memorialisation is considered a very important part of the healing process for those affected and the State should progress the national memorial records centre.  The Secretary General has chaired that group and funding has been secured.  I intend to bring a memo to Government in the coming weeks in respect of this, with an overarching vision and a proposed approach for the creation of a national centre.</p> <p>There will be other aspects to that as well.  I hope to have further details for the House in relation to that.  It will be a significant investment but it has to be done right as well, obviously in consultation with all involved.  That work has been progressing and it is fairly advanced.  We intend to bring that to Government.</p> <p> In respect of the report of the rapporteur, there is a significant process involved in the redress scheme.  The Minister went beyond the recommendations of the commission.  There was an interdepartmental group.  The Minister went beyond that also in recommending to Government that we extend the range of the redress scheme.</p> <p> In respect of children who were boarded out, that is very challenging.  The Minister is looking at further means of trying to develop a better analysis in respect of children who were boarded out because it was not really central to the commission's report.  It is also a more challenging area in terms of records and so on.  It is a piece of work the Minister is looking at.</p> <p> The redress legislation is before the House.  The Minister is engaging with Members and will continue to do that.  The redress scheme is extensive and is allied to all of the other initiatives that were taken.  The Minister will engage with the House and Members as the legislation goes through in respect of it.</p> <p> On the Stardust inquiry, there had been a venue, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan will be aware.  It was through no fault of the Minister for Justice that it fell through.  I think it was in the RDS.  Every effort is being made to secure premises as quickly as we possibly can.

On disability, I agree with the need for a more singular focus on disability.  The Government took a decision to move disability out of the Department of Health and over to the Department for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth because it was felt that health was such an enormous area that disability was perhaps not getting a co-ordinated focus.  The view was that we would move it.</p>  <p>  Disability is wide-ranging.  I was involved in the area for many years as Minister for Education and Science and we did a lot of good stuff.  We were able to do it much quicker in the education system, in terms of special needs assistants, etc.  I am of a view - there have been pilots on this - that therapists being in the classroom may be a faster way of getting access for children to occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  We have provided additional funding this year for more therapists in the health service through the progressing disability programme but that has created its own problems in terms of how it is being developed and progressed.</p>  <p>  I hear what the Deputy is saying in terms of the Department of the Taoiseach co-ordinating this, and I will look at that.  However, the Deputy will see from the list that the Department of the Taoiseach has been expanding over the years in terms of that co-ordinating role.  He can see it in the range of issues involved, from policing reform to climate change co-ordination.  The trend seems to be in that direction whereas, under the Constitution, we have functioning Departments whose primary responsibility is the delivery of services that fall within their remit.  That is something the Oireachtas needs to reflect on too, as the Government is also doing.</p>  <p>  We can keep on expanding.  I notice now, for example, that an Oireachtas committee may produce a report and then non-governmental organisations will come forward on specific policy areas and all of them will recommend that the Department of the Taoiseach do this or that.  The bandwidth or operational capacity is not there within the Department of the Taoiseach to do all of that.  However, it can do so effectively on some key areas.  In housing, there is a strong delivery mechanism chaired by the Secretary General of my Department which works with the Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Public Expenditure and Reform to make sure there is a full-on public service response to housing across all Departments.  Those delivery mechanisms can work.  It worked spectacularly in the late 1980s for financial services in which there are now between 30,000 and 40,000 people working.  That took a delivery focus.  Likewise with climate change, it has to happen in terms of delivery focus.  The key issue for Government to deliver is that cross-departmental co-ordinated piece.  Departments should not work in silos but in a non-territorial way, if I may use that phrase, and just get things done.  That is my constant agenda.  I hear what the Deputy is saying in relation to disability and I will come back to him on that.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Calleary, there will be an expression of interest sought for the post in question when it becomes vacant in the public service, along with the traditional way that this post has been filled.  I hear the Deputy's acknowledgement of the public service the current incumbent has performed over many years in different capacities within the public service on issues of key national importance, as well as international importance, for example, Europe, Brexit and Northern Ireland, the economy and, not least, Covid-19.  We have a good public service in this country overall.  It has its weaknesses and its challenges, but the public servants in this country work in a committed way for the benefit of the country.  I want to put that on the record.  It is important.</p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue of a wage-price spiral.  Wages have increased.  As I said last week, if wages increase in line with productivity, that is okay.  Those comments were made in the context of the cost of living crisis.  The Government has to look at ways to protect people against what is undoubtedly a very serious issue now in terms of cost of living increases and do so in a way that is not inflationary but protects people's disposable incomes, particularly their access to the necessities of life.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Department of Health and the Secretary General, I have been clear about this.  The Executive took a decision on this from a different perspective, and looking at it through a different prism.  The health arena needs absolute focus and significant reforms right across all layers.   Of all Departments, it oversees an enormous budget and a range of other issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="14:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200032#KK00400"><p>I am sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I very much welcome this opportunity to update the House on the Government's easing of the Covid-19 restrictions.  I am joined by the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte.</p>  <p>  Ireland has reached a major crossroads in our management of the Covid-19 crisis and, as we reflect on our journey to this point, we should recognise the positive position we are in as a result of the extraordinary efforts of people throughout the country.  We acknowledge, in particular, the public support for our national vaccination programme, the continuing high levels of adherence to public health guidance and, of course, the extraordinary dedication of our front-line workers.</p>  <p>  At every stage of this crisis, the Government has endeavoured to follow the science.  We have been guided by the public health advice and, first and foremost, by the need to protect lives, public health and our essential services.  In line with this approach, the decision of 21 January to lift the majority of the remaining Covid-19 restrictions was based in the first instance on the Government's consideration of the latest advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.</p> <p>On 20 January, NPHET agreed that the current profile of the disease allowed for a fundamental change in the management of Covid-19 in Ireland.  At that stage, NPHET noted that the epidemiological profile of Covid-19 provided a broadly positive outlook.  While incidence of the disease remained high, the data indicated that this was reducing and demand for testing was also reducing.  While the burden on acute hospital care remained significant, the number of cases in hospitals was also in decline.  Numbers in ICU, daily admissions and cases requiring mechanical ventilation were also relatively stable.  It was clear from the advice received that the incidence and force of infection in the population were past their peak and declining rapidly.  Perhaps most significantly, the evidence confirmed the positive news that during the Omicron wave, there has been a reduced burden of severe health outcome compared to previous waves of infection.</p> <p> We have seen these trends continue since then and the current epidemiological data continues to provide a broadly positive outlook.  As of Monday, there were 692 confirmed cases in hospitals across the country, down from 855 a week previously.  On the same day, there were 72 confirmed cases in ICU, compared with 76 on 24 January.</p> <p> While the majority of restrictions have now been lifted, we must remember that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over.  The threat of new variants remains, and the Government is now focusing on ensuring that systems of surveillance and response and broader health service capacity are strengthened to ensure Ireland is best placed to deal with any new emerging threat.</p> <p> As Minister of State with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy, I take this opportunity to say a few words about the easing of Covid-19 restrictions within addiction services and the continuation of measures to protect people who use drugs and alcohol and to strengthen services.  From the outset of the pandemic, the Government identified drug treatment and addiction services as essential services.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership and commitment of addiction services, including the HSE, community-based services and voluntary service providers in ensuring their services operated safely during the pandemic.</p> <p> There were many innovations in the delivery of drug and alcohol services during Covid-19, especially the use of online services.  I want to ensure that these gains are captured in the strategic priorities for the national drugs strategy in the period 2021 to 2025.  The additional resources I am providing for community-based drug and alcohol services and HSE addiction services in 2022 will consolidate these gains.  Drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes help individuals to build recovery capital and to avoid relapse into harmful patterns of substance use.  Over the course of the pandemic, the Department of Health developed guidance to support the continued operation of drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes.  I want to acknowledge the co-operation of support groups with this guidance.  I am pleased to say that in line with the lifting of public health restrictions, drug and alcohol support groups and programmes can now operate as normal, while participants are advised to continue to wear masks as appropriate in crowded indoor settings.</p> <p> I am aware of the constraints faced by residential drug and alcohol treatment services during Covid-19 due to social distancing and other public health measures.  I support the efforts of the HSE and voluntary service providers to restore services to pre-Covid-19 levels.  I have provided an additional &euro;3.3 million to expand capacity in residential treatment services.  Altogether, this funding will provide an additional 475 treatment episodes in a full year.</p> <p> During Covid-19, the rapid induction of new clients on opioid agonist treatment resulted in approximately 1,000 additional people receiving treatment.  Not alone did this treatment help them to manage their addiction, there is evidence that it was effective in minimising the risk of contracting Covid-19 among this vulnerable population.  The Department of Health has provided an additional &euro;4.2 million to continue to support these new clients in their care plans.</p> <p> While I welcome reopening of the night-time economy, we must bear in mind the risk to public health from increased drug and alcohol use in this setting.  While it is always safer not to use drugs, we have a duty to protect people who choose to use drugs in bars, nightclubs and at music festivals.  The HSE nightlife campaign entitled &ldquo;If you go, go slow&rdquo;, seeks to create a safer nightlife experience for all participants.  The HSE is promoting harm reduction messages through social media and providing information resources in nightclubs and colleges.  I support the recommendations in the Emerging Drug Trends and Drug Checking Report 2021 for a health-led approach to drug use in the night-time economy and at festivals.  The Department of Health will work with all stakeholders to ensure their implementation.</p> <p> A range of measures were implemented to reduce the spread of Covid-19 among people who are homeless and other socially excluded groups.  The public health response greatly minimised the risk of illness and death from Covid-19 for these groups and improved their access to health care services.  These achievements highlight the importance of homeless services and addiction services continuing to work together, as is committed to in the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All plan.  The Department of Health has provided an additional budget allocation of &euro;10 million in 2022 to maintain public health measures for people who are homeless and to consolidate improvements in health care delivery.</p> <p> While we recognise that Ireland is today in a positive position because of the efforts of the public and the dedication of our front-line workers, we continue to call on people to remain vigilant.  As we move forward with this new phase in our country&rsquo;s management of Covid-19, the public health advice is to continue to take appropriate individual actions based on our own risk assessment.  Those who have symptoms of, or a diagnosis of, Covid-19 should restrict their movements to protect others.  Protective measures in schools will continue until the end of February as the vaccination programme for children progresses.</p> <p> Masks will continue to play an important role in reducing transmission of Covid-19 and requirements to wear masks in a range of settings are still in place.  It is important that masks are made correctly, well fitted and worn properly.  It is recommended that medical grade or FFP2 masks are used in a number of settings, including by anyone aged 13 years and older who is a confirmed case, a close contact or who has symptoms suggestive of Covid-19.  These masks are also recommended for those over 60 years of age and vulnerable people of all ages in indoor or crowded outdoor places, and by anyone visiting a healthcare setting.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will update the House further.</p></speech>

I would like to acknowledge the enormous and continuing contributions made by our health and social care staff in providing vital services across the country during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, outlined, the current outlook remains positive and the easing of the majority of restrictions is very welcome.  We know, however, that the pandemic is not yet over.  The highly transmissible Omicron variant is dominant in Ireland and incidence of disease remains high, although it is declining.  Test positivity has reduced significantly in older age groups of people aged 65 and over, particularly in the latter part of January.  However, those who are vulnerable and those who remain unvaccinated are still at risk of severe illness.</p>  <p>  The public&rsquo;s strong support for the national vaccination programme is essential and its success is a big part of what has enabled us to lift restrictions.  More than 10.36 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered since the programme began in December last year, including more than 2.69 million booster doses.  This has been an extraordinary national effort.  We are immensely proud that Ireland continues to have one of the highest vaccination rates in Europe.</p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for older people, I very much welcome the continued prioritisation of the booster vaccine programme among our older population.</p> <p>More than 88% of eligible people aged between 60 to 69 and living in the community, more than 94% of people aged 70 to 79 and more than 93% of those aged 80 and over have received their booster dose.  In total, approximately 933,000 booster doses have been administered to people aged 60 and over living in the community.  I am pleased to inform the House that approximately 25,000 doses have been administered in long-term residential care settings, including mental health centres and nursing homes and the roll-out in these settings is now complete.</p> <p> Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves and others against the most severe impacts of Covid-19.  The evidence is clear.  People who have received a booster are less susceptible to infection and, if infected, are less infectious to others.  Every effort is now being made to encourage everyone to complete their primary and booster vaccination programme and to reach those who are not yet fully vaccinated.</p> <p> As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I will take this opportunity to say a few words about what the easing of restrictions will mean for the most vulnerable in our society across a number of care facilities.  In nursing homes, which were prioritised in our vaccination programme, we are again seeing the positive impact of the vaccines manifesting in a less severe disease profile among residents.  However, there are still high numbers of outbreaks in nursing homes, with outbreaks currently being experienced in more than 40% of nursing homes.  As of yesterday, 225 nursing homes currently have outbreaks.  Residents who test positive are remaining largely well, however, and there are early indications that case numbers are reducing in nursing homes.  The ongoing monitoring and management of Covid-19 across the nursing home sector remains a critical focus for me and for the Government as a whole.</p> <p> The State continues to provide a range of supports to the nursing home sector.  This includes the provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, supports, including FFP2 masks, free of charge.  This amounts to &euro;95 million in PPE for private nursing homes to date.  It includes access to expert advice and support through the Covid-19 response teams and public health, temporary accommodation for staff, and training and education webinars on infection prevention and control standards and practices.  I have recently met with the HSE and with the chief inspector of HIQA.  Both confirmed that all of these supports continue to be deployed to assist nursing homes.  Of note, serial testing was recently reintroduced as part of a targeted intervention to provide important information on the distribution of cases and risk across nursing homes.  In addition to these supports, private and voluntary nursing homes still have access to outbreak assistance funding through the temporary assistance payment scheme.  More than &euro;122 million in payments have been made to date.  That means the 225 nursing homes which currently have outbreaks can claim outbreak assistance at this time.</p> <p> To continue the substantial progress being made in implementing the recommendations of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel report, almost &euro;18 million was allocated in budget 2022, including investment in community support teams and safeguarding supports.  The return to normal visiting arrangements is of critical importance to people living in nursing homes and their families.  New public health guidance was published on Monday by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and  reflects many of the recent relaxations of public health measures.  The new guidance will come into effect from 8 February.  The primary change that residents will see is a move towards more normal visiting arrangements and access.  Residents can expect to be able to receive visitors, indoors, on a daily basis at a minimum.  To further support the mental health and well-being and social connection for residents, there will also be the introduction of a nominated support person.  This person will be nominated by the resident and should normally have unrestricted access to the resident for most of the day, with the exception of some busy care times in the home.  This will also support improved social connectedness during an outbreak.  There will no longer be a need for visitors to show immunity through vaccination or previous infection.  I very much welcome this approach to visiting and the further move to restoring normalised access in nursing homes.</p> <p> I have received correspondence highlighting that, in some cases, visiting is not being facilitated at all in nursing homes.  Last week, I met Sage Advocacy, which highlighted concerns of families and residents in respect of the implementation of visiting guidance.  I want to be clear that this is not acceptable in the absence of a clear public health or infection prevention and control rationale.  I wish to remind nursing home providers of their obligations for facilitating visiting in nursing homes and the right of residents to receive visitors.  Significant support has been provided to nursing homes through the investment of significant public funding.  It is of the utmost importance that providers facilitate visiting to the greatest extent possible.</p> <p> The reopening of day care centres for older people has been an absolute priority for me following their closure last year due to Covid-19.  I am pleased that 237 centres had reopened by the end of last year, with a further 18 expected to reopen in January and February.  These centres are fundamental to promoting the health and well-being of our older population.  I am also delighted to hear that active retirement groups across the country are planning for full resumption of meetings, days out, and many other activities.  In our mental health settings, services continued to operate between 85 and 90% capacity of pre-Covid levels.  Importantly, any services that were impacted by reduced capacity or temporary closure, such as day centres, are in the process of fully reopening.  This will occur in line with evolving public health information and guidance.  I am pleased to say that these developments coincide with a significant reduction in the number of outbreaks across our mental health services.</p> <p> I am conscious of the impact that visiting restrictions in acute hospitals have had on patients and their families and of the value of regular personal contact with friends and loved ones in these settings.  Throughout the pandemic, the HSE has developed and regularly updated guidance relating to visitor access to hospitals.  This guidance is kept under constant review and updated in the context of the trajectory of the ongoing pandemic.  The current guidance makes provision that all patients in inpatient areas of a hospital should be allowed to nominate one support person and access for that support person should be as flexible as possible.  Visitor access can be accommodated in accordance with local hospital policy and it should also be acknowledged that visitor access may be limited when there is a significant number of Covid-19 cases in the hospital, Covid-19 outbreaks or high incidence within the community.  At all times, guidance has sought to strike a balance between facilitating visitor access wherever possible while also recognising the need to keep patients and staff safe by reducing the risk of Covid.</p> <p> With the removal of so many restrictions recently, I know people will look forward to seeing their loved ones again.  However, it is important to remember that a hospital is very different to other settings in society, where social distancing may no longer be in place.  Some of the most vulnerable to Covid are in our hospitals, and we have a duty to protect them to the greatest extent possible.  That is why a greater degree of caution is required compared with other settings.  While the easing of restrictions has been welcomed by many, I know that the reopening of our society and economy will cause concern and anxiety for some people.  There are many people who are immunocompromised or more vulnerable to the severe effects of Covid-19.  We must continue to collectively adhere to remaining public health measures and keep up the high levels of vaccination in our population to reduce the risk for the most vulnerable in our communities.</p> <p> As we continue to adapt to the reopening of society, we can help by giving each other the space to respond to these changes in our own time and by supporting our friends and family who may be anxious and who continue to exercise caution.  I encourage those who are concerned to be open about it and to share their feelings.  It is okay to take your time.  I hope and expect that we individually and collectively start to feel increasing benefits of the easing of restrictions and the reduction in harm caused by Covid-19.  I look forward to Deputies' contributions.</p></speech>

If we cast our minds back to March 2020, when the first restrictions were imposed, they were designed to last for a few short weeks in order to flatten the curve.  Weeks became years.  For most of those two years, tough public health measures had to be put in place.  My party supported those measures on the basis of the public health advice that was given.  That is to say that we were not conscious of the impact those public health restrictions had on individuals, families and businesses.  We will have to deal with the fallout from and legacy of those restrictions for some time to come.</p>  <p>  Many people have mental health challenges and difficulties arising from the pandemic.</p>  <p>Many people lost their jobs and many found things very difficult.  It has been a very tough two years but people stepped up to the plate.  The public were absolutely fantastic in responding to the challenge.  Despite all of the difficulties and the fact that nobody wanted restrictions and public health measures to be in place for as long as they were, people recognised what needed to be done.  We know our front-line healthcare workers stepped up to the plate.  People in essential retail also stepped up to the plate, as did many public sector workers, including teachers, garda&iacute;, and others, and so too did the vast majority of the public.  They took the public health advice, implemented it, got vaccinated, wore their masks and abided by the restrictions.  That collective effort got us through what has been a very difficult two years.</p> <p> It is fantastic that we now have an easing of restrictions.  This is something that we can all rightly celebrate.  As has been said by public health experts today and over the past few days, however, the disease is still here and we still have to exercise a degree of caution and continue to abide by the very limited restrictions that are still in place.  The Government must spell out in the coming weeks exactly what public health infrastructure and public health surveillance will remain in place.  We all anticipate that we will see a winding down of testing and tracing at some point.  There will be questions around vaccination and whether that will be an annual occurrence.  We also have to look at the whole area of public health and how we see it now in contrast to how we viewed it before.  While we were caught on the hop or caught by surprise by the severity of this disease and this pandemic, the WHO has been warning for many years about the dangers of a pandemic and the fact that the world was not ready or prepared for it.  Hopefully, all of those lessons will be learned.</p> <p> On the issue of lessons being learned, there must be a full public inquiry into the State's pandemic response and into the level of preparedness of the State.  I certainly do not want to see an inquiry that is long drawn out or that costs huge amounts of money or one that is about apportioning blame.  I want an inquiry that is an opportunity to learn and that is about taking action and making changes where they are needed.  In terms of some of the changes that need to be made, my party and others in opposition were making the case for them long before the pandemic struck.  The pandemic caught the Government by surprise, but hopefully it has learned some lessons.  I hope that it is now on the same page as the rest of us and understands that we need a single-tier health service that is fit for purpose, that is properly supported and staffed and has the beds and capacity to deliver better and fairer healthcare, as opposed to the deeply unfair two tier system that we had to deal with at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p> If we hold a public inquiry, we have to look into what happened in nursing homes in the early stages of the pandemic.  We have called for a non-statutory, Scally-type inquiry to examine issues of isolation, neglect and abuse but also to look at the clinical governance frameworks that need to be put in place.  An expert group or panel has made recommendations in that regard and the Government has said that it is committed to implementing those.  However, HIQA has said that the HSE did not understand the private nursing home sector that it was funding and important lessons need to be learned in that regard.  As far back as 2009, the HSE said that we needed 579 critical care beds.  We came into the pandemic with 255 such beds.  That was subsequently increased but the total is still nowhere near what the capacity review sought.  The same is true for inpatient bed capacity, beds in the community and staff.  The Government can point to the billions of euro that have been invested in health in recent years but we must set that against decades of underinvestment and the fact that beds and staff were not put into the system over many years.  That is why we do not have a health service that is fit for purpose.</p> <p> Any review must also reflect on the huge collective effort of the people who stepped up to the plate.  It must also, in fairness, reflect on where the Government got it right as well as where it got it wrong and, in particular, where Departments got it wrong.  It has to be said that there was a lot of last-minute decision-making.  While the Government might say that is what happens in a pandemic, there was also a lack of contingency planning,  indecision at times, confusion around regulations, kite-flying and mixed messages, very often coming from senior Government representatives at the very top.</p> <p> I have already mentioned the deficiencies in our health service and I could say the same about workers' rights.  We do not have a statutory sick pay scheme or safe working environments in some areas.  Meat plants are a good example of the latter.  I hope these are all lessons that we can learn.  We also need to learn the lesson of the importance of an all-island response.  We did not get that right.  Despite the fact that my party, both North and South, pushed hard, including in the Executive, for much greater collaboration between the two Ministers for Health, it did not happen.  In a pandemic, on an island, we need to be responding on an all-island basis, making sure that whatever strategies, policies, supports or public health measures are put in place are aligned on an all-island basis as much as possible but that did not happen.</p> <p> I hope all of those lessons will be learned.  I hope that we can commit to building a better health service, one that does not leave people behind.  The current health system is not delivering for many; it is certainly not delivering for the 900,000 people on waiting lists, the people who are on hospital trolleys every day, the children waiting for access to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, or those with scoliosis and spina bifida who are waiting for life-changing operations for which funding is not being made available.  I hope we have learned lessons and that if anything comes from this pandemic, it will be that the solidarity the public showed will be met with solidarity from this House and that we build a better health service and a better society for the people of this country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="14:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200035#NN00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  Over the past 24 months, a variety of public health measures were introduced.  While there might have been differing views on what needed to be done, we accept that at all times those measures were motivated by the public health interest and were guided by public health advice.  Nevertheless, it is very welcome, not just from a social but also from an economic perspective, that we are in a position to lift many of those restrictions now.  Businesses and workers are especially happy to see these measures eased.  Contrary to what a lot of people said about people living it up on the very modest pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, workers flocked back to work.  They could not wait to get back to work.  The moment that they could do so, they went back.  More should be done by the Government to recognise this.  We should not allow the narrative to persist that people were living it large.  There were people who were sitting on Government benches at the time talking about civil and public servants who were at home with their feet up watching box sets.  That was not the case.  People stepped up to the plate and worked really hard and that should be reflected and amplified a little by the Government.</p>  <p>  The hospitality sector bore the brunt of much of the public health restrictions over the last two years and while the sector was understanding of the worsening public health situation at different stages over the past 24 months, it was frustrated at being singled out as part of the problem, especially when the vast majority of pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues were totally compliant with the public health measures, to the letter in fact.  If we cast our minds back, many restaurants and pubs closed before they were even advised to do so.  While the Government was dithering, trying to make up its mind on whether it should advise them to close, many of them did so out of concern for their staff and their customers.</p>  <p>  While the scaling back of restrictions has been very welcome for hospitality workers, those who work remotely will have more mixed emotions when it comes to the relaxation of restrictions as they return to on-site working.  We had cases of employers being able to summon workers back on site without proper provisions being put in place.  The announcement was made, workers were told to go back and then, two weeks later, the return to work protocol was published.  The T&aacute;naiste is only now talking about remote working legislation.  Working from home or remote working is not just a response to the pandemic, although it was an effective response; it is also a really serious workers' rights issue and we should take the opportunity now to run with it.  A report on the right to request remote working was only recently published and it highlighted that workers want a hybrid or blended model.  It is not surprising that workers were confused and really angry at the fact that they were summoned back to work without being given adequate protection.</p> <p>Two years into the pandemic and we are only now starting to have that conversation.  There is no statutory sick pay.  There is no extra bank holiday although I am assured we will have one very shortly, which is good.  But there was two years of time lost when we could have been capitalising on remote working and giving people the right to remote work, not simply the right to ask and 13 reasons, well crafted by the T&aacute;naiste, why an employer could say no.  That was an awful way to approach it.  We spoke about it at the joint committee this morning.  The T&aacute;naiste says he is open to amendments.  My God, the whole Bill needs to be amended.  It comes from a very negative place altogether.</p> <p> As the restrictions ease, I ask that the Ministers of State convey to their colleagues, and specifically to the T&aacute;naiste, that there is a serious issue around warehoused debt.  I call on the Government to monitor the situation for small to medium enterprises and ensure that the hidden debt does not effect their ability to bounce back to profitability in the short to medium term.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="14:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200036#OO00200"><p>First, I wish to acknowledge that the lifting of many of the Covid restrictions has been welcome news for citizens.  People are beginning to return to their pre-Covid activities and this should be welcomed.  The vast majority of people have been terrific.  We looked after our neighbours and we followed the health advice which was asked of us.  We all together have saved many lives.  We should be proud of that.  Well done to everybody.</p>  <p>  The last two years have been a very difficult time for most of our people.  We missed family funerals, weddings and events.  Many of us were not with our loved ones when they died.  We lost people we love.  People lost their jobs and many lost part or most of their income.  However, we now move into what will hopefully be a much brighter future.</p>  <p>  If the Covid pandemic served any useful purpose, it was to highlight the abysmal state of our health services.  Waiting lists were long before Covid and they have lengthened.  The number of people being treated on hospital trolleys in hospital corridors was high prior to Covid and that has increased.  The issues of the health service need to be addressed urgently.  The numbers presenting to ICU with Covid symptoms have reduced so we can no longer hide behind the excuse of Covid for the failures of our health system.</p>  <p>  I represent the constituency of Limerick which has consistently had the highest number of people on trolleys.  This is not due to some sudden surge; it is always the most overcrowded.  In the first month of this year there were 1,300 people treated on hospital trolleys at University Hospital Limerick.  It is an utter disgrace.  Staff at our hospitals, on a good day, have very challenging jobs.  Having to cope with such levels of overcrowding only adds to the challenges of their roles.  It is a credit to these staff that they keep showing up.  They have done tremendous work in managing and treating the large number of people presenting at the hospital. However, they need a break.  Staff at UHL have faced two years of working in the most challenging of environments, with the danger of infection always looming.  These were the toughest of times for healthcare workers, hospital staff and their families.  Now that we are exiting the period of Covid restrictions we need to ensure that the capacity and overcrowding issues are addressed in their workplace.</p>  <p>  A 96-bed unit is to be delivered at UHL but construction will take at least 18 months to complete.  The unit will not be operational until summer 2023 at the earliest.  Staff and patients need solutions in the interim.  I have pleaded with the Minister for Health and other Cabinet Ministers for efforts to shorten this time.  I have received no definitive response.  I have written to the Minister for Health on the challenges faced by staff, as recently as last week.  To date I have not received a response from the Minister.  I have advised him that I am open to meeting him, with other local Oireachtas Members, in Limerick to discuss what steps can be taken to fix the issues at the hospital.</p>  <p>  Recent research from the UK indicates that there is one excess death for every 67 patients who stay in the emergency department for eight to 12 hours.  It is believed that over 30% of patients were waiting to be discharged or admitted after waiting for more than six hours in Irish emergency departments.</p>  <p>  As restrictions are lifted, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff at Limerick hospitals.  For many, these past two years will have been the most difficult of their professional career.  From treating those with Covid, to supporting those who could not spend their last moments with their families, they have gone above and beyond for us all.  While we have issues at the University Hospital, we can be immensely proud of the contribution of our local health care professionals during this most challenging of periods.  Now is the time to address the issues of capacity and overcrowding so that these staff can operate in the best environment available.  They deserve no less.  Let us deliver a national health service that is fit for purpose as part of a true legacy of Covid-19.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="14:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200036#OO00300"><p>I am not usually one to mention this because I know that Ministers need to travel on occasion.  However, there are reasons for travel and there is the extent of the travel.  We have had a week where we discussed south Kerry CAMHS, statements on youth mental health, a motion on the cost of cancer and now we have statements on the easing of Covid-19 restrictions and the Minister is not here again.  All those issues that we discussed have been compounded by Covid.  It is all interrelated.  We have been discussing as an Opposition non-Covid care and the build up of crises in our health service because of the impact of the pandemic.  We have had space to discuss it politically over the last week.  The Minister not being here, when he is over in Dubai at some wellness expo, is frankly disappointing.  He is there with the Secretary General in a week when it was learned that the Secretary General had accepted his pay increase.  If anyone should be getting an acting-up allowance it should be the Ministers of State over the last week given that they are the ones who have been doing the work here in the D&aacute;il and at committees on health related matters.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of how we discuss this phase of Covid.  We do all have a feeling of optimism about where we are going on this.  The public health advice is encouraging and positive but we still have Covid wards.  We still have 692 people in hospital and there are still people working on the front line and will remain so as people are on wards receiving hospital care or are in ICU fighting for their lives.  We still have advice from the WHO telling us that we need to be on guard.  We know there is seasonality to this and that there will be new variants.</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks I want to see plans from the Government on our PCR testing system and on antigen testing.  Will the State be providing any?  What is the plan for our vaccination strategy and our booster strategy for younger people?  I am getting representations from the parents of children under 16 years who wonder when the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, will advise on the booster for that cohort.</p>  <p>  We need to be careful.  We need to acknowledge everything that has been done and the two years that we have had but be very clear that the work is still ongoing in our health service and will remain so.  We cannot be caught on the hop if the virus takes another unexpected turn.  The response that we have had from our health service has been exceptional.  It has been great and ambitious.  It has delivered in vaccinations and testing.  However, there have been times when it has been caught on the hop when it has been under intense pressure.  We have had delays and times where people could not get tests and so on.  In all my visits to PCR testing, I have had nurses, people who work in social care and members of the Defence Forces.  It can be an emotional experience just being present at a testing centre or at the vaccination centre when they are busy because it shows the best of what our country can do, not only our individual workers but also what the State can do and what our Government and politics can do.  However, I get a sense that we feel as though it is over.  We cannot allow that to creep in because I felt that it had crept in at times over the past two years and then we were caught on the hop.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, the Minister needs to publish the plans for vaccination in 2022 and when we will roll-out the next round of vaccinations for vulnerable people.  Will it be when they are ready to go or will we take into account the seasonality of the virus?  Will we wait until the summer to make sure that people are vaccinated right through to the winter?  These are the practical questions.</p>  <p>  What about the Covid army of people who came back from abroad to work in our health service on short term or fixed term contracts?  Are they going to be regularised into our health service with proper long term contracts with good pay and good pensions?  Is that something that is being worked on now?  Maybe the Minister is going to bring back all our workers, whether in health, teaching or anywhere else, from Dubai to supplement further the services here.  We are under pressure and under stress across the entire health service.  We need the resources and plans.  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, has mentioned it a few times in debates in the last week, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  There is acknowledgement at least of the resources that are needed but where is the plan?</p> <p>Are we taking into account the cost of living when trying to attract workers back to Ireland and trying to ensure graduates coming out of the education system stay here and desire a long-term career in the HSE?  I mean a career they know they will be able to progress in professionally, not just with respect to pay but also to career progression and fulfilment.  I have been speaking to workers on the front line.  Sometimes they have put their own careers on hold to work on Covid, be it in swabbing, testing and tracing or whatever.  They are going back to other areas of healthcare and they need to be valued and valued in a real way.  I want to see that plan being communicated to us clearly, including the numbers, levels and targets, so we know what 2022 is going to look like and so that if the virus takes another turn we know there is a plan in place.  We cannot make the same mistake we have made before and treat the last wave we have had as the final one.  We all hope it is but we cannot plan for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200037#PP00200"><p>I welcome this debate.  It is appropriate and timely it happens as restrictions are being eased and that we all pay fine and sincere tribute to all the people who worked in our homes, in hospitals, on the front line, on ambulances and so on.  We pay tribute also to those who sadly passed away in this awful tragedy called Covid.  About a year ago this week my own brother-in-law passed away from Covid in a nursing home.  He was very well looked after, as were thousands of other people who died of Covid.  However, some were not looked after well at all and that is why we need a full and complete inquiry, especially into the only home in the country, namely, Dealgan House nursing home in Dundalk, that the HSE went into and took over.  It is clear to me and to the families concerned that the Department is avoiding a decision on this.  We were told by the Taoiseach last week the Department is looking at options.  I welcome that and ask the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her senior Minister to engage with the families to bring closure, transparency and accountability.  I am not like the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesman who said he was not interested in accountability in this area.  I am interested.  The families of the people who passed away in these homes are interested in accountability.  They demand it.  If it had been 22 or 23 children who died in the home that the HSE went in to take over, would there not be a public inquiry?  Would there not be protest marches?  Would there not be ructions in this House over it?  Age counts, old age matters and people who died in nursing homes were not properly looked after, especially in this particular case.  Today I received word of a home in, I understand, County Clare where a protected disclosure was made, I think, to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler's Department, if not her office.  I only got word of it this afternoon.  I will send her the details later but it is very concerning.  One thing we really need after this awful pandemic is a national centre of excellence for the training of all staff, be they nurses, healthcare staff, healthcare assistants, nursing home managers and so on.  We need the best possible practice internationally to be at our centre of excellence and we need proper and appropriate national guidance on medical correctness, proper procedure and proper care.  If that comes out of this appalling disaster of Covid, then that at least will be an important change.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who is present also, has done an excellent job on our addiction services.  I welcome his speech and the work being done.  Nevertheless, there is a review of drug addiction services in the Louth-Meath area that remains unpublished despite requests from me and a freedom of information request that has not been answered to date.  It has now gone beyond its time and I must appeal it internally.  What is being hidden by the Department or by the HSE?  Why can we not see what happened?  Why can we not see the impact and know the impact of Covid on drug addiction services in our region?  There is a need for change and change is in the air and is coming but we must lead it as a Government and as a D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  There is another serious issue that must be addressed, that is, the question of young people in our nursing homes.  There are 1,330 people aged under 65 years living in nursing homes.  Of those, 45% are 60 or more years of age and 20% are younger than 50 years of age.  This number is very concerning.  We must eliminate the practice of accommodating younger people with serious disabilities in nursing homes, which is a commitment of the programme for Government.  The Ombudsman's report found many people were prisoners in the homes.  They only went in there on a temporary basis but there is nowhere for them to go.  It is expensive, obviously, to set them up in their own homes or their own accommodation but that must happen.  It is unfair and wrong that they are prisoners and they cannot get out.  Their choice is to leave but they do not have that choice right now.  I urge the Minster of State that we do that.  I do not have much time left.</p></speech>

I join other Deputies in commending our front-line workers and commending other people involved in the services sector in particular who worked at their post, if you like, throughout Covid-19.  Previous speakers have referenced how working patterns and lives have been changed forever by the impact of the virus.  That is true and many people are now working from home and will continue to do so, to one extent or another, into the future.  I commend also the people of the country.  The response of the general public has been exceptional, especially when we look at vaccination rates.  Ours is one of the best in the world.</p>  <p>  I intend to flag a few issues in the short bit of time I have.  Deputy McNamara and others were, throughout the process, eloquent in this House and other places about examining the role of Government in curtailing the personal liberties and freedoms of individuals.  I share some of their concerns.  As part of the review of what happened during Covid-19 we need to look at where we stand with respect to the potential for future pandemics.  I welcome the fact the Minister with responsibility for communications and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, are involved in recent announcements on fake news on social media and clamping down on some of that.  Despite a torrent of it, the general public responded very positively in this country.</p>  <p>  The other point I raise in the minute or two I have left concerns NPHET.  I know some of the people who serve on it.  I do not envy its members the job and the difficult task they had and continue to have as a group that deals with giving the Government guidance on public health.  However, as part of the review process the interactions of NPHET, or whatever the NPHETs will be, should be considered.  The methodology that prevailed towards the end of, for want of a better term, kite-flying, whether it was coming from the political sector or from those involved, either directly or indirectly, with the National Public Health Emergency Team was far from acceptable.  I happened to be at some of the public health meetings at the end of the last Government when the virus was here first.</p>  <p>  One thing that struck me even then was the swift response of the public services to try to deal with something we did not know the extent of at the time.  Overall, the public services responded very well to unprecedented circumstances but that is not to say that as part of the review, difficulties such as the ones Deputy O'Dowd has pointed out and the ones that have been pointed out by others in relation to the Government interfering with people's liberty should be considered.  The latter was something that had to be done and I support doing it.  What are the mechanisms by which those decisions could or would be made if viruses or other public health or public order issues emerge into the future?  There are lessons to be learned.  I commend the Ministers of State present and their predecessors on their work during the pandemic.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that this pandemic has been an absolute watershed in our lives.  Deputy O'Dowd mentioned some of the ways in which it has set us back on our heels.  This is the time to start to take stock of what we have learned from this.  One of the positives is the extraordinary way in which our export companies have helped us through this.  We have had the highest ever creation of jobs by Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Authority.  It is our robust economic management that has helped us to protect people during this difficult period, but we have to now recognise that this pandemic has also exposed serious imbalances in the global economy that we have to knuckle down to.  This pandemic gives us an opportunity to take a fresh look at them.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the world has changed, with the emergence of extraordinarily strong data companies mine data have and have scant enough regulation of how that impacts on our lives.  We have seen precarious working emerge from some of these models.  We have seen the extraordinary frailty of our planet exposed by some of the practices that have developed and we have seen divisions and inequalities in access to skill and opportunities.  We now have to knuckle down to see how we address these issues.  We have been very successful in the global market, but if companies are to continue to serve the public interest and protect the gains they have delivered to consumers - health is one of those areas - we need appropriate regulation to match the pro-enterprise policy that has been so important.  We need to see new principles underlie the success of our enterprises.  The wave of new success will come to those who apply the lessons of how to avoid environmental damage, while at the same time delivering high quality standards, how they protect consumers, how they value and develop their workforce and how they ensure that any algorithms being used to access marketplaces have sound principles underpinning them.  They have to protect families and offer the flexibility that allows families to thrive.</p>  <p>  We need to start looking at a new social contract, where the new risks that are in people's lives are addressed.  That will be the agenda we have to address in the coming months, but we do so starting from a good base in that we have a robust economy.  It gives us the chance to achieve leadership roles in these important areas.  I hope that will be the mark of how we learn from this pandemic, not just in the health area but in the wider area of economic progress.</p></speech>

I am sorry to point out that the easing of Covid-19 restrictions has not brought any easing of stress for our leaving certificate students and their need for choice in this exam year.  They suffered hugely from the restrictions and isolation imposed.  No other leaving certificate students suffered as much as they did.  They deserve better from the Minister and the Department of Education than a roll-out of the traditional leaving certificate following a couple of years that have been anything but traditional.  This is bad for the well-being of leaving certificate students, who know what they need as citizens and as exam candidates.</p>  <p>  It is also bad that there are cold and sometimes freezing conditions, which these students and teachers are reporting to me in classrooms across north Kildare, while HEPA filtration is still on the long finger.  When did it become accepted that these children and their teachers and families should just get on and fend for themselves?  Fending off an airborne virus is not science and restrictions cannot be confused with mitigation, especially when we have a positivity rate of more than 30%.  Vulnerable people must also live, shop, work, go to school and college and take public transport so we still need working mitigations.  These vulnerable people pay taxes and many provide care in their communities.  The economy and health service would be in real trouble if they just locked themselves away to fend off the virus.</p>  <p>  We also need a proper strategy for dealing with long Covid.  I am extremely worried about this, given the extremely long waiting lists we have at present.  Our front-line care workers are hanging on by a thread.  It is only really their solidarity with each other that is keeping them going.</p>  <p>  We are very optimistic.  As a republican, I am always optimistic.  The lifting of the restrictions is also optimistic but we have to be cautious.  The WHO expressed concern about the narrative that the pandemic is over thanks to the vaccines, but until vaccination is available around the globe the issue of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver cannot be allowed to drop off the table because none of us wants to go backwards.  People are happy and relieved that the restrictions are being lifted, especially our young people.  We all generally regard those years as the best of our lives and young people put those years on hold to protect their families and communities.  </p>  <p>  I also welcome that we will have a new holiday next year, the feast of Imbolc, in honour of the Kildare feminist and Celtic goddess, Brigid, and in memory of all those we have lost due to Covid.  This extra bank holiday will bring us closer to the EU average for public holidays and that too is welcome as a first step. </p></speech>

I have raised this issue on several occasions previously.  Karl attends a service in our community.  For the past two years, his family did everything right.  They socially distanced, they accepted a service that had to close during lockdowns and they got their vaccines and boosters.  They were willing to go the extra mile to keep themselves, their son and his friends well.  However, the family have gone from being extremely supportive to deeply frustrated due to the continuing denial of a full service for Karl.  He is entitled to a five-day service but has not got one full week since the Covid pandemic began.  It has been a four-day service since it recently opened up.  The straw that broke the camel's back this week, however, was when Karl was called into the office and told he would have zero days next week.  He was distraught and upset that he was losing his service and losing out on being with his friends; he could not understand why.  He got upset and was told there was nothing to cry about.  After two years of isolation and being told time and again that there will not be a return to a full service for some time, you can understand why the family are upset and angry.</p>  <p>  No community employment training centre or Youthreach centres have closed in recent weeks.  Pubs, clubs, cinemas and restaurants have all fully opened, with virtually no restrictions.  Football matches are at full capacity.  Why are adult day disability services being treated differently from everything else?  It is not a medical centre; it is a training centre.  What would the Minister for Education say if schools said to students in primary and post-primary schools that it is their turn not to have an education next week?  Does the Minister of State believe that this is acceptable?  Will she demand that all services are opened full time as quickly as possible?  I spoke on the phone to Karl yesterday.  He was so upset because he could not see his friends next week.  This issue is something that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="14:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200038#QQ00400"><p>I note that we are having yet another health debate and the Minister for Health is not present.  This has been the case for the past week when there have been a number of different health debates.  It is really not acceptable that he is not here doing his job as Minister.  We have had the breaking scandal of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in south Kerry and serious concerns about the standard of CAMHS services throughout the country.  He is not around for any of that and nor is his Secretary General.  Today, we are talking about the lifting of Covid restrictions, which is, again, a very important debate and he is not around for it.  We had a debate last week on mental health services and we had a debate this morning on cancer services.</p>  <p>  The idea of the Minister for Health being off in Dubai with the Secretary General for what will be more than a week is just not acceptable, especially given the nature of the event he is attending.  I was gobsmacked to hear the justification the Taoiseach provided last week for that trip.  This is a commercial expo.  It seems it is an Enterprise Ireland expedition that includes a number of Irish start-up companies.  The Taoiseach talked about leveraging capital, making important contacts and networking with the business community.  That is nothing to do with public health.  The Minister and the Secretary General are charged with providing a properly functioning public health service.  We patently do not have that.  There are serious problems and the Minister should be concentrating on those rather than on what appears to be feeding the kind of creeping privatisation that is going on and is doing so much damage to our public health service.</p> <p>I am really disappointed that the Minister and his Secretary General have chosen to be away for a week at that event and that the Taoiseach chose to justify it on the grounds that these were business opportunities.  We do not want business opportunities within our public health service, we want a properly functioning public health service that is accountable, answerable, adequately resourced and fully staffed.  That is the Minister's primary responsibility and he is not living up to it.</p> <p> Like most people, I welcome the easing of the Covid-19 restrictions.  It is great to be at a point where we can start to live life fully and catch up on so many things that were missed out on over the past two years.  Credit goes to everybody involved in that national effort at all levels to get us to this point.  It is very much to be welcomed.  However, I want to talk about a particular cohort of people who are not delighted that the restrictions have been lifted because it makes them even more vulnerable than they were previously.  I refer to that cohort of people who are immunocompromised.  We know that there are at least 109,000 people in this cohort, which is a significant number.  I am not sure that adequate consideration or thought has been given to this cohort of people.  I have received representations from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Ireland, CLLI, an advocacy group for people with blood cancer in particular.  It has made a very strong case in writing to the Minister on these points.  There is a lack of clarity.</p> <p> At a meeting this morning of the Joint Committee on Health with representatives of NPHET, I asked a number of questions but the witnesses were not in a position to answer them.  I will ask them again here.  First, what is the position with regard to the fourth vaccination, which is the booster in the case of people who are immunocompromised?  There has been a complete lack of information and advice in that regard.  People have to wait three months after their third dose to get the fourth dose, but many people are at that stage now, having got their third dose in October.  There is no information on that.  These people want to know the arrangements for the roll-out of the booster, that is, the fourth dose and how people go about doing that.  It came to light in recent days that there is a facility for booking an appointment but nobody has been told that.  There is a need for clarity on that.  These people have also expressed concern about the implications for them of going to vaccination centres.  It is not the safest place to be if one is a vulnerable person with a serious underlying condition.  Are other arrangements being made for them to receive their booster dose?</p> <p> The second question is in regard to the issue of antivirals.  For people who are medically vulnerable antivirals are essential.  If they get the virus, it is really important that antivirals are provided to them as quickly as possible.  There is a strict time limit of a matter of days involved.  It is really important that there is clarity on what one should do if one is immunocompromised and one gets the virus.  There is no direction on that.  We know that orders have placed and that deliveries have been made of antivirals, but as of yet there is no plan for rolling them out.  Time is of the essence in this regard.  There should be clear protocols.  There is a clear plan in, for example, the UK in regard to how a person in that situation should go about accessing antivirals.</p> <p> The third issue is monoclonal antibody treatments.  Regrettably, for some people who have serious underlying conditions the vaccination is not effective.  It does not provide protection.  It is really important that people can establish if they are one of those people so that they have access to antibody treatments.  I ask the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Feighan, to pass on all of these issues to the Minister whenever he returns and please to provide clear information to the 109,000 people who feel very vulnerable at this stage.</p></speech>

I have listened to the contributions of Members opposite.  There is reason to be optimistic.  I would like to cite the words of Dr. Tony Holohan at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health this morning.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	The number of confirmed cases in hospital has decreased, with the average number of newly confirmed cases in hospital each day also reducing.  The total numbers of confirmed cases in ICU, daily admissions, and cases requiring mechanical ventilation have decreased.  The number of COVID-19 patients in receipt of advanced respiratory support in hospital settings outside of ICU has also reduced.  </blockquote>  <p>We all know that this has been a collective effort.  To be fair, everybody who has spoken thus far has acknowledged the great work of our front-line healthcare workers.  We owe it to them to do that.  So too we must acknowledge the compliance of the vast majority of people in terms of ensuring we got to where we are today.  There is a note of optimism in the air.  We should acknowledge that.  Members opposite will call for public inquiries.  I add my voice to that call, particularly in regard to Carechoice Nursing Home, Ballynoe, Cork, where there were a number of deaths.  I believe that merits investigation.  I am sure other Deputies will cite various other nursing homes across the country in that regard.  It is important to stress, as Members opposite have done, that this cannot be about finger pointing or blame games.  We want to get to the root cause of what happened in these institutions and what we can do going forward to ensure it never happens again if we find ourselves in this situation.</p><p>At this morning's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health the Chief Medical Officer also said, &quot;The evidence in relation to Omicron, as well as our experience of it, indicate that the burden of severe health outcomes appears reduced compared to previous waves of infection.&quot;  If that is the case, it is very encouraging.  It shows the different strains of the virus are waning in terms of strength.  If we have data on that, I would like to see it published.  I would also like to know what the plans are in regard to long-Covid.  Other countries across the Continent have established different units in medical settings, which will analyse and care for people who are suffering the ill effects of long-Covid now and into the future.  God knows how long those people will suffer from the ill effects of Covid.</p><p>The issue of remote working was mentioned.  The benefits of remote working may be lost.  The Government is planning to introduce legislation in that regard.  All of us can agree that in various settings remote working has been predominantly positive.  We cannot lose the benefits of that.  The Government needs to work with the unions and employers to encourage remote working where possible.  It is something that we cannot afford to lose.</p><p>On disability services, in my area in Cork we are told that services are operating at 75% to 80%.  They still have not fully resumed and that is being felt on the ground.  A variety of posts remain unfilled.  Organisations such as Cope Foundation and the Brothers of Charity, Cork, are struggling to hire staff.  We need to double down and put great emphasis on getting staffing levels right again.  Many of the people we are talking about have some of the most complex physical, mental and health needs.  It is ironic that we are talking about the benefits of remote working and how people suffered in terms of having to commute two to three hours per day to and from work while at the same time we still have not had a debate on disability services and people going to ASD services in schools often for two or three hours a day, five days a week.  I would welcome a debate on the adverse mental impact that is having on those people.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the pandemic has caught us all off guard and lessons have to be learned.  I would like us to have a serious debate on preparations for the next event.  I am not sure when that event might be and the hope is we will never have this experience, at least not in our lifetime.  We need to build for the future and to have that open and honest debate.</p></speech>

I further thank staff in our hospitals, front-line staff in our nursing homes and GPs and their staff for their work over the past two years and all of the people who have worked in vaccination centres across the country for their work over the past 12 months.</p> <p>We have managed the pandemic very well.  There were enormous challenges that changed by the day.  We must admit that our responses were not the appropriate ones on all occasions but, in fairness, the vast majority were.</p> <p> I have a concern around the opening up of services.  I raised at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health this morning the issue of the opening up of elective surgery.  People want to get back to what they were doing previously and what they are good at.  I am talking in that regard about nurses, staff, care assistants and all those who work in our hospitals.  There still seems to be a problem in getting elective procedures back in place.  There has been a restriction on that work.  Where there are substantial delays, how do we fast-track procedures?  Should we, for instance, be looking at opening facilities on Saturdays, especially for day procedures?  Could we do such procedures on Saturdays?  Could we look at outsourcing to other facilities?  In Cork, for instance, there were more than 4,500 people on the gynaecology waiting list.  The consultants in Cork University Hospital moved to the Mater Private Hospital and patients were seen there.  Those HSE consultants went to another facility to get procedures done.  Those were all day procedures.  That action cut the waiting list by more than 3,500 in a short period of time.</p> <p> I know the Minister of State is doing work in the home care area.  Lessons relating to nursing homes have been learned.  I understand that there are cases where home care is not appropriate and some people require the higher level of care available in nursing homes but many people are able to live comfortably provided there is adequate home care provided for them.  An OECD report examined many countries and set out the need to look at better pay and conditions.  On the basis of that report, we need comprehensive training, cultural change in the structures of our services and improvement of job design.  We also need opportunities for carer advancement.  All of those need to be looked at if we want to have a comprehensive home care facility.  In the Cork and Kerry regions, for instance, 1,800 people were providing home care within the HSE approximately 14 months ago.  That number has dropped to 1,400.  There are 400 people fewer working in that area and we need to address that.  How can we make working in that area attractive to people?  How can we bring more people into the sector to provide that level of care?</p> <p> When we talk about home care, we consider the cost.  If we examine the cost of nursing home care at the moment, it is over &euro;1,000 per bed per week.  Home care is still a far cheaper option.  At the same time, we must ensure the appropriate level of pay is given to those who provide that home care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1454" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200040#SS00200"><p>Like others, I will say something that cannot be said often enough, that is, I acknowledge the efforts made by everybody in the healthcare sector.  It was not just the healthcare workers.  It was a general, national endeavour that got us through the pandemic.  Front-line healthcare workers and staff working in local supermarkets, meat plants and dairy farms made a collective endeavour that got us through the pandemic.  I acknowledge all of those people.</p><p>I confess I was, and remain, one of the sceptics with regard to the front-line bonus payment the Government has announced.  I acknowledge it is now a <i>fait accompli</i>and good luck to those who will get it.  However, I think it incredible that we might contemplate differentiating between one form of front-line worker and another in the health service just because their pay cheques come from different authorities or organisations.  Those who work in section 38 or section 38 organisations did work that was as valuable in delivering front-line services to people with disabilities and healthcare needs as did those who work in the HSE.  I hope that when cheques are being written we will not differentiate between them.</p><p>One of the great takeaways from this period in respect of our health service is the response; what we can do and what we did.  That was probably because of the fantastic level of scrutiny and observation of that response.  There was daily and weekly accountability from the Chief Medical Officer and other senior officials and that got us through the pandemic.  I acknowledge all the supports around that, including the National Public Health Emergency Team, the national immunisation advisory committee and everybody else.  If we can do it for Covid-19, we can do it for cataracts, orthopaedics, waiting lists, disability services and mental health services.  If there is one takeaway in particular, it is that we should bring forward that level of scrutiny, oversight and accountability, which is the thing we are lacking most in the health service.  People can suggest their own explanations for what happened in the child and adolescent mental health service in Kerry but these are not isolated cases.  When we bring a forensic accountability and shine a spotlight on the service, we can do it.  I do not think people would shy away from committing more funds to the health service if they were satisfied they would be well spent and accounted for.  The pandemic showed we can do that.</p><p>I will move on to consider mask-wearing and visits to public hospitals.  It seems to the layperson rather illogical that we can have this level of opening up now because risk is so minimal and yet those who have been least at risk, that is, healthy young children, are still the subject of compulsory mask-wearing in certain circumstances.  I am not a public health expert and I defer all the time in this debate to those who are but I think we need to review that as early as possible.</p><p>There was a case in my own constituency this morning of a person who was distressed because they were unable to visit their wife in hospital.  Obviously, the risks still continue and we are not over Covid but we could allow visits.  If we are doing it in nursing homes, we could do it in general hospital settings.</p></speech>

At a time when the State was in most need, people stood up to be counted.  Everyone in this Chamber recognises that and we salute those people for their efforts and respect the work they have done.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In January this year, there were over 650 people waiting for access to residential rehabilitation beds.  Waiting times in many facilities have doubled and even tripled with people now waiting four to five months to get into many rehabilitation facilities in the State.  What is happening now is that when people are at the crucial stage where they want to make change, are ready for recovery and need a helping hand, it is not available.  When they are not getting that support, the reality is that some people slip back into addiction and we lose that chance.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  This is happening because facilities were forced to close beds during the Covid-19 crisis due to restrictions.  It was also the case that lifesaving facilities such as Keltoi were closed down and still have not reopened.  Now that Covid-19 restrictions are easing, can the Minister of State please provide a timeline for the reopening of Keltoi?  It is desperately needed.</font></p><p><b><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font></b><font color="#2F2F2F">Something that those in recovery and other experts have raised with me is the need for more publicly run, secular residential facilities.  We need to start opening more public addiction treatment beds and facilities.  We need to see those beds moved under the remit of HIQA and held to the same standard as the rest of our healthcare services.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Sinn Fein&rsquo;s alternative budget proposal for addiction services included ten times the funding of the Government&rsquo;s budget because we recognise that investing in addiction services will save lives and will save the State money in the long run.  Part of this plan included replacing those lost beds with public beds.  We have an opportunity now.  I ask the Minister of State to take the opportunity and run with it.</font></p></speech>

It is a real boost to everybody.  It has given everybody a lift and it is welcome.  The sporting community probably welcomed the easing of restrictions more than most.  Sport plays a large part in our lives.  It strengthens communities, teaches young people about health and well-being, and boosts the morale of the nation when we are cheering on our international athletes and stars.</p> <p>Under Sport Ireland, there are more than 40 affiliated sporting bodies covering a wide range of sports.  While most people are used to hearing news of the big three, that is, the GAA, FAI and IRFU, the amazing work of many other smaller organisations such as Basketball Ireland, the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, Athletics Ireland and Rowing Ireland, is too often forgotten.  These smaller organisations carry out amazing work in communities right across Ireland and across all backgrounds.  Locally in Ringsend, we have two amazing rowing clubs, St. Patrick's Rowing Club and Stella Maris Rowing Club.  These two clubs are intertwined in the local community.  They are essential for the community and a model for what community engagement should be.</p> <p> The success of sporting culture should be judged not only on the achievements of a few but on the strength and diversity of all sports on the island.  The easing of Covid-19 restrictions has had a welcome impact on many of those sports, many of which are indoor-based, particularly basketball.</p> <p> Often, additional supports are carried out by voluntary groups such as St. John Ambulance Ireland, which provides medical support to sporting and community events throughout the country every week.  St. John Ambulance Ireland is currently under review due to sexual abuse by its members and I am deeply concerned that amid this review into sexual abuse it continues to provide support to community and sporting events.  I do not think it is appropriate for national sporting bodies such as the FAI, IRFU and GAA to avail of its services while a review into sexual abuse is ongoing.  This is effectively a transfer of State funds to St. John Ambulance Ireland via sports organisations.  I do not believe St. John Ambulance Ireland should be funded.  Other organisations can do the same job and sporting bodies should engage with them rather than using St. John Ambulance Ireland.  I again call on NGOs not to use St. John Ambulance Ireland at their sporting events and use alternative service providers.</p></speech>

We were all going around knocking on doors trying to get back into the D&aacute;il and some of us did while others did not.  Little did we know what was to come four or five weeks later.  It really does feel like a lifetime ago; not only the general election but what has gone on in the last two years across the world.  It has been a truly unprecedented event, not only in our lifetime but across generations.</p>  <p>  Many of us never heard of Covid-19 but we got to know it very well in every pore of our society.  Many of us thought it was something from far away; a pandemic from a hundred years ago.  Little did we know what was to come.  The events that happened were completely unprecedented.  When we think back now about what was to happen with regard to our liberty, the economic effect it would have on people's jobs, our health, the 10,000 people who died on this island and 6 million and counting who died worldwide, it really is unbelievable.  A virus that was invisible to us has asked a lot of us and what we want to do next as a society.  In the throes of the pandemic, however, the virus did a number of - I hate to say this - positive things.</p>  <p>  One of the things that happened was the commandeering of private healthcare.  There was no such thing as the two-tier health system for a period of time.  Most of the 19 private hospitals were commandeered by the State.  It throws a big question into why we need a one-tier health system.  We saw the potential for better public service.  We saw the fault lines that exist in society but more importantly, on a human level, we saw something unbelievable in ourselves about how humanity can be so good when it comes together; not acting as individuals but as a collective.  We can be amazing.  We can beat any virus in the world.</p>  <p>  In our health service, doctors, nurses, porters or whoever it may have been had to go into an environment that was like trench warfare.  They had to go into the midst of the pandemic, where Covid-19 was ever-present, and hold the hands of some of our relatives at their very last moments when they had nobody to say goodbye to except those hospital staff.  We owed everything to those people and we continue to do so.  Hopefully, we see a different society where workers are treated better.  Most workers who worked through this pandemic are poorly paid and sometimes not recognised.  They are looked down on and their jobs are seen as menial.  They drove and served us and did everything they possibly could under extreme circumstances.  We pulled together, however.  I do not want to be party political about it; sometimes we have to rise above party politics.  There were times the Government got it wrong and let some bad things happen.  It got some things right as well.  However, I think we are coming to a conclusion, hopefully, in relation to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  My final issue is with regard to a public inquiry into nursing homes.  It is really important that this State has a public inquiry regarding all the deaths in nursing homes in the first year and a half of the pandemic.  We owe it to the people who died in those circumstances and the relatives who are still asking questions.  It is incumbent on the State to have a public inquiry with regard to all deaths in nursing homes.</p></speech>

One of the great things about <i>Ulysses</i>, of which I am a big fan, is that Joyce takes as his characters the ordinary people, whereas in all previous literature of the 19th century, in novels and so on, it was the aristocrats, elites and upper middle classes.  Joyce takes a hammer to that.  In the opening chapter, Joyce brilliantly describes the art he wants to make as being &quot;the cracked lookingglass of a servant,&quot; in other words, smashing the normal mirror we put up to ourselves, which does not actually give expression to the ordinary working people and making their voices heard.  Of course, the servants, downtrodden, oppressed and minorities feature as central characters in <i>Ulysses</i>.</p><p>That is exactly what happened during Covid-19 and we need to remember the lessons.  I want to shout out that we will remember those lessons for the musicians who live precarious, often impoverished lives, but who enrich our society no end.  Just because Covid is over does not mean the need for a renewed support for musicians is over.  They are asking that some of the supports will be maintained and that we recognise going forward that we will give them those additional supports to truly value our artists, musicians and so on.</p><p>The Minister of State might take note that some individual musicians, taxi drivers and so on were refused the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, on the grounds that they had not made certain PRSI contributions.  When some of them checked into that fact, they got it rectified because they were not properly awarded the PRSI contributions they should have been while they were receiving the PUP.  It seems that may be quite a widespread administrative mistake.  I would like the Minister of State to look into that and rectify it in order that people who should have been getting the PUP, particularly over the Christmas months and weeks, will actually be awarded the backdated PUP they deserve.</p></speech>

In the early days of the virus, there was a necessary and welcome urgency in Government to address the homelessness and housing crisis while individuals and families were asked to lock down in place.</p> <p>Between April and May last year, there was a 12% decrease in the number of people in emergency accommodation.  Unfortunately, since that time, the numbers of people seeking support have gradually crept up towards pre-pandemic levels following the lifting of the ban on evictions, and, as we all know, the cost of living, in particular rents for housing, has soared.  The number of people in emergency accommodation has reached the 9,000 mark for the first time since April 2020.<br/><br/>As the world moves to a post-Covid reality, it is imperative that the Government does not allow a return to the norm of the last few years as regards the numbers of people who are in homeless and emergency accommodation.  It is vital that every Department of the State works to ensure that long-term homelessness is considered completely unacceptable in Irish society.  We know for certain that long-term stays in homeless accommodation and emergency accommodation lead to worse outcomes for those who receive services.  That itself places great stress and demand on treatment and counselling services.  Outcomes for people in emergency accommodation will not and cannot improve unless they have access to secure long-term housing and appropriate support services.<br/><br/>I will raise a couple of issues in that regard.  The first is provision of dedicated LGBTQI+ emergency accommodation within homelessness services.  A recent study by Focus Ireland, BeLonG To and UCD suggested that some LGBTQI+ persons experiencing homelessness were unwilling to enter a space such as a hostel or an emergency accommodation venue because they feared they would encounter a lack of understanding.  People deserve to feel safe no matter what services they are accessing.  We may need to have dedicated housing for that purpose.<br/><br/>Second, the Covid-19 pandemic raised grave concerns for people who are homeless and use drugs.  In March 2020, in light of the pandemic, the HSE published a plan, which was welcomed, that guided the support and treatment of substance use and recognised that harm reduction interventions for substance users were necessary.  People experiencing homelessness who were substance users were offered support both to reduce the risk of contracting the virus and reduce harm from drug use.  I echo Deputy Creed&rsquo;s call for staff who worked in high-support services to also be recognised in the recognition payment.<br/><br/>The two major initiatives that were undertaken were the faster processing of clients into treatment and temporary amendments to allow patients to access ongoing treatment and regular medicines.  This was fantastic and I hope we can hold on to that.  However, the one area that we did not significantly address is the continued dichotomy in Ireland between treatment for addiction and treatment for mental health.  Service users often have to choose which treatment route they will take as we continue to separate out those two issues, despite best practice.  People cannot get psychiatric care until they treat their addiction or <i>vice versa</i>.  Of course, life does not work like that.<br/><br/>The proposed Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on drugs would be an ideal opportunity to discuss this lacuna.  For the most part, from what I am hearing, service users and providers agree that some positive changes were made during the Covid-19 crisis and should be maintained.  However, we have a lot more work to do, in particular on mental health.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="15:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200042#UU00200"><p>On 5 March 2020, the Ceann Comhairle called me to make my first contribution to the House.  The previous weekend, a case of coronavirus had led to a closure of a school in my area.  Local councillors and Deputies had been briefed in City Hall by people who we considered to be unknown public health officials but who the entire country would soon to get to see on a nightly basis.  I left that meeting feeling incredibly afraid, not just for my community but for the country.</p>  <p>  In a wave, Covid came upon us and our community and spread across the whole country.  It changed everything for the two years that I have been a Member of this House.  It has dominated every aspect of every day.  It has taken twists and turns with its key characteristics being the ability to both surprise and mutate.  As a population, we learned about R-numbers and social distancing.  We watched as around the world countries and cities such as New York and Italy struggled with ventilator shortages.  We learned of temporary army hospitals on battleships and body bags being piled up in corridors.  We prayed that those things would not happen here.</p>  <p>  Every person in this country, young and old, has borne the burden of Covid-19 but those on lower incomes, in poorer housing or in front-facing manual and service jobs have borne a heavier burden.  Those in clinical settings with Covid-19 patients, many of whom died alone, bore the hardest burden of all.  I pay tribute to all those people and all those who lost their lives.</p>  <p>  In the past two years, I have voted for some extraordinary restrictions.  These involved Government reaching into people&rsquo;s lives, restricting their movements, employment and contact with family and friends.  I want people outside the House to know that I took none of those votes lightly.  I know Ministers in the previous and current Governments did not take any of them lightly either.</p>  <p>  In an unprecedented pandemic, there were things that Ireland definitely got wrong.  However, as I have said many times in this House, we crafted a path that was set neither by the zero-Covid zealots or the herd immunity champions.  We never put the economy over public safety.  We stepped in to help families and businesses financially in a much greater way and for much longer than many other countries did.  By treading that middle ground, perhaps we doubled our critics, but this country has got through the last two years by balancing restrictions and freedoms.  This was the right strategy, one which I believe it will be vindicated in the course of a full review.  I look forward to such a review because I believe that we can learn many lessons.  As a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, I echo the calls for an investigation into what happened in those early months in primary hospitals and nursing homes.</p>  <p>  Ireland got many things right.  That is why we had one of the lowest death rates in Europe.  That is not a statistic but it is people's lives.  It is why we had one of the most successful vaccine roll-outs.  It is why independent analysis ranked us highly in how we balanced restrictions and freedoms.  I saw both Opposition and Government Deputies call for this or that to open or close.  I did it too.  We all had good reasons for making those cases and we made them on behalf of good people.  Government had the job of deciding on that balance.  Decisions were required.  While some in the House had the role of challenging those decisions, those of us on this side of the House had a role in making them.  They were always made in the interests of the Irish people and in their interests alone.</p>  <p>  As we emerge from Covid-19, we will have to learn lessons.  For me, our reliance on key public services and their importance have been key learnings.  Childcare, public health, drug support, education and caring professions all need resources.  They need public funding and, importantly, public governance.  On the return to work, Dublin is already seeing increased traffic and longer commuting times.  Our city centre is seeing life again, but our urban villages are losing some of the life they gained.  How do we retain the balance the Government had to strike at a national level?  People saved hours of time commuting and gained those hours with their families.  How do we challenge ourselves to ensure we maintain that balance?  How can we set targets for those people who work for the Government to make sure more people are able to work from home?</p>  <p>  By God, we have all missed travel but we discovered some new and old gems in Ireland.  How do we ensure Irish tourism is the first choice for people travelling abroad?  For international travel, with climate change being our next challenge, we have to ask whether we are really paying the full carbon cost of international travel and low-cost flights?  There are so many things we could learn from Covid-19 but, as Deputy Creed said, the response to the Covid-19 challenge meant we learned how to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to solutions and to supporting their implementation.  That is the key lesson for me in how we learn from Covid and implement many of the solutions identified in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

James Joyce was rightly quoted in the current context.  If Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Casey had been around two years ago when Covid-19 appeared on our shores, he would have squinted out the window and said, &ldquo;The blinds is down Joxer, the blinds is down.&rdquo;  They were, and the challenges were huge.  Nobody knew what was coming around the corner.  It serves us well to remember what Deputy Creed and others have said.  At a time of crisis, people with nerve are needed to stand up, do what has to be done, call on those who need to be called upon,and put the right people in the right places to ensure we are on the right track.  I believe that was done.  We were critical at many times in this House and we made contradictory statements in which we called for more, less or maybe nothing to be done.</p> <p>The people at the helm and on the front line, those who managed the pandemic and the individuals and families who paid the price all had an influence.  Some paid a huge price.  Some paid with their lives.  One way or the other, we muddled through it.  It was not really muddling because it was well-charted and we were able to do it at least as well as anybody else across the globe and better than most, even though the Government, the Minister and the system were criticised.  Our self-belief returned.  It was possible to identify what we could do if we made up our minds to do it.  We now have to apply those principles to the delivery of health services in general.  We cannot go along indefinitely complaining about the system and saying somebody should do something.  We have to do it ourselves and that can be done with the right will.  If the will is there, we should utilise it.</p></speech>

We have already seen our older people left out of Government announcements, particularly those living in nursing homes.  The Government has been slow to consider their needs.  Those who are medically vulnerable and those with suppressed immune systems have been left to fend for themselves.  I urge the Government to be more inclusive and to consider the effect of its announcements on all of our citizens.</p>  <p>  There must be a public inquiry into the pandemic response.  It must include an investigation into the failures in some nursing homes and pre-existing failures such as low ICU capacity, which made us all more vulnerable.  It should look at issues of poor planning, slow response times and mixed messaging by Government over the course of the pandemic.  Mistakes were made and must be learned from.  The terms of reference for this inquiry must be drawn up in consultation with civil society groups to encompass a wide range of concerns.</p>  <p>  One thing made clear by this pandemic is that we need an independent nursing home regulator.  There must be consequences for the minority of nursing homes that had serious shortcomings and the consequent isolation, neglect, and loss of health and life that were experienced.  Any inquiry must also look at how failures to properly resource the health service, and failures to modernise and advance critical reforms, contributed to the difficulties faced by hospitals and the health system during the pandemic.  It cannot ignore workers&rsquo; rights, such as sick pay entitlements, and how we can make a wide range of changes across society and the economy to ensure a fairer Ireland.  The pandemic bonus payment is to be welcomed but the Government must commit to including workers in section 38 and 39 organisations, as well as family carers.</p>  <p>  I have been inundated with emails from students who are worried about the recent leaving certificate announcement.  I urge the Minister for Education to listen to our students, to rethink the path she has chosen and not to repeat the same mistake with our junior certificate students.</p></speech>

In March 2020, none of us here knew what lay ahead and nor did the public outside.  I recall having a phone conversation with a HSE manager at the time and, to be frank, I was not the better of it when that conversation ended because of the sheer scale of what was being presented as a possibility.  We have moved out of the emergency phase and lockdown and cocooning are hopefully consigned to the history books but there remains a fragility from those restrictions and there will be for some time to come because fear, anxiety and hesitancy remain.  Accompanying that is a backlog of missed vital medical appointments, whether in the disability sector or physical or mental health sectors.  Each and every one of those must be addressed.  We also need a mechanism for dealing with long Covid.  That impact must be forensically examined, as much every other sector and service.</p>  <p>  We cannot ignore the response to Covid that happened in our nursing home sector, and we should not seek to do so.  Events like that should never be seen again under any circumstances.  There are scars, some of which are visible and some that are invisible.  People said their first hellos and their last goodbyes through windows or on Zoom and they still need time and supports to heal.  I still speak with mothers who are justifiably struggling to move on from giving birth under the most severe of maternity restrictions.  They felt isolated and alone and they feel that to this day.</p>  <p>  It will take some time to bounce back as a society.  For some it will take longer and for others it will be less of an ask.  While a new day may be dawning, we cannot walk away without taking steps to ensure that issues surrounding nursing homes, PPE, health, maternity services and the imbalance that existed in our society before Covid are examined in detail and that lessons are learned.  None of us likes to think of it but we may be back in this situation again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="15:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200043#VV00500"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak today.  The Covid pandemic has been a life-changing experience for us all.  Who would have thought a couple of years ago of the impact Covid has had on each and every one of us?  Thankfully, it seems we are now over the worst of this pandemic and society is starting to get back to normal, although we need to remain cautious.  We need to look after our front-line staff.  There is a lot of work being done at the moment.  I think of the medical staff who fought this disease with great courage and skill.  They are the real heroes and they continue to do this heroic work on a daily basis, often in very difficult circumstances.  I also thank the staff of the many retail businesses that remained open during the pandemic, ensuring that we all had access to vital supplies.  It is important that we recognise the great efforts made by everyone who made these great sacrifices for our health system.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, many of our loved ones were taken from us as a direct result of this pandemic.  It is very important going forward that we remember those who lost their lives as a direct result of Covid.  These people made the ultimate sacrifice and we must never forget that.  As we start to get to other side of this pandemic, we must learn from it.  There was no roadmap when this pandemic hit and a lot of people died.  It is easy to look back with hindsight and be an expert.  What is important now is that we learn from our mistakes.</p>  <p>  I am very disappointed that despite all the additional funding that was made available to tackle this pandemic, it seems we are no better off when it comes to the number of ICU beds available in the health service.  The reason for such severe lockdown measures at the height of the pandemic was to protect the health system and ensure that ICUs in particular were not overrun.  I would have thought that a logical approach would be to increase the number of ICU beds to ensure we have a buffer.  A great exercise to carry out in the near future would be to look at how all the additional funding that was put into the healthcare system was spent and to see what long-term benefits will be achieved from it.  My fear is that we could be hit with another pandemic and unless we learn from this one, we could face even greater challenges.</p>  <p>  The bottom line is that we must now learn to live with Covid.  Locking down society is not the answer.  It has been clearly demonstrated that the vaccination roll-out was the main reason we are now past the worst of the pandemic.  For this reason, I urge everybody to please get vaccinated.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has left the Chamber but I wanted to raise with her the case of a 15-year-old girl in Dundalk who tried to commit suicide last week.  This child was crying out for help.  She contacted the helpline last week.  Due to the cleverness of the operator, she realised there was something going on and contacted the Garda.  Garda&iacute; came to the young girl's house, saved her and took her to hospital.  This is according to her mother.  This is not the first time this child tried to commit suicide.  The problem at the moment is that nobody seems to want to take responsibility.  When the girl was brought to the hospital, the hospital told her she did not have a medical condition.  CAMHS then got involved and got her to see a psychiatric consultant and social workers.  She keeps telling them she wants to commit suicide but at the same time she wants to live.  There is a lack of everything at the moment.  The health service only seems to deal with mental health issues from Monday to Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  If people go looking for anything at the weekend, they are wasting their time.  If they go to the Garda, they are told "What can we do?"  Garda&iacute; can go to someone's house and take the person to the hospital but then he or she is released.  What are we going to do going forward?  I do not know the answer.  Parents ring me saying they have a problem so I ring the hospital, which says it is nothing to do with it.  I ring CAMHS, Tusla and everybody else and they all say the same.  I am like a dog chasing its tail and going around in circles.</p> <p>I heard the Minister of State say earlier that she was spending millions doing this and that.  There is no point in spending millions if it will not help somebody.  A 15-year-old child came to me to look for help.  I contacted the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, three or four months ago, the last time the girl tried to commit suicide, and nothing was done.  I have a name which I will pass to the Minister of State, and I ask her to help this child.</p></speech>

It now signals, I hope, a transition out of Covid.  We will be asking questions about what we have learned.  There are a couple of issues I would like to raise in that regard, one of which is the use of antigen testing.  We will have to figure out how for 15 months we could not implement a public health measure which has shown its value in the past three months.  Another is how we ignored vitamin D.  I believe much of the science will point to that as a great health omission.</p><p>Beyond that, we have the issue of HSE procurement and the dysfunction in it.  We also have what I would call at this stage a forcing down of indigenous contractors who engaged with the HSE and now find the HSE trying to dictate new terms because it believes the Covid pandemic is passing.  These include companies which had antiviral drugs approved by the EPA but the Department of Health did not engage with them.</p><p>In terms of the hospital situation, we have significant waiting lists throughout the country.  I ask the Ministers of State to come up with a new strategy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  Where is Sl&aacute;intecare?  We know national community care networks are trying to organise but there is no evidence of that in the acute hospital sector.  When will we start to see that happen?</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has left the Chamber but she is well aware we have significant deficiencies at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, in neurology, diabetes, trauma care and general diagnostics, not to mention trying to advance our 24-7 cardiac issue.  I am seeking a forward capital development plan for University Hospital Waterford.  Such a plan should be published for each of the other hospitals as well in order that we can see what plan we will take forward.</p><p>We have a significant issue with recruitment to residential care homes and with work permits, as the Minister of State knows.  The T&aacute;naiste advised this morning that work permits could take up to 20 further weeks.  I ask that we look at taking an initiative in this regard.  There are people in direct provision centres who are qualified and there is potentially an opportunity to get them out of these centres and working for a short time.  We should give them some points towards their asylum applications based on that.  They can be shadowed by other public health workers.</p><p>I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, mention the drugs strategy.  I ask him again to look at supports for the drugs strategy, especially in Dublin.  We will either pay now or we will pay later.  It is as simple as that.  I also ask the Minister of State to look at what is happening with opioid abuse in America.  I am sure he is well aware of the problem, which is rampant in American universities.  This begs a question about education on the use of recreational drugs.</p><p>As we know, a significant number of section 38 and 39 workers are excluded from the front-line recognition bonus.  That is a mistake and I ask that it be revisited.  How is the recognition bonus demonstrating social cohesion to family carers and those looking after disabled persons in their homes?</p><p>I welcome the future national CAMHS review.  We cannot operate hospital care without multidisciplinary teams and we most definitely cannot do this for CAMHS either.  I am sure a new review will show that.  We need significant investment in that area.</p><p>We will have to consider setting up long Covid clinics throughout the country.  There is ample evidence of its effects, similar to other post-viral syndromes.  We will have to look at whether we are giving people the best care possible.</p><p>Will insiders or outsiders lead the proposed national Covid public inquiry, expert review or whatever it will be?  What lessons will be discussed?  A significant number of voices have been left outside public health policy over the past two years.  If we want to have a full, frank and open discussion that will teach us anything, we have to allow other voices to be heard.</p></speech>

I know this is the reason restrictions have been eased.  We have heard from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, that getting back to activity is possible now and we have much to look forward to.</p>  <p>  However, I have concerns, one of which is the case numbers and that people are still getting sick.  My understanding is that children are still getting sick.  We very much need ongoing close monitoring of the virus.  The message has to be that the pandemic is still not over.  There is a sense that people who are highly vaccinated or have already contracted the virus have changed their attitudes about the virus.  I have heard many people talk about that in the past few weeks.  We still have to be very careful because there is always a risk.  While Omicron infections led to a smaller share of hospitalisation than infections with the Delta variant, China, which is hosting the Winter Olympics, is taking measures to contain travellers from abroad and avoid mixing with the population of Beijing.</p>  <p>  We have reopened, which is great for our economy, tourism and hospitality, but we must accept that we still have a protective role.  While we must communicate that people should continue to follow the current advice for those with symptoms and are close contacts and continue to wear masks and maintain clean hands, we cannot lay everything on the good people of Ireland who have already done so much.  We must take steps to continue to protect public health.  We must maximise the uptake of the primary and booster vaccinations and those travelling to Ireland continue to follow guidance.  We must also boost our public health sector to catch any outbreaks that may occur.</p>  <p>  As we reopen, we need to look at the pinch points.  As I raised with An Taoiseach yesterday, my understanding is that most dentists do not accept medical card patients for treatment.  Many people have been unable to afford to pay privately and their dental health has suffered immensely.  Only one dentist in Carlow is taking medical cards right now.  That has been a very big issue for me.</p>  <p>  I have also had people contact me about GPs.  In fairness to GPs, they have been giving vaccinations and boosters but some of them have not been seeing patients.  Some patients have contacted me to say they very much want to be able to see their doctor face to face when they have medical complaints.  Doctors, GPs and nurses have been very good about telephoning patients and some doctors are seeing patients but there are still some who are not.  I ask that this be looked at.</p>  <p>  I have also had many people contact me who are waiting on operations and feel they need to get in to the hospitals to have their operations.  One lady who contacted me needed a knee replacement.  She is an elderly lady with a medical card and had been waiting.  We understand we had to be careful during Covid about people visiting hospitals or going in for operations.  She was told it would be a long time before she had her operation.  She ended up going private and her family had to save the money to get the operation for her.  We should deal with the issue of people needing operations, especially those who are experiencing significant pain.  While it is good that we have moved on, we have to ensure people who need operations or to see their dentists or GPs are in a position to do so and will be seen.</p>  <p>  Another lady who appealed to me is immunocompromised and she feels the immunocompromised have been left very much to fend for themselves and that no information is passed to the population as a whole which might make people think twice about what they can do and about the concerns of the immunocompromised.  I ask the Ministers of State to look at that.  It is a good day in that we are moving on and returning to normality.</p></speech>

I am sure the Ministers of State will join me in paying tribute to those who have been working on the front line of the Covid-19 situation in our hospitals, especially in intensive care units given the stress and strain on workers in that setting.  The National Ambulance Service has also been absolutely extraordinary.</p>  <p>  I have worked hand in hand with the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, throughout the past two years.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge and thank both of them, most sincerely, for their work.  I have also worked with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on issues pertaining to drug addiction and other addiction issues throughout the pandemic which, of course, remain a concern for me.</p> <p>I have ongoing concerns regarding drug addiction among younger people in our society.  Sadly, the pandemic has brought unimaginable levels of stress and pressure on young people.  It has had knock-on impacts on all sectors of society.  I am not forgetting about anybody here but I want to focus particularly on teenagers and people in their 20s, and their growth and development in life.  Every parent in the Chamber will join me in acknowledging this point.  The group has been so badly impacted, it is hard to get a measure of the damage that has been done.  That is something that the health service will have to be cognisant of in the next number of years.</p> <p> When it comes to drug use, unfortunately, with pubs and other hospitality settings where alcohol is consumed having been closed, from my experience, the go to substance for people who were using for recreational use has been cocaine.  I have many concerns about the level of cocaine consumption.  Once upon a time, this was only an issue within cities.  Acknowledging, of course, that it is an issue, it was not something that was seen in rural areas but no matter where anyone goes in rural Ireland now, whether in a pub in any town or village in my constituency or, indeed, in our cities, this is a serious and growing problem.  According to the figures, drug consumption, particularly of cocaine, is climbing and the age bracket at which it is being consumed is lowering.  That is frightening.  It merits us putting additional focus and resources on particularly the area of advertising.  It is so important.</p> <p> I do not want to finish without acknowledging that the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, has been very helpful in his communication to me on that particular issue but I would call on the Department of Health to focus on a public advertising campaign to inform young people about the dangers of drug use.  It may not happen every drug user but there will be one or two individuals in a group of 20 who may have a bad reaction ,which, unfortunately, often leads to long-term consequences for their health and, in some cases, death.  That is something that frightens me, as a 24-year old.  I want to highlight that that should be prioritised within the Department.</p> <p> I also want to acknowledge some of the points that were made by Deputy Murnane O'Connor  regarding the immunocompromised.  These points have been relayed to me.  It is important for people within society to acknowledge that there are people among us who face many health risks and they are worried about, and fearful of, reintegrating back into normality, as we would have known it before 2019, given what we have lost out on over the past two years.  It is important that there would be a focus on public information in this regard for the next number of months.</p></speech>

There is a direct correlation.  We have a new 60-bed ward.  That 60-bed ward was supposed to alleviate the emergency department, ED.  That is being used as an isolation ward for Covid.  There are 78 patients in UHL with Covid.  There are five in ICU.  It is welcome that the numbers are reducing but the task for Government at present is how to get the number of people with Covid in hospital down.  If it can deal with that, the number of people in hospital with Covid will reduce and beds will be freed up for other elective work that is not happening and that had to be put back previously.  That is primary task.  Let us put a plan in action to get the number of patients in hospitals with Covid down.  There are 89 in the ED in UHL and 78 in the hospital with Covid.  That speaks for itself.</p>  <p>  Once we deal with that task, we have to evolve the way we deal with Covid.  We have to get to live with Covid fully.  NPHET has done great work but the next strategies, and the medium-term strategy, are being developed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is looking at it with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I refer to this expert advisory group with Professor Brady.  We now have to get to a point where we need to bring in the business, education and voluntary sectors as well as all the other sectors that are directly impacted by Covid.  NPHET becomes part of that equation.  Effectively, they provide public health advice.  In the long term, we cannot have further major lockdowns because businesses and schools cannot withstand them.  I ask that the new model that is considered be a more inclusive model where NPHET is part of it but there are business groups and other groups involved making decisions in real time to ensure that we bring in measures to enable us to live with Covid while at the same allowing business can function.</p>  <p>  The big task for Government is to reduce the number of people with Covid in hospital.  Omicron has not generated as many ICU cases but some people are ending up in hospital.  If we get that number down, then at least we can then deal with large ED numbers in hospitals such as UHL with 89 patients on trolleys, and with 78 in hospital with Covid.  The new 96-bed block needs to be built as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

An ambitious and co-ordinated tourism plan from public and private stakeholders must be considered to prevent the industry from faltering.  Tourism was one of the first sectors hit by Covid-19.  It is likely to be the last to recover.  A co-ordinated plan is now required in the short term.  A rapid and sustainable financial recovery support package tailored to the needs of each tourism sub-sector alongside strategic operational supports must be established.</p>  <p>  My time is short here but I, along with, I am sure, the rest of the Deputies present, have been inundated with requests from parents of children to get rid of face masks.  If we do not need them in restaurants, bars, etc., why do our children have to suffer wearing them?  They have become submissive enough because of this pandemic.  It is time for us all to live with it, especially our children.</p>  <p>  While I am on matters related to NPHET, I think it needs to be disbanded immediately.  Lessons needs to be learnt that no one should have been given the power it was given.</p></speech>

They showed us the need to reassess how we support our schools.  Inequality was deepened.  There is an issue regarding schools accessing the delivering equality of opportunity in schools,DEIS, programme and in attaining DEIS status.  The current process needs to be reassessed because disadvantaged communities are not being captured by the current programme.  This needs to be reassessed.</p>  <p>  Many schools have been told that the reason they have not been included is that they do not have the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage among their pupil cohort.  The principals in many schools know their communities and their students well.  We need to listen more to them.  The DEIS model needs to be urgently reassessed to address the deep inequality that exists in education.</p></speech>

Targets are set at random but are never met.  Following a similar debate last year in the House, a target of 100,000 additional outpatient appointments were promised but we were to find that only 33,000 happened.  What transpired with the person who set the 100,000 target or what happened to people who only had 33,000 come through the doors?  Where is the accountability?  In the first four weeks of January 500 procedures were cancelled.  I was contacted by the parents of a young girl with cystic fibrosis who were getting her ready for an operation.  They spent three months readying their young daughter for her operation.  They got to the hospital, she was on the bed and she was being prepped for the operation.  Half an hour before the operation was to go ahead, they told her it could not go ahead because they did not have a proper bed for her.  What about the damage done to the parents and the daughter after what they had to do to get her there in the first place?  She was on the operating bed in the hospital only to be told to go home.  They were told they did not know when the reschedule the operation because they did not have a proper bed for that child.  That can never happen again.  We have to make sure the staff in our hospitals have the proper equipment and management skills to make sure no child or other patient who goes in for an operation has to leave the hospital and go home after three months of preparation for such a big operation?</p> <p>Will the Ministers of State please ensure the accountability of management?</p></speech>

That was the saddest part of the whole thing.  It should not have happened and I ask that it not be allowed to happen again, especially as visitors are being severely impeded from entering hospitals.  Some people became seriously sick, such as Jim Tangney from the Black Valley, a naturally fit man, and Teddy O'Connor, who is still sick.  The front-line workers did so much for everyone under a great deal of pressure.</p>  <p>  I am very disappointed with the plan for the leaving certificate and the way it was announced.  The youngsters who missed so much should have been given a choice.  They have been ringing me over and over again because they are very worried.  I am concerned that this will create further problems.  The Government made the wrong decision.  I do not blame any individual, but the Government made the wrong decision.  Students should be given a choice.  Perhaps it is not too late.  They are not happy in respect of this issue.</p>  <p>  Most unusual advice and guidelines were given by NPHET.  For example, there was the restriction whereby people had to leave indoor public spaces by 8 p.m.  I do not have time to comment further so I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I thank all those who worked in the hospitality sector when it was allowed to stay open, and those who worked in shops that kept business going when that was allowed to keep going.  I thank each and every one of them.  I also thank the people involved in healthcare, such as those who provided home help, carers and individuals who visited homes in the most difficult of circumstances.</p>  <p>  We need clarity with regard to the wearing of masks in the future.  It is crazy that we have to wear them in shops but not in public houses.  We need to know what we are and are not supposed to do.</p>  <p>  Older people were kept separate from the rest of society, which was very hard on them.  We need our hospitals to be able to open in a safe way for visits.  We need to take care of people on waiting lists, who have had to play second fiddle all along, which we understand was necessary because of the Covid crisis.  Most importantly, we need to acknowledge the families who lost someone during this crisis.  We are all able to carry on now but we must reiterate to those who have lost relatives that we are so sorry for what happened to them, their families and the lovely and beautiful people who left before their time and who should be still here.  Every time we have a debate in the House, we should remember those very important people.</p></speech>

I do not have much time to contribute, so I must ask myself what points are important to make.  I do not wish to waste that time commenting on a senior Minister's absence from the debate while he attends a well-being expo.  I said earlier, and I reiterate it now for the record, that it is entirely unacceptable.  The Ministers of State seem to be entirely overworked.  I pay tribute to their work on the ground.  The Minister for Health should be here because the announcement to lift the restrictions, while welcome, was made outside of the House, without any placing of it in the context of the draconian legislation still on the Statute Book and when that will be lifted, and without any reference to a human rights assessment of what we have been through.  While I forgive everything that happened in the beginning because, clearly, the pandemic developed very suddenly, and while I participated in the debate on and gave my consent to the draconian legislation to which I refer, I never again did so on the basis that I never once accepted that the Government was being frank with me regarding either the facts and figures or a human rights assessment.  In fact, when I raised this recently with the Taoiseach, I think his response, although I am subject to correction, was that he was too busy for a human rights assessment but that he would have no problem with one in the future.</p>  <p>  This pandemic is now included in the national risk assessment register for the next time.  When we look back on it, we will need to look at the preparedness and the planning, and we will need to learn from what has happened.  A cross-party committee recommended an inquiry into what happened in nursing homes but no action has been taken on foot of any of its recommendations.  There has been a press release about a look-back exercise but, again, no Minister has provided terms of reference or told us what we are setting out to learn.  The main issue that has jumped out at me over the past two years related to the compliance of the public, which was noted repeatedly in the Policing Authority's very detailed reports.  One of the very good mechanisms that was set up, I think by the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, ensured that the policing powers would be monitored.  The Policing Authority was given that role and carried it out very effectively.  It praised the Garda when praise was due and it also highlighted some of the problems, but the main issue that was highlighted concerned the compliance of the population.</p>  <p>  When we clap hands and give awards, that is for the people who showed us the way.  The Government moved from a position of solidarity, whereby we were all in it together, to one of division.  We did that first with the over-70s and we then ended up using our children to protect adults.  It had never happened, to my knowledge, in the history of the world that we would use children, who were not themselves in danger, to protect adults.  We then brought in a mandate of mask-wearing at school for them.  I happily wear my mask and comply with everything, but this has been done without any built-in review until the end of February, although I acknowledge that seems to have begun happening.  We are doing this without any thought about the effects on children.  One has only to read the special rapporteur's report on the effects of Covid on children and the disproportionate effects on different groups.  We were never all in this together, although we were given the illusion at the beginning by the people who led us that we were.</p></speech>

I thank our front-line workers, who kept society together and kept it going.  I offer my solidarity and sympathy to those who died, their families and, importantly, the people of Ireland because, as I have said many times, they have listened closely to NPHET and have been way ahead of the Government guidelines.  We have an opportunity now to take certain actions to help us prepare for new variants and waves of infection and, I hope, to avoid the necessity of a return to restrictions or to have further lockdowns.</p>  <p>  There are three key areas in which action is needed.  First, we have to recognise that we entered the pandemic two years ago with a public health system that was not fit for purpose and that remains so.  The recent revelations regarding mental healthcare for children and young adults in south Kerry are just one example of the effects of years of underfunding and under-resourcing.  It is a system in crisis.  The many problems cannot be resolved overnight.  It is not just a question of funding, although that is badly needed, it is also a question of dealing with the fundamental reforms outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  There is now no excuse for the lack of urgency or the foot-dragging by the Department of Health and the HSE.  Sl&aacute;intecare must be prioritised, with clear targets set and achieved.</p>  <p>  The second issue relates to ventilation.  We need a national plan to monitor schools, hospitals, nursing homes, all public buildings, hospitality areas and workplaces in order to ensure they are properly ventilated.  Where buildings or areas within them do not allow for adequate ventilation, specialised equipment must be installed to bring in fresh air and expel stale air.  We need an inspection regime to monitor, in particular, workplaces and hospitality venues.  If there are not enough inspectors, there are thousands of health and safety officers in trade unions in workplaces throughout the country and we could approach them to ask whether they would play a part in this.</p>  <p>  Third, vaccine inequality must end.  It is a killer.  People have died because they did not get a vaccine or because they could not afford oxygen that was not provided by underfunded and under-resourced public health systems throughout the world.  Vaccine inequality is not just obscene, it is madness.  While large numbers of people in middle and low-income countries are unvaccinated, new variants of this killer disease are inevitable.  It does not make sense, unless someone is a big investor in or an executive at Pfizer or Moderna.  Within a week of the arrival of Omicron, these two companies saw their share prices increase by more than $10 billion, with the CEO of Moderna, St&eacute;phane Bancel, adding more than $800 million to his personal wealth.</p> <p>I want to end with a quote from Tim Bierley, a pharma campaigner at Global Justice Now, who stated:</p><blockquote>	Pharmaceutical companies knew that grotesque levels of vaccine inequality would create prime conditions for new variants to emerge.  They let Covid-19 spread unabated in low and middle-income countries.  And now the same pharma execs and shareholders are making a killing from a crisis they helped to create.  It&rsquo;s utterly obscene. </blockquote> <p>Human Rights Watch and M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res have identified over 100 factories which could produce mRNA vaccines if intellectual property barriers were removed.  The blocking of these is absurd.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="16:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200047#ZZ00200"><p>I am grateful to have the time to talk about the easing of Covid-19 restrictions and I thank all speakers for their contributions.  Without a doubt, Ireland has come through some dark and challenging days, and I hope and expect that we are now entering a brighter time.  It is timely for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to be in the House because he was here at the start, while we are representing the current Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, this evening.</p>  <p>  It has been more than 22 months since Covid-19 arrived with us, causing immense disruption across our health and social care services and society.  I wish to recognise the extraordinary continuing contribution of all our front-line staff and the public during this unprecedented time.  This has been essential to coping with Covid-19.  As the Ministers of State, Deputies Feighan and Butler, have noted, it is thanks to their hard work, and the exceptional support of the Irish people for the necessary public health restrictions and for the national vaccination programme that we are in a position to ease these restrictions.</p>  <p>  It is also important to remember the grief that is felt by so many who have lost loved ones to the pandemic.  Covid-19 has taken a devastating toll on so many families around the country.  However, no one should be in any doubt that the collective efforts of the Irish people during this difficult time have saved many lives.  We will take time in March, around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, to remember those we have lost and to recognise these efforts.</p>  <p>  We have been learning and adapting our response throughout the pandemic and we have already established processes, as needed, as part of ensuring the best possible response to this unprecedented challenge.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, recently established a new public health reform expert advisory group, with a membership of 13 national and international public health experts, chaired by Professor Hugh Brady.  This expert group will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic in Ireland.  It will then look at strengthening health protection in Ireland generally and enhancing our future public health pandemic preparedness.  It will also identify lessons from international best practice regarding reform and strengthening of our core public health functions.  The first meeting of the group took place on Monday.  We look forward to hearing its findings when it reports in the middle of this year.</p>  <p>  As the Minster with responsibility for disabilities, it is important that I raise how Covid-19 also presented huge challenges for people with disabilities and their families over the course of the pandemic.  Services were unavoidably impacted by necessary restrictions in line with public health guidance.  All services continued to be provided to service users with the highest priority throughout the pandemic and, in line with the guidance provided, all services are currently being built back up to full capacity in a safe and robust manner.</p>  <p>  One of the main issues raised with me over the pandemic relates to adult day services, which were probably the disability service most affected by the crisis.  Approximately 18,000 people attend adult day services, including more than 4,000 people in receipt of both residential and day services, so it is a substantial cohort.  Adult day services had been closed from March 2020 but I made it a priority to open them by deeming disability services an essential service in mid-2020.  In September 2020, all day services reopened at reduced capacity, reflecting public health guidance, and then reopened at full capacity on 22 October 2021.  While services were closed or reduced, innovative and original remote supports were developed.  The curtailment and reduction in service was in line with public health guidance but also due to staff shortages in residential and day services due to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  For those watching and listening in, I am aware that, more recently, significant staff shortages are still causing issues in residential and day services.  Some locations have had to close for a short duration while other day services have had reduced service levels in line with the availability of staff.  I am monitoring this closely from week to week but I am delighted that the HSE reports that the number of staff on Covid leave is decreasing.  While there will continue to be a level of disruption to day services in the months ahead, the HSE is confident these are manageable.  I can confirm that the HSE expects full restoration of day services by the end of March.</p>  <p>  Another issue often raised with me is respite.  While some centres remained open, others operated at a reduced capacity and some were temporarily repurposed as isolation facilities.  I made &euro;5 million available in the 2021 budget to open nine additional respite houses in 2021 to provide an additional 10,400 respite nights in a full year.  Work continues to progress on the nine respite houses for 2021, with five of the houses now either fully or partially operational.  Unfortunately, some of the houses were subject to delays relating to recruitment and procurement, and the remainder of the houses are due to open in the coming months.  Notwithstanding this, it&rsquo;s positive to see that the number of respite overnights operated at 4.5% ahead of the national service plan target for the first three quarters of 2021.</p>  <p>  The delivery of therapeutic interventions to children awaiting services has been hindered by the pandemic.  Disability service providers worked innovatively to ensure supports could be provided across the sector.  This included assessments and therapeutic interventions for children either online or in person throughout the pandemic.  I am continuing work to ensure there is an increase in the delivery of interventions on the ground so our children get the supports they so badly need.  For me, this is the most important success I could achieve in 2022 after such a disruption in service.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Government&rsquo;s agreement to give a Covid-19 recognition payment to front-line public sector healthcare workers to recognise their unique role during the pandemic, it is important I take this opportunity to echo the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments during Leaders&rsquo; Questions yesterday regarding section 39 organisations as I have received many questions seeking clarity on this.  Those eligible for the Covid-19 recognition payment are general front-line public healthcare workers who are directly employed by the public health sector and who worked or trained in environments exposed to Covid-19 or clinical settings.  Aside from the staff covered by that, staff also intended to be covered by this arrangement are home carers working for and contracted out to the HSE and agency staff who worked in clinical settings for the HSE, including agency nurses, doctors, cleaners and paramedics.  Those working in long-term disability care facilities under section 39 and in public-private voluntary nursing homes and hospices are also covered.  The arrangements for processing this decision are currently being finalised by the Department of Health and the HSE.</p>  <p>  As my colleagues have noted, while we are now in a positive position, it is important to stress that Covid-19 is not yet over in Ireland.  There is a need for ongoing close monitoring of the virus.  The emergence of new variants with increased levels of transmissibility, immune escape or virulence remains a high risk, both nationally and globally.  This point is particularly important in the context of continued high levels of infection and variance in vaccine supply and uptake globally.  It is important that we continue to follow public health advice and we must maximise the uptake of the primary and booster vaccinations.  Our national vaccination programme will continue to work to reach those who have not yet been protected, and work is under way to ensure that a flexible and robust vaccine delivery system is in place for the future.</p>  <p>  Throughout this crisis, the solidarity demonstrated across communities all around Ireland has helped us to rise to the immense challenges we have faced.  As we move forward, it is important that we continue to show this same solidarity and give each other the space to adapt and respond to the lifting of restrictions in our own time.  This is a shared responsibility for us all and it will be critical as we adapt to this new phase of management of the pandemic.  We know what we can achieve by working together.</p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge the role that carers in the home played throughout all of the pandemic.  While I talk about respite or day services not being available, it is not wasted on me or my colleagues that the people who deliver that are also the carers in the home.  I acknowledge the pressure and the stress that they are under.  We all have to work together on this.  One of the first things that I learned when I went into the Department of Health was about the collective approach by the Department of Health, HSE and the providers.  We need to not lose that as we come out of Covid.  We need to ensure that collaborative work together continues, because that is the only way that we can get jobs done.</p></speech>

Higher education is a serious business.  It is critical to our economic, social, and cultural progress.  When you gather all the sources of public funding flowing into these institutions, it becomes a serious sum.  Our methods of oversight and accountability are not appropriate.  I said this to the Minister during previous statements.  They do not keep up with the job of trying to keep tabs on our shrewd university presidents.  Of course, we all want vibrant, independent and critical institutions, but other countries navigate these choppy waters of accountability and independence.  I am still stunned at the cheek of the sector, using a largely publicly-funded purse to fund an elaborate marketing campaign recently, Save Our Spark, hammering home its cause for additional funding.  It is hard to believe these claims when the sector can drop &euro;250,000 into such public relations, PR, generation and promotion.</p>  <p>  As a Deputy, as I said before, I have no way to find out about, for example, UCD's exotic financial arrangements in the Orient.  Do lecturers get topped-up salaries, effectively double pay?  Who actually owns the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland?  How can UCC afford &euro;215 million for just two buildings?  How much do they cost per square metre?  On what planet is that square metre cost value for money?</p>  <p>  The university's annual reports are junk PR.  They are all sizzle and no sausage.  The university presidents have grace and favour housing with wine cellars, butlers, chefs and waiting staff.  Their extravagance in the sector is the stuff of legend.  Yet, this year, I will be asked as a Deputy to provide a Vote of more than &euro;2 billion for that sector.  How can I know what I am supporting?  It is terrifying that, collectively, our seven universities now appear to have borrowing of just under &euro;1 billion.  Presumably, there is some recourse to the State if these institutions cannot meet these debts.  This is terrifying because university governance issues have clogged up the Committee of Public Accounts for years.</p>  <p>  Time and again, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has failed us.  It has failed in its job of oversight and to properly allocate public resources in ways that best serve the public interest.  Indeed, the HEA appears to allocate university funding based on a custom and practice model from before modern Ireland emerged.  It has failed in its job to make the sector transparent.  It has failed to stamp out bad practice or to hold runaway university presidents and their wild expenditures to account.  They have demonstrated that they cannot be frugal.  They have a tin ear to the public and cannot manage their social responsibilities.  They operate under the fabrication that they are financially independent of the State, a situation which I understand is necessary to avoid their considerable debts hitting the national balance sheet, but that cannot be used as an excuse to avoid responsibility to the people of Ireland.  That is why I welcome this Bill in principle.  I commend the Minister on introducing it.</p>  <p>  I advise the Minister that Trinity will have to be included in these measures.  I know that Trinity has a special place in the heart of these Houses.  Three Senators is a remarkable privilege.  The Trinity of historic, aristocratic privilege was established by toffs with ruffs around their necks.  I cannot be parleyed into escaping the simple fact that Trinity is now a modern institution of our Republic and substantially relies on public funding.  The funding for Trinity is greater in measure than that provided to many other similar institutions.  The patronage, custom and practice of the University of Limerick, as the Minister has reminded me, is the worst reason possible to avoid good governance.  I welcome that these measures appear to replicate those of the new technological universities and represent a joining of the two sectors, so to speak.</p>  <p>  This House and the Minister have promised Waterford a university of equal standing, along with the south east.  This Bill appears to be putting the universities and technological universities on a similar footing, which is a good thing.  This morning, on Leader's Questions, the Taoiseach told me that the technological university for the south east was the signature investment that Government will make in the region, which I should concentrate all my efforts on.  The Taoiseach is certainly signalling significant investment for the technological university for the south east.  I hope that, along with this progressive legislation that the Minister is proposing today, that the quantum of funding that he will announce for the technological university for the south east will be as transformative as the Government signalled in the House this morning.  The reform of third level education demands it.  Ending the south east's brain drain and political and regional equity demand it.  I hope that, despite the progressive governance legislation that the Minister hopes to enact here, we in the south east do not stand to be disappointed.</p></speech>

I supported and welcomed last year the inclusion of apprenticeship courses in the Central Applications Office, CAO, process, which is an important step towards encouraging people into the trades, in line with European norms.  There is progress with the technological university of the south east.  I know the Minister has been supportive of the project and I welcome the progress that he and his Department are making towards the 1 May deadline.  The university will be fully up and running, with, as soon as possible thereafter, a campus for County Wexford.</p><p>There benefits of the project and the university are worth repeating.  The costs for students from Wexford and other south-east counties of having to go to university in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, or further afield is obvious.  These costs are often prohibitive.  Having a university in the south east may help to alleviate this.  Investment in the area is helped by having a university presence.  Private companies want to invest in areas where there is a workforce with the necessary skills and qualifications.  The number of IDA Ireland jobs in Wexford is far below what it should be <i>per capita</i>.  There may be a number of contributing factors causing this, but there is no doubt that our lack of a university is part of the problem.  For a county with such amazing access to the UK and continental Europe, it is amazing that it is not promoted more prominently by IDA Ireland.</p><p>The core objectives outlined by the Bill are important, with the overall aim of providing a high quality, student focused system with appropriate oversight and accountability to underpin public confidence of  stakeholders, students and the public.  One area of concern, which is not just an issue in Ireland, but is a growing problem worldwide is the protection of freedom of speech.  Ideas should be debated openly and voices of those who are willing to challenge prevailing views should be heard, no matter how unpopular, controversial, or unpalatable they may seem to some.  Our third level sector should be a hotbed of debate, diversity of opinion and inquiring minds.  Those values must be protected.  The Higher Education Authority has an important role here.  Section 47 mentions lifelong and flexible learning.  It states that An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s will promote and support designated institutions of higher education in the development and provision of lifelong and flexible learning.</p><p>As someone who completed a degree as a part-time student, I was very grateful to be able to study in the evening in a way which allowed me to continue working.  The nine-to-five college day certainly does not suit everyone and there are many people who would love to be able to continue their learning while holding down a full-time job.  It is a challenge but our third level institutions go to great lengths to cater to people in this position.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to give some consideration to those students who have not taken up their course and who will be competing with those who got predicted grades.  It is an issue and it may prohibit some from gaining access to college and, unfortunately, they are some years away from being mature students.  We do not want to lose these people to emigration.  I would like to see us concentrating on finding a solution that will ensure that we can retain our own professionals here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="16:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200049#BBB00200"><p>While I know it is not the Minister's area of responsibility, I will start by speaking on behalf of the students in my constituency who are not happy with the way they have been treated in relation to this year's leaving certificate.  These students have been hugely impacted by Covid-19.  They have had their senior cycle education totally disrupted.  Some had underlying conditions which meant they were studying from home more than others.  Some had no broadband and no computers or tablets.  It is highly unfair that they are not being given the option of a hybrid leaving certificate.  Schools have been closed for long periods and teachers and students have been off sick.  Let us not forget that these young people have lost two years of living their lives like normal students.  Again, I would urge the Minister to discuss this with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley and reconsider the decision.</p>  <p>  In the aftermath of Covid-19 thousands of young people are struggling with mental health and addiction issues.  Many have fallen out of the school system and have become socially isolated.  There are huge waiting lists for psychological and psychiatric services, including counselling.  The closure of Cara Lodge in west Cork in 2020 exacerbated an already difficult situation in my own constituency.  We need to include the mental health of our young people when we are speaking about higher education.  This must be a priority in terms of funding.  </p>  <p>  One of the main problems faced by students is trying to source accommodation.  This is a complication for students every year.  There must be some solution found for students who live hours away from college.  In Cork South-West we have no public transport infrastructure, unlike the situation in the cities.  While we have a private operator who puts on a service for students, he is under severe pressure to keep routes open and working.  There is no harm in me fighting in this House for a third level college in west Cork.  People from the Beara peninsula, Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and throughout west Cork are travelling up to Cork city and for some, the journey takes two or two and a half hours.  There was talk previously of a third level college being set up in Skibbereen and that would be a super location.  It would be of great help to those young people who are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to get accommodation in the city.</p>  <p>  The Minister must provide clarification and assurances to the D&aacute;il regarding third level funding.  The director general of the Irish Universities Association, Mr. Jim Miley, welcomed the Government's Higher Education Authority Bill 2020 but said the issue of serious underfunding of the sector must also be addressed.  In fact, Mr. Miley told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that legislative reform of the higher education sector will be meaningless if institutions do not receive adequate funding.  Currently the HEA's core legal function is to allocate recurrent funding to higher education institutions.  When the original Act was signed 50 years ago there were approximately 20,000 students in higher education.  This has increased to more than 200,00 students today, with the HEA now responsible for a much more extensive and diverse university sector.  Let us not forget, within that, to include adequate funding for mental health.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the third level colleges in Cork.  Many students from west Cork are attending them and are getting a very high standard of education.  As I said previously, they had a difficult time during the pandemic and there is not enough understanding of that by Government.  While I know the leaving certificate is not the responsibility of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, it is an issue that proves how little understanding there is for our young people.  Quite a lot of them are angered and hurt by the recent Government decision.  </p>  <p>  A third level college in west Cork is now a must.  I do not want to see our young people walking the streets of Cork, unable to find accommodation.  Couch surfing seems to be the way forward.  I do not know how many people I met in west Cork who asked me before the colleges reopened if I knew where they could get accommodation in Cork city.  It is an area in which I do not have expertise, other than the usual outlets to which I would direct people.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to opening a third level college in west Cork.  We must work towards an understanding that students should not have to travel for two or three hours every weekend or end up sleeping on a couch during the week while trying to educate themselves and go further in life.  I would not be doing my job as a public representative if I did not fight on their behalf.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="16:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200049#BBB00300"><p>One of the aspirations of this Bill is to facilitate improved engagement with students in order to promote equity in access to, and participation in, higher education.  I appeal to the Minister here to consider the word "access" and to ensure that the pathway to an apprenticeship is more transparent and easier to navigate than it is currently so that increased participation will happen.</p>  <p>  Turas Nua was appointed as a JobPath provider by the Department of Social Protection.  The JobPath scheme left a lot to be desired for many people who found themselves out of work through no fault of their own.  They found they were used for financial gain and pressurised into taking jobs that were not suitable.  They were promised training and help with their CVs but this was at best minimal and inadequate.  When applicants secured jobs themselves, their new employers were phoned on numerous occasions by Turas Nua.  This frightened off new employers and often the applicants ended up not getting the job.  Turas Nua stands for financial gain and inadequate training.  The HEA needs to look at this and see for itself what is happening. </p>  <p>  One of the main objectives of this legislation is to promote and support higher education institutions in achieving excellence in teaching, learning and research in higher education.  There are more than 250,000 students in third level education.  They are of mixed ability but have one focus, which is to be the very best that they can be.  Studying in third level colleges and universities is all about working together with other students, working in teams, co-operating with others and pooling resources.  This is very difficult to do in Zoom-type settings, as we know ourselves.  I hope that this will be addressed as part of this legislation.</p>  <p>  I have engaged with the Minister for Education on introducing an apprenticeship model at second level so that years are not lost for students who are happier doing practical subjects that would form the basis for apprenticeships.  This could be introduced at the start of the senior cycle in second level, after the junior certificate or transition year programme when some students are thinking of leaving formal education.  This could encourage this cohort of students to complete their education and they would have the skills appropriate to the career path that they will follow.  These are practicalities that need to be addressed sooner rather than later in our education system.  Practical skills are in short supply currently and if this is not addressed, we will have major issues down the road.  I spoke to Limerick City and County Council and the Government five years ago about skills shortages.  I sat on the board of the Limerick Education and Training Board, ETB, and spoke at length on the problems with apprenticeships and early school leavers.  I pointed out that students were leaving school early but if we introduced an apprenticeship model after the junior certificate, they could do an apprenticeship as part of their second level education.  Early school leavers could do an apprenticeship within the two-year senior cycle and possibly complete the leaving certificate applied programme.  They would then have the tools they need for the career they want to follow.</p>  <p>  As the father of a leaving certificate student, I would point out that the Department had access to all of the quarterly exams from junior certificate to the present day.  I refer to the summer exams, Easter exams and Christmas exams, the results of which are all uploaded within each school in digital format.  That data is available in all second level schools in Ireland.  </p> <p>All that could have been accessed.  All our students who suffered an awful lot of anxiety and distress might have been spared had the Minister used this.  Yes, I want every student in Ireland to sit the leaving certificate but I also want them to be able to use their quarterly examinations, which are in a digital format in secondary schools.  They could have been used.  We could ask the schools to do quarterly exams and they would do it.  They know their students.  It would make up for the lack of teachers during Covid and the people who were missing at that time.  The Minister and Cabinet made the wrong decision.  They had the tools, experience and knowledge to make the right decision.</p></speech>

He certainly is committed to his current post.  </p>  <p>  I want to talk about the cost of education and the parents and young people who are trying to afford going to university.  A young person who works during the summer is punished.  That is totally wrong.  It does not make sense.  We want to encourage young people to work, whether at weekends, during summer holidays or at Christmas.  The money they earn should be totally disregarded.  We want them to have a work ethic so that they will go out to work.  When they do, we do not want to penalise them but to reward them.  That money will be petrol in the tank for the winter during their college time.  We want to make sure that it does not affect their parents' ability to qualify for SUSI grants or any other type of assistance.  We want to encourage work.  I plead with the Minister to take that into account.</p>  <p>  I congratulate everyone involved in the Institute of Technology in Tralee which merged with Cork IT in January 2021 to become Munster Technological University, Ireland's second technological university.  That is great.  I thank the presidents past and present, all the lecturers and everyone who works to make this institution the most vibrant educational tool we have in County Kerry.  I am very proud of the fact that we have it. </p>  <p>  I now turn to problems.  There is the accommodation crisis for students across the country.  I know of nightmare scenarios where students were carpooling to from Kerry to Cork or Limerick, for example.  I remind the Minister of the dangerous aspect of that.  Think of the law of averages if a group of students is travelling early in the morning or late in the evening in a car.  They should not have to do that because of a lack of available or affordable accommodation.  We surely should be able to ensure that students have proper, safe places to stay at a price they can afford.</p>  <p>  Then there are the troubles our young students have with mental health.  The whole uncertainty around the closing and opening of colleges and schools, online classes on Zoom and so on brought certain pressures to bear on young people that were not there before.  I would like assistance to be available to help them.  Remember, young people are the politicians and teachers of the future.  They are the workers who will come after us.  We want them to be minded and protected in every way they can.  If a youngster is suffering from distress or needs to talk to somebody, I want to be sure that talk or assistance is available.  There is nothing wrong with it.  There is nothing wrong with a student coming out and saying he or she is having a bit of trouble and needs to talk to somebody about it.  I thank the people who are involved in helping and supporting young people with that and I encourage them to keep up their excellent work.</p>  <p>  I want to speak about the very important matter of trades.  I adore the fact that people are getting an academic education.  However, as the Minister will have seen on the day he visited Tralee, we need to acknowledge the importance of people becoming mechanics, blocklayers and plasterers.  Good God, if you had a child today and you were fortunate enough for that child to grow up to become a plumber or electrician, it would never see a hungry day or a poor day.  We want to encourage that so we have roofers and people who can build and use the two hands God gave them.</p>  <p>  Long ago, there were courses and organisations such as AnCO where people could go away and learn the trade of publican and other trades in the hospitality sector, such as chefs, and all that goes with that.  We should encourage that.  The reason we have such a labour shortage in the country is that we are not encouraging enough of that.  We should remember there is absolutely nothing in the world wrong with using the two hands that God gave us, maybe even more than using our minds, and of course to use one, we must use the other. </p>  <p>  In the seconds remaining, I have to register the number of young people who have contacted me to say they are not happy that they were not afforded the hybrid model for the leaving certificate.</p></speech>

We are educating children and pupils to the highest standard in our universities.  I also welcome the Munster Technological University in Tralee, which is a big advantage.  We needed for so long and we are glad to have it since the beginning of last year.  It is important for the vibrancy of Tralee and to facilitate youngsters from Kerry, Cork and the entire area.</p>  <p>  We are educating people to the highest standard but we do not seem to be able to hold on to them.  There is a shortage of staff in every area.  Whether it is doctors, nurses, teachers or whatever else, we seem to be losing people.  They go abroad and we are lucky if some of them come back.  Is it pay and conditions or what is the reason?  We must get to the bottom of it.</p>  <p>  Recently, we learned that the HSE has been trying to appoint a senior consultant psychiatrist for south Kerry for over six years.  That is not acceptable.  What is wrong?  Are we not educating people to qualified as consultant psychiatrists?  As well as psychiatrists, we need psychologists.  When youngsters are growing from boys and girls into men and women, there are physical changes but there are mental problems as well.  It cannot be just a case of shoving a needle into them and giving them an injection or whatever they were being given.  We have to talk to them and get to the root of the problem.  We need more psychiatrists to deal with those cases.  Our whole mental system is a shambles.  Surely the Government knows that.</p>  <p>  We need to get more people into apprenticeships and the trades and at the same time allow them to do night courses if they want to get an academic education or a master's degree.  They should be able to do their apprenticeship first.  There is nothing wrong with being a plumber, electrician, mechanic, plasterer or blocklayer.  We need them.  We should not look down on those people.</p> <p>There is an attitude now that people must go to university and perhaps not do those things.  Maybe everybody is not suited to going to university.  If they were working at home, it would be good for our rural areas.  It would be good for them to mind their parents and families at home.  They could be at home and work from home.  As I said, not everyone is made for third level education.  Some of the smartest people we know never went to university or college.</p> <p> The points system is the other aspect.  There are people who really want to get into a certain course or whatever but the points system is all wrong.  It is all about places and if there are more applications, the points go up.</p> <p> I have a few more things to say on the cost of getting a licence for a driver.  We cannot get drivers, be they bus drivers or lorry drivers.  The cost of getting licences is too high.  Young people are being turned away because they do not have the funding and they are not getting help with it.</p></speech>

That must be acknowledged.  He has cut new ground in almost every part of the third level sector.  When he visited the Institute of Technology Carlow he made quite an impression with the interest he took in all the projects that were displayed and each of the individuals he spoke to.</p>  <p>  I also admired the fact he introduced the type of reform that deals with the accountability issue.  That is hugely important.  We rely on the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts to do an awful lot of this work.  In the past, we have had various scandals but also good news stories emerging from the third level institutions.  However, when accounting before the Comptroller and Auditor General, every aspect of expenditure and governance must be covered.  Consideration should be given to expanding the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and providing it with the appropriate and necessary support to cover all the sectors for which it is responsible.</p>  <p>  Of course, we can introduce all the legislation we like and establish a new regime but without a change in culture in the third level sector, we will face the same problems we have now in ten years' time.  I see that culture now in Munster Technological University, MTU.  A senior Member of this House and I sought a meeting with the president of MTU to deal with a legacy issue from Cork but we were told the president would not meet us.  If a president of an educational institution can say that to Members of Parliament who are trying to address issues, it gives him or her licence to do as he or she pleases.  It is early in the game for that.  The Minister should intervene and insist on the appropriate steps being taken to ensure Members of the House who have issues have them addressed by the president or someone senior within the university structure.  I would like to see the particular legacy case I speak of dealt with.  I am tired of raising it here.  The Minister has given me a good and positive hearing but these are legacy issues that will drag into new arrangements and structures, serve to contaminate them and cause further controversy and disagreement.  I therefore ask that the Minister insist on MTU dealing with the issue and before getting on with the business in hand.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned that the Bill makes provision for co-operation between the HEA and other bodies, including SOLAS, Qualifications and Quality Ireland, QQI, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and also for the establishment of a national apprenticeship office.  I propose that, in the context of Carlow and Waterford, he consider purchasing a site in Kilkenny and establishing an apprenticeship scheme there to cover a wide range of apprenticeships.  Kilkenny has always been the home of design and innovation.  It had the Kilkenny Design Workshops and would be an ideal location to provide the types of schemes that would be necessary on a greenfield site connected to the university structures.  The Minister should examine that proposal and provide the funding for a greenfield site for setting up the apprenticeship schemes many Members have asked him about in the course of this debate.</p>  <p>  Kilkenny is also the centre of our Norman heritage.  The Normans influenced our country greatly and had an influence right across Europe.  Norman studies should be incorporated somewhere in the south east with a Norman trail because a significant number of those studying our culture and heritage are now travelling Europe using the tracks created by the Normans at that time.  Perhaps a museum of Norman studies would be of interest and would add a tourism element to the structure of our universities.</p>  <p>  My last point on universities is on student accommodation, which I believe the student representatives in Carlow mentioned to the Minister.  The number of companies within the university structure is growing.  Such companies should be encouraged to go down the route of providing student accommodation to ensure good quality accommodation is made available to our students.  If there are to be profits from that kind of activity within the university sector, they could go back into the general coffers of the university and perhaps fund further initiatives.</p>  <p>  The main point in all of this is that the Bill is moving in the right direction.  We are getting transparency and accountability.  It is new, innovative and imaginative and will achieve a great deal.  My message to the Minister is to deal with those culture issues I spoke about.  I truly want to meet the president of the MTU and others involved in it to discuss the legacy case I spoke about.  Perhaps an early intervention would bring about a resolution and help the universities and the new structures to look ahead instead of having to look over their shoulder at legacy issues that are yet to be resolved.</p></speech>

I begin by picking up where Deputy McGuinness left off, with MTU.  The raising of the flag over the rebranded MTU was a very positive day for education in Cork, Kerry and the whole region.  I acknowledge there are still issues that need to be resolved with the transition.  It is important the Minister is aware of that and keeps those issues under review.  None of them is insurmountable.  They can be resolved and I hope they will be.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is a necessary updating of the legislative framework of higher education which is half a century old.  During that period, higher education has been completely transformed and expanded by many multiples.  I welcome that the Minister took on board some of the Sinn F&eacute;in recommendations during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, including on the importance of a role for cross-Border co-operation in higher education and also by giving the HEA a specific role in the promotion of the Irish language.  T&aacute; Conradh na Gaeilge agus go leor daoine eile den tuairim go bhfuil g&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh r&oacute;l na Gaolainne sa Bhille seo agus &oacute; thaobh an &Uacute;dar&aacute;is um Ard-Oideachas.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go dt&oacute;gfar san &aacute;ireamh roinnt de na molta&iacute; sin ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste chun go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ag cro&iacute;l&aacute;r na heagra&iacute;ochta seo agus go mbeidh s&iacute; &aacute; cur chun cinn.  Beidh muid ag moladh roinnt r&uacute;in agus roinnt leasuithe chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p><b></b>I raise also a concern about the proposal to limit to 17 the number of members of governing bodies of higher education institutions.</p> <p>There are 39 members on the board of the college I attended, University College Cork, UCC.  It is a very inclusive board; that is its objective.  It is a diverse grouping of people, including those from academic and non-academic backgrounds, current students, graduates, the mayors of two cities, representatives from other organisations such as IBEC, the education and training board and the chamber of commerce, and local elected representatives.  They bring a unique viewpoint to the running of the university.  If the Bill is implemented, this board will lose more than half its members.  What 22 would go from the board and what viewpoints would lose out?  There is an issue there.  I know the point about efficient governance, but perhaps there should be some autonomy for organisations.  If UCC is satisfied with how it operates, then perhaps that should be allowed because it has a diversity of voices.</p> <p> I will take the opportunity to raise the issue of the leaving certificate about which we have had a lot of discussion.  The Minister will know that I am disappointed with the decision.  I think that students are disappointed and frustrated.  I do not believe that every option was explored, but whether the hybrid or current option was selected it will be the case that there will be some issues with third level places, especially for high-demand courses.  No matter what course of action the Government took, whether it opted for what Sinn F&eacute;in recommended or went down this road, there were going to be challenges.  It is vitally important that there are targeted interventions for those high-demand courses, in particular.</p> <p> I will make a final point very briefly.  Last year, we raised the importance of fairness as between courses.  We need to work on that for next year, but there is still an issue hanging over from last year.  There were issues we asked the Minister to address last year.  We would appreciate it if he were to come back to us regarding some of the advice that was to be provided at that point because we want to be constructive in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="17:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200052#EEE00200"><p>I am happy to see this Bill reach the floor of the House because it is crucial that our legislation underpins and supports our modernised and vastly changed higher education system, our students who are in that system and all those who work in it.</p>  <p>  I also want to refer to the fact that yesterday we passed the Technological Universities Act, which approves the merger of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, Letterkenny Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology Sligo to form the Atlantic Technological University that will happen on 1 April.  As an aside, I do not know who chose the name but I think it is an excellent choice.  This is positive news, but in many ways it is just a start because we now have to put flesh on the bones.  Putting the framework in place is an essential first step.  Yesterday was the most important part of that process.  Another plus in all of this is that all the students who graduate in 2022 will do so with university degree qualifications.</p>  <p>  I will come back to the Atlantic Technological University because that is the core issue I want to speak about.  I will raise one or two other points and perhaps come back on Committee Stage to refer to a few more.  I listened to the debate last week.  I thought I might be speaking on Thursday, but that did not happen and it ran into today.  I remember the Minister said that the Bill does not address all the relevant issues.  One of the things it seeks to do, and what I will refer to, is to promote equality of access to, and participation in, higher education.  It is very important when we speak about equality of access that we do not neglect students with disabilities or students who have care responsibilities.  Many of those students might need to access remote learning for some or part of their course, for example.  This will have to form part of the reform of the Student Universal Support Ireland grant scheme.  As I said, I know that is for another day, but access means access for all.  We definitely need targets and indicators so that we can measure how we are improving equality of access.  The Minister will know that if we cannot measure something, then we cannot really say whether we are going in the right direction, never mind achieving those targets.  I believe that a reforming Bill such as this must be accompanied by the necessary measures not just to promote but to ensure equality of access.</p>  <p>  As I said, one of the main reasons I am happy to see this Bill is that it is part of the support system for setting up the technological universities, TUs.  There is a good regional spread between the west and the north west in the setting up of the Atlantic Technological University.  I believe, as does the Minister and most people, that if it is properly resourced, and we will have to wait and see, it can act as a catalyst for better educational outcomes, economic development in the region, support for established and new businesses right across the region and, crucially, can provide world-class education and opportunities to the students who attend.  In the context of the TUs, I will mention the very valuable work - I have done this before but I want to do it again - of the Minister's predecessor, the former Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who was determined to ensure that these TUs would be set up across the entire country.  It is great to see that the Minister carried on her work and now they are a reality.  It tells many of us the truth that if a Minister is determined that things will happen, very often they do.</p>  <p>  On 1 April this year, the Atlantic Technological University will become a reality.  This Bill will help to set up the necessary framework.  In that context, I will ask a number of questions and make a number of points.  The main point I want to make relates to the incorporation of St. Angela's College, Sligo, with IT Sligo so that it can be part of the Atlantic Technological University from the very start.  As the Minister is aware - I know he has visited St. Angela's and is a strong supporter of it - St. Angela's is the national provider of home economics and arts degrees, and home economics teacher education, in addition to providing nursing health sciences, disability studies, education, special needs education, religious education and food, nutrition and business management courses.  As the Minister already knows, St. Angela's College will bring very significant and strategic assets to the Atlantic Technological University.</p>  <p>  Incorporation of St. Angela's with Sligo IT commenced in May of last year with a view to full incorporation by January 2022.  That was envisaged prior to the establishment of the Atlantic Technological University.  However, the current institutes of technology Act does not provide adequate legislative provision for the incorporation.  In fact, I believe that two new amendments must be added either to this Bill - I would like clarity which I know the Minister will give in his wrap-up since I spoke to him about it earlier - or to the institutes of technology and the technological universities Acts.  I asked him to clarify for me what is necessary in order that we have a firm legal basis for the incorporation.  It is my understanding that the two necessary amendments are relatively simple and straightforward amendments to the institutes of technology and the technological universities Acts.  I think that would suffice.  If this is the case, I ask the Minister to progress that immediately.  If on the other hand, we need to amend this Bill, it would happen on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Right now, the proposed date for the signing of the transfer agreement between St. Angela's and IT Sligo is 1 March 2022.  Either this Bill must be passed before that can happen, with the amendments I spoke of, or the amendments to the institutes of technology and the technological universities Acts must be put in place.</p> <p>It is crucial that everything is in place before 1 April when the Atlantic Technological University will come into being.  It is my understanding that those amendments are not ready.  It may be that they are still with the Department or with the Attorney General.  I am not sure but wherever they are, I believe they are reasonably straightforward and could be progressed soon.  If not, there is a real possibility that could have significant and unforeseen outcomes for the incorporation of St. Angela's College and IT Sligo because after 1 April it will no longer be IT Sligo.  </p> <p> I ask that the Minister provide a timeline for the enactment of this Bill and if he, as Minister, and the Government will ensure that this legislation is in place in time to allow for the incorporation of St. Angela's College to take place before 1 April?  Or, as I said, will the Government ensure the amendments to the other Acts are in place by then?  This is the most crucial matter.  I listened to the debate last week and this evening and it is clear that there is fairly broad support for this Bill.  There are some caveats and members of the Opposition rightly believe improvements can be made but there does not appear to be any systemic opposition to the Bill.  I ask that the Minister make every possible effort to ensure the timely passage of this Bill.  </p> <p> I apologise for being so pedantic but this is really important.  If it is the case that the institutes of technology and the technological universities Acts just need to be amended, then I ask that this be done speedily.  I know that the Minister fully supports the incorporation of St. Angela's College with IT Sligo and, therefore, with the Atlantic Technological University.  As I said earlier, if Ministers want things done, very often they are.  We can both agree that when the new Atlantic Technological University is set up with its new board and new chair - whom I wish well - the incorporation of St. Angela's College may not be at the top of their agenda.  They will set their own agenda within the context in which they operate.  There could be a delay.  Three months could easily turn into six months or a year and that would be a real disadvantage for St. Angela's College or for any other college not involved from the start.  As the Minister will know, the start is when plans are put in place and when short, medium and long-term objectives and the allocation of resources are debated. </p> <p> I am almost finished.  I appreciate the Minister remaining in the House for my contribution.  I listened to the contribution of Deputy McGuinness in which he mentioned that he requested - and a senior Minister or member of Government had requested - a meeting with the president of the Munster Technological University and that this request was refused.  It is clear that new boards, presidents and chairs will have their own minds.  I do not want to come back to the Minister in three or six months' time when I can do little and when I am not sure if the Minister can do anything.  I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle needs to move on so I will finish.  It is not simple but it is possible and doable.  I have spoken to the Minister and I know he supports the incorporation of IT Sligo and St. Angela&rsquo;s College.  Timing is crucial in that.</p></speech>

When I invited him he said he would come down and in fairness to him, within about six weeks he was down to visit the two excellent third level colleges we have in Carlow.  I thank him for all the work he has done for us in Carlow.</p>  <p>  Higher and further education have been greatly affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  It is so important that we support the sector through these challenges, to ensure that educational opportunities remain and are made more accessible to everyone, particularly to the most vulnerable in our society.  We see now more than ever the importance of supporting our research community to tackle the social and scientific problems posed by Covid-19 now and into the future.  I have been working closely with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the Technological University for the South East and the integration of Carlow College therein but I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, a few questions.  Will all the students who are currently attending Institute of Technology Carlow receive a technological university accreditation?  Are we still on track for 1 May for the Technological University for the South East?  The Minister of State might come back to me on those questions.</p>  <p>  I believe in inclusive education and that we must do all we can to ensure people feel safe at work and when studying.  It is vital that we develop an action plan for equity of access and participation, especially for those who are economically or socially disadvantaged, those who have a disability or those who are from sections of society that are under-represented in the student body in higher education.  There is also here an opportunity for Ireland to assume a leading role in ending sexual violence and harassment in higher learning.  I welcome the commitment to foster a culture in higher education where it is clear that unwanted behaviours are not acceptable.  I am aware that considerable supports have been allocated to a number of initiatives in this area.  The 2019 framework for consent in higher education institutions: Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive - Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions, is a welcome part of this.  It is important that institutions embed this framework in their policies and procedures and that progress is adequately monitored.</p>  <p>  It is most welcome to see this legislation include specific provisions on the establishment of a shared national apprenticeship office by SOLAS and the HEA to deliver a unified apprenticeship system.  I raised the issue of apprenticeships and inadequate places with the Minister before and I spoke to him when he visited Carlow about counties Carlow and Kilkenny becoming the hub for apprenticeships in the south-east.  We have two excellent colleges there and we should lead in those apprenticeship roles.  I ask that Carlow and Kilkenny be considered for that.  As we know, everyone learns in different ways and the plan to provide a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for both employers and apprentices is great but right now we are in a serious place in apprenticeships because of the pandemic.  I have been contacted by several constituents in Carlow who have been highlighting the delays apprentices are facing now.  What should have been a four-year apprenticeship is looking like it will be a six or seven-year apprenticeship, which is concerning.  This age group has suffered so much already and many of them worked right the way through the pandemic in essential services.  Apprenticeship courses did not have the same remote learning possibilities as many other studies.  Extra college places need to be made available for the apprentices to filter them through the system quicker.  It is vital that we do this.</p>  <p>  At a time of great economic uncertainty, when so many people fear for their future employment, we must ensure that higher education plays a vital role in our recovery.  I emphasise that there is such excitement in the south east, particularly in Carlow and Kilkenny, that we will get a technological university.  That will bring so much to Carlow and Kilkenny.  Previous speakers mentioned student accommodation, which is so important.  I know that is being addressed.  Carlow County Council and others that have approached me have indicated that they will look at how we can make sure we have proper student accommodation for the students.  It is important that we are prepared and ready.  I understand that it will definitely be a technological university on 1 May but I ask that the Department communicate more and provide more information so that we are ready.  We are all delighted with this but information and communication are key.  I ask that the Department would come back to us on what is happening.  I welcome this Bill; it is great for the south east that we have this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="17:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200053#FFF00400"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s standard of third level education is world renowned.  We have an incredibly well-educated workforce and it is one of the many reasons we attract so many of the world&rsquo;s biggest and best corporations to our shores.</p> <p>Data from the Central Statistics Office show that in 2021, 53% of people between 25 and 64 in Ireland had a third level degree.  That is more than half of the population.  This Bill will inform the HEA to make it even more progressive.  It will support higher education institutes to achieve the highest standards of teaching, learning and research.</p> <p> One of the most important provisions in this Bill is the commitment to promoting and safeguarding the interests of students.  That includes improving the equality, diversity and inclusion in our higher education institutions.  A 2020 report by the Royal Irish Academy could only identify one full-time black female academic professor in Ireland.  Only a handful of postholders of Asian or other minority ethnic backgrounds were identified.  Just as worryingly, the report could not identify how many students from ethnic minority backgrounds are in third level education here in Ireland.  We not have that data and that is a problem because if we cannot identify or quantify a problem, we cannot fix it.  Representation is important in all aspects of life and with higher education becoming so closely associated to better life outcomes, it is important that we have information on how diverse our third level institutions are.  This legislation will make the HEA a regulator of the third level sector.  With the role as regulator comes appropriate powers to seek information from our third level institutions and I hope the HEA will make equality, diversity and inclusion within our third level institutions a key priority, going forward.</p> <p> I welcome the commitment of the Minister thus far to making third level campuses safer spaces for our students.  Action on consent classes, reporting of offences and clearer support channels for victims of violence and harassment are all making a real difference.  A published action plan for ending sexual violence and harassment on campus is now a requirement for all higher education institutions, HEIs.  I welcome the role that the HEA will play in holding institutions accountable to ensure we continue to make progress in this area.</p> <p> I am proud to sit on the governing board of University College Dublin, UCD.  I am a graduate of UCD, which makes it all the more meaningful for me.  I was elected to the governing authority when I was a councillor by my peers, the councillors on the executive of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.  I know from my experience the important role that local councillors can play on the governing authorities of third level institutions.  They bring a rounded, external perspective.  They bring the views of their constituents and their experience as decision makers on local authorities.  They have valuable contributions to make and the Minister of State needs to value that.  We should be keeping the link between governing boards and the AILG to ensure that our HEIs continue to benefit form the unique role that local councillors play.  This Bill, as it is currently set out, erases the opportunity for councillors to sit on university governing bodies.  Twenty-five councillor seats will be lost across University College Cork, UCC, UCD, the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, and the University of Limerick, UL.  In many cases, these are not new seats but have been in place since 1908.  It would be a real shame if the Minister of State let this century-plus record come to an end because it would also mean the end of all local knowledge and regional links that councillors bring to university boards.</p> <p> As I said, I am a former student of UCD and in my role on the governing authority, I have a direct window into the experience of today's students and faculty, an insight I am grateful to have as a legislator.  I know the spirit of this legislation embodies the work that many HEIs are already doing to try to uphold the excellent reputation that Irish institutions have.  Promoting and safeguarding the interests and experience of students should always be the priority at the heart of every third level institution.  I welcome the important role this Bill will play in holding our third level institutions to an appropriate standard, holding them to account for the confidence of stakeholders, students and the public.</p></speech>

In my time knowing Noel and campaigning with him, I was always amazed by his ability with names and his connection with people up and down the country.  He will be fondly remembered in this Chamber by all people of all parties and none.  He made a significant contribution to public life as a Deputy, a Minister and in his leadership role in Galway GAA.  I offer my sympathies to his wife, Mary, and their children.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p><p>I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials for introducing the Higher Education Authority Bill.  I will be supporting this piece of legislation which will reform how our higher education institutions operate.  The Bill seeks to reform the supervision and regulation of HEIs and to modernise the regulatory role of the HEA.  The Bill introduces a number of welcome requirements, including obligations on third level institutions to engage in strategic planning, enhanced engagement with students, improved access to higher education, comprehensive collection of statistics and other measures to ensure a consistent approach to governance is ensured across the sector and country.</p><p>  We are lucky in Ireland to have a number of outstanding third level institutions.  Trinity College Dublin, TCD, and UCD are well known throughout the world.  Academics and students from TCD and UCD, and of course UCC, NUIG, UL and Maynooth University have made a significant contribution to Irish society and internationally over the years, noting, of course, James Joyce, one of UCD&rsquo;s most prominent graduates, who published his masterpiece <i>Ulysses</i>on this day 100 years ago in Paris.</p><p>In recent years we have seen the development of the higher education sector with even more students than ever taking up third level courses at traditional institutions and also the new technical universities, such as the Technological University Dublin.  I welcome many of the proposed governance arrangements in this Bill, particularly the changes to ensure the unique and historic arrangements at Trinity College are respected.  I thank the Minister for taking on board the feedback from academics at the university.  Academic freedom is a core principle and nothing in this legislation will impinge on the academic freedom of higher education institutions or their staff which must continue to be protected in legislation.  </p><p>It is apt that the Minister of State with responsibility for skills and further education, Deputy Niall Collins, is in the Chamber because I also welcome the provisions of this Bill that will further develop opportunities for apprenticeships.  As we deal with the housing crisis and the challenges of climate change, including the need to retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes, we will need a new generation of skilled, educated workers.  This Bill will help further that critical objective.</p><p>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Professor Andrew Deeks, the president of UCD, who is due to take up the post of president of Murdoch University, Perth, Australia.  Professor Deeks has ably led the university since 2014, introducing many changes and overseeing a transformative programme at the institution.  I wish him, his wife, Dr. Linda Deeks, and their daughter, Pearl, all the best as they depart.</p></speech>

It is a positive piece of legislation.  The Government is yet again honouring commitments it made in the programme for Government.  In the programme, there was a commitment to continue to reform how HEIs operate through their relationship with the HEA by enhancing performance, financial management, governance and transparency, and utilising the system performance framework to drive accountability and improvements in our higher education system.  This Bill modernises the governance structures we associate with HEIs and third level institutions.  It is a welcome development and I am glad the Minister of State, who represents the neighbouring constituency to mine, is leading this along with the Minister.  Well done to them both.  I hope this legislation passes through the Houses without too much amendment or argument.</p>  <p>  I join with others in paying tribute to the late Noel Treacy.  I express my deepest condolences to his wife, Mary, and their children.  I met Noel many times.  He had a unique art in that he could link someone to each townland, not just each village.  He was able to pick out townlands in Parteen village that some people in Clare would be unable to identify.  He was able to name people from that townland.  His knowledge and mental database were incredible.  Long before Lotus Notus or Microsoft Excel, we had people such as Noel Treacy who, at the click of a finger, could name off people in every parish in Ireland.  He was an affable character and a smart guy.  Nowadays we judge people in their early 70s as young - too young to die.  Noel certainly fought his battles with ill health but he is going to heaven as a young man.  I express my deepest sympathies to his wife and bereaved family.</p>  <p>  I will reference a few other matters relating to higher education in the time I have left.</p> <p>It is really fantastic to see the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, TUS, expanding its campus out to Coonagh beside the Tesco site.  There was a commercial development around Coonagh and much of it faltered.  Of course, Tesco is there as an anchor tenant but there are many other buildings around it.  I have a huge interest.  Even though it is in County Limerick, it is only half a kilometre or so from where I grew up in Meelick.  It is at the other side of our parish.  Not a whole lot of work is going on there at the moment.  We really want to see a bit of a spurt put back on that project because everyone looks forward to a hive of activity happening around that area.</p> <p> Quite similarly, UL is moving into the Dunnes Stores site on Sarsfield Street in Limerick.  Again, that bolsters that whole third level presence in and around the mid-west.  It is something we look forward to.  I would hugely appreciate if the Minister of State could address some of those issues his reply.</p> <p> Every person one meets along the corridors here and in the street has a smile back on his or her face again.  We are slowly getting back to a bit of normality.  My 20-year-old niece came to visit us the other evening.  She is enjoying her first year at UL where she is studying business and French.  We were delighted to see her in our house.  We have not had her there in more than two years.  I discovered that she is studying, as I said, business and French.  There are something like 20-odd hours of contact lecture time in the week and then students have tutorials and all the other stuff they must do in college.  Only three hours of her lectures at the moment are on campus in lecture halls.  That is a little bit unique because business and French is one of those massive courses in UL.  Many of the business lecturers could often have 400 or 500 students in the lecture halls.  They actually hold some of those lectures the concert hall.</p> <p> I attended UL for four years.  If we are getting back to normality, and that certainly seems to be the pathway we are on in terms of all sectors, people like Aisling Biggane and many others starting out in third level should also go back to that.  We have antigen tests and will have many layers over the coming months to ensure we have armour to fight back against Covid-19.  We need to give students that experience.  Three hours of contact time in a lecture hall is not really where we want to be in early February of 2022.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State the Minister and, indeed, anyone from the third level institutions who may be watching this evening to urgently review that.  We have somehow managed to get all other sectors back to some degree of normal functionality but third level students need it as well.</p> <p> I wish each and every one of them a good semester.  Many of them have gone back with gusto since January.  They should enjoy it.  They are definitely the best days.  I know people will say that the best days are when one is elected to the D&aacute;il, but they are not.  They were in UL trying to find the next house party and trying to drag oneself into college the next day.</p></speech>

I would be delighted to go back to my student days.  They really are the best days.   Those best days have been denied to many youngsters, however, and we, as Members of this House, need to stand up for them to give them back that bit of normality.  They are the fun years but also those in which people  acquire the skill sets that will lead them through their adult lives.</p></speech>

It was a very well-merited and passionately given contribution but not all of us got that experience of full-time education in third level institutions.  We cannot forget about those other learners.  I was one of those people who returned to college as an adult and a single parent while raising my daughter alone.  We should not exclude people like that because when all we hear is one side of what college represents, we can mistakenly and absolutely unintentionally forget there is also another group of learners.</p></speech>

I am simply putting on the record that we do not all have that experience.  It is as valid and meritable for everybody else who gets there regardless of which route they take.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022.  It provides for the necessary items relating to the internal governance of universities, technological universities and institutes of technology by reforming the size and composition of their governing bodies.  This is very worthy legislation.  It is also a worthy undertaking because if we look at education over the years, the existing legislation was enacted in 1971.  I was not even born in 1971.  Education changes and legislation needs to change with it accordingly.</p><p>I fundamentally believe that education should be considered in the context of a holistic approach.  As I mentioned in the context of Deputy Crowe's contribution, there is not a one-size-fits-all approach and no education system is going to be absolutely perfect 100% of the time.  If we aim for something holistic, however, we will at the end have individuals who are not only well-educated on paper through books but well-rounded individuals who are best placed to be able to actively pursue whatever career they want.</p><p>As part of that, I believe the Bill should include the welfare and safety of students and the climate in which they study.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to the report in<i>The Irish Times</i>last week, which, to be quite frank, makes for harrowing reading.  It relates to the NUIG study on sexual harassment in higher education that was conducted online with almost 8,000 students and 3,500 staff in third level institutes.  The article begins by stating: &quot;Thousands of college students at third level say they have experienced sexual violence or harassment.&quot;  These statistics will no doubt strike fear in the heart of any parent who has a young person going off to college when, as the article reported:</p> <blockquote> 	More than 3,000 female students responded to questions on non-consensual sex.  Of these, 34 per cent &ndash; more than 1,100 students &ndash; experienced non-consensual vaginal penetration through coercion, incapacitation, force, or threat of force. </blockquote>  <p>That makes for extremely hard reading.  It is very hard to have to read it out on the floor of this House, but it is what the students reported.</p><p>With regard to the Bill, there is an element of a missed opportunity because the study recommends that we create a &quot;positive culture of respect, safety, and consent&quot;.  The funding and structures for that to happen need to be embedded through consent frameworks in our universities, colleges and institutions.  The funding of essential activities could also include in some way towards that requirement.  Safety on campuses across the country for staff and students could have been improved considerably and continuously if measures to do so and the changes required had been given consideration in the context of this legislation.</p><p>It is claimed that the Bill will promote a student-focused system.  It appears, however, and it has been said to me, that because of the reforms to governing bodies, students will actually have less representation on those bodies in all higher education institutions.  The Minister of State needs to clarify the potential impact this could have for representation at undergraduate and postgraduate level on students and their governing bodies, on the representation of academic and non-academic staff and on trade union representation.</p><p>We have repeatedly heard shocking details over the last number of months that highlight the very real dangers women face when going about their daily activities.  There were more reports today and yesterday in the national newspapers about this.  We speak eloquently and movingly at times but those words need to be underpinned by definitive actions and followed up with legislation, through which we will deliver a real and measurable change for women and girls.  To paraphrase a statement that has been used quite often recently, until society is safe for women and girls, it will not be safe for any of us.  That needs to be underpinned in legislation and action.  Otherwise, how will any of us, like myself and many more in this House who are lucky enough to have them at home, look our daughters in the eye?</p></speech>

We all know the role that was played by Trinity College over the centuries but there was also the establishment of the Catholic University of Ireland in the 19th century.  That became the Royal University of Ireland and subsequently the National University of Ireland, which had a huge impact in establishing Irish independence.  It educated a huge group of Irish nationalists who were able to articulate the cause of Irish independence and I do not think that independence movement would have happened without us having a national university in the country.</p>  <p>  Beyond that, part of the reason Ireland has been so successful as a country since the Second World War is that we have produced huge numbers of intelligent, articulate graduates from our universities.  Universities have an extraordinary transformative impact not just on a country but, more specifically, on a region.  UCD has had a huge impact on the whole of Dublin in generating growth there.  As the Minister of State will know, Limerick has to a large extent been transformed by the university that has grown there over the past 30 years or so.  My hope is that the legislation we are discussing today, along with the legislation in respect of technological universities that was enacted more recently, will ensure we can also transform Irish society in a meaningful way, in the same way universities transformed it in the past.</p>  <p>  One of the criticisms we can make of universities when we look back at them is that they were very focused on academic achievement and the creation of expertise within the professions or the arts.  One of the great benefits of technological universities is that they recognise that there are other aptitudes, skills and excellencies that can be developed.  I had the opportunity, along with members of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, to visit the Munster Technological University before Christmas.  It is a wonderful location and one can see the type of people who have been targeted there.  We need to ensure that in the future universities and technological universities target not just groups who are very talented academically but also those who are very talented with their hands, mechanically and in other walks of life.  Once we can target a broader group of people, we will be able to provide greater opportunities for them.</p>  <p>  Education is a liberation.  It provides people with liberation and enables them to achieve greater things in their lives.  Hopefully people who may have felt that the education system was not for them because their expertise was only in manual skills will now recognise that the expertise they can get through apprenticeships or technological universities is as worthwhile and significant as the other expertise that was achieved previously in respect of academia.</p>  <p>  In this Bill we are trying to achieve a balancing act and ensure that universities and third level institutions retain their academic and intellectual independence while at the same time ensuring that, since the State funds them, it has some level of control.  The impact of Covid on students was mentioned.  It had a devastating impact on their student lives.  When a president of one of the universities was before the education committee, he indicated that it was a matter for lecturers to determine when lectures would recommence in person.  That is not acceptable in circumstances where the State is funding universities.  It is not up to lecturers or individual institutions to decide whether or when they will go back to in-person teaching.  That is why it is so important that some outside regulation and control is exerted by the State, since we are giving them that money.</p>  <p>  We also need to recognise that we do not want to exert too much control over universities.  The reason they succeed and are so influential is because they have that intellectual independence  They are able to make decisions about what type of academic expertise they want to study, or what manual expertise in the case of technological universities.  We need to retain that independence while at the same time ensuring the State is getting good value for the money we have to put into universities.  The funding of third level institutions is another debate to which we will return.</p></speech>

Since the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the elevation of its Minister to Cabinet ranking, this is probably the most important all-encompassing legislation to come to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  It is very easy to dwell on many different aspects of this so I will try to limit my contribution to two or three remarks.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan rightly referred to the importance of retaining the independence of our academic institutions.  While that is extremely important, there must be safeguards.  I am concerned about the impact some third-party actors, including other State actors, have had in trying to influence the academic teaching in some of our third level institutions in recent months and years.  There have been very worrying reports that have led to academics, including from University College Dublin, coming forward about the inappropriate contact and influence from other actors over their academic freedom and their ability to teach students the truth and allow them to gain critical analysis skills.  It is still important that the State plays an extremely proactive role in that.  That feeds into the wider issue of the global standing of our higher education institutions, which is extremely important.  We have to ask what the purpose of higher education institutions is and where the opportunities are.</p> <p>Although many Members have highlighted the high standing of Irish institutions globally, we all know they can do better in global rankings and, most importantly, through attracting funding, whether through the new model of Horizon or co-operating with other institutions, particularly in other EU member states, to attract that investment and research and development capability.</p> <p> The key component of this legislation on which I would like to focus my remaining time is the whole area of the student experience.  There are many different areas at which we can come at this.  There are many different examples of what a third level student or a student in a higher education institution could look like in terms of their gender, their age and their background.  We need to make sure higher education is genuinely accessible to all and that the level of higher education is appropriate for all.  We need to throw off the shackles of outdated mentalities when it comes to apprenticeships and much else.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, has been proactive in this.</p> <p> As many Members have done, it is tempting to talk about their own third level experience and that is all very important because it frames our debate.  However, let us be frank.  Not all of our experiences, and particularly mine, were recent.  One area I regret, although I do not like to dwell on regret, is the decision I made quite some years ago to turn down the opportunity to go on an Erasmus.  This is an area that feeds not only into the student experience, but into the development of our higher education institutions and the ability to promote Ireland as an Erasmus destination and to attract students from across the European Union to come into our third level institutions and to complete their year of undergraduate studies.  This does not only relate to our third level institutions or to our graduate studies, but to other vocational training.  Perhaps, in due course, those who are doing further research studies, such as post-doctoral research, may think of Irish institutions as their destinations.</p> <p> Equally, we should encourage all Irish students to take up that opportunity to go to another EU member state to study there for a year, to appreciate the cultural opportunities and to arm themselves with a modern European language because we, as a people, are desperately bad at this.  We have an inability to be multilingual.  Beyond the c&uacute;pla focal and our abilities in English, we do not have enough French speakers, Spanish speakers, Romanian speakers or Polish speakers in this country.  If we look at the pre-Covid-19 figures, only 3,500 or so Irish students were taking up the opportunity to go on an Erasmus each year and it was heavily weighted towards France.  If we can achieve anything through this legislation and through returning the student experience, it will be to show students that there is so much more to third level than the books and the lecture halls.  It is about the wider experience.  Crucially, we must give them the tools, the funding and the support to take up all the opportunities open to them.  I look forward to contributing to this legislation in more detail on a further Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200058#LLL00200"><p>At the outset, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, and the work his Department has done since its establishment.  In many respects, that seems like a long time ago, because of Covid-19 and everything that has happened in the intervening time.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has really hit the ground running.  This legislation is evidence of that.  I agree with some of the points Deputy Richmond made, although they might not directly relate to this legislation.  He mentioned in passing the emphasis now being placed on apprenticeships.  I welcome that as well as the fact that we have record numbers, because we have never needed them more.  I welcome also that apprenticeships are being properly presented by the Department as a viable, worthwhile and important career path for many of our young people.</p>  <p>  I speak as somebody who had the opportunity to go to third level, and, as Deputy Richmond said, it was a few years ago now.  I also speak as a child of parents who never even got to go to secondary school.  The transformation that has happened in the last 20 or 30 years has been huge.  We have third level institutions dispersed throughout the length and breadth of the country, although they are not in every county.  There is not one in my county, and this goes back to some political decision that was made before I was born and it still causes some ire.  However, they are accessible in all their forms.  This has been a huge source of economic, cultural and social success for Ireland, particularly in the last 20 or 30 years.  The fact is that people from all sorts of backgrounds can aspire to attend third level and pursue a course of education or study that they wish to pursue.  That is not the case in many countries.  It is too often taken for granted, by some people at least, in this country.</p>  <p>  I want to speak specifically on the technological universities.  One of the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins&rsquo;s predecessors, the former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, brought through the legislation to allow for their establishment.  Throughout the regions we have seen the impact the institutes of technology, and before them the regional technical colleges, have made in terms of students from geographic areas and limited economic backgrounds being able to aspire to attend third level and to gain third level qualifications.  The technological university development is the logical next step in that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond and others referred to the fact that Irish third level institutions have good standing internationally, given the teaching that takes place within them.  I speak about my own region, the south east.  One of the things that always struck me in my almost 20 years in the Oireachtas was that, as a region, it was not always seen to be at the forefront of economic deprivation or of underachievement and yet the south-east region has until now continuously had the lowest levels of third level attendance.  It had the lowest levels of disposable household income.  For some reason, Wexford and some of the other counties within the region have traditionally always lagged way behind.  That is part of the reason I welcome the technological universities.  Wexford is very much included in the proposal for the for the south-east university development, as is my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  That is crucially important if we are to improve the quality of life and the standard of living.</p>  <p>  The purpose for which we are elected to this House is to represent the people who put us here and we are here to make their lives a little bit better.  For too long, the south-east region has been without a university.  That has affected our national economic statistics because so many of our students leave the region to go to Dublin or to Cork or to leave the country and never to come back.  That is why the technological university is so important.  At least it will give more of them the opportunity, hopefully, to stay within the region as well as to economically boost the region into the future.</p>  <p>  To wear my particular Kilkenny parochial colours, I spoke earlier about apprenticeships.  The Kilkenny Education and Training Board, ETB, is examining the provision of a new apprenticeship centre and the ETB and the local authority are looking at the possibility of providing a campus facility in Kilkenny for the new university of the south east.  As Covid has shown us probably more than anything, the reality of it is that the university of the future will not be a granite building just down the street.  This is not to say that Trinity College Dublin will not survive and thrive into the future.  However, the modern methods of education will require new types of university.  Remote education will be, and is already for many institutes, a fact of life.  It will become a bigger one.  That is why, while it is now possible for students to learn from a distance, it is also important that there would be some physical presence around the country.  I say that specifically in relation to the university in the south east.</p>  <p>  I welcome and support the legislation.  I want to finish by again sincerely commending the Department and the Ministers involved on the efforts they have made in the difficult few years since the Department has been established.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1456" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="18:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200059#MMM00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to welcome and speak on the Bill that is before the House.  Nothing has been more transformative in Irish life since the foundation of the State than the education system.  We can be very proud of how the education system has developed over the years and the huge amount of effort that has been put in by many Governments and Ministers to advance education.</p>  <p>  To take up Deputy Phelan's point, we are put here to make the lives better of those that we serve and that must be our guiding light at all times.  The Bill before us looks at the Higher Education Authority and all the aspects of higher education: the universities, technological universities and all the changes that have taken place in that sphere.  Equity and fairness must be at the very centre.  That is why I take the liberty to raise one issue that I have been pursuing for quite a long time, that is, inequity within the system.</p>  <p>  I have a case of a student who went on to third level education and then did a postgraduate course.  The person came from a very, decent, honourable, hard-working family.  The parents are wonderful people who went on to give their kids the best.  The student applied for a postgraduate course with a stipend.  Because the stipend from the research company was paid upfront, on the understanding that the student was clearly entitled to the grant afterwards, but because the course had to be secured, the fees were to be reimbursed by the company.  That was the understanding of everybody that was involved with it.  Because that had been done at the very start, the grant awarding body and the Department took the view that they were taking in excess of the stipend.  We have tried in every way humanly possible to resolve the issue over many years.  I bring it before the D&aacute;il tonight because it speaks to the Bill and ensuring that there is fairness and transparency.</p>  <p>  I accept that not everything will be got right by the grant awarding bodies or the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science but there need to be checks and balances to correct any issues that are brought before them.  We have tried to resolve the issue through various bodies, even outside of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I understand we cannot refer to here.  I contacted the Department, the grant awarding body and the Ombudsman to try to resolve this very specific and simple case where one student, who had worked hard enough to go on to postgraduate education, suffered the injustice of not getting the grant due to a tick in one box.  We must be very mindful in the legislation before the House that we are passing, that there is a mechanism to ensure that when cases are brought, they can be addressed.  We work extremely hard as public representatives to ensure that when cases are brought before us that we work through the system to ensure that they can be resolved.  There have been a number of questions and letters to the Minister, and the matter has not yet been resolved.  My office had been discussing the application with the grant awarding body for a number of years and eventually it said there was never an application.  A gross injustice has been done in this case.  We, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, must ensure that we are capable of looking at injustices that take place and that we can go back over them and the Department and the reviewing bodies can accept that an injustice was done and that it can be corrected.  I accept there is a lot going on in the Department, but I urge the Minister of State to do something.  I am aware that an awful lot of work is going on in the Department.</p>  <p>  I commend the Bill that the Department has produced.  In my allocated time I urge that this injustice is rectified.  It speaks to the very heart of what we do in this House: we try to ensure that we make lives better.  Where we come across issues like this, where everything is done in good faith, even if it does not tick a specific box, the grant awarding bodies, the Department and outside bodies must accept that was the understanding of all and that therefore the grant should be awarded.  We must make sure that in everything we do in this legislation - I know there will be amendments to the Bill and further discussion of it - a simple, clear, fast mechanism must be put in place to address issues and not have them going on for years and requiring outside bodies to get involved to resolve them.  We must have a clear and concise way of resolving a very simple matter and an injustice done to a student who has gone on to better themselves in postgraduate studies.  The injustice was done at the very time the person most needed help and support and it must be rectified.</p>  <p>  The Bill is a very detailed document, but at the outset it states that its purpose is to reform the higher education institutions and for them to operate within their relationship to the HEA.  We are introducing legislation and I am bringing information to the House that shows there is not any way to resolve injustices except going outside of this House, and that should never be the case.  I ask that this would be examined on the basis of the case I raise in the House this evening.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sa D&aacute;il romham ach bh&iacute; s&eacute; ann p&iacute;osa fada leis.  Fear is oibritheoir iontach a bh&iacute; ann agus aireoimid uainn &eacute;.</p>  <p>  The point made by Deputy Clarke and the statistics she quoted regarding sexual interference, rape and sexual behaviour in colleges are quite scary and need urgent action.  It is doubly scary because we are talking about what we believe to be the most educated and informed generation ever.  There can be no tolerance for what that survey shows.  The third level colleges need to take action to deal with it and to stamp out such totally unacceptable behaviour.</p>  <p>  I agree with what Deputy Michael Moynihan said about fair access.  Fair access at times can be very unfair.  People say the points system is fair.  It is a fair system in terms of the marks and the way it is done, but how you get there is unfair because those with resources and from a more privileged background tend to be more likely to get to the high achieving courses.  Therefore, we must look at access to third level and the mad points race.  It is also unfair to students who at a time when they should be widening their horizons, getting involved in debates, art, sport and whatever else, are forced to focus totally on an exam over a period.</p>  <p>  The other point I always found very strange is that there are special access applications for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  As Deputy Moynihan said, if you make one mistake in the form, you are out.  I always thought that was a total contradiction.  All of us can make a mistake.  I doubt if there is anybody here who has gone through life and not made some fairly basic mistakes filling up forms.  I remember one day here I filled up the form that goes to the One-Stop Shop and I did the very basic mistake of forgetting to sign it.  They had to ring me up, but they are benign in this place, and they said "Would you come down, Deputy, and sign the form."</p>  <p>  Academic freedom is important.  On the other hand, according to the information we are given, there is a statutory basis for the HEA to implement Government policies.</p>  <p>We need to be careful because the State is putting in billions of euro of your money and my money.  Who is the HEA accountable to if it is not accountable to the people who provide the money?  I am sure it is accountable for and answers for the private funding it gets.</p> <p> I would agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said.  For example, we have just passed the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 but there seems to be no plan at the level of the HEA or of third level education to provide graduates with the Irish language skills to provide the services we have promised the people in law that we will provide.  We have to retain in this House the power to make it deliver those graduates, whether it is by ring-fencing the funding or otherwise.  There is a fasach or a precedent for this because we did that with the Science Foundation Ireland funding when we wanted blue skies research back in the 1990s and the noughties by ring-fencing funding for that purpose.  I sincerely welcome the establishment of the shared national apprenticeship office.  To me, apprenticeships have been the Cinderella of third level education.  As a country we have provided many academics but we have done it and left ourselves short of people like electricians, plumbers and other skilled workers that we need.  We need a balanced economy and we have to give status across all trends in education.</p> <p> I join with those who have criticised the lectures that are not in-person that are going on in some third level institutions.  That should be eliminated at this stage and it is totally unsatisfactory that students are not being taught in person at this point.  We are all in the D&aacute;il in person and if we can do it then they can do it as well.  We will all sit together cheek by jowl tonight to vote and it could be a long session and we will still have to get our business done safely.  Therefore it is arrogant of universities to deny students who have paid their fees of access to in-person lectures at this remove.  There is a lot more I would like to say on this Bill.  I have tried to make my points as briefly as possible.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an mBille ach t&aacute; go leor ceisteanna f&oacute;s le pl&eacute; maidir le hoideachas tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al.  &Eacute;inne a cheapann go bhfuil gach rud ceart go leor amach ansin, n&iacute;l siad ag breathn&uacute; go hioml&aacute;n ar na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in at&aacute; roimh oideachas tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al sa t&iacute;r seo.</p></speech>

We can all agree that a lot has changed in the world of education over the last 50 years.  After all it was only a few years after free education was introduced.  The world has changed and now most second level students aspire to receiving a third level education.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, on taking up their important portfolios and setting up a new Department to manage this most important sector.  There is no doubt that the Minister, the Minister of State and this new Department have hit the ground running with the formation of a number of new universities and colleges.</p><p>The creation of the Technological University of the Shannon is an exciting development for the mid-west, with the incorporation of the former Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, and the former Athlone Institute of Technology.  It has been warmly welcomed throughout the mid-west and I look forward to the many new opportunities it will bring, including the expansion of educational facilities into many new campuses.  This will include the campus in Ennis, County Clare.  When that new campus opened a number of years ago the then president of LIT, Professor Cunnane, said:</p> <blockquote> 	The reality is that the new campus will act as an economic generator, retaining people in Clare and potentially adding value to business and industry by providing additional high-quality education options locally.  Studies show that for every euro invested in an Institute of Technology, four euros will be generated in the local economy. </blockquote>  <p>That is exciting and positive for County Clare and Ennis.  I am delighted that this new Ennis campus of the Technological University of the Shannon will also offer evening and part-time courses to those who want to undertake further studies.  I welcome the major part that these new universities and colleges will play in the decentralisation in our third level colleges.  Students will be able to receive their third level qualifications much nearer to home, making college attendance more affordable.  Irish third level colleges have a proud history of recruiting students from all over the world and our graduates go all over the world.  I hope that after the passing of this Bill we will continue to recruit students from all over the world and to build relationships with other colleges throughout the world.</p><p>It would be remiss of me if I did not mention Professor Teresa Lambe and Professor Adrian Hill and their work in the last 15 years in the study of fire risk detection and creation of vaccines.  Professor Lambe is a graduate of UCD from Kilcullen in Kildare and her research allowed her to lead the University of Oxford team in building the Astra Zeneca vaccine so quickly during the pandemic.  This proved that Irish universities educate the brightest and best in the world.  It is in this context that I mention that we have had the successful young scientists competition for secondary students for over 50 years.  The HEA might consider organising a similar competition for third level students to display their research and show the world the quality of our third level education.</p><p>We should also see a full integration of these colleges with the local communities among all age groups.  The HEA might be encouraged to promote fourth age learning programmes for our senior citizens.  I would like to suggest that we would have some colleges in the regions for specific sectors.  I would encourage the HEA to examine the feasibility of working with local industry and government on that.  I am particularly excited by the proposals of UL and Clare County Council to develop a strategic development zone, SDZ, on the Clare side of the UL campus.  This proposal will create a new and distinct model of academic engagement, a mix of research, education, industry and enabling infrastructure.  This will be a game-changing project for the mid-west region and for Ireland.  I expect that this proposal for an SDZ will come before Cabinet soon and I would urge the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to support this project as strongly as possible.</p></speech>

Cork is very well known as a beacon of education, with both University College Cork and Munster Technological University recognised regularly on the world stage for their academics, both in teaching and research.  Unfortunately, on the north side, in the heart of Cork, we have low levels of university attendance and we do not have a single university campus.  In the initial planning stages of BusConnects, for example, there was not one single direct route from the north side to MTU.  I have objected to that and I have asked for it to be included in the next plans because it shows the attitude that students on the north side are facing.  If one student can live at home, wake up at 8 a.m. and get a bus to college, and another living the same geographical distance from that college has to get up at 7 a.m. and get two or three buses to college, we cannot deny there are barriers.  I have repeatedly reached out to MTU to request a meeting to discuss this.  Unfortunately, I have not received more than a courteous reply.  I have met with UCC but, disappointingly, it is not considering expanding into the north side, despite it acknowledging the benefits this could have and the low level of third level attendance.</p>  <p>  It is time for the Minister and the Higher Education Authority under its new powers to intervene and instruct both colleges to open campuses on the north side and send a clear message to young people and everyone else on the north side not only that they can go to university but that they belong in university, if they wish.  The 20x20 concept for women in sport is &ldquo;If you can see it, you can be it.&rdquo;  This also applies to students on the north side.</p>  <p>  As we are talking about barriers to college and the issues that the Higher Education Authority needs to address, it is very important that we recognise that to have the leaving certificate going ahead in the traditional format this year will stop some young students from attending third level.  We have spoken about youth mental health.  For students in sixth year, what we are hearing and seeing is the stress they are facing ahead of their leaving certificate and the anxiety this is causing them.  It is having a huge effect on their mental health.  There are students who possibly have not had normal school since junior certificate and some of them have not even had a junior certificate, yet the Minister expects those students to walk into examination halls in June and perform to the highest level.  I believe the Government and the Department are wrong and that they should be going ahead with a hybrid leaving certificate.  Otherwise, those most affected by the pandemic are likely to lose out the most.  Every single sixth-year student has had a Covid-19 education and deserves recognition of that.  Let us listen to them.  All they are asking is that this be resolved now and that it not be like the last two years, when students were campaigning, with Sinn F&eacute;in support, for last-minute decisions to come in.</p>  <p>  Third level education is not for everyone but everyone should have equal and fair access to it.  I know this from personal experience.  When I came out of school, I went straight to work at 18.  I did not go to third level until I was 33, when I went to MTU, then the Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, at night.  Given the difference it made to me personally to be able to do that, I want to give every student that opportunity.  It can be a life-changing experience to go to third level and that is why I feel it is important that everyone has that opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="18:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200061#OOO00200"><p>It is a huge privilege to have the time to tease out some of the issues involved in this legislation.  I wish I had that time earlier for the Covid debate but I certainly welcome it for this very important topic.  This is substantial legislation and I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the staff of the Department.  A huge amount of work went into this, which I acknowledge.  There are 124 pages, 128 sections, 18 Parts and four Schedules.  I am going to come to the purpose of it, as well as perhaps a broader discussion of what education is about, academic freedom, where we are going and where that debate should take place.</p><p>It has been pointed out that we are changing legislation that is 51 years old.  We talk about transformative action.  Earlier today, Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett quoted from James Joyce&rsquo;s <i>Ulysses</i>.  That is probably the first time <i>Ulysses</i>was quoted in the D&aacute;il, although maybe I am wrong.  I want to use that in a different sense.  I heard various comments on <i>Ulysses</i>and speakers talked about the transformative effect of <i>Ulysses</i>on literature.  I would like to think we have come to the point where third level will have a transformative effect on our society because, really, we have no choice about that.  After Covid and with climate change, we have no choice but to seek to have our third level institutions produce a transformative effect or, otherwise, we are finished.</p><p>Anyone who comes to the House as the final speaker is able to pick up and comment on different things, which is both fair and unfair, but that is the reward for waiting until the end.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan talked about the huge role that universities have had, which they have had, but they have also had a huge role in promoting inequality.  They have also had a huge role in backing up an establishment that saw ongoing consumption as the model of behaviour, which has led to tremendous problems, not least of which is the existential crisis facing us with climate change.  This is the time.  If this is the beginning of a discussion, then I welcome it.  It is certainly not the end of a discussion for me.</p><p>We have what we have been told and we have all read the explanatory memorandum and the purpose of the Bill.  It is to reform the legislative framework for the higher education system, enabling improved oversight and regulation, and giving a legal basis to the powers that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s was using up to now.  Now, however, they are underpinned by statute and, presumably, they are extended a little bit.  We have to ask why we need this legislation before we get onto the bigger topic of what third level education is supposed to be doing.  We need it because governance has utterly failed.</p><p>I had the privilege of going to university.  I also had the privilege of coming from a large family, which was the biggest education I ever got.  The range of experience, jobs and occupations extends from medical doctors and teachers to plumbers, carpenters and plasterers.  That is the privilege of coming from a bigger family.  Within that, there are always people to bring you up and bring you down, and when you are down, they will bring you up, and when you are up too far, they will bring you down very quickly.  I have always had a huge problem with the in-built snobbery in Irish society, where third level was put up there - certainly the universities - to the detriment of society, not just to the detriment of our skilled people and the need for skilled people.  We see it in the construction industry and across a whole range, but that was built into the system.  I welcome that, theoretically, this is changing.  I heard both Ministers make very positive comments and I welcome the national apprenticeship office that is being set up, if we are beginning to rebalance.</p><p>We are looking at governance.  My real university education was on the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have always publicly paid tribute to the staff in particular and to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who are certainly excellent public servants.  It was at that committee that I began to get a real university education when I saw what was coming before me.  I have to say my biggest disappointment at the time was the seven male leaders of the seven universities.  I have said it.  I have to put the word &quot;educated&quot; in inverted commas.  They had a complete inability to reflect on or openly discuss where universities had gone into a cul-de-sac in terms of public space being used for the development of companies for private gain, which is one issue, and the role of unaccountable foundations - those are my words - particularly in Galway, where there is a substantial amount of money in the accounts of that foundation.</p> <p>That foundation has boards managing it in New York and in Galway, in Ireland, including everything from Goldman Sachs to Coca-Cola.  It was all new to me that foundations, described by the university as benign, are given such an important role in the development of our building in Galway.  It may be good or bad.  It is good if it is done in an open and accountable way, but not so good if it is not.  More and more buildings are being put up for particular subjects as opposed to other subjects, with no student accommodation and so on.</p> <p> I mentioned Galway.  The issues there included precariousness of employment, which is repeated in all universities and is dominated by females.  The brave Sheehy-Skeffington took a case.  The new president is sorting out the legacy cases.  In my own city, I was partly aware and partly unaware of what the university was like for many staff, who had no tenure.  The more "untenured" the position, the more likely it was to be dominated by females.  Whistle-blowers came before us from Limerick and other places, who enlightened us in a painful way about the repeated failure of governance in all of these universities.  That is why we are here tonight.</p> <p> I know I am not to mention names but this is all public.  Dr. Aoibhinn N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in is an assistant professor in the school of mathematics and statistics in UCD.  In fact, it was the last university to admit a woman.  Galway was one of the first.  Alice Perry was the first woman to qualify as an engineer in Europe, so Galway was slightly better.  UCD distinguished itself by being the last university to let women go in.  In the 21st century, we have Dr. Aoibhinn N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in courageously reporting repeated sexual harassment over two years, from May 2015 until July 2017 by a professor, who has been named publicly, Hans-Benjamin Braun.  He has been convicted of harassment and there is a barring order against him regarding contact with the assistant professor for five years.  This has all been publicly reported.  She repeatedly reported the incidents to UCD's human resources department.  It was reported to the garda&iacute;.  The harassment lasted for two years after she first brought it to the attention of the university.  She then made a formal complaint and was dissuaded from doing that.  It went on, until, finally, Dr. N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in went public with her experience and requested action plans against sexual violence and harassment.  That is just one example.  The research quoted here tonight shows how difficult the experience of women and sometimes men is when it comes to violence in universities.  That is the background to this legislation.</p> <p> I welcome this legislation.  That said, it needs much more discussion and amendments.</p> <p> Is c&uacute;is mh&oacute;r d&iacute;om&aacute; dom &iacute; nach bhfuil ach p&iacute;osa beag amh&aacute;in &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de sa Bhille; ag cur in i&uacute;l go bhfuil an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s taobh thiar den Ghaeilge.  There is a tiny bit about the Irish language, which is a huge disappointment to me.  I would like this to be teased out further, if possible, because in that substantial, 124-page Bill, there are two lines on the Irish language.  One of the objects is promoting it.  "Objects" is a funny word, as opposed to objectives, purposes or aims.  Under that, amid something else, it states that we will promote the Irish language.  That causes serious worry for me.</p> <p> I welcome the commitment to lifelong learning.  I think it is the answer.  How we measure that and ensure that there is open access are important.  Some of my colleagues on the left have talked about opening up third level education.  I agree with them.  It should be explored and practical research should be done to see what the implications would be of opening up third level to everyone, regardless of the points they have in their leaving certificate.  Rather than the idea being dismissed or sneered at, I think that it is important that it be researched.  I understand that it has happened in other countries.</p> <p> I have looked at various people when considering what university is all about.  I will start with the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, who gave an interesting speech on 8 June about academic freedom.  Significantly, it was an address Scholars at Risk Ireland, a conference for all European academics.  Among other issues, he looks at the danger posed to universities without academic freedom.  What does academic freedom actually mean?  It is certainly not synonymous with autonomy of the university.  The university can have autonomy but that does not mean it has academic freedom.  I do not have the time to go into it.  I could not do it as Michael D. Higgins has done, but he has done so and raised significant issues regarding the purposes of our universities, what they are for, who they are serving, and what the dangers are.</p> <p> Dr. Kathleen Lynch from UCD and her colleagues, as well as a colleague from Galway, Dr. Geraldine Mooney Simmie, have all raised questions about the commercialisation and marketisation of our system, and the aligning which we have done with Government policy that was produced in 2011, during times of austerity, when the strategic policy for third level education was produced.  They have also raised the alignment of industry with university.  I have a difficulty with that.  I want Ireland to thrive and I want our economy to thrive.  I want Galway city to lead the way as a green, thriving city.  It must be sustainable.  We are facing a biodiversity and climate change emergency, as well as Covid.  We have had all those empty words about how we cannot go back to where we were and how we must change and learn, yet we have speaker after speaker praising the identification and alignment of industry with third level education.  They praise a campus that put public funds, industry and university together as one, as a trinity.  I seriously question that model.</p> <p> I can think of no better way to highlight why we need universities to question than to look at the Nyberg report into the banking crisis, titled, Misjudging Risk: Causes of the Systemic Banking Crisis in Ireland.  The report of the Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland was published in 2011.  It was commissioned to provide answers and a number of institutions, private and public, acted in an imprudent manner.  I can think of other adjectives apart from "imprudent".  That imprudent manner continued to the occurrence of the Irish banking crisis.  The report found herding, groupthink, consensus, silent observers and enablers.  They were all the key words in the report about what allowed the banking crisis to happen without any questioning.  The commission considers that this pervasive pressure for consensus may explain why so many different parties in Ireland were simultaneously willing to adopt specific policies and accepted practices that later proved unsound.  It states that there was widespread lack of critical discussion within many banks and authorities indicates a tendency to groupthink.  It states that something as basic as serious consideration of alternatives appeared to be modest or absent.</p> <p> I could go on, but I will pick from a different speaker, the vice-chancellor of Oxford University.  In commemoration of 1916, there was a series of talks in National University of Ireland Galway, which have been published in a book.  Louise Richardson, an Irish woman, is vice-chancellor of Oxford University.  She presented a paper, "The role of education in addressing the challenges of the twenty-first century" at a conference, Ireland 1916-2016: The Promise and Challenge of National Sovereignty.</p> <p>She writes:</p><blockquote>	... if universities focus exclusively on training a skilled workforce, we lose the opportunity to provide an education that is so much broader and more important.  An education that produces a generation accustomed to thinking critically, acting ethically and always questioning &ndash; whether it is the doctrines of the government of the day or the ideologies of those who wish to overthrow it &ndash; will ensure a generation that will question those proponents of violence.  An education that teaches empathy with others, that exposes its students to a cosmopolitan community of scholars, that delights in diﬀerence rather than fears it, and that inculcates the belief that truth is an aspiration not a possession, will produce a generation that will reject any eﬀort to impose orthodoxy...  If we want to master new technologies [not be mastered by technologies] we must educate not only those with the ability to make scientific discoveries and technological innovations, we must educate a generation with the moral sensitivity to think through the ethical implications of these discoveries and innovation for the rest of society. </blockquote> <p>I do not have the answers here but we must commit to the start of an open discussion and debate on the purpose of third level institutions; on how we have produced so many graduates who have an inability to think critically and who lack the courage to stand up and say &quot;That is wrong, what is happening in this university is wrong&quot;; and how we have allowed governance, practices and procedures to stay in place that add to the abuse suffered by various people.  This raises the most serious questions as to what we are doing in our third level institutions.  I am a graduate of a third level institution and I would go back to Galway and the governing body in Galway when the procedures, law and internal governance were changed by legislation.  There was a large governing body and the big thing was to get governance right, not critical thinking but a consensus on doing away with the requirement for Irish, the details of which I forget at this stage.  The important point is that consensus was important as opposed to cherishing critical debate, analysis of the subject and perhaps agreeing to differ on these issues.  <br/><br/>While I welcome all of the work that has gone into this legislation, I share the concerns that have been laid out by people far more educated and articulate than me, including the President of Ireland and Professor Kathleen Lynch, who has gallantly struggled on with her colleagues for years highlighting all of these issues while also highlighting the alternatives that could be in place with collaborative research and research for research's sake, which seems to have died a death in universities because research now has to have a specific purpose.<br/><br/>I will finish on the issue of vaccines.  Many times we have praised the pharmaceutical companies here but they have produced vaccines at an obscene profit with public funds and no risk.  The risk was taken away from them completely and we carried that risk on public money.  When we are praising research, let us analyse the purpose of it, who is behind it and who is paying for it.  We must also ask when research is being done, what research is not being done.  I think of a struggling PhD student in Galway who is trying to get money to look at an ecological corridor and red squirrels.  That student is struggling to get money and recognition from a university for research into an ecological corridor which one would imagine a university would champion in the context of our biodiversity and climate crisis.</p></speech>

He is a huge loss to his wife and family, his local community and the many organisations with which he was involved in Galway.  I refer in particular to Galway GAA, where he was chairman of the county board for a number of years after his retirement from these Houses.  He was a great colleague and a great person to offer advice to new Members of this House.  I was a new Member during his last term here and I wanted to pay my respects to his memory today.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies who have indicated their support for the Bill and all those who contributed to the Second Stage debate today and last week.  I will comment on a number of issues related to the Bill.</p>  <p>  The higher education sector has been transformed since the Higher Education Authority Act of 1971.  The authority was first put in place over 50 years ago, and a number of contributors alluded to that fact during the debate.  In 1971, there were approximately 20,000 students in higher education.  This figure has increased to over 200,000 students in the present day.  Higher education has become more accessible to all sectors of society and more adaptable to meeting the State's social, economic and labour market needs.  The HEA is now responsible for an extensive and diverse sector beyond the original small number of universities provided for in the 1971 Act.  The HEA's responsibilities now extend to a number of universities, new technological universities and institutes of technology.  There have been legislative developments in the interim but this has not extended to a comprehensive legislative review of the HEA itself and the institutional governance across the sector.</p>  <p>  As part of its core legal function, the HEA is responsible for allocating recurrent funding to higher education institutions of &euro;1.5 billion in 2022.  The HEA will also be responsible for allocating up to &euro;152 million in capital infrastructure funding this year, as well as overseeing capital project delivery, advancing the higher education public private partnership, PPP, programme and planning for future capital investments.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, presented the European Commission DG REFORM-funded report on future sustainability for higher education to the Cabinet committee in late December 2021.  The committee agreed that the report and the Department's position should progress to Cabinet shortly, in late January or early February.  The Department is engaging with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on bringing the report to Cabinet this month.  It is anticipated that the report will be published shortly after that Cabinet meeting.</p>  <p>  The effective performance of the higher education system is crucial to the realisation of key economic and social objectives.  This legislation is a key part of the Government's reform agenda for the higher education system.  As we look to drive our ambitions forward, we are seeking to ensure that the fundamental building blocks of governance and funding are firmly in place.  The core objectives of the HEA legislation are to promote and support higher education institutions in achieving excellence in teaching, learning and research; promote and safeguard the interests of students; advance equality, diversity and inclusion in higher education; provide comprehensive governance and accountability frameworks to safeguard Exchequer investment in the sector and ensure accountability by higher education institutions for that funding; maximise the contributions of higher education to social, economic, cultural, Irish language and environmental development and sustainability; and maintain and enhance the reputation of the higher education sector, including its international reputation.  The overall aim is to provide a high-quality, student-focused system with appropriate oversight and accountability to underpin the confidence of stakeholders, students and the public.</p>  <p>  The legislation will clarify overall policy development in relation to higher education and research as the responsibility of the Minister.  It enables improved institutional governance in higher education institutions but also provides for accountability by the higher education institutions to the HEA and the State, in particular, for Exchequer funding.   This legislation puts an onus on the higher education institutions to have in place robust governance and accountability structures and processes within their institutions.  It provides for oversight by the HEA of the institutions of higher education and intervention if they do not exercise good governance.</p>  <p>  The legislation will recognise that autonomy and flexibility are essential features of higher education institutions, but also that this must be matched with transparent governance and accountability to students, stakeholders and the public.  It is important to note that the legislation will not impinge on the academic freedom of higher education institutions or their staff.  This is a core tenet which will continue to be enshrined in legislation.  Institutions will continue to be supported to do what they do best, which is to deliver excellence in education and research and provide places of engagement and insight to support a flourishing democratic society.</p>  <p>  There has been an extensive and ongoing consultation process on this legislation since 2018 which has been a central element of the development of the legislation.  The views of stakeholders have been sought on all of the key issues and the approach has been to make clear the policy objectives and reforms are understood and, to the greatest extent possible, supported by stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I thank the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science who undertook pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill.  Many of the recommendations made were very helpful in finalising the provisions in the Bill.</p>  <p>  I will respond briefly to some of the issues which were raised.  With regard to the incorporation of St. Angela's College in Sligo, an amendment to the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 and the Technological Universities Act 2018, was included in the memo to Government on this Bill and amendments are with the Office of the Attorney General for drafting.  It is intended to include these amendments on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Moynihan raised a number of issues with regard to the case of a student who is seeking grant assistance.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has asked that Deputy Moynihan furnish all of the details to his office and he will have the matter taken up with the grant-awarding authority.</p>  <p>  A number of speakers raised the issue of governing bodies of our institutions.  The Bill seeks, as we know, to reduce the number of members on governing authorities to 17.  It is intended that the membership would be a competency-based membership.  Modern governance practice is to have smaller boards, rather than representational boards.  Some members raised points about local authority members and the legislation provides for consultation by the higher education institutions with all stakeholders, including local authority members.  In addition, there will be opportunities in terms of sitting on subcommittees of governing bodies.</p>  <p>  I thank the House for its engagement.</p></speech>

I will take a moment to reflect on the situation in which we found ourselves in that we were dealing with legislation on the banning of mink fur farms and at a late stage, on Committee Stage, what was essentially entirely new legislation on tree-planting and forestry schemes was added.  Both elements of this legislation, in principle, are absolutely supported by Sinn F&eacute;in, as the Minister knows, but there were peculiarities.  With regard to the issue of small-scale afforestation scheme, in particular, which we had long called for, it would have been beneficial had we had the benefit of a longer lead-in time to discuss and outline the nature of how that would look.</p><p>With regard to the first aspect of the scheme, I acknowledge my disappointment we were not a position to find the route by which we could provide greater compensation supports to those workers who will lose their jobs on the farms affected.  There have been discussions and many debates and we have articulated them well with regard to the compensation for farm owners, but especially with regard to the workers.  This is a unique situation in that this House, tonight, will vote to essentially close down a sector and put people out of work.  It is highly unusual for that to happen.  It is not fair in those instances that the workers who are affected will simply get their statutory redundancy and no more, nor is it fair to simply say the companies can look after them, because the companies are essentially going out of business, as well.</p><p>Report Stage is the first time these amendments have been tabled and I hope the Minister will come at them in a positive light.  The first amendment relates to the broader issue of afforestation.  I have often said that a forest should be a place beside which people wanted to live.  A forest should be something communities embrace and that enhances communities.</p><p>In too many areas, that has not been the experience, because of blanket planting of one species, Sitka spruce, with little consultation with local communities and the investors often responsible for that not being from the local area and being motivated primarily by profit.  We want to see the level of afforestation throughout this country increase, which the Minister knows, but we also want to see an increase in the level of community support and a fair balance in afforestation.</p> <p>This amendment is simply asking that the D&aacute;il would resolve that the Minister of the day bring an annual report before the House detailing the levels of afforestation.   This would not be just at a State-wide level but at a local electoral area, LEA, level and would outline the percentage of that afforestation that is native broadleaf and provide a report on how that aligns with Government policies and objectives.  This is a very progressive amendment.  It does not add any additional costs.  It simply ensures this D&aacute;il is kept apprised of what is a crucial element of not only our rural development policy but also fulfilling our climate action obligations.  Crucially, it will allow different local communities to have first-hand knowledge of how their areas are being affected with respect not only to the level of afforestation taking place but also its type.</p> <p> As I put forward this amendment, it would be remiss of me to not talk about the experiences that have been relayed to us by communities, especially those in Leitrim.  There is a very particular issue in that county whereby rather than a forest being something people want to live beside, afforestation has become something that epitomises a negative experience.  We must learn from that and from the stories we are being told by the people in those communities.  There are parts of other counties where similar stories are being told.  Now 19% of County Leitrim is covered in forestry and 13% of it by one type of tree, namely, Sitka spruce.  Clearly we do not have a balance and the balance is not right yet in terms of the level and location of afforestation.  This amendment is asking the Minister to do nothing other than bring a report before this House.  However, it would send a very strong and progressive signal on the Minister's part if he were to adopt that.  It would allow us to ensure we have a proper and continuous audit of our forestry stock so we can look to dramatically increase afforestation across the country in the coming years but also that we do so in a balanced way that is beneficial to all communities.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill, especially the mechanism to allow for and encourage small-scale forestry planting on farms and other land.  This is the type of practical intervention needed to help local afforestation with native broadleaf species.  The right type of planting has multiple benefits that range from improving carbon sequestration to improving biodiversity and air quality.  We need more measures like this to help farmers and landowners to increase our levels of native broadleaf trees.</p>  <p>  The first amendment is in the names of Deputies Martin Browne, Carthy and Mac Lochlainn.  It provides for the annual reporting on the afforestation rates in the legislation.  It is important to understand the impact of the Bill to see how it is going in order to ensure the intent results increased levels of tree-planting on a local scale.  Agriculture organisations have highlighted the need for more incentives to assist farmers in planting trees, while the Mackinnon report mentions delays, uncertainties and perceptions of excessive bureaucracy as disincentives for farmers.  It cannot just be a matter of allowing small-scale planting, providing grants and then saying the Department's job is done.  There needs to be accountability and transparency around the effectiveness of these measures.</p>  <p>  As I said, a mechanism to allow for and encourage small-scale forestry is really welcome.  We need more afforestation, especially given our COP26 commitments, but there must be more than just this type of legislation.  It cannot just be piecemeal.  On Monday I met a group who are trying to prevent the sale of Coillte-owned forestry.  When everyone is in favour of legislation of this kind and trying to work on afforestation, it is confusing and ridiculous that we are not keeping land with old and native species in State ownership.  Instead, it is being sold to a private owner.  We are going backwards while we are going forwards and we must take an overall approach.</p>  <p>  On a final point, I welcome the Bill's other purpose of phasing out fur farming and prohibiting the raising of animals for the purpose of using their skin for fur.  This is a practice most people strongly oppose and the Bill allows for those affected to be compensated in moving to other methods of farming.  That is a just transition and is very welcome.  I hope we see more of that from the Minister's Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="19:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200065#SSS00300"><p>I will be brief.  Firstly, I support the amendment.  It is a laudable one and worthy of support.  Certainly, the Labour Party seeks to speak in support of the amendment.</p>  <p>  When the climate action Bill was before us we sought to put forward amendments to provide for specific sectoral targets for afforestation.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications refused to accept those amendments.  It was disappointing to say the least.  We thought it would have been quite an obvious thing for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to take on board given the pronouncements from that part of Government on the desire to ensure we reach afforestation targets throughout the State.  I welcome, therefore, this approach by Sinn F&eacute;in which merely asks the Minister to lay a report before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the level of afforestation per LEA.  It is a reasonable amendment.</p>  <p>  When you look at the forestry licensing dashboard, which has become the tool we all use for information on the number of afforestation licences and felling licences issued, we can clearly see that while there was an increase in September, October and November, there was a reduction of December.  Obviously, January's figures have yet to be published.  It seems to me that when you parse the afforestation licences that have been granted, small farmers or private landowners - mainly farmers - received about 26 felling licences.  The vast bulk of them are going to Coillte.  It received almost double that amount, at 51 licences and that is a constant trend.  What I am asking the Minister to do, in supporting this amendment, is to use his good offices to start ensuring that where planting licences, or even felling licences - as there is a natural rate of felling as well - are being applied for, that he remove the impediments to that.  There are still too many.  I am finding that where felling licences are being applied, smaller farmers who own tracts of forestry are feeling an inordinate amount of stress and strain in respect of the processes they must go through and the hoops they must jump.  They are not rich people.  They are people who planted in good faith.  They are people who sought to look to the future.  They are people who want to grow trees again and reapply for afforestation licences.  However, the system still has not worked through the issues that have been so well highlighted by the agriculture committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Cahill.  We are not seeing enough of a seismic shift to reach those afforestation targets the Government itself has set.</p>  <p>  This amendment is a very sensible one.  If the Minister could meet its proposers on this and support the amendment it would give us a greater degree of transparency and move towards the setting of the clearer targets that are badly needed if we are to meet our sequestration goals, carbon reduction goals and all the self-evident goals I need not explain.  There is a real willingness and desire now by forestry owners to plant but there is still too much of a weighting against them in terms of the bureaucracy and the technocratic mechanisms that are in place and it is preventing that from happening.  If they can be worked through it would assist the process greatly.</p></speech>

There was just nothing at the committee meeting regarding the amendments.  No matter what the Opposition put through that evening it was not going to be accepted.  I ask the Minister to listen to Deputies Sherlock and Cairns.  They are telling the Minister, as are the foresters, that this kind of amendment will only improve the system we are all saying has failed at this stage.</p>  <p>  Since becoming a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have had ongoing discussions with forestry workers about their individual situations.  It has become clear to me, and to everybody else, that they have specific issues with the Government's policy, the impact it has having on them and the level of communication that filters down to them from the Department and the forestry service.  Some of them will tell you that what is coming down is nil.  The inclusion of forestry-related aspects in this Bill is a case in point.  It took them and all of us by surprise, given that the original purpose of the Bill was to determine the manner in which fur farming was to be phased out.  A surprise of this nature demonstrates the perpetual level of dissatisfaction of the sector with the Department and, indeed, some of the distrust that is there.  That there is distrust between the Department and foresters has come up at every agricultural meeting at which we discuss forestry.  That is the sad situation we are in.  </p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has included this amendment for the purposes of giving clarity to local foresters on how they are faring in terms of the national plan.  It will make it plain whether the target set for afforestation is realistic for them, given the dysfunctionality of the forestry services and the licensing system.  We met the Minister earlier.  I will take him at his word when he said it is improving, but to try to convince those that have planted trees that this system is working is next to impossible.  That is coming across on a daily basis.  This amendment would also result in what we hope would be an increased level of Government accountability to local foresters who have felt their concerns have been overlooked in the quest to reach 8,000 ha per year.  I must note that target will be missed again this year.  I do not care what is said because going by the figures for the month of January, what we have seen all along will be repeated.</p>  <p>  We are aiming for more discussion and debate in the House regarding the supports that are available to foresters, whether those supports are actually serving the purpose the Government maintains they are there for and whether the foresters feel the same.  For too long, there has been a lack of oversight of the issues that affect the forestry sector and the supports that are made available to it.  The ash dieback, or reconstitution and underplanting scheme, is a case in point.  It was widely panned by foresters as not being fit for purpose.  The Minister and all of us in the Chamber who are involved in this have gone to see some of these plantations.  A key purpose of this House is to have oversight of matters of importance to all sectors of society and in business life in this country.  We are seeking to ensure this happens effectively.  </p></speech>

We have gone through a horrendous year and a half with situations involving people that reach all the way back to the landowner.  It is very simple.  If people cannot fell their forest, they will not sow it.  As previous speakers have said, that is why the targets are so important.  I am on the agriculture committee and I do not know how many hours we have spent bringing Department officials before us to try to answer simple questions as to why it cannot meet its targets.  It always looked as if, about a week before the meetings with us, the targets would fly up and as soon as the meetings were over they would go down to rock bottom again.  It looked like there was an objector at the time who was able to dictate to the nation how and where forests could and could not be felled.  It was scandalous to think that a whole nation could have been held to ransom by someone who was just ruthlessly objecting and who did not have a honest reason to do so.</p>  <p>  It is a major issue that we are not meeting our targets, which we have discussed over and over again at committee level.  It does not look like it will rectify itself this year.  It did not in 2021.  GP Wood in west Cork is one of the biggest timber manufacturers in Ireland.  I have spoken and met with its owners on several occasions because they had a very serious concern for their business in that they would be importing timber instead of being able to have their own timber in this country.  There is plenty of it this year, if common sense was applied.</p>  <p>  This amendment will in some way ease the pressure on those who work in forestry farming so they are at least clearly able to sow and fell forests.  That is the way and the clear channel by which people get into forestry farming.  We need to encourage more and more people to do so.  Unfortunately, the situation for the past year and a half has been so bad that we discourage people from doing that, which is shocking.  We as an agricultural committee and as a nation need to turn around this whole very dour and bad situation into a positive one where we see clear planting of forestry in the time ahead.  That means we would at least be able to meet our targets. </p></speech>

I will vote for anything that will help the forestry sector, whether it is felling licences, planning licences or the building of roads.  No farmer has any problem with planting small plantations of broadleaf.  Farmers did not have to be told by the Green Party, or by anyone else for that matter, to do so.  That has been happening over the years in corners of fields, haggards, around houses for shelter and different places.  It has been done over the ages.</p>  <p>  Confidence in the forestry sector is totally and absolutely gone.  People hear about the problems with the felling licences.  Some people are getting felling licences, and I have no problem with that, but it should be fair across the board.  The private foresters should be entitled to get their fair share of felling licences; that is not happening.  In other countries, when someone plants a forest or plantation, the presumption is that it will be cut down when it is mature, when it is the right time and when it will make some financial sense to the owner.  That is not being allowed to happen.  I have heard of several cases where forestry was to be the source of funding to put a youngster through college.  That has been lost. In another case, funding from forestry was to be used to make the house of a person who uses a wheelchair more accessible, with a new bathroom and improvements to the heating and other areas.  That is not happening.  It appears to me the green agenda is to plant no spruce and to fell no spruce.  It is, rather, to plant broadleafs and forget about spruce altogether.  That is the way it seems to me.</p>  <p>  The Minister has no idea of the frustration that even contractors are enduring at present. </p></speech>

I have almost said what I want to say.  I will again say to the Minister that most confidence in the forestry sector has gone and what is left is evaporating as the days go by.</p> <p>We have gone from 2018 to 2019, 2020 and 2021 and here we are in 2022.  We are talking about nearly five years and we are still in trouble with it.  </p></speech>

The purpose of this legislation is to prohibit fur farming in Ireland, provide for a compensation scheme for the farmers affected and introduce other miscellaneous amendments to the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  The legislation also introduces some unrelated but important amendments to the Forestry Act 2014.  These amendments will confer a regulation making power on the Minister to make regulations to facilitate small-scale planting of native tree areas without the need to first obtain an afforestation licence.  This amendment is just one of a number of measures that will assist the State successfully transition to a low-carbon and environmentally sustainable economy.</p>  <p>  This Bill has progressed through Committee Stage and we are now dealing with Report Stage.  No amendments were received regarding the provisions of this legislation to prohibit fur farming in Ireland, which are sections 1 to 8.  Three amendments were received relating to section 9 provisions of this legislation amending the Forestry Act 2014.  I recognise the broad support of Deputies for both aspects of the Bill - the prohibition of fur farming and the very sensible step to introduce the capacity to be able to plant 1 ha of native trees without the need to apply for a licence - obviously with reasonable terms and conditions applying to that.  We will debate the three amendments put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in but it is important to note the overall agreement and sense that both initiatives are good in terms of policy direction and are worthy initiatives and move forward strongly in terms of providing capacity to make good headway regarding improving forestry under native trees and the important step of banning fur farming.  This was a very legitimate and well-organised industry over many years but without a doubt, is one that has outlived its relevance in modern society in terms of our approach and attitudes to animal welfare standards as times have moved on.  Therefore, we are taking this quite unprecedented step to prohibit the industry in the country.  </p>  <p>  Amendment No. 1 asks that on an annual basis, a report shall be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the level of afforestation per local electoral area describing what level of afforestation is broadleaf and as to how this aligns with Government policy and objectives.  As things stand, the Department provides very comprehensive forestry statistics.  On a weekly basis through the forestry dashboard, information is provided on afforestation, roading and felling.  Monthly statistics are also provided on a broader range of statistics that are available on the Department's website.  At the end of each year, comprehensive statistical information is provided on a county-by-county basis in the annual forest sector statistics publication.  My Department already makes available detailed information at individual plantation level on the composition of the areas being afforested.  This information can and has in the past been used to determine the area and species planted at a regional level such as local electoral areas.  The requirement to provide these statistics is not statutorily based but has evolved over time to meet the requirements of stakeholders in the forest sector.  This allows for changes to be readily made to the information being sought.  My preferred approach is to retain this current flexible approach to providing statistics.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept these amendments.  I see where the Deputy is coming from but I am pointing out that this can already be done with the statistics provided by the Department.  When we are putting primary legislation in place, we must consider the merits of how much detail we go into and how many legal requirements and how much of an administrative straitjacket are required of a Department.  The appropriate way to deal with this is the way we currently do it by providing the statistics on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.  It allows information to be sliced and diced in many different ways.  Using primary legislation that requires it to be done in a specific way laid before the D&aacute;il would not add anything because the information is already readily available and is very much utilised by the sector.  While I see the point behind the amendment, the information is available and can be utilised and it is excessive to put that specificity into primary legislation.  </p></speech>

This is an issue we really need to get right for all the reasons outlined by the Minister to which this D&aacute;il has agreed.  This has implications for a myriad of different policy areas such as land use, rural and regional development and our climate action obligations.  We need to get this right.  We are also in unanimity about saying that we need to plant trees.  We need greater levels of afforestation and to ensure that we do all the things we set out to do.</p>  <p>  What we have are lofty targets that are not being met.  The programme for Government contains an afforestation target of 8,000 ha per year but we are nowhere near it.  About a quarter of this was planted last year.  The Minister is bringing forward what is on the face of it a good scheme regarding small-scale afforestation of native broadleaf species but what is missing is that overarching and comprehensive viewpoint.  As has been rightly said, the timber industry has specific needs we need to address.  Our environmental obligations mean there are specific needs we need to address.  A crucial component concerns community needs we need to address.  I ask the Minister to reconsider or at the very minimum give a commitment here tonight that the Department will supply the information asked for in this amendment in some official format.  If the Minister could go this far and we could be assured that we could get clear and precise detail about the amount and percentage of broadleaf afforestation by local electoral area on an annual basis, it would be a good evening's work.  </p></speech>

Farmers have been planting broadleaf trees in corners of fields and around houses for shelter and continue to do so.  Is the Minister telling me that what they were doing was wrong?  He is suggesting that they do not have to apply for planning permission.  I think they would do this anyway without the Minister telling them.  Could they be helped with a grant?  Could they get some funding towards this?  Everything you do today costs money - plants and work.  Is it the Green Party's intention as part of Government to subsidise or help these people to plant broadleaf trees?</p> <p>If there is not something like that coming down the line, what we are doing in here is wasting time.  Farmers and landowners have been planting broadleaf trees since before we were here, going back to the foundation of the State.  They were always doing it.  They did not have to be told they could do it without planning.</p></speech>

This is a specific amendment.  It should not be so injurious to the Minister that he should not accept it on the basis that it is overly specific.  There is a point to be made here that captures the political zeitgeist.  That is about how we take carbon out of society and the economy.  One of the ways to do that is through an active afforestation programme.  The facts in respect of the dashboard, which is the toolkit we all use, clearly indicate that those targets will not be met.  Deputy Carthy has already stated that.  We can see it for ourselves.  The point of the amendment is that it asks for a level of granularity which is not unreasonable.  The Department is a mighty Department in the sense that it has many personnel.  It has an ever-growing number of personnel, particularly relating to the processing of afforestation and felling licences.  It has many experts now.  It would be very easy for the Department to carry out this exercise.  I ask the Minister to rethink his position.  I fear I am involved in a futile exercise in that regard but I ask that nonetheless.</p></speech>

One shocking issue that was touched on earlier cannot be ignored in this debate.  I am trying to be as specific as I can.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, should be in the Chamber.  He should be tied in here for a while to make him listen to some of the contributions.  The shocking issue was that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, failed to sign the derogation allowing farmers to burn scrub on 1 January.  He did not do it on the grounds of protecting the environment.  It is going to backfire enormously.  It is turning every man, woman and child in rural Ireland-----</p></speech>

We will take no notice of the Green Party for a while.  How do Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael think they can face the farmers?  I was grateful when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine did his tour of the marts.  Would he like to go into the marts now and tell the farmers he is supporting the other Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who failed to sign the derogation he should have signed if he had any bit of common sense at all?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is supporting that decision.  He cannot say he is not because he is.  I would like the Minister to answer that.</p></speech>

We are trying to make it as easy and as practical as possible for farmers to be able to plant up to 1 ha without a licence.  Under the current legislation, the situation which has been in place for many years now, the threshold is 0.1 ha.  Anything over 0.1 ha has required a licence for many years but anything under 0.1 ha has not.  We are applying what I think is a common-sense approach in increasing that to 1 ha.  That will provide farmers with the capacity to manage their land and plant trees on up to 1 ha of their farms and on different parts of their farms, should they wish.  I will certainly be looking at how we can support and incentivise farmers to do that plantation.  I already have done that with regard to the CAP programme, both in the eco schemes and the agri-environmental scheme to support that. I will continue to look at that. </p>  <p>  Deputy Sherlock referred to the specificity of legislation.  The point I am making is that when something is put in primary legislation, it applies this year, next year, in ten years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years and 60 years.  We have regulations in law that go back to a time prior to the foundation of the State.  We have to think seriously about what we put in primary legislation because long after we have left, those who come after us will have no interest in the contents of this amendment.  Officials and persons paid through the taxpayer will have to sit down, prepare a report and submit it, and nobody will ever look at it.  What is important is that we have reporting that is relevant and flexible, and gives everyone the information they wish.  Of course, on any annual basis there is the opportunity for any Member of the D&aacute;il to seek to bring attention to that and have it dealt with on the floor of the D&aacute;il or in committee.  That is a good way to go.  We have done a lot of that over the past year.  We will be providing that reporting.  I will ensure this type of information is provided, is part of our reporting and is accessible.  That is the best way to do it rather than putting it in legislation which could be there for many years.  That creates an administrative system and a level of red tape that is excessive.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae asked about the derogation, a matter I have discussed with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in recent days.  That derogation will be signed and that adjustment will be in place.  We try to take a common-sense approach to everything.  We will also look at alternatives for the future and engage on those.  The derogation will be in place.  We are in government to support farmers in any way we can, through funding and otherwise.  We are doing that and a sensible approach is being taken here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="19:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200068#VVV01400"><p>I move amendment No. 2:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 15, line 30, after &ldquo;grants,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to D&aacute;il approval and&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>This is the most important amendment we have proposed and I hope the Minister will adopt it.  We have heard about the broad outline of the scheme that is being brought forward which exempts afforestation of broadleaf trees up to 1 ha.  We support that, as the Minister knows.  We support that principle.  This amendment asks the Minister to bring any scheme arising from this legislation before the D&aacute;il for approval.  The reason we are doing that is that forestry policy, as has been already discussed here, has failed utterly in recent years.  There has been a systemic failure to deliver on targets that have been set and to ensure that forestry policy does what it should do, which is to deliver for the environment, communities and the economy.  As I have mentioned on many occasions in this House, we have managed to come up with a forestry policy that does none of those things.  We want that addressed and I hope this scheme will be a small part of addressing it.  It will undoubtedly be a small part but it can be a part of all of that.  We need to make sure it is.</p><p>Quite frankly, this amendment is a matter of confidence.  We want to build confidence in this sector because at the moment that confidence is at rock bottom.</p><p>There is a pattern that emerges with this type of scheme.  The legislation provides for schemes to happen.  I can nearly write the playbook.  On a Wednesday evening at some point in the future, I will check my Twitter feed or I will see a screenshot of the front page of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>and it will tell me that the Minister is about to launch a new scheme.  That will happen prior to any Member of this House being aware of it.  We will get the headline details in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>or another publication.</p> <p>Within minutes or hours, we will start getting phone calls from people asking if they will qualify for it, what it will mean or how they will operate and we will have no idea.  We will have heard nothing at all about it.  There will have been a PR exercise and we will have to wait until the next opportunity for the Oireachtas committee to meet or for parliamentary questions to be answered if it happens between recesses or whatever the case may be.  It happens all too often. I am asking in this instance that we democratise this system.</p> <p> I imagine the Minister has unanimity tonight with regard to this legislation.  He will get full support regarding the idea and principle of scheme.  We are asking that he bring the scheme back to this House in order that we can scrutinise it, in the first instance, to make sure there are no unforeseen issues.  It happens all the time that schemes are introduced by officials with the very best will in the world, even in collaboration with the Ministers, and then there are difficulties with them.  We want to make sure that when the scheme is introduced, there is D&aacute;il scrutiny and that the D&aacute;il approves of it.  Then the Minister can have his PR launch and take the credit for delivering what we hope will be an excellent scheme.</p> <p> This is absolutely fair and critical.  It has been sorely missing across too many areas of agriculture where there has not been proper democratic oversight of the detail of schemes that can impact people's livelihoods.  When they are got wrong, they can put people out of their livelihoods or cost them substantial amounts of money, whether that be in penalties or whatever the case may be.  I believe it is a reasonable amendment.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment in order that we can say this scheme will be a product of the Oireachtas recognising the failures in forestry and collectively coming together, under the Minister's leadership, to address this issue in a progressive and pragmatic way.</p></speech>

To have trust in the sector out there, there must be trust here in the House.  If we are not being informed of what is going on at the start, then the whole scheme or any scheme, whether it is that of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or of the Department of Health or wherever else, is doomed to fail.  Like Deputy Carthy said, we ask that the Minister accepts the amendment.  It is good practice if nothing else.  It is fair on the sector and fair on people sitting in this Chamber in that they will get a chance to speak on any of these amendments that are coming.  I again ask the Minister to consider the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="20:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200069#WWW00300"><p>I thank Deputies Carthy and Browne for the amendment.  This is already provided for in section 9(d) of the Bill with the requirement on the Minister to provide, by regulation, for a scheme to facilitate the planting of native tree areas.  It is, therefore, provided in the Bill that the Minister would do that by way of regulation.  This provides that the legislation to establish a scheme must be consistent with and based on the legislation adopted by the Oireachtas in the primary legislation, which we are considering in this Bill.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in advance of the development of a scheme, the Department will have to undertake a strategic environmental assessment.  The strategic environmental assessment directive includes statutory legal requirements for the public to be able to participate in the process at specific stages to ensure there is transparency in the decision-making throughout the strategic environmental assessment process.  The consultation process will engage with statutory authorities, outside bodies and the public.  Members of the Oireachtas can also participate in this process to shape any future scheme.  There is, therefore, much opportunity for engagement to help shape and look at the potential scheme from a number of different aspects, not just for Members of the Oireachtas but also for the wider public.  It is very well covered already and, therefore, I do not see it as necessary to do that in terms of primary legislation.</p>  <p>  If, for example, we were saying that a scheme such as this would have to be subject to D&aacute;il approval, which basically means it would have to be voted on in the D&aacute;il, then why would we not do the same for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, or any scheme a Minister would bring forward, not just in my Department but in any Department?  It is overburdening the role of the Oireachtas and primary legislation when it is already being done by other means.  We all know the challenge it is to get legislation into the D&aacute;il.  We know how long it took even for this legislation to find space and come through.  If we were to bring other matters, which can be done in a more collaborative manner that is already provided for with processes in place to do so, then I do not believe it is a proportionate use of either primary legislation or the D&aacute;il's time directly.  It is excessive, overly bogged down in red tape and not conducive to productive government.</p>  <p>  I absolutely see where the Deputies are coming from.  I recognise the importance of collaboration to make sure the scheme is right and the primary legislation we are bringing forward today delivers the results we all want to see, which is more native trees, there are schemes to deliver that and also other subsidiary schemes in terms of incentives and grants and that we drive it on and make use of it.</p>  <p>  Putting it in primary legislation would mean that every time we do something like that, in addition to all the other processes such as consultation through the strategic environmental assessment, we would need to have, for example, the capacity for regulation in a statutory instrument.  It is unduly excessive to burden it with the red tape and D&aacute;il time that would be involved, as proposed in this amendment.  Again, if we were doing it for this, why not for so many other things?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="20:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200069#WWW00400"><p>Why not, indeed?  If the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme, for example, had come before this House for approval, we might not have had the situation where so much money went without being drawn down and then had to be repaid through penalties.  It is precisely for those reasons that there is a need for oversight.  There is a particular problem in forestry, however.  Quite frankly, as I said, across the board, when we talk to environmentalists, the timber industry and communities, they do not trust the Department.  I recognise and have gone on record as saying there have been improvements over the past number of months but the erosion of trust has not yet been fully undone.</p>  <p>  On this particular issue, without getting into a debate on all the other different schemes - because there are other schemes that I believe warrant D&aacute;il approval - what would this mean in practical terms?  If the scheme is a good one and we hope it is, it would be agreed without problems and without debate.  The only time it would actually lead to time taken up in the D&aacute;il would be if fundamental problems were identified by any Member of the House.  Again, from the starting point with regard to this, it is absolutely legitimate to suggest the scheme would be brought before this House in order that we could all be confident that it will deliver what it sets out to do.  I implore the Minister; regulation will not cut it.  The difficulty with the regulation is that it is signed off by the Minister in Agriculture House before anybody else - in terms of the elected Members of this House - has seen it.  This issue of the afforestation crisis and the importance of forestry in relation to all the things I have outlined is too important for that.  This needs to be brought back to this House.</p></speech>

I believe it is already well provided for in the legislation.  As we know, I spent much time at the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine earlier today.  I have spent a lot of time talking about forestry in the agriculture committee previously, as indeed has the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, who has done Trojan work in bringing this Bill forward in terms of drafting this initiative.</p>  <p>  With regard to confidence in the forestry sector and in the Department, we have had a very challenging couple of years but we have been working our way very deliberately and progressively out of that.  As we know, a court decision on the challenges around licensing in 2019 radically changed the nature of how licenses will be processed, particularly the level of ecological assessment required of each application.  As a result of that decision, it radically altered the way licenses would be considered within the Department and the processes required for that.</p> <p>That then led to a backlog, which emerged from 2019 onwards.  When this Government was formed, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I were faced with a real crisis in the sector whereby there was a significant backlog.  We had to recruit significant additional staff and alter processes.  The backlog was not just in the primary and initial licensing, but also in appeals.  There was a backlog of 1,000 cases in the appeal system.  We introduced legislation to deal with that.  As for that backlog of 1,000 in the appeals system that was present 14 months ago, there are now ten or 20 cases.</p> <p> In relation to the backlog for licence applications, we have reduced that over the past year by about 1,400.  Today, the figure is approximately 4,700.  Previously, it was approximately 6,000.  We are bringing it down every week and every month.  We will bring it down even more over the course of this year.  While it is a difficult situation, we are working our way out of it.  Through initiatives such as the 1 ha proposal that we are bringing forward, as well as through the new forestry strategy, we will drive forward to improve afforestation over the next number of years.  This will allow us to deliver on our climate targets.  Importantly, it will allow this to be an important resource for the country, as well as an income stream for farmers.  </p></speech>

The Minister has talked about some of the positive things that have happened.  The evidence is that this House has supported him.  He mentioned the legislation on forestry appeals.  The Opposition collectively agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny to ensure the legislation&rsquo;s speedy passage and through the D&aacute;il.  I do not believe there is anything to fear from asking for D&aacute;il scrutiny in this instance and it is for that reason that I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

Essentially, we are proposing that one of the criteria to be taken into account before the Minister approves a scheme would be the existing levels of afforestation adjacent to domestic dwellings.  The amendment does not seek to constrain the Government at all in designing this scheme; it simply asks that when people seek to avail of it, due consideration be given to existing afforestation in the same manner as public safety, for example, which is already included in the Bill.</p></speech>

The reason, as with the previous amendment, is that we have to decide what is proportionate and sensible to put into primary legislation, as opposed to dealing with it through policy and regulation.  For example, the particular proposal the Deputy is putting forward will be accommodated fully in the scheme and the regulations.  The amendment does not mention archaeological sites in the area and how they would interact with the scheme, or water courses, biodiversity, habitats and the wider environment.  If we start being prescriptive in primary legislation, where do we draw the line?  That is the key question.  It is therefore important that we deal with the appropriate things in regulation and policy as opposed to primary legislation.  That is why I do not believe it is appropriate to put this in the Bill today.</p></speech>

We are asking that the scheme take into consideration the existing levels of afforestation and, to go back to our earlier conversation, the types of afforestation involved.  We want a forestry policy that delivers for the environment and the economy but also, as I have said countless times, delivers for the communities that live close by.  Our amendment is eminently sensible in that regard.</p></speech>

As with those other points I mentioned, this issue will be accommodated through policy and guidelines so it is not necessary or appropriate to put it into the primary legislation.  I assure the Deputy that such matters will be fully taken into account in the positive schemes that will be brought forward as a result of this legislation, which has universal support in the House.  However, it is not proportionate or appropriate to include it in the primary legislation.</p></speech>

Equally, this would give power to a fisheries office to make judgment on the balance of probability or, in other words, on a 50.1% probability, that a potential infringement action occurred.</p><p>The area is a key concern for fishermen and fisherwomen.  If this amendment was accepted, at the very least, the legislation would become fair.  The application of penalty points on a licence means a criminal sanction and will have very serious implications for masses of fishing boats.  Importantly, Irish law recognises two principal standards of proof.  The criminal test is that a charge must be beyond reasonable doubt, while civil cases are decided on the balance of probabilities.</p><p>The meaning of these terms would seem obvious to anyone trained in basic statistics science.  In terms of the confidence intervals, one is inclined to accept that the probability it is true exceeds 95%.  Beyond reasonable doubt appears to be a claim there is a high probability that the defendant's guilt is true.  The criminal convictions require a higher standard than the scientific norm.  Some 99% or even 99.9% confidence is required for one to be thrown in jail or to have a criminal conviction recorded against one's name, whereas the phrase &quot;on the balance of probability&quot; surely means that the probability the claim is well founded exceeds 50%.  However, brief conversations with experienced lawyers establish they do not interpret the terms in these ways.</p><p>One famous illustration supposes one is knocked down by a bus which one did not see and that is why one was knocked down.  Company A operates more than half the buses in the town and in the absence of other evidence, the probability one's injuries were caused by a bus belonging to company A is more than one half, but no court would determine that company A was liable on that basis.  A court approaches the issues in a different way.  One must tell us a story about oneself and the bus.</p><p>Legal reasoning uses a narrative rather than a probabilistic approach and when the courts are faced with probabilistic reasoning, the result is often a damaging muddle, such as the flawed testimony in the UK of Sir Roy Meadow on child deaths that led courts to wrongfully convict grieving parents of murdering children.  That clarifies our amendment No. 1 on a sea infringement being beyond reasonable doubt.  The whole Bill, to be honest, stinks to the high heavens.  It is anti-fishing and I will certainly oppose it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="20:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200072#ZZZ00600"><p>We have had many exchanges with the Minister about this.  He knows the history of it.  When he was the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine, his colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, the then Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on the marine and fisheries, moved an annulment of the statutory instrument from 2018 and for the first time in the history of the State, a statutory instrument was annulled.  That is how strongly Pat the Cope Gallagher, former Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House, felt about the issue.</p>  <p>  Not only did he oppose the statutory instrument, he made it clear that fishermen supported the principle of penalty points but it had to be fair and balanced.  He put forward a number of proposals at that time as a solution.  If one looks at the amendments from the Sinn F&eacute;in and Rural Independent Group Deputies, they reflect what the Fianna F&aacute;il fisheries spokesperson at that time believed in.</p>  <p>  I will not read back to the Minister what he said in the D&aacute;il but he was seriously concerned about the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and he felt there was a culture in that Department at that time which led to a mishandling of this whole affair.  It should be remembered that fishermen had already won a number of court cases against previous Government decisions which found their rights were being infringed upon and this was not balanced and yet, the Minister has brought this legislation back pretty much verbatim.</p>  <p>  The Minister has travelled around the coast.  He has met fishermen online and in person all around the coast.  He knows their views towards the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, which, unfortunately, has been a dysfunctional organisation and is now undertaking reform at last.  However, the Minister knows there are protests within the organisation.  It is dysfunctional and has not served its purpose properly around the State.</p>  <p>  This dysfunctionality led to the withdrawal of our control plan, which was a disaster.  That has recently been reversed, thanks to the huge effort of the fishermen in resisting this and standing up for their rights.  The SFPA allowed a message to go out there that we were overfishing and involved in widespread illegality to the tune of tens of thousands of tonnes and hundreds of millions of euro.  This was widely reported in the media because it was leaked.  We do not know who did so, but somebody in either the SFPA or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine leaked information to media in Ireland that was hugely damaging to and deeply untrue about the industry.  What happened next?  On the back of all of that, the European Commission withdrew the control plan.  That is the level of crisis that has created the lack of distrust between our fishermen and those who are supposed to work with them.  People understand regulation is needed in this country.  There needs to be oversight.  We all accept that.  Fishing has to be sustainable and one has to stick to whatever the science says.  It would be reckless not to do so.  To be clear, everybody agrees on that.</p>  <p>  However, the reason we in Sinn F&eacute;in tabled these amendments, along with our colleagues in the Rural Independent Group, is that it is outrageous to set a threshold of conviction where somebody's livelihood can be taken away, which is the balance of probabilities in this legislation.  It is on the balance of probabilities, rather than beyond reasonable doubt, which is the universally accepted threshold for conviction.</p>  <p>  We have repeatedly appealed to the Minister to remove the balance of probabilities and make it beyond reasonable doubt.  It is an entirely reasonable appeal.  It would have been a gesture of goodwill from the Minister to those fisheries communities, whose trust in the likes of the SFPA and indeed the Department is on the floor and it gives me no pleasure to say that.</p> <p>We have to rebuild those relationships.  I appeal to the Department and the marine officials who will either tune into this debate tonight or read the transcript to start to rebuild those relationships.  When the Minister was on this side of the House he said exactly the same.  I will read back his script later if necessary.  He said he was really concerned about the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its relationship with fishing communities.  My concern in few years since he said those words remains exactly the same.  We need to rebuild trust and the relationship between the Department, the SFPA and fishing communities.  Getting this legislation wrong is not the way to do that.</p> <p> At that time, I spoke to the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, who was the Leas-Cheann Comhairle at the time, the Fianna F&aacute;il fishery spokesperson previous to that and a very fine Member of the Oireachtas for many years.  I read his proposal to strengthen the legislation.  He would feel just as strongly as we do now.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Minister has not changed the language in this law to "beyond a reasonable doubt".  Every single person has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the threshold, yet the legislation refers to the balance of probability.  The Minister knows that is wrong and the then Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher knew it was wrong when he had this statutory instrument annulled.</p> <p> I appeal to the Minister tonight to get rid of this offensive language and lower threshold because every citizen has a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  That is natural justice but that is not what is in this legislation.  What that tells me is that the people in the Department who drafted this legislation and write the Minister's briefing notes still do not get the anger and blind fury.  Anybody in a coastal community knows there is blind anger and fury in fishing communities about they way they are being treated and the facts that they are not listened to and had to sign up to the seafood task force report on the basis that that is just how it is and there are not enough fish out there.  I will speak about all of that later.  The Minister hails from a coastal community and knows this legislation is wrong.</p></speech>

Today&rsquo;s amendments highlight the lack of due process and natural justice in this regulatory system and the Government's bizarre commitment to an impaired approach, which must be called out.</p>  <p>  Penalty points can be issued on a balance of probability rather than on the principle of beyond a reasonable doubt, as Deputies have said.  The Government is enacting an ambiguous and worrying threshold that has no place in any State regulatory process.  This will lead to confusion, conflict and, potentially, litigation.</p>  <p>  Unbelievably, the Government is standing over the section which provide that even if an individual is found innocent of the alleged breaches in court, the penalty points applied under this legislation would not be deleted.  That is simply wrong.  Unfortunately, this represents a larger issue within the Department.  The Government follows the Department's lead in how it interacts with coastal and island communities.  The fisheries penalty points system was brought in suddenly, not by the Minister but by the Taoiseach when he was the acting Minister for the marine, without proper consultation with the sector.  Not only is that poor policymaking, it is deeply disrespectful to fisher and coastal communities.  Now, instead of welcoming a system that reprimands bad practice and acknowledges the good work of most of the sector, we have this mess.  The coastal and island communities deserve better than this.</p></speech>

If a Government ever wanted to pull out the foundations of the support that it might or might not have, it would attack the farmers and fishermen and succeed in turning all of them against it.  Let us consider what the Government is doing with this wording.  The wording means that someone will be presumed guilty rather than innocent.  Surely that goes against every right-thinking person in this country.  Our fishing people have enough obstacles against them as they try to make a living in difficult circumstances, which is all they are trying to do.  Financially, it is difficult because the costs involved are enormous.  Given the price of diesel and machinery, fishing people are really up against it.  Then there are quotas, trying to compete on the seas and make a catch to earn a profit in order to keep going.  Boats are regularly being tied up in bad weather and there are many other obstacles, while trying to keep on the right side of the law.</p>  <p>  Then the Government that is elected to represent fishers comes along with wording such as this and refuses to accept genuine amendments from genuine people who know the truth.  The killer issue about all of this is that the Minister does not agree with it himself.  In his heart and soul, he would like to be over here saying what we are saying because he knows we are right.  However, as the Minister he must toe the party and Government line.  It is like being inside in bed with the Green Party.  My good God, I would rather be anywhere else in the western world or the uncivilised world than be inside in bed with the Greens.  The Minister is selling everything he fundamentally stood for himself.  I do not mean to personalise this issue and I am sorry if I am doing that.  I know the Minister is a decent politician and a hard-working man.  At the same time, if he is going to stand up here and say we are all wrong and he is right, then I am sorry but he is wrong and he is in bed with the wrong crowd.</p>  <p>  The Minister should be standing up for the fishers.  He wanted to go out and meet them to tell them he was on their side.  He should show them that he is on their side tonight.  Fair play means you are presumed innocent until found guilty.  The inclusion of the word "probability" is wrong and alien.</p>  <p>  I am mindful that we should all help the Ceann Comhairle tonight so I will not use my full time.</p></speech>

This is a new departure from fair play.  Any criminal brought before any court enjoys the presumption of innocence until found guilty.  What is suggested in the wording is wrong.  It may seem small to argue about the wording but it is important to people whose heads are down at this time.</p>  <p>  This legislation does not solely affect fishers and all the grand people who came up the River Liffey to he convention centre last year.  They gave a clear and precise presentation and no one repeated what anyone else said.  It was a wonderful presentation and a joy to listen to.  These are grand people who are trying to make a living.  Look at what that exercise cost.  These people would not do that only their backs are to the wall.  They tell us they are only allowed to fish 16% of Irish waters.  All the Government seems to do is offer them some compensation to get out of fishing.  God almighty, there are traditions in those places where people were brought up to fish.  If we went back to the 1600s, it was the English who taught us in the first place how to fish and now our own Government is telling fishers not to fish.  We now have penalty points and the weighing of fish on the pier.</p> <p>It would be fair if foreign fishermen had to weigh on the pier too but why is it just the poor Irish fishermen?  When we are hurting the fishermen we are also hurting their communities because it is all tr&iacute; na ch&eacute;ile.  If they make a pound, they spend it in the butcher's shop, the grocery shop, the clothes shop and so on.  Rather than penalising them and victimising them, we should be joining together here to see how we can help them.  That is what we should be doing rather than discussing the question of the balance of probability.  </p> <p> For God's sake, the Minister must look again at what he is doing and accept our amendment.  He should at least agree to insert the words "beyond a reasonable doubt".  I appeal to the Minister to see sense.  We all saw what the former Leas-Cheann Comhairle did.  He got out of his seat, went up to the back and annulled the statutory instrument but here we have it being introduced again, obliterating what the former Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher did.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies all voted for that, as did we.  We all supported Pat the Cope Gallagher.  He is from Donegal and knows the trouble that the fishermen are in.  Likewise, we are close to the fishing people in Cahersiveen, Dingle, all along Kenmare Bay and in Castletownbere and we know they are hurting.  They are looking at us in here tonight, asking the Minister and his Government to just change four words.  I appeal to the Minister to do that.</p></speech>

This amendment is at the very core of the problematic flaws that exist within this Bill.  The issue here is the balance of probabilities set against beyond a reasonable doubt.  The thrust of any Bill should be based on a just and fair outcome.  One of the problems with this Bill is on page 12, line 17 and we are proposing to delete "on the balance of probabilities" and substitute it with "beyond a reasonable doubt".  The balance of probabilities does not have a precise meaning or a set, definitive standard whereas beyond reasonable doubt is a clear and concise instruction that places a far greater burden on the decision makers to thoroughly examine, and be far more accurate in, their assertions.  This is a far higher standard than more probable than not.  Aside from this, it reduces bias and adverse stereotyping which is often at play when it comes to our fishers.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to carefully consider the amendment and accept the universal concept that beyond reasonable doubt far outweighs the balance of probabilities.  Should the amendment be accepted, it will deliver a fairer and more equitable result to our fishers who deserve the utmost respect.  I commend all of the fishers, especially those in County Wexford, on their magnanimous stand last week to protect the environment by shifting the Russian fleet outside our economic zone.  They deserve justice and a fair hearing which is not contained in this Bill.</p></speech>

We are not opposed to penalty points and neither is the fishing industry.  We have stated that repeatedly but the system must be fair.  This scheme is not fair and we have made that point previously.  We have introduced this amendment because allowing the future livelihoods of fishermen to depend on the loose "balance of probabilities" is wrong.  This would raise serious questions in any other area of a person's work life and why it should be different for the fishing industry is a mystery to us all.</p>  <p>  Has the Minister met any fishing representatives who believe they are being treated fairly in this Bill?  We certainly have not met any.  We have sought to address the unfairness by replacing the words "on the balance of probabilities" with "beyond a reasonable doubt" but have encountered nothing but resistance from the Minister.  In terms of the purpose of this group of amendments, penalty points and serious infringements must be determined on the basis of beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the very basis of any law.  Fishermen are entitled to that, at the very least.  It is outrageous that the fishing industry is being treated in this way.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting these amendments.</p></speech>

Reference has been made to the former Deputy and former Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Pat the Cope Gallagher, who holds the respect of every single person in this House, both past and present.  He spoke with passion in respect of Statutory Instrument 89 of 2019.  He argued that natural justice must be allowed to occur and that common law rights should be upheld.  What is at issue in this group of amendments is the very principle espoused by former Deputy Gallagher, who represented a coastal community, who was very close to the fishing sector for so many years and who knew it intimately.  He served as a guide to many of us who were not so well versed in matters relating to the sector.</p><p>We are supporting these amendments, quite frankly, because we believe that the long-established principle in common law of beyond reasonable doubt should be inculcated into this legislation.  It is as simple as that.  Other speakers before me and the proposers of the amendment have articulated that viewpoint very well.  </p><p>We are debating this legislation in the context of the recent prospect of Russian naval exercises taking place within our exclusive economic zone.  The prospect of those exercises highlighted and exposed the weaknesses in our Defence Forces in terms of fisheries patrols and the weaknesses inherent in our own fisheries sector.  The idea that there would be, just yesterday, a European Fisheries Control Agency, EFCA, vessel docked in Cobh is anathema to those of us who have great respect for our Defence Forces and specifically for our navy.  We now know that the capacity of the navy to patrol our own waters is just not there.  The timing of this legislation is all wrong.  When I think of the diplomatic win, a win that was not garnered by the Government or any Department of State but by fishers who took on the might of an empire, I am reminded of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i>taking on the might of the Tsar of Russia.  There was a certain symbolism in that, in the way that people like Patrick Murphy and Brendan Byrne took on the might of the Russian navy.  It made me proud to be Irish, that these humble people were defending not only the rights of fishers but also defending the environment and the sustainability of the sector that they represent.  </p> <p>They were representing families and individuals who seek to ply their trade, make that catch and make the few shillings to keep life and soul together.  It was a fantastic example of Samson and Goliath.  The Minister is proposing legislation that seeks to further trammel the rights of those very same people.</p> <p> If I was advising the Minister, with the Minister himself having taken such a strident view on this very legislation when he was in opposition, I would ask him to roll back a little on it, to take further counsel and not to go down this route in regard to the legislation.  This is precisely because, as was articulated in pre-legislative scrutiny, the issue of reasonable doubt, which is a concept that prevails in the common law system, is not present here.  While supporting these amendments, I fear we are going to criminalise further ordinary men and women.  It is the State leaning too heavily on ordinary men and women.  The Minister needs to revise his position on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="20:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200075#CCCC00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the amendments.  I fully support the three amendments in this grouping, which do exactly what the Members who proposed them have said.  It is acting reasonably.  The least that fishermen should expect from the State is to change this and to work within &ldquo;a reasonable doubt&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the balance of probabilities&rdquo;, as it currently stands.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility for the Department to establish a body that would meet and discuss this.  The method of allocating the points could be done &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; just as well, which is an important point.</p><p>Much reference has been made to the debates we had in the last D&aacute;il, where this process was rejected by the whole D&aacute;il and in particular by the Fianna F&aacute;il party.  I am reminded of a book that I read as a young fellow, <i>That Was Then, This Is Now</i>.  That is really what the difference is.  Fianna F&aacute;il was on this side of the House when it was put forward, and now it is on the other side of the House and it has to do the exact opposite.  That is a telling point in regard to this whole situation.  It seems that despite everything people do in opposition, they can forget about it when they go into government because government is different; that is the way it is and we are all supposed to accept that.  I do not believe that is the way it should be or can be.  It requires the political system to have the strength to stand up and be counted, but I do not feel that is happening here.</p><p>In response to these amendments, the Minister will probably say they have met all the requirements and, therefore, it is not the same as what was proposed previously.  In reality, it is, and that is how it is going to work out.  I want to offer my full support on these amendments, which are vital.  Even at this late stage, the Department could withdraw this, come back and provide for &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; to be included as it will achieve the same thing.  That is what is important overall.</p></speech>

Given we had dealt with this on Committee Stage previously, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I have given in great detail my rationale and logic as to why that is the case.  It has been subject to very significant interrogation and assessment going back to when it was in the D&aacute;il previously and when the previous statutory instrument was annulled.  At that stage, a number of amendments were put forward by my party and they were comprehensively assessed afterwards.  A comprehensive process has been gone through in terms of looking at each of those amendments and assessing whether they stack up to scrutiny in regard to actually being able to introduce a statutory instrument which will bring us into compliance with our obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Some of those amendments were assessed and incorporated into the new statutory instrument.  Others were assessed and not incorporated because to incorporate them would have seen the statutory instrument not fulfil its duty in regard to bringing us into compliance under the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>  <p>  As it stands, we are the last member state that has ocean and catches fish to actually come into compliance and introduce the penalty points system - the last.  We often hear it said that we are the best boys in the class and we are dancing a jig to this and dancing a jig to that.  That is not the reality.  The reality is that we are the very last, so much so that the EU has taken enforcement proceedings against us, it has taken a reasoned opinion against us at European level and it has actually stopped our funding.  That is where we are coming from.  We have to introduce a statutory instrument that meets the criteria.  If we do not, we will be introducing a statutory instrument that would not fulfil that and we still would not be compliant.</p>  <p>  All of the amendments that have been suggested have been fully assessed and fully teased out.  I have had numerous engagements on this issue with fishermen, fisherwomen and fisher representatives, both in terms of their leaders nationally and at each pier side right across the country.  It has been well thrashed out, as it has been comprehensively thrashed out with the Members present over the last period of time.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Michael Collins said, the key point is in regard to &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo;, which he wants to be the threshold.  Again, this is an administrative system.  In an administrative structure, &ldquo;on the balance of probabilities&rdquo; is the standard threshold.  &ldquo;Beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; is what is used in criminal proceedings and &ldquo;on the balance of probabilities&rdquo; is what is used in administrative structures.  It is a requirement on us to introduce it in a penalty points system.  This is not a criminal conviction.  If somebody gets penalty points, it is an administrative system similar to the road traffic system, where if somebody gets penalty points on their driving licence, it is not a criminal conviction.  If it is a very serious misdemeanour, criminal proceedings can proceed in parallel to that, which would then go through the courts.  However, the penalty points system is not criminal; it is administrative, which is a key point.  That is the reason that threshold is being used.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn spoke about the culture in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the culture in the SFPA, and he had a real go and personalised it in terms of Department officials.  He then tried to tie that around to it actually being me who was saying that, and that somehow what he is saying equates with what I would say.  I am happy for the Deputy to read back on anything I said in the debate on the initial statutory instrument - by all means, please do.  I can assure him that if he does, he will see that, as with everything I ever say, it is measured and considered, and I always hold people to account.  It is not personalised.  As has become Deputy Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s form in all of these debates at committee level or in the D&aacute;il, very much contrary to other contributions that we have heard in the D&aacute;il tonight, he tends to personalise it to officials and have a go at them, rather than dealing with the facts.  That should be beneath Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  It is not the way to approach this.  We need to deal with the facts, assess it, deal with the logic, deal with the reason, but not have a go and personalise it.  If the Deputy looks at leaders in the fishing sector, he will not find them using the language he uses or having a go personally.  If he looks at his colleagues in the D&aacute;il tonight, he will not find them having a go personally, but it his standard approach.  It should not be the way he goes about it and it is not the way to do business.</p>  <p>  He should not be saying that what I am bringing forward is because a briefing note has been put in front of me.  He should know me well enough at this stage to know I look at things and assess them in great detail.  I bring them forward because I stand over them.  That is the way it should be; it is the way it should be for any Minister who comes into the D&aacute;il.  That is the way Deputy Mac Lochlainn should accept it to be as well, and not try to bypass that and have a go at officials personally.  Again, I do not believe that is the way to do business.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cairns asked whether penalty points will still apply if a person is found innocent in court.  As I said, penalty points are an administrative approach.  If it is a very serious offence, it can lead to a separate criminal line as well, but that is very much separate.</p> <p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said that one would be presumed guilty rather than innocent.  I do not agree with that.  That is not the case.  The starting point here is not that anyone is presumed guilty.  The starting point is that, if something is brought, people have a chance to defend themselves.  It is only if it crosses the threshold of the balance of balance of probabilities that penalty points would apply.  If it is a court case, then the threshold that is used is whether it is beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said that we are telling people not to fish.  That is not what we are doing.  We want to maximise the fishing resources that we have in our seas and oceans.  We want to empower fishermen to fish as they can and we want to ensure that it is done in a way that ensures that fish are there for many years to come, by fishing at a sustainable level.  I have worked at European level at all times to try to maximise the quotas that we get and to fight every battle in that vein.</p> <p> I thank Deputy Mythen for his contribution.  Deputy Pringle made the point about then and now.  I have outlined the significant process of assessing all of the proposed amendments, detail, and consultation.  That is how we have got to where we are.  We are the last member state to bring in this process.  There has been great attention to detail.</p></speech>

In the annulment motion tabled by his colleague, former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We need to take on board the needs of the fishing sector.  We need to avoid the possibility of it being struck down in the courts again.  The Department's track record in introducing a penalty-points regime has been poor.  Given that on two occasions attempted statutory instruments were struck down following appeals to the Supreme Court reflects very poorly on the management of the issue heretofore. </blockquote>  <p>The Minister dares to lecture me when those were his words at that time.  I will continue.  The Minister stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The key points that remain to be addressed relate to the burden of proof.  The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued.  The role of the SFPA permeates the statutory instrument at all stages, which was the basis on which the Supreme Court struck down the previous statutory instruments. </blockquote>  <p>The Minister was against everything that he is now defending.  He was on the same side as us when he spoke the last time and he was heavily critical of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SFPA in his commentary, but the Minister tells me that I am personalising it.</p></speech>

If the Minister goes ahead with this tonight, he will demonstrate that he is not listening to the fishing community and that he is out of touch with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="21:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200076#DDDD00900"><p>I have two minutes to speak on this issue.  I could spend an hour speaking on it.  This Bill aims to criminalise the entire fisheries sector and creates an unequal and deeply unfair legal system for fishermen and women.  Therefore, it is important for the Minister to support us on this amendment.  He said that we are the last to bring in the penalty points system.  We are the last when it comes to fishing in all negotiations.  It was proven at Brexit, when we got the most shocking deal of all time.  We have been the last at every negotiation about fishing.  We come out the worst.  Maybe it is time for the Minister to stand up to his European counterparts and tell them that, a few years ago, he was on the other side of the fence.  Maybe if there was a general election and the Government was toppled, the Minister might be on this side of the fence again, back with us, and supporting this amendment.  This is the direction that the Minister was heading at that time but obviously a bit of power changes everything and the fishermen are sacrificed.</p>  <p>  The Minister said he had discussions with numerous fishing organisations.  Can he name one that supports this measure?  They are the people who know the effect that this will have on the people on the ground.  They are the people who we should listen to and who I am taking my advice from.  It is astonishing to think that a very reasonable amendment is not being accepted here.  We are the very last to get this sorted.  The only thing that we will succeed in doing for our fishermen this year is decommissioning.  That is the best deal that they will get this year.  Is it not sad to think that we will wipe out a fleet of fishing boats from our waters and that decommissioning is the only flag that we have, to get rid of the fishermen?  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae was right when he said that fishermen are being got rid of.  There is no point in denying that because they know it.</p></speech>

I remain open to the expertise of the Minister's own officials, given that they have spent much time going to and from Brussels over the years.  Was due cognisance taken of the fact that we are in a common law system?  Whether or not there is a criminal sanction for the application of a penalty points system, fishers feel put upon, whether through decommissioning schemes or the outworkings of negotiations at intergovernmental level in respect of Britain's exit from the European Union.  There is frustration on the part of fishers that they are getting a smaller and smaller part of the pot with every successive negotiation.  Does the Minister acknowledge the frustration of the Opposition as it seeks to introduce amendments of this nature?  It is trying to ensure that if a penalty points system is introduced, it does not further impose upon the fishers and they are not put upon.  Can the Minister understand where fishers are coming from?  They feel as if there is a slow and gradual erosion of their livelihoods.</p></speech>

The purpose of us asking to use the words "beyond a reasonable doubt" is to provide fairness and equality for fishermen and women under the law and the Constitution, otherwise the Government will create a new and dangerous precedent of treating fishers as second-class citizens under the law.</p> <p>This would give power to a fisheries officer or office to make a judgment on the balance of probability, in other words, a 50 million to one probability that a potential infringement action had occurred.  This is of key concern for fishermen and women.  If this amendment is accepted then the legislation would be, at the very least, a little bit fairer.</p></speech>

It shows a total lack of willingness to work with the fishing people and their communities and a total disregard for them.  It is upsetting to hear the record back and to hear the way a person can change his views, opinions and outlook on a subject just because he moves from this side of the Chamber to that side.  It is very worrying and if that is the cost of power and of being in office, then it is a very heavy weight.  It is a tough anchor to have hanging off a person if that is the cost of the anchor.  It will not be forgotten when people disregard those they are supposed to represent.  It does not make sense and it is not right.</p>  <p>  We have to remember that this is predominantly an agricultural country.  We appreciate tourism and everything else but the fundamental things that we had when we had nothing else were farming, fishing and people just working, trying to make work for themselves.  Our job as legislators, in every way and in every fashion, is to help those people, to assist them and make life easier for them.  If the Minister could stand up and put me in my box tonight and tell me how he is making life easier for fishermen, I would gladly bow to his experience, to his position as a Minister and would say that he is right and I am wrong but I am sorry, I cannot understand it.  It does not make sense to me.  When things do not make sense to me, I tell it out straight, as it is.  The Minister should stand up for the fishermen and tell us that he will accept this amendment because it is a very small and humble request that we are making.</p></speech>

The Deputy tried earlier, in his first contribution, to equate what he was saying with what I had said previously.  As is clear from what he read out from my contribution that night, I said that the Department's track record in bringing forward a statutory instrument was not a good one, given that it had already been knocked down in the Supreme Court twice.  I think that was fair comment.  It had been knocked down in the Supreme Court twice.  I also said that there should not be such an adversarial approach and since becoming Minister, that is something I have worked very hard to try to change.  I have visited every pier and every harbour in the country.  I have worked with and met fishermen at every opportunity.  I have worked very closely to support them in every way I possibly can.  I fought hard on their behalf on Brexit, which we all know was a very challenging situation.  After that, I brought the fishermen and fisherwomen together in a task force and tasked them with setting out a pathway to maximise our natural resource and to make their livelihoods as strong, viable and sustainable as possible into the future.  Now I am stepping forward to implement the plan they put forward.  That is my track record since I became Minister.</p>  <p>  Regarding the statutory instrument, it was knocked down twice by the Supreme Court, which is not a good track record, as I have said.  I have worked very closely with the Department in terms of stepping that out, having the amendments proposed at the time assessed, accommodating those that could be included but moving forward and not including those that could not be included.  Now I am successfully bringing forward legislation to put in masters legislation but doing it in a way that makes us compliant, as is our obligation, while taking on board all of the views expressed.  Not all views can be accommodated because ultimately, if some of the suggestions the Deputies are putting forward were accommodated, we still would not be compliant because we would not meet our obligations.  </p>  <p>  That is the approach that I have taken.  I have been measured and have worked to support fishers in what has been a very challenging time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="21:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200078#GGGG00200"><p>I move amendment No. 2:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 12, line 4, to delete &ldquo;30 working days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;60 working days&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>This is a fair amendment.  You must look at the type of work a fisher does.  If something as huge as penalty points is hoisted upon his or her back then he or she will need time.  They will need time to challenge what is probably an unfair conviction being put on them.  It is now left to a fisherman to fight an uphill battle, especially as the Minister did not accept the previous amendment.  This amendment will increase the period of time to 60 days to allow a submission in writing to be made to the panel, from the date of notification from the SFPA.  That is not an unreasonable ask.  It is just 30 days more than the Minister is giving in the first place.  These fishermen are out on the water.  Many of them are working very hard.  They have not the time to come in and fight a case.  Fighting a case is a new penalty foisted upon them.  Anybody who knows anything about court processes knows the person must be there themselves and must prepare his or her case.  A case as big as this is an extremely serious situation for a fisherman.  We saw last week the situation with the Russians and whatever.  The livelihoods of the fishermen are seriously at risk.  They have been for quite some time because both this Government and the previous one have taken their eye completely off the ball in relation to protecting the income of fishermen.  Thus, they are forced out on the water at any time they have an opportunity to catch the little bit allowed by their quota.  They might well have to go out for 30 consecutive days.  Then they will not have a chance to come back in and fight a case, which could be a very unfair case.  It looks like they are guilty if they are caught.  They are guilty if they are not guilty and they are guilty if they are guilty, so they have not a hope of winning.  At the same time, they are entitled to get some little bit of a chance.</p><p>I mentioned the situation with the Russians.  When nobody helped them last week Irish fishermen went out there.  They came up here.  They came in off the water, went to the Russian embassy and spoke to the ambassador there.  They were able to turn it around when the Minister, or the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach could not.  The Taoiseach was taking the praise for it a little this week all right but it is a little too late because the whole country was falling around laughing at the way the Government failed the Irish fishermen.  However, that is just a continuation of failures by successive Ministers and Governments to protect the Irish fishermen.  They threw them out.  They threw them out into the water.  In this situation they took the law into their own hands.  The sad thing is now they tell me the biggest mistake made was them not being allowed negotiate out in Europe during the Brexit negotiations because they would have come home with a result.  We came home with a zero result.  It is a sad reflection of what is going on there that the fishermen themselves have to fight every inch of the way to succeed.  That is the sad situation they find themselves in.</p><p>I speak to them daily and they are under severe pressure.  If the Minister continues with the 30 working days he is going to put more pressure on them instead of working with and co-operating with them.  I cannot for the life of me understand why there is such a misunderstanding or dislike in the Department's thinking over the last 20 years to make it so anti-fishing.  Maybe people say it has been over the past 30 years.  Fishing is one of the greatest industries we could have in this country.  It could be something we could stand up and be proud of, the same as we were so proud of our agriculture.  The sad thing is the Government will wipe that out too if it keeps going the way it is.</p><p>This is a simple request.  The Minister should substitute the 30 working days with 60 and give the fisherman every chance he has to come home and fight his case.  It may be an unfair case he must fight in the first place but I cannot stop that process, by the look of it, given the way the Minister is going.  In fairness, I wish the Minister was back on this side of the House like he was before.  If he were we would have a different story tonight from him.  We do not have that, however.  We have a situation where the fishermen are going to be sold out one way or the other if the Government can have its way.  They have had a disastrous 12 months going from one crisis to another.  There was the weighing crisis, Brexit, penalty points and decommissioning.  Lord God, one thing is just being piled on top of the other.  Is there any good news here?  Is the Minister going to get up tonight and say this penalty points system is going to go ahead?  Are Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael - we can forget about the Greens as they will always do these things anyhow - going to railroad this through one way or the other?  Is there any hope the Minister will stand up tonight and say he has secured quota for the fishermen so we can turn things around a small bit and make them think they may survive in what is a crisis situation they face at this time?  I ask that the Minister at least change his mind on the 30 working days and at least show some bit of respect.  This amendment is about giving them respect and a stronger chance to defend themselves when they are probably in the right and deserve the right to defend themselves.  They cannot do that in the 30-day period.  That is what they have told me and I am relaying the message to the Minister on behalf of the fishermen of this country.  Please stand up for them.  Fianna F&aacute;il stood up for them at one time.  Now it is turning its back on them because they are being sacrificed for some other sweet deal somewhere else along the line.  That is what has been going on here for years.  Let none of us be fooled here in any way.</p><p>I must touch on the SFPA while I am here.  There is a shocking relationship between the fishermen and the SFPA.  It should never be like that.  It should be a working relationship.  That is something the Minister will have to work hard on going forward.</p> <p>Is the SFPA now going to be whipping boys with penalty points?  They have been whipping boys against the ordinary fishermen for the past 30 years aided and abetted by successive governments.  It is now time to change, to turn out and fight for those fishermen and their rights, whether it is in this country or in Europe.  The Minister is at the helm to do that but he has failed to do it so far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="21:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200079#HHHH00200"><p>I will speak to the amendment that relates to the increase from 30 working days to 60 working days.  I think that is reasonable.  It moves the requirement from one calendar month to two calendar months.  I was interested in the discussion of working days because in the fishing industry every day is a working day.  I presume the amendment relates to continuous days.  It is reasonable because the nature of the fishing industry is such that someone could be on a ten- or 14-day trip or something like that.  People who are notified of these penalties on a fishing trip will not be able to prepare a defence or arguments in respect of that.</p>  <p>  In addition, while people are waiting for a case to be heard, they will continue to try to make a living.  They will be at sea for periods between that time so in order to allow people time to actually put up the best defence they can, it is reasonable to extend the time.  It is not an unreasonable time in terms of how the system that will be delivered will work.  To have an actual two-month period is not unreasonable.  I ask the Minister to take that on board and to accept this amendment because I believe it is worthwhile.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="21:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200079#HHHH00300"><p>Justice rushed is justice denied.  That is the main thrust of doubling the working days allowable to permit people a proper chance to organise, to put together and to fight their case, if they have the prospect of penalty points being imposed against them.</p>  <p>  There is no other sector of society, except farmers, whose members are targeted as much for going about their daily work.  Can you imagine a person working in a factory, building site or any other place of work, where people are down on him or her as much as they are on fishermen and farmers?  There is another group, that of lorry drivers and the Road Safety Authority, another agency that is also tormenting people.  Certain categories of hard-working people in Ireland today are treated like criminals before they do anything.  You have to shake your head and ask why.  A typical example tonight is why the Minister would resist this amendment.  Why does he not see the common sense in saying yes to an extra 30 days being added on to allow people proper time to put together their defence?</p>  <p>  It is a fact that when people go out to fish they can be gone for a period if the weather is good and, if they are catching and things are going their way, they will not come in.  If they have to prepare a case to defend themselves while there is the prospect of continuing to make their living if they are getting on good when they are outside, how in the name of God can they come in to fight a case like that?  Of course, that is what the Government wants to do.  It wants to take them off the water because it does not want them fishing in the first place or it would not be doing half of what it is doing against them.  It just does not make sense.</p>  <p>  It again comes back to what farmers and fishermen have done to this Government that it will try to impede, upset, torment and agitate them and come down on them every way it can.  It is a wonderment to me and to them.  We are all completely at a loss and completely confused to know what set the Government has got against them.  Is it because of the beautiful Green Party I talked about earlier?  Members of the Government will be remembered forever for firmly being in bed with the Green Party and for selling its soul for power by doing so.  It will never be allowed to forget it.  It will be remembered forever for all the horrible things it is doing, including all the impositions of additional carbon taxes and all the taxes it is imposing on the people of Ireland every day.</p>  <p>  The wrath of God will come down on the Government.  When voters cast their votes and members of the Government wonder what happened, they should remember nights like tonight.  They will say that maybe if they had listened to Sinn F&eacute;in, the Rural Independent Group and other people who said to listen to common sense, they would not find themselves in the position in which I am sure they will find themselves.  Not one of us knows where anybody will be, but I know one thing.  I know where the voters will be and they are not going to be on the Government's side.  The day it attacks the working people and the day it will not help the people who are trying to make a living, my God, is the most fundamental thing in the whole world.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, we have a coast all around us.  God knows the livelihoods of fishers have been eroded by the bad deals that have been done in Europe, by the way they have been continuously shafted and sold down the river and by all the times they have been neglected and let down by this and successive governments in the past.  It is a miracle they are in existence at all.  We are trying to encourage young people.  I have spoken to fishermen who desperately want to see members of their families and the younger generation continuing in the business.  They are very despondent.  Anybody looking in tonight, and listening to the contributions and what was said earlier about the Government resisting the ordinary amendments we are trying to put forward to try to make it more acceptable for fishing people to make their living, will see that all our amendments are being rubbished.  Why - because they are coming from us?  They are coming from us because the Green Party will not allow them.  It is just a horrible situation.</p>  <p>  People are listening tonight.  Please do not think we are in the Chamber on our own.  Farmers are watching and listening, as are their representative groups.  Fishermen and their representative groups are watching, listening and looking at the way people are voting.  If anybody thinks when they are blindly rowing in behind the Government tonight that nobody is watching and taking notice, and nobody will remember, I can tell them they will remember.  They will remember who did what, what they were doing and from where they were doing it.  People will know how Members voted on these amendments; you can be sure of that.  If the press do not report it, the groups that are representing the farmers and the fishers will know it and they will remember it.  It is an awful thing to do.  </p>  <p>  Again, I am amazed that an amendment that just gives people additional time to prepare and to stand up for themselves against the wrath of the Government if they are being taken to court for an alleged offence is being opposed.  Fisherman commit an offence when they pull up their trousers in the morning as far as the Government is concerned because it believes fishers should not be fishing in the first instance.  That is a fact.  You can laugh all you like but I can tell you one thing; there is no fisherman, fisherwoman or fishing family laughing at that statement because they feel like they are criminals.  It is the exact same as a lorry driver who gets into his or her lorry in the morning.  They also feel like criminals because they are being targeted.  Working people are being targeted by this Government and the agencies of the State that are supposed to represent the people but are instead representing something else. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="21:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200079#HHHH00400"><p>What we are asking for is very minimal.  These are hard-working people who pay their taxes.  They are contributing to us in this Chamber and to services, whether those are carers, pensions or whatever.  They are contributing like everyone else and they do not have surety of work.  They are dependent on the weather as to whether they can go out to fish.  We are asking the Minister to double the days to 60 because 30 days pass quickly.  We are not long back after Christmas and the month of January is gone.  The other problem the fishermen have is that when their quota is reached, at the end of the month or before it, they cannot go fishing for another few weeks.</p> <p>They are out again when the time comes because they have to make money to make payments to keep their vessels.  They will not get paid if they are at home.  They might have already spent a number of days at home because they had filled their quotas or the weather was bad.  They go back out on the high seas to try to make a few pounds and the 30 days are stripping days.  Thirty days pass quickly.  It is only a small request to increase those 30 working days to 60 working days.</p> <p> Departmental officials certainly have a different idea of 30 working days.  Sole traders who are operating on their own or as companies must pay their employees and they must work whatever days they can.  That is often seven days a week and, many times, 24 hours a day.  That has to be understood and I do not think it is being understood.  I humbly ask the Minister for this.  I ask him to tell me why he cannot make this adjustment if he will not do it.  How would it hurt the process for it to carry on for another 30 days?  I ask the Minister to explain that to me.  All they are asking is for a period of 60 days to allow a submission in writing to be made to the determination panel from the date of the notification from the SFPA.  We could not be more humble or ask for anything smaller than what we are asking for.  We are asking the Minister to double the time limit.  I do not think it would be the end of the world.  I ask the Minister to explain how it would damage the SFPA's case if the time limit was increased to 60 days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.525" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="21:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200080#JJJJ00200"><p>If this legislation is about an EU harmonisation of sanctions, is the 30 days the de facto position across all member states?  Is each member state implementing a 30-day regime?  If that is the case, so be it; there is consistency.  However, we plead mitigation in these circumstances.  Given the particular variations in an Irish scenario where fishermen are fishing quite far from their home base, as has been articulated by Deputy Pringle, there is scope to plead for some mitigation to allow for a greater number of days to be provided when preparing one's case, as it were.  That is simply what the amendment seeks to do.  Is the Government tied to the 30 days so as to be <i>ad idem</i>with the position of other member states or does the Government have scope how it transposes the EU rules?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-02a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="21:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200080#JJJJ00300"><p>I referred earlier to <i>The Fishing Daily</i>, <i>Marine Times</i>and <i>The Skipper</i>.  It is my job and that of the Minister to read those publications every time they come out to educate ourselves on the issues affecting fishing communities.  If he had done that, he would not have made the assertion he made earlier that he has never heard of those publications criticising the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the SFPA.  That was an astonishing statement.  I can tell the Minister that, from talking to fishermen up and down the coast, there is, sadly, a wall of distrust that has been established over a long period of time.  The Minister's job is to try to break down that.  This legislation is a disaster for that challenge.  It undermines trust even further.  It says that fishers are second-class citizens.  The threshold for conviction is the balance of probabilities and not beyond a reasonable doubt.  Fishers are second-class citizens.  The Minister can talk about administrative or criminal law.  The livelihoods of those fishers can be taken away by this legislation.  That is serious.</p><p>I watched a documentary a number of years ago called &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.  It was screened in the audiovisual room in Leinster House and everybody was invited.  It was a tremendously powerful documentary.  Something that stayed in my mind from that documentary was the fisherman Jerry Early in Arranmore.  He had been dragged into the courts.  That was the reality for him.  He was back on the boat and trying to eke out a livelihood fishing off Arranmore.  There is a scene in the documentary where he is sitting on the boat and the interviewer in talking to him.  He talks about a city of lights behind him - the super trawlers.  We were going after the inshore fishermen and the island fishermen, treating them like criminals, while a city of lights, a super trawler, was hoovering up the sea behind them.  We were telling those fishermen not to catch the odd salmon or herring, or whatever it might be here or there, while a super trawler was coming out and legally hoovering up fish with no oversight, CCTV or observers on board.  They were landing massive catches.  That is the context and the profound injustice involved.  We are going after our fishermen while we hand more than 85% of the fish in our waters without a fight.</p><p>Bluefin tuna is the most lucrative fish in the sea.  It is now in abundance in our waters thanks to good practices.  The quota for the European fishing fleet increased by 78% in recent years.  An additional quota was given to the fishing fleets of Europe.  What did the Irish fishermen get of that?  Not 1 kg.  The Irish fishermen can catch bluefin tuna but they must release them again.  They can catch them and look at them but they have to be thrown back into the water again.  Fishermen from all other fleets in Europe can come into our waters and beyond.  International fishermen can catch the most lucrative fish in the world.  Imagine the difference bluefin tuna would make for our inshore fishermen, even if they were told to line catch them.  There was no fight in that regard.</p><p>This is an environment in which there is growing anger.  In 2005, we had 280 fishing vessels that were longer than 50 m.  That is indisputable.  When the latest decommissioning round is completed, we will be down to fewer than 100.  Our fleet is one third of the size it was in 2005.  Is it any wonder fishermen have lost faith in their own Department and the Government, and why they are infuriated by people harassing them, following them and chasing them?  The Minister knows this.  He has been around the piers and harbours.  We forced our fishermen to take their fish out of iceboxes, weigh them and put them back into the boxes.  The Minister knows that under the seafood regulations there is a crucial issue around the temperature of fish and the process of taking them from the sea, maintaining them at the right temperature and freshness, and selling them to market.  That is an EU directive around seafood safety and yet all of that was undermined by another directive on the back of a poor job by the SFPA on auditing.  All that was leaked.</p><p>The Minister accused me of personalising the issue and being nasty.  I challenge him to disprove a single word I have said in my contribution.</p> <p>Is it nasty to speak the truth?  Is it unreasonable to tell the truth about what is happening to our fishing and coastal communities?  I appeal to the Minister to listen to them.  He is from a coastal community.  He is not far from the sea in the middle of Inishowen.  Nearby are Urris, Malin Head and Greencastle, with its good-sized harbour.  There are decent piers in the area.  The Minister knows these people.  He knows who they are and that they are the salt of the earth.  He knows how they feel.  I am appealing to him for a change of direction.  I am not questioning the Minister's character.  We have known each other long enough.  However, I cannot understand the direction he is taking here.  I cannot understand how the senior officials in the Department, who have failed for so many years, have the Minister moving in a direction that is wrong.  This legislation is wrong.  This is not a personal attack on the Minister.  I personally have good regard for him and we have known each other long enough.  I genuinely and from my heart tell him that from speaking to fishermen around the coast, that is how they feel.  Nothing I have said can be refuted.  I ask the Minister to take it any way he wants but this is a genuine appeal to him, as an Inishowen man surrounded by water, to do what is right by the people we have known all our lives.  That is all I am asking and nothing more.</p></speech>

However, there are industries that are supported by fisheries.  My Rural Independent Group colleagues have major fisheries in their counties and I support them.  I have listened to everyone who has contributed to the debate.  The media are currently asking which Deputies have a second job.  I have been self-employed all my life.  I understand what the fishers are going through because they have been self-employed all their lives.  Most of the Rural Independents have been self-employed all their lives.  Why do the members of the Rural Independent Group make so much sense?  It is because we understand business and hardship.  Whether a part of an SME or in another job, 51% of the people in Ireland are self-employed.  We give jobs to 51% of the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Some of the contributions tonight said the Minister was on the side of the fishermen a number of years ago before he became a Minister.  He had morals when he said for years that he was standing up for the fishermen and fisherwomen of this country.  Has he sold them out for the position he holds?  </p>  <p>  Irish people are known for their culture.  People in Europe recognise the Irish culture, including its farming culture and fishing culture.  All our cultures are recognised.  The only people who are selling out the Irish culture are the members of the Government.  They are selling out our culture, industries and SMEs to Europe.  The Minister was sent to Europe to fight for our country and the people of Ireland, no matter what industry they are in.  All Ministers are there to fight for us.  The Minister sold us out.  He sold out 85% of the fisheries in Ireland.  Does it not resonate with him, what he has done in the position he is in?</p>  <p>  I do not say it light-heartedly but there is a fierce problem in our Government at the moment.  We have too many career politicians.  People in the Opposition, such as the Rural Independent Group, are bringing to the table the opinions of the grassroots membership of the parties that the Government members once stood up for.  The second politicians get into a position, they let civil servants rule them.  The Minister should be taking on his Department and telling his officials what to do.  Those officials should not be telling him things he does not agree with.  The Minister is left going around in circles saying he did not say this or that.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn just read back to the Minister a statement he made in the past.</p>  <p>  My job, as a Limerick Deputy, is to represent the people who put me in here, whether they are from the farming industry or wherever else.  I represent people who are working and people who are not.  I have to fight for the best deal for Limerick on behalf of the people who put me here.  The Minister's job is to fight for the best deal for Ireland.  He did not do that.  He did not fight.  </p>  <p>  This amendment seeks to change 30 working days to 60 working days.  I can understand that, as a businessperson, as can everyone else.  Perhaps the Department and the civil servants cannot understand it because they have somebody running around doing things for them.  We are talking about people who are working tooth and nail to provide not only for the fishing industry but also for the transport industry.  The Government has done things to penalise them when it could have helped them.  The Government could have helped with fuel costs but it penalised them again.  The Government is making it impossible for any industry in Ireland to survive.  All it is doing is creating inflation.  We can see it in the ports.  The Government is bringing in more legislation and stopping stuff coming into this country or leaving this country.  There is an increase of &euro;2.8 billion in transport going through the North because it is relaxed.  We have to do it differently in Ireland.  We are responsible 0.01% of global emissions but we have the most stipulations of anywhere in Europe.  They are placed on us by Ministers who are city-based and who are not business people.  They are being led by their Departments. </p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to stand up and take on his Department.  I ask him to stand up and fight for the people who elected him to represent them.  I call on him to give them a small piece to say they will have an extra 30 days.  They have to stay outside in the waters longer and catch less.  They have to throw fish back.  The biggest point I am going to make to the Minister is that those Irish fishers are pulling into ports and seeing other trawlers in the ports and unloading their fish onto trucks while the Irish fishers have to empty their boxes.  Why are some of them getting penalty points?  It is because fishers are weighing their fish in boxes with ice in it.  They are told they are overweight and penalty points are applied.  There is no chastising of foreign vessels that can come in and do what they want.  Those foreign vessels can come into the same port as Irish fishers and unload as fast they can before going out again to catch more fish.  That is wrong.  I call on the Minister to stand up for the people who elected him.  He should stand up for every county of Ireland that depends on fisheries.  He should stand up for transport, fisheries and everything.  He should stand up and make an imprint on Irish politics.  I call on him not to be a career politician for the position that he holds.</p></speech>

In the course of his impassioned contribution, he made reference to the Minister's morals.  I know he is a new Deputy so I did not want to interrupt him but I think we all have to accept that we can come in here, have a debate and vehemently disagree with each other and have radically different approaches to matters, but it is beyond the pale for us to start questioning other people's morals.  Everybody is here, in my view, to do the very best they can and I think we should accept that.</p></speech>

This has been a bizarre debate.  This is the second amendment.  During the debate on the first amendment, pretty much all the Opposition speakers spent their time telling me that I changed my opinion when I moved from one side of the House to the other.  They told me that now I am on the Government side of the House I am peddling a different set of policies.  I clearly laid out that was not the case.  I laid out the logic in what I am doing and what I have brought forward.  I set that out clearly.  We are now on amendment No. 2 and the Opposition Deputies are opposing something they proposed when a debate on these matters was held most recently.  They are accusing me of not having come forward and put in place the amendments they supported when Fianna F&aacute;il proposed them when we were on the Opposition benches.  One of the amendments we sought to adopt was the increase the period to 30 days.</p> <p>That was one of the things all of the Deputies supported the last time around.  It is one of the things I supported.  It is one of the things I put in place in the licenceholder's legislation and in this legislation, which is for what the Deputies all advocated.  It was one of their key amendments.  Now, they have spent the second amendment debate arguing against the very thing they were proposing then, even though it is already contained in this Bill.  It is bizarre really from that point of view.</p> <p> I will go back over some of the arguments and points that were made.  Deputy Michael Collins first of all indicated that I was anti-fishing and that people were rolling around laughing at the negotiations for Brexit.  Again, Deputy Collins has followed this debate.  He should have seen my form and track record so far with regard to fisheries.  I was in Rossaveal yesterday.  I visited it as part of my tour of the piers last October and met with the fishers.  It is a tremendous natural asset.  It is a port that has not done as well as it should have in recent years.  I went back there yesterday and announced a &euro;25 million investment for a deepwater harbour.</p> <p>Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned Urris and Greencastle in our own backyard.  Since I became Minister, &euro;200,000 has been invested in a new pier for Urris.  The Greencastle breakwater project was a &euro;12 million investment in something both of us have been pushing for ten years and has now been delivered.  The fisheries school in Greencastle was allocated &euro;1 million for a safety water pool.  A support scheme was announced last week for inshore fishers.  If I am right, it is the first time ever there has been a scheme to support our inshore fishers with up to &euro;4,000 for each inshore fisher.  Right throughout my time in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have backed fishers to the hilt in every way I could through a historically difficult time while dealing with the challenge of Brexit</p> <p> At the end of those contributions, Deputy O'Donoghue indicated that I had sold out 85% of our fleet.  As Deputy O'Donoghue will know, unfortunately, 15% of our quota was impacted by the Brexit deal and agreement.  We fought tooth and nail to protect the industry in very difficult negotiations.  The Deputy will know how our good friend, Mr. Boris Johnson, put fisheries up there in lights as one of his targets and how one third of our fish is caught in British waters.  That was a challenge we were up against.  We fought tooth and nail to do the very best we could for the sector throughout that.  Since that, we put together the task force to bring together all the voices in the sector to plot the way forward and then backed their proposals by putting in place those schemes.  That is the track record of this Government.  That is what this Government is doing to support and back our fishermen to ensure there are as many sustainable livelihoods as possible in the years ahead and, indeed, that our fishing resources are sustainable in a way that means fisheries will be here for many years to come and fishery stocks will be healthy.</p> <p> The reason we are sticking with the amendment is that, again, it is 30 days, which all the Deputies themselves proposed.  It was one of the key amendments, which is now in here and which they are all arguing against without it actually ever moving to Government.  They just changed their position in opposition.  I say to them to back their own amendment, stay consistent, which is the same thing they have been asking me to do, and back the proposals I have in the legislation, that is, the 30 days they initially sought to have in there and that actually is in there.</p></speech>

I asked specifically whether that is consistent with other member states' positions in respect of preparing cases and whether there is scope, because of the particular conditions that exist in an Irish context, for a moving of that beyond the 30 days.  It is really more from the point of view of seeking information that I posed the question.  I just wanted to see what the member states' positions were in respect of the 30 days.  Is there greater scope for furtherance of that position?</p></speech>

It is quite bizarre, to be quite honest, to think that we are only going to get two hours tonight to debate this hugely important issue of what is basically the destruction of the Irish fishing sector.  We will only get through to five or six amendments and then it will be all over and gone, and that is it.  Unfortunately, we need more time.  It is a bizarre situation in which we find ourselves.  It is a bizarre situation to think about amendments our Rural Independent colleagues and I put before the Minister.   We will just mention the fee for when a person wants to appeal a wrongful conviction.  There is no fee.  The Minister never set a fee.  This is very unclear in the Bill going forward.  Imagine, no one knows what the fee will be.  Today, it is the Minister.  He might, in fairness, have some sympathy towards the fisherman in that he might put forward a very low charging fee.  The next Minister might not be sympathetic and he or she might charge &euro;10,000 for an appeal.  I brought up that in an amendment that, unfortunately, we will not reach today.</p>  <p>  The Minister said that I said we were rolling around laughing at Brexit.  I did not say that.  I actually said the nation was rolling around laughing last week in relation to the situation with the Russians where the Irish Government, Ministers and leadership could do absolutely nothing.  It took fisherman to come in off the sea to do it.  That is why the country was roaring laughing.</p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit, I will not go there.  I have said often enough that it was a shocking bad deal.  It is scandalous beyond belief and it has wiped out the fishing industry.  Basically, in the dying seconds I have to talk on these amendments - there is so much more on which we should have had ample opportunity to speak - I will go back to the people of Castletownbere, Schull, Glandore, Union Hall and Kinsale in west Cork and tell them this is a raw and shocking bad deal, and the Minister is at the helm.  I plead with him today to pull back from the edge and stand and fight for the fisherman of this country.</p></speech>

It is probably the only one that spoke to the amendment.  We had a nice around-the-houses debate in general around fishing and stuff like that but that is not really the nature of what we should be discussing tonight.</p>  <p>  Yes, I did support 30 days in the previous Bill and I would support 60 days in this Bill.  I have no problem about that.  I did not propose the removal of 30 days.  I actually proposed replacing it with 60 days.  There is a big difference in what the Minister actually outlined in his response.  I would be very interested to hear the actual responses on what Deputy Sherlock asked about the EU and across the Border.  It will be interesting to hear if the Minister would answer that question because that is relevant to what we are discussing tonight.  What he has responded with so far only goes along with everybody else here in speaking total irrelevance with regard to the Bill.</p></speech>

I was not in the previous D&aacute;il.  Those on the Opposition bench did agree to 30 days but they are surely entitled to seek an extension to help fishermen.  The 30 days is not long enough.  That is the idea we have been trying to change the Minister's mind about by tabling amendments.  The Minister talked about money being spent in all the ports.  That money should be spent.  It is well-deserved and should be spent but it is not being spent on what fishermen actually need and what they are telling us.</p>  <p>  I asked the Minister a question earlier about whether he met fishermen who supported this Bill.  I had left the Chamber by the time he gave the answer; I watched it on the television and I could not believe my ears when he said that he had.  He did not talk to the fisherman today who protested at the convention centre.  None of them agreed with the Minister.  I recall being in the committee room the day the &euro;25 that Deputy Collins spoke about was brought up.  It was just a minimal fee that fishermen could appeal with.  The response the Minister gave is that he cannot fix a fee because the next Minister might not agree with it.  The Minister should set a fee.  Let the next Minister, whoever he or she is, worry about changing it if he or she thinks it is not good enough.  At least give fishermen something in that by having a small fee of &euro;25, they can come back and appeal something .  Again, like all the other speakers, I ask the Minister to start listening to the fishing industry.</p> <p>Implement the changes that they are looking for and support them.  </p></speech>
