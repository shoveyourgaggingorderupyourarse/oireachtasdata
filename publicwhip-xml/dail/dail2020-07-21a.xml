Sheas Ruth N&iacute; Mhuirgeasa ar son na f&iacute;rinne i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.</p><p><b></b>I was deeply saddened to learn of Ruth Morrissey's passing on Sunday.  I know that her husband, Paul, her daughter, Libby, and all her family and friends are truly devastated.  No words of mine will provide them with any consolation at this heartbreaking time.  Ruth was a young, brave, courageous woman who worked tirelessly for others and for future generations of women in this country.  Over the past two days, every one of us was touched by the many accounts of her ability to help people in a very good-humoured, kind and touching way.  She fought a long, hard battle with her illness and also fought very hard for her own rights to be vindicated in court.</p> <p>Ruth, along with many other brave women brought together by their diagnosis of this terrible illness, worked to highlight diagnostic failings in this country's CervicalCheck screening programme so that others would not have to go through what they went through.</p> <p> On behalf of the State, I again sincerely apologise to Ruth, Ruth's family and all the other women and their families for the litany of failures regarding the operation of the cervical screening service that obtained in Ireland for many years.  This Government, like the previous Government, acknowledges the failures that occurred with the CervicalCheck programme and we are profoundly sorry for what was allowed to happen.  Too many women who should be here and enjoying life with their families are gone because of those failings.  Those of us who are here and have the responsibility of elected office have a solemn duty to learn the lessons of how these errors were made, to reform the system and to make sure such errors never happen again.  The Government will fully implement the recommendations of the Scally and McGrath reports.  We will do so to honour the memory of those who were failed by the programme in the past and to ensure that CervicalCheck is improved and can save more lives.</p> <p> Last July, the Oireachtas passed legislation to set up the CervicalCheck tribunal.  This is a statutory tribunal that will deal with the issue of liability in a non-adversarial way.  It was due to start its work in March but this was delayed due to Covid-19.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, is now in the process of appointing a judge and two other independent members in order that the tribunal can be set up in such a way that allows work to start while respecting Covid restrictions.</p> <p> Ruth gave voice to the women who suffered in silence.  It is important that her legacy is remembered by allowing the women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal to have access to the supports they need and the compensation they deserve in a non-adversarial way.  The Government -  and, indeed, all Members - wants better screening services for all women.  The 221 group is still united in its determination to improve CervicalCheck in order to ensure that women are diagnosed early so they can have the best chances in their fight against cervical cancer.</p> <p> Ruth was generous of spirit and was deeply motivated by the interests of others.  She will always be remembered for putting others before herself and for working endlessly for future generations of women.  Again, I extend my sincere sympathies to her husband, Paul, her daughter, Libby, and her family and friends.  May she rest in peace.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach is aware, Ruth was one of hundreds of women impacted upon by failures in the CervicalCheck screening system.  She has paid the ultimate price for those failures and is now grieved by her family, including her heartbroken husband, Paul, her devastated little girl, Libby, and her wider family and circle of friends.  There are no words I can offer that can adequately convey the magnitude of the loss felt by her death, but suffice to say, the State grievously failed Ruth Morrissey.  T&aacute; mo chro&iacute; briste ar son clann Ruth. Is trag&oacute;id &eacute; c&aacute;s Ruth, agus n&iacute;lim in ann glacadh leis go raibh uirthi dul chuig na c&uacute;irteanna.</p>  <p>  Instead of holding up its hands and admitting liability, the State joined the US laboratories that were at fault in this case in dragging a terminally-ill woman through the courts and fought her tooth and nail every step of the way.</p> <p>Even when Ruth won her case at the High Court, she was hauled before the Supreme Court to suffer one final indignity before she was vindicated.  Ruth's solicitor, Mr. Cian O'Carroll, has described this as "deathbed litigation".</p> <p> All this happened despite the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, giving a promise to the women concerned that this would never happen.  The truth is that this adversarial and aggressive approach has been maintained.  I understand there are approximately 203 active claims relating to the CervicalCheck matter, of which eight have been concluded.  I would like the Taoiseach to confirm those facts.</p> <p> This is entirely wrong.  The Government should not be joining with negligent labs in fighting these women.  A decent Government would stand up for them, protect them and ensure justice is done.  A decent Government would be acting to ensure none of this happens again.  We need to fix the system, and that is the only lasting tribute that can be made to Ruth and the other women involved.  As the late Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na once said, talk is cheap and action must follow.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach now intervene and ensure the State accepts and acknowledges its responsibility and liability and stops dragging very sick women through the courts?  Will the Taoiseach accept the outsourcing of screening has been a disastrous failure?  He has committed to the establishment of a national laboratory for cervical cancer testing and this must happen as a matter of urgency, as 90% of Irish screening is still done in US labs.  Astonishingly, despite everything that has happened, this is still unsupervised by an Irish inspector.  Will the Taoiseach commit to fast-tracking the establishment of the national laboratories for cervical cancer testing as a matter of absolute urgency?  In the meantime, will the Taoiseach instruct the HSE that Irish inspection of US labs must happen urgently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100005#C00200"><p>The apology by and commitment from the then-Taoiseach and now T&aacute;naiste on this matter were made in good faith.  As the Deputy knows, the previous Government agreed that the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan, would be requested to review, in the cases of women affected by CervicalCheck issues, mechanisms that would avoid, where possible, women and their families having to go to court.  That is the objective of the Government.  Emerging from that report, a tribunal was to be established, and it will be established.  The legislation paving the way for the establishment was passed into law last year in this House.</p>  <p>  There have been delays in the establishment of the tribunal.  It was to be established in March and it is the most effective mechanism to enable the women involved to resolve these matters without having to go before the courts.  That said, one cannot prevent people from going to court to establish and secure their rights.  Every step has to be taken to remove obstacles in the pursuit of the entitlements of women in these positions.</p>  <p>  In general, the screening programme has saved many women's lives.  Many lives have been saved by the national cervical cancer screening programme.  This must be said in fairness to all those who work on the programme, and it has also been acknowledged by many women throughout the country.  It is my sense that if we were to remove immediately the outsourcing of screening, we would not have a national cervical cancer screening programme, and we would not have had one from the very beginning.  Perhaps it is a debate for another day but we must put this in perspective while acknowledging the failings that occurred.  Quality control is essential to achieving the highest standards of oversight of screening programmes and ensuring this highest standard.</p> <p>That is why the move to HPV cervical screening for the medium term and into the future has already occurred.  That is the key to improving the programme from a quality and safety perspective and reducing error and optimising the standard and quality of that screening.  Ireland joins a small group of nations that employs what will be the best in class testing to screen their populations for cervical cancer into the future.  Others are Australia, England, the Netherlands and Wales.  Along with the continued roll-out of HPV vaccinations, that is the key road forward.  It is the roadmap for the future in terms of reducing death and grief and also making sure that the quality of the overall programme is much better and more precise for women in this country.</p></speech>

The family of Ruth Morrissey have made it very clear that they are not interested in apologies.  That ship has very sadly sailed for Ruth Morrissey.  What we need is action.  The tribunal to which the Taoiseach referred is an adversarial mechanism.  If I can quote Ms Justice Mary Irvine on the matter.  She stated that the claims before the tribunal are to be heard in the same manner as the High Court hears and determines personal injuries actions for negligence and the High Court determines such claims in what is described as an adversarial process.  That is the fact.  In addition, the tribunal mechanism has no means of fast-tracking cases, bearing in mind that we are dealing with very sick women.  The truth is that this State has not made available to these women a mechanism that is non-adversarial or a mediated mechanism for the State to acknowledge and to carry its full liability for the damage to these women's health and, in many cases, for the loss of their lives and the loss of them as women and mothers to their families.</p>  <p>  At the heart of this scandal is another scandal, and it is that of the outsourcing of screening services.  I wish to recall that when that decision was made the House was warned of the many dangers of proceeding in that direction and, tragically, those warnings have come home to roost.  It is essential that the national laboratory to which the Taoiseach has committed is established and resourced as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I cannot believe, after everything that has happened and on the day that we mark the passing of Ruth Morrissey, that the Taoiseach cannot accept the absolute necessity for Irish inspection of what is 90% of screening.</p></speech>

How will he provide a non-adversarial mechanism for these women; what is the timeline for the national screening laboratory; and will he insist that there is supervision and Irish inspection of screening, which continues in the United States?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100006#D00700"><p>First of all, a compensation tribunal is far less adversarial than any court system.  We know that from experience in a variety of medical scandals going back to the various scandals relating to blood products and so on.  In my view the tribunal is far more effective than a courts process.  Ms Justice Mary Irvine is no longer in a position to take up the position as chair having been appointed President of the High Court, therefore, the Minister for Health is working with the Attorney General to make sure that the positions will be filled to allow us get the tribunal under way as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Regarding outsourcing, we need to be honest with ourselves and everybody here that we must be clear about our objectives.  As Minister for Health, I was involved in setting up BreastCheck.  That took quite some time - four years or more - and we built it up nationally to world-class standards.  I recall the huge waiting lists for testing for symptomatic cervical cancer patients.  They were waiting for a long time.  Outsourcing at that stage became an intervention that almost eliminated those waiting lists.</p> <p>Following on from that, the whole idea of a screening programme using that model was developed.  I accept the Deputy's point that it is not optimal, but we simply would not have a national cervical screening programme if that was not pursued.  We need to be honest.  The capacity simply was not there at the time and is not there now.  We have a decision to make if that is the route people want to pursue.  We simply will not have a national screening programme for the foreseeable future.  It has saved many lives.  That has to be said.  Many women are alive today because of the programme.  I certainly take the point on oversight and quality control.  I answered that in reply to the first question.  That should be the case and it has to happen.  </p></speech>

She fought the State not once but twice.  I received news of her passing from Vicky Phelan on Sunday morning.  My condolences go to Paul, Libby and all of her family and friends.  The Taoiseach's predecessor, the current T&aacute;naiste, said on "Six One News" after Ms Phelan came forward that no woman would have to go through this again.  It has never happened.  He should never have said that.  He could not deliver it.  Ruth Morrissey subsequently spent 36 days in the High Court while terminally ill.  She won.  Mr. Justice Kevin Cross uttered a now famous phrase referring to "absolute confidence" in testing.  In the High Court, the State never contested or even commented on this famous phrase which caused so much consternation.</p>  <p>  On 3 May, Ruth said she was proud that no other woman would have to go through this.  I know because she said it to me.  However, a frenzy followed, led by some people in the medical profession, some people in politics and a small minority in the media.  We heard that screening would collapse if this was to be the standard.  Despite not even commenting in the High Court, the State contested this clause.  As we all know, Ms Morrissey won again.  Chief Justice Clarke said it was obvious that many people had not read the judgment.</p>  <p>  The State should have apologised after Ms Morrissey won, not today.  I know some people's words are well-meaning, but today is not the time.  It is too late.  Paul Morrissey made that quite clear.  The Taoiseach's statement the other day, saying that it was very sad that Ruth had passed away but he had made an apology, was a crass statement.  The T&aacute;naiste's statement was a crass statement.  The apology that was issued in this House in October of last year did not apply to Ruth Morrissey, because the State was taking her through the courts at the same time.  That should never, ever have happened and we as a body politic need to reflect on it.  Some professionals in our health service need to reflect on it, as do a small number of people in the media.  Testing did not fall apart.  In fact, Ruth Morrissey's biggest legacy is that she enforced the standard that applies in the UK for the women of Ireland.</p> <p>That is her legacy.</p> <p> A number of people have asked what would be the best way to ensure that legacy.  I can tell the Taoiseach that the best way to ensure her legacy is to do three things.  The first one is to change the Civil Liability Act to enable dependants of a dying person to claim for losses in one action rather than having to go through the courts again after the person has passed away.  I know this is what Ruth Morrissey wanted because she told me so on 19 March.  The second thing to do is to ensure testing is brought home.  Third, we must ensure that the tribunal, which is not functioning, is not an adversarial tribunal, which it quite evidently will be unless it is changed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100008#F00200"><p>I appreciate the Deputy's comments fully.  I know the sincerity with which he makes them because he has been involved in this issue for quite some time and has been engaged with a number of the women who have been to the forefront of the campaign for greater disclosure and transparency around the programme itself and, above all, to enhance the programme in order that it can serve women in this country for the better into the future.  Without question, as I have said, the programme failed women in this country.  I agree with the Deputy that in situations like this one, non-adversarial approaches should always be the first to be pursued and the State should be very proactive in providing the mechanisms, be they compensatory tribunals or other non-adversarial fora, where the issues can be dealt with in an honest and transparent way.  However, that is challenging and it is easier said than done.  At this particular point, I think it is important that the tribunal gets established quickly, and appointments be made to the tribunal to enable it to get up and running.  I will work with the Deputy in regard to the Civil Liability Act.  I think it is a fair point that where someone passes away in such a situation, the family would have an entitlement to pursue those issues.</p>  <p>  In terms of the testing being brought home, I am in favour of developing our own capacity on the testing front.  We hope, with the passage of time and being in a position to deal with Covid once and for all, that we can then restore the national cervical screening programme, because its overall impact has been to prevent many cancers and prevent many women from dying.  We cannot undermine that kind of work, which was ongoing prior to Covid.  It is important that we be very clear collectively in terms of the route we want to travel on this.  In other words, I have no issue with building up - in fact, I would support building up - our own capacity in terms of laboratory testing and being able to do it here.  Moving to the HPV programme means testing is now far better and will give far better outcomes and give certainty and precision around testing.  Once the threat of Covid recedes, we must be in a position to make the programme available to as many women as we possibly can.  That has to happen in the short term.  Over time, I take the Deputy's overall point about the importance of developing the capacity within the State to do the programme here.</p></speech>

I think we all know the lyrics and can apply them to our own lives in many ways.  We need to apply a little bit of them to politics and what happened to Ruth Morrissey.  There is no use in apologising now.  Her family has made that clear.  They do not want an apology.  What they want - I know it is what Ruth wanted, as she told me so - is the Civil Liability Act to be amended to do as I just said and as the Chief Justice himself outlined.  The Labour Party is going to bring forward that legislation in her honour and I expect the Taoiseach to support it.  I expect the House to support it and I expect the Taoiseach to support it.</p> <p>Not too long ago, the Minister for Health stated the women involved and their families should be put at the heart of the State's response.  He stated that this should be done, regardless of whether we think it is right message, and that, for once, we should just do what they want and put them at the centre of matters.  We need to put them at the centre of this.</p> <p> The volume of cases coming through means that we need to amend the legislation.  I will be asking the Taoiseach to honour the Government's commitments to the nth degree when we bring forward the legislation.  I will also be asking him to ensure that the process by means of which the tribunal will operate will be changed to make it less adversarial.  It cannot be a carbon copy of previous models.  There are too many cases out there.  If the Taoiseach honours those two requests, it will mean something has been done in memory of Ruth Morrissey.</p></speech>

People will wish to access the courts as well and that is their entitlement and their right.  We cannot take that either away from them.</p>  <p>  One lesson that must be learned from the entire CervicalCheck scandal relates to disclosure.  The absence of disclosure was, in my view, a significant failing.  The results of the audit that took place should have been disclosed.  That, in itself, would not have saved lives, but it is a very important principle that people are entitled to information relating to their medical situation at all times.  That is why it is particularly important to follow through on the commitments we have made in that regard.</p></speech>

She was a woman who was failed as a result of the negligence of the State.  Regrettably, the apology to her has come too late.</p>  <p>  What is the current strategy being pursued by the Government in respect of Covid-19?  Until recently, the State followed public health advice, went into lockdown and largely succeeded in avoiding complete catastrophe.  There have been many tragic deaths, but matters could have been so much worse.  There is now widespread concern among the public that there is drift and that we risk undoing the hard work that has been done and sacrifices that have been made by so many over the past four months.  In recent weeks, while we have been getting to grips with community transmission and opening up the country, it has become clear that the big weakness is the failure to control the importation of the virus from abroad.  There is now major confusion about international travel.  Promising to announce a green list of countries regarded as safe while at the same time advising against all non-essential travel is inherently contradictory.  Of far greater concern is the Government's ambiguity regarding travel from countries that will not be on the green list.  I refer to those countries that are regarded as unsafe due to a high prevalence of the virus.  Not only has the Government operated a self-isolation policy which has been largely unenforceable in recent months, but, inexplicably, in the past couple of weeks the travel advice has changed.</p> <p>It has been weakened for those countries.  Incoming travellers are now advised merely to restrict their movements.  This poses a great risk to our health, the lives of our vulnerable and to the economy.  The priority now must be to create the circumstances which will allow us to reopen the schools in September and get our domestic economy fully operating.  Controlling inward travel would allow us to do that.  There are many good models of that kind of approach around the world, New Zealand being the most obvious example.  That kind of approach has been called for by our Chief Medical Officer and by Professor Gabriel Scally, several other doctors and a great many in the scientific community.  Phase 4 has been delayed because the numbers presenting with the virus have been rising.  On what basis does the Taoiseach now expect the case numbers to reduce?</p></speech>

Societies and countries all over the world are experiencing difficulties in reopening, some a lot more severe than ours so far.  The Government has taken a very cautious approach.</p></speech>

I have made it clear, and I agree with what the Deputy has said, that the reopening of our schools at the end of August is the priority.  The resumption of services for non-Covid illnesses and strands of health is a priority and it is challenging and very difficult.  As the Deputy has said, aiding the recovery of our domestic economy as best we can is a priority and that is why the stimulus programme will be published, to outline a whole series of measures to make sure the economy can come back and recover in the context of a very severe pandemic.  I am just back from the European Council meeting and have talked to other Ministers who have had far greater problems than we have had in terms of reopening and then having to lock down again.  We are taking a very cautious approach and that is why we delayed phase 4.  Understandably, we took some heat from people in rural Ireland when the pubs in particular were not opened but we did it because we felt it was the right thing to do in respect of public health.</p>  <p>  We have never banned travel as a country since the beginning of this pandemic.  However, if we look at the figures, travel has reduced dramatically compared to where we would have been last year.  The Government will be meeting to decide on this issue.  We actually postponed this idea of the green list of countries at the same or a lower level of the incidence of the virus than us.  That was to come in some weeks ago but we postponed it in a cautious approach.  We will take a cautious approach in that regard.  We have made masks mandatory on public transport.  We are now going to follow through on the advice from NPHET that we make masks mandatory in retail and other environments like that because it is important.  This is an evolving virus.  </p>  <p>  The big question for all of us is how we live with Covid-19 for the foreseeable future.  We have really tough issues, not just the Government but all of us as a society.  We must try to maintain a level of economic activity that sustains employment, companies and jobs and gives them a fighting chance to emerge intact from Covid in 12 or 15 months' time.  It is very challenging.  That is why at 6 o'clock this morning we witnessed an unprecedented decision by Europe collectively to make &euro;1.8 trillion available to try to recover and to provide the capacity to engineer a European economic recovery.</p> <p>No one is certain that that will happen.  The most effective way of keeping the economy going is to keep the transmission rate of the virus very low indeed and that is the objective of the Government.</p></speech>

I asked the Taoiseach what the Government is actually doing now which will make the numbers go down.  This seems completely <i>ad hoc</i>.  We cannot revert to lockdown every time the numbers go up.  Last Tuesday's official letter from NPHET to the Government was very clear about foreign travel.  It said that there has been a 12% rate of travel-related cases, but more importantly, NPHET took note that there have been several clusters associated with that travel-related 12%.  It went on in that letter to say that NPHET recommends that all measures are utilised to minimise and discourage non-essential travel from overseas to Ireland.  The Taoiseach has not told us about any action that the Government is currently taking to discourage travel to Ireland.  That is the key thing.  We have to prevent the importation of this virus.  Unless we do that, we are simply not going to be in a position to reopen our schools and to get the economy up and running again.  I am asking the Taoiseach yet again what exactly the Government's strategy is in relation to, as the Taoiseach puts it, living with the virus.  What steps is the Government taking to reduce the importation of the virus and to ensure that we can move forward to open the economy and get back to some kind of normality?  Is the Government prepared to learn from New Zealand in terms of its success?</p></speech>

Let us be straight about that.  It is not comparable in geography and many other issues.  We should go behind the headlines sometimes.  For example, people talk regularly about mandatory quarantine. It is not a great idea actually, and in some jurisdictions it actually led to a spread of the virus.  This is not simple, and there are no easy answers.  Travel into Ireland collapsed.  There is very little travel into Ireland since the pandemic.</p></speech>

His Government has already lost its way in dealing with Covid-19 and if things do not change we are facing a very serious situation and the likelihood of a second wave and we will not be in a position to prevent that becoming a very significant problem if not a disaster.</p> <p>As well as the obvious need to state simply that non-essential travel into this country will not be allowed and that people will be checked on the way in, the other key area, the front line, which we seem to have completely forgotten about, is the capacity of our health service to deal with a second surge and, possibly, with influenza outbreaks, which are likely to increase in the autumn.</p> <p> I do not know if the Taoiseach heard the pretty alarming, frightening testimony of Siobh&aacute;n Murphy, a young nurse, at the Covid-19 committee this morning, who had no underlying health conditions, was working in a Covid-19 ward, was infected with Covid-19, as were 12 of the 19 nurses on her ward, a number of whom were hospitalised with very severe symptoms, and who described her psychological trauma as a result of having to work in these conditions and the impact of Covid-19 on her.  She was absolutely clear, as was Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, that chronic understaffing and a lack of capacity in our health system was at the root of us having the highest infection rate among healthcare workers of those infected anywhere in the world.  The global proportion of healthcare workers infected of all of those infected is 10%.  Here it is 34%, and in the past two weeks it is 46%.  Nearly half of the infections that have happened in the past two weeks are among healthcare workers, and this is even with personal protective equipment, PPE, because they are working 12-hour shifts, are not getting breaks, and are fatigued, frightened and traumatised by the situation.  Critically, they are chronically understaffed.  We have 1,000 fewer nurses in the health system than we had in 2007.  We need 5,000 additional nurses to drive up the capacity of our system.</p> <p> We are desperately under-resourced and under capacity to deal with a possible second wave, yet all we hear about this week is guarantees for banks and big economic stimulus.  It seems as if the Government has forgotten about the health pandemic and all it is concerned about now is business.  Will the Taoiseach heed the call of the healthcare workers to embark immediately on an ambitious campaign of recruitment to drive up the capacity in our health service, to double the ICU capacity, and to make Covid-19 infections in our hospitals a notifiable issue so that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, can be called in to assess the health and safety conditions that our health workers are in?  Will the Taoiseach support our health workers not just with words but by resourcing them and preparing for what is coming if we face, as we very likely will, a second wave of this infection in the autumn?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, societies all over the world, as they reopen, are experiencing huge issues with the virus and very significant clusters have emerged in many locations in Europe and elsewhere.  We are very anxious to avoid that.  We are working with the CMO and with the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  Non-essential travel has been the advice from the very beginning.</p>  <p>  The Deputy said that tests should be carried out at airports.  NPHET do not agree.</p></speech>

Everyone has spoken about the importance of NPHET advice and it believes that there are many complications around this which could create issues for the contact tracing and isolation system within the country.  It is very easy to say that we should do this or that.  We have examined these issues and continue to examine them.  It is important to say again that the focus now is on the health capacity.  With the winter flu in particular coming our way, great work is being done within the Health Service Executive on capacity issues, as they relate to staff, physical capacity, ICU and the acute hospital system, and on the flu vaccination programme.</p> <p>I visited the HSE on the Friday before last with the express purpose of speaking to people there about the prioritisation of the winter initiative right now so that we will be in a position to have the capacity to deal with whatever comes our way in the autumn, particularly within our hospital settings.</p> <p> It must also be acknowledged that front-line healthcare workers have been key to dealing with the virus.  The Deputy spoke about Siobh&aacute;n Murphy.  I did not hear her testimony, other than a small part of it on the news on the way in.  This is a terrible, dangerous and deadly virus.  We have to do everything we possibly can to prevent people from getting it.  We cannot understate its impact on individuals' health.  People can have it for a long time, they can be debilitated and it can create issues for their long-term health.  That is why we need to continue to maintain our current behaviour in terms of social distancing and respiratory etiquette.  Those are the essentials that will keep this virus down.  People congregating indoors in large numbers has been a significant factor in the increase in numbers over the past two weeks.  Those are important issues that we need to address and keep working on in order to ensure that we can keep down the spread of the virus by practising the kinds of behaviour to which I refer.  I am under no illusions about how dangerous this virus is to the health of any individual and to all of us in general.  That is why we have to do everything we possibly can to keep it low.</p></speech>

The major source of infection in the context of Covid-19 is now among healthcare workers.  After all that we went through, healthcare workers are getting the virus.  Siobh&aacute;n Murphy described what they are having to deal with.  They are working 12-hour shifts and are not getting adequate breaks.  Health facilities are chronically understaffed, which means that there are not people available to take over and reduce the number of hours that others are working.  Even when people are identified as contacts of those who test positive, they are still encouraged to come to work sometimes because of staff shortages.  That is the reality we are facing when infection levels are quite low.  What will happen if a second wave arrives?  There does not seem to be any focus on this.  As I understand the reports, the July stimulus is money to guarantee banks and for big businesses, but there is nothing about building up capacity and recruiting healthcare workers in large numbers in order to reach safe staffing levels and create additional capacity in the health service.</p>  <p>  The matter has not received much coverage, but I note that the budget of the EU for health was slashed during the recent negotiations.  The money that was supposed to be used to pay for stockpiles of ventilators and to assist national health services to deal with Covid-19 was slashed.  As stated, this matter has received no coverage.  That seems to be reflected in the priorities of this Government, which is not supporting the healthcare workers and the health service that we need to protect us and that will comprise the front line against Covid-19 in the autumn.</p></speech>

We will get through it.  We do not just acknowledge but know full well the incredible role that healthcare workers have played in helping the people of this country to come through Covid and that will continue to be the case.  We will have a &euro;30 billion deficit at the end of this year because of the enormous expenditure on health.  That expenditure will continue right through 2021 as well.  Testing has increased significantly, including of all healthcare workers.  For example, the HSE has been operating a programme to test all healthcare workers in nursing homes.  That will continue on a systemic basis to make sure that we can avoid what happened with the spread of the virus in the nursing home sector and, similarly, in the acute hospital sector.</p>  <p>  The stimulus is not about big business and banks.  The stimulus is about workers.  I am sure the Deputy wants workers' jobs to be preserved and their livelihoods to be improved.</p></speech>

We are a global economy.  Ireland develops well when it can export its goods and services abroad and people buy them.  The international scene is not good.  It is very important, therefore, that we take measures that can enhance the domestic capacity of our economy during this period, which is all about workers and giving workers a chance.  Yes, small companies will benefit and companies will benefit to a certain scale because we want them to survive.  Why do want them to survive?  It is because they provide employment to people.  There are too many simplistic catchcry slogans emanating.  I have great respect for the Deputy Boyd Barrett as a thoughtful parliamentarian, but every now and again we get empty rhetoric that everything is about big business.  It is all about workers.</p></speech>

The new EU budget will see a 9% cut in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and this at a period when our farmers need more support, not less.  It is at a time when farmers are under increasing pressures around prices.  It is at a time when the detail we have on the Common Agricultural Policy is that it will apparently result in greater bureaucracy and costs.  Put simply, on the face of it, this is a disastrous deal for Irish farmers and the communities that depend on them.  We are still unsure as to how Ireland will actually benefit from the agreement or how much additional contribution our taxpayers will be expected to pay towards the &euro;7 billion for the so-called defence fund, which in essence is a subsidy to the EU arms industry.</p></speech>

We are talking of the stimulus package and everything else.  There is a worry in rural Ireland for farming and for the rural economy and that what is good for Europe may not necessarily be good for the farmers in Ireland.  This is very serious.  Whether we can find time to extend the time allocated for statements post the European Council meeting or we have a debate on the matter some other day during the week, we need to discuss this in detail.  There are too many mixed messages coming as well.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, has said that the agreement is good for Europe.  Yes, that is fine, but it might not be good for us.  Ireland will now be the fifth highest contributor to the EU funds, which is going to be very serious for Ireland.</p></speech>

I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle on Friday on foot of an exchange I had with the Minister on Thursday when I asked her a very straight question about the leaving certificate results.  The Minister refused to answer the question and then sent out a press release some two hours later.  That was disrespectful to the D&aacute;il and to the Ceann Comhairle.  I ask that the Minister for Education and Skills be made available today or tomorrow to answer questions on the leaving certificate and the reasons the issuing of the results has been delayed.  There will be no other opportunity in the coming days for us to do this.  I believe the Minister disrespected the House last Thursday and I feel that it is incumbent on the Government to give Opposition spokespersons an opportunity to question the Minister in this House on this important issue, which will affect so many families in September.</p></speech>

A marking scheme has been devised and there is an idea of grades instead of exams.  No individual Deputy is going to organise how the grading system is going to work.  I have been in education and I understand how complex marking schemes are, even for the leaving certificate proper as we knew it.  A non-leaving certificate examination is going to be complex, difficult and challenging for all concerned.  It is better that once an announcement is ready to be made, in terms of the detail of a marking scheme and how it is going to work, that is when it is made.  It is very difficult for the students in particular as they endeavour to look to their future.</p></speech>

I cannot see why both cannot be accommodated on Friday.</p>  <p>  All the unions which represent front-line health workers were before the Covid committee today.  The Taoiseach will know about the huge challenges faced by our health services dealing with Covid care, non-Covid care, catch-up programmes and screening.  We have many questions for the Minister for Health.  He should be here on Friday.  It was the first opportunity for the new Minister for Health to address the D&aacute;il and to take questions from Deputies.

We are as busy as the Taoiseach is and everyone in the Chamber has his or her own work.  When we are told that the Minister for Health will attend on Friday, he should be here on Friday.  All we are asking is whether the business can be rescheduled so that both sittings can be accommodated.  We accept that the Seanad has to do its work and pass legislation, but to just put our business off on Friday willy-nilly and with no consideration for anyone else is unacceptable.  It is the first time that the Minister for Health is to be before the D&aacute;il.  In fact, we will have statements next week as well - it would not be good to have statements twice in one week.  We have urgent questions that we need to put and clarifications are necessary.  All we are asking is for the Government to show a bit of good faith and try to reschedule the sittings of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il so as to accommodate the Minister.</p></speech>

The legislation is in the Seanad and I take it that it is important that we get the legislation right and that enough time is given to the scrutiny of the legislation itself, particularly in what is a high-pressure situation in terms of legislation going through the House at the moment.  I am just not clear whether deferring it to Monday is something that could not be accommodated, but I am open to talking to the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee can reflect on this.  Getting the legislation through with proper scrutiny should be our priority.</p></speech>

The point the Taoiseach makes is absolutely valid, in that legislation must take priority over statements.  The proposed change from Friday to Monday is not something of earth-shattering significance, but I am in the House's hands.  The Business Committee will be convened in some form this afternoon and we will consider all these matters.  Is that okay?</p></speech>

Will he confirm to the House that the CAP budget is to be cut by 9% in constant prices compared with the last seven-year multi-annual financial framework, MFF?  Can he answer &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;?  Is it a matter of fact that there will be a 9% cut compared with the last seven-year MFF? </p><p>The Commission's original recovery proposal was for a &euro;15 billion package for rural development.

The first would have resulted in a reduction of &euro;124 million for Ireland over seven years.  The second cut of &euro;2.5 billion, which makes up the rest of the &euro;7.5 billion, would have brought it up to somewhere closer to &euro;200 million over seven years.  I went back to the President of the Council and made it clear that was not acceptable to us.  We got a special allocation under the MFF of &euro;300 million over the seven years, which will more than adequately cover the proportional allocation we would have got from the fund, which obviously was for 27 countries over seven years.  We have dealt with that in terms of the &euro;300 million allocation we received.</p>  <p>  In terms of CAP, obviously there will be a calculation of figures between current and constant pricing.</p> <p>Overall, CAP has been protected.  There will be more flexibilities within it.</p></speech>

While the Taoiseach is in here answering questions on it, outside the T&aacute;naiste has basically asked what is the point publishing a green list at all if the continuous advice is to refrain from non-essential travel.  The mixed messages on this issue have been pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith.  For a significant period of time now we have pointed out that people should be tested when they arrive and again within 14 days.  I am beginning to wonder who is Taoiseach.  I refer to the message from the Taoiseach today on a green list being published.  According to the media, his ministerial colleagues have stated that it will be published this evening but outside the House the T&aacute;naiste said that because of the advice being given and because of the mixed messaging, he does not see any point in the publication of a green list in relation to travel.  Which is it?  Is it what the Taoiseach says in here or is it what the T&aacute;naiste says outside?</p></speech>

The new law will prevent the eviction of tenants unable to pay their rent due to the impact of Covid-19.  It protects them on a statutory footing and it is focused on the vulnerable in our society.  It also gives a stronger role to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, in regard to supporting tenants and in other areas.  It is needed because the existing statutory instrument is not a sound, solid basis for the continuation of what is currently in place.</p></speech>

Over the past number of years, I have met hundreds of young couples who are working but have no real hope of owning their own home.  They are earning slightly too much to qualify for social housing but not enough to secure a mortgage to purchase a home.  They are stuck in a rental trap, struggling to save for a deposit.  Local authorities throughout Ireland are building social housing schemes but there is no affordable housing scheme available to cater for this forgotten group of people.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to instruct local authorities to identify sites for affordable housing schemes as a matter of urgency.  A site was recently purchased in Claregalway and is in the ownership of Galway County Council.  This site should be considered for a pilot project for such an affordable housing scheme.  I ask that Galway County Council be instructed to assign the site for a pilot scheme.  When does the Government expect to have an affordable housing scheme in place?</p></speech>

In that context, I will ask the Minister to engage with the Deputy on the Claregalway situation.</p>  <p>  The Government cannot necessarily instruct councils but it can engage with them to progress situations.

We know the Taoiseach is tired having come back from Brussels.  We need to look at the bigger picture in terms of stimulus measures.  Every bed and breakfast, farm and country guest house, small hotel, big hotel and Airbnb that gets a booking through <i>Booking.com</i>, or any of the other numerous booking agencies, most of which are based outside of this country, pays a charge of between 10% and 20% in respect of each booking.  This money is not paid to the hotels, bed and breakfasts and so on.  Rather, it is going out of the country.  The Government needs to look at this area.  In some cases, the charge is equivalent to the VAT rate, which is 13.5%.  We need to stop this charge by asking people to holiday at home and to book directly with the bed and breakfast, guest house and so on.  There are many of them in my own parish, community and county and throughout the country.  We need to cut out the middlemen and the racket of booking online and the charges because we are losing too much money to our economy.</p></speech>

We need to develop incentives and mechanisms to encourage people to spend on bed and breakfasts and to take a weekend away in Ireland over the next number of months because, as we know, tourists are not travelling to Ireland in anywhere near the numbers of a year ago.  Of all the sectors of the economy, the travel,  tourism and hospitality sector has been most severely hit.  We do have to take measures to encourage people to spend and to holiday locally.  For example, there is a huge build-up of savings and if we can trigger some of that into the economy, it might help to keep people going over what will be a very difficult period to Christmas.</p></speech>

Are the reports that there is absolutely nothing in the plan for families that are taking their holidays in the peak summer season true?  Children have been out of school for six months.  Hopefully, they will be able to return in September.  This means that families are not in a position to take their holidays in September.  Is the Government deliberately introducing measures that it knows the majority of people will not be able to avail of?  To judge by the way the matter has been reported, the Government is adding insult to injury because very few people will be able to avail of what is in the plan.  If that is not the case, will the Government amend the design of the plan to ensure that the majority of families taking their holidays during the peak summer months will be able to avail of the staycation tax rebate?

In addition, Sharing the Vision states "an individual with an addiction has a right to access relevant mental health supports".  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the policy outlined in both documents relates to non-governmental organisations that receive financial support from the Government to provide mental health supports?  Will non-governmental organisations such as Pieta House be instructed to provide a mental health service to individuals irrespective of whether they have addiction or substance-misuse issues, to ensure there is no wrong door when it comes to dual diagnosis?</p></speech>

Over the past number of years, when I was actively pursuing mental health issues, one of the difficulties was in recruiting psychiatrists and psychologists to various mental health teams throughout the country.  I pressed various Ministers to try to work with high-quality non-governmental organisations that could, perhaps, support and complement the work of the public mental health services.  I am very keen to work with non-governmental organisations, both on the addiction side and in the area of mental health, to help them in an integrated way.</p></speech>

We had a board meeting last Friday and one of the serious issues that arose was funding, particularly for personal protective equipment, PPE.  Unfortunately, to date, the only PPE that has been given to the community drug team, as far as I know from reading the report, was a box of face masks.  If such teams are to reopen in September, it is very important that funding be given to all community drug teams.</p></speech>

Throughout the country, school places for children with autism are particularly difficult to secure.  There are zero autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes in Dublin 2, 4, and 6, there is one such class in Dublin 6W and there are no early intervention classes in any of these areas.  Despite the need to establish ASD classes in Dublin 2, 4 and 6, agreed to and identified by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, no schools have agreed to open special classes.  Will the Government compel schools in these areas to open ASD classes as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

As the previous speaker noted, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to: "reduce the waiting times for assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005 through the full year provision of additional therapy posts."  It is clear that the commitments under the Disability Act 2005 are not being honoured in the context of children with disabilities.  There are severe waiting lists for primary care services and for therapy provided under the assessment of need and early intervention team provisions.  This is unacceptable and it poses a great deal of stress for children and their parents.  It is also not right that many children with autism or special needs are without appropriate school plans in either special schools or special classes.  Can the staffing levels in the appropriate therapy disciplines be increased to tackle these waiting lists?  Can a five-year projection of special needs education in each school catchment area be undertaken without delay in order to ensure that the necessary school plans will be provided in a timely manner?</p></speech>

I will revert to the Deputy in respect of the publication of the mutual recognition of custodial sentences Bill.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Haughey's points about the need for greater provision for intervention teams in the areas of both education and health.  I favour greater recruitment of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists in schools.  I am of the view that we should expand that programme significantly over the lifetime of the Government and there is a commitment in the programme for Government in respect of the matter.</p>  <p>  As to the other point raised by Deputies Haughey and Andrews, all children with special needs should have the appropriate school placements provided for them in September.</p> <p>The previous D&aacute;il agreed legislation between all parties to give greater power to the Minister if the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, requests that a direction be taken.  That is not exactly an ideal mechanism in the way it has been drafted.  It seems to me we need stronger advocacy for the child within the system.  It is something I will work on with the respective Ministers to make this a real priority in terms of the needs of children with special needs and their families.</p></speech>

It also recommended that adequate regulation be put in place.  As we all know, more than 640,000 people are over 65 in this country.  By 2030, more than a million people will be over that age, and by 2040, there will be 1.3 million people over that age.  Therefore, there will be a growing demand for home care.  It is also the case in hospitals that 51% of all hospital beds are occupied by those who are over 65.  There is an urgent need for proper planning to be put in place for the appropriate timeframe for people to be discharged from hospital.  There must also be appropriate procedures in place for providing home care.</p><p>The Law Reform Commission defined home care as services required to ensure an adult person can continue to live independently in his or her home.  The report recommends that the protection of the safety, dignity and independence of care recipients should be the guiding principle of a legislative framework of home care services.  This Bill provides for the regulation of home care providers where currently there is no regulation in place.  The Bill would provide additional powers to HIQA to ensure we can have proper planning in place.  It will form the basis of an individual contract of care between a professional care provider and the care recipient, and it will provide that prior to the commencement of professional home care, a risk assessment will be carried out, with this assessment to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  It will include requirements concerning the care plan required under a proposed section 106 to the Health Act 2007, including a companionship plan, a home care plan and the advance home care plan.</p><p>What is contained in the Bill must be put in place to ensure a proper structure and regulation of these activities.  I formally propose that the Bill be debated in the House in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>

What are its precise objectives?  Could he expand on this model of sectoral engagement?  What will it consist of and what will be its modalities?  It would be very helpful to get a sense of how this unit will engage with the T&aacute;naiste in terms of his ministerial responsibilities.  For example, what role will the unit play in responding to the recent High Court decision to strike down sectoral employment orders, SEOs?  Last week, the T&aacute;naiste confirmed that the Government will appeal that judgment and its strategy to lodge the appeal with the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court at the same time.  That is welcome in as far as it goes.  However, when he was questioned further on that matter in the D&aacute;il, the T&aacute;naiste did not adequately address the Government's reluctance to introduce legislation that would protect those very workers now excluded from the protections of these SEOs.  It is my hope that the Taoiseach might be able to shed some light on that.</p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions advises that primary legislation can be enacted to address the deficiencies identified by the High Court.  Does the Taoiseach share that view?  Importantly, congress notes that there is nothing in the judgment that would preclude the Oireachtas from enacting legislation in the same terms as the sectoral employment orders previously enforced.  Does the Taoiseach share that view?  As the Government has acknowledged, new entrants will not be covered by the SEOs and instead will only be entitled to the minimum wage along with minimum terms and conditions.  Arising from this pandemic, these new entrants will be significant in number because many will have lost their jobs as a result of the lockdown.  I ask for clarity regarding Government contracts.  The Government's position appears to be that the SEO terms and conditions should still apply, and not will still apply, in respect of Government contracts.  It would be very helpful if the Taoiseach could at least give that small amount of comfort to the particular category of workers affected by the judgment.</p></speech>

The labour-employer economic forum, LEEF, mechanism has been useful.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance have been involved in that, as was the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in the previous Government.  That will continue.  As we emerge from Covid-19 in the fullness of time, we need to work with various sectors of the economy, listen to what they have to say and respond with the strategies required to get them back up and running.  The model used to get back to work in the context of Covid-19 has been constructive.  ICTU and IBEC have worked well under the aegis of LEEF to facilitate a safe return to work for workers.  In terms of economic development more generally, I am a great believer in strong engagement with the social partners to collectively develop a roadmap for the social and economic dimensions of Irish society.  We must work collectively on several issues of benefit to workers. </p> <p> Regarding sectoral employment orders, SEOs, I would have thought that before we move to primary legislation that it would be important the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court be known because that could inform the content and nature of the legislation.  It will give clarity to the overall legal framework governing sectoral employment orders.  The important issue is the protection of the pay and rights of construction, cleaning and security workers who have been particularly affected by the recent High Court judgment.  That remains the priority of the Government in the interim period before the hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court.</p></speech>

I am sure he can understand the anxiety of workers who now no longer enjoy the protection of SEOs and their desire for absolute clarity on the protections afforded to them.  Can the Taoiseach state in a very straightforward way for the record of the D&aacute;il what the interim protections for those workers are?</p>  <p>  More generally, on the area of social dialogue itself, is the Taoiseach committed to ensuring that workers' rights, collective rights and trade union rights are stitched into the very fabric of the model for economic recovery?  Furthermore, is he committed to ensuring community development and a sustained model of empowerment for communities, particularly disadvantaged communities in urban and rural settings, are stitched into the fabric of the model for economic recovery?  Can the Taoiseach give some assurance that social dialogue will not just be cover for co-opting workers and those who are least advantaged in society onto an agenda that is simply about bigger economic and corporate players?  Given the complexion of the Government headed by the Taoiseach, I respectfully suggest that there will be a certain cynicism around his commitment to these elements, which I regard as essential to a successful and sustained recovery.  </p></speech>

I have a long record of such engagement in the various Ministries I have held.  I also believe in getting the right balance in doing that.  This is not about co-opting anybody into any corporate programme.  It is about how we navigate change in our society and the prioritisation of housing and healthcare.  Ultimately we must all prioritise.  In my view, making sure people have access to housing is a key social priority on which I would like to engage with the social partners.  Proper access to healthcare is another.  We will not be in a position to do everything.  While there have been many faults in the process, my previous experience is that there is value in sharing the issues facing us all.  Everybody knows we cannot do everything but we can prioritise that which makes life meaningful to people in society.  Access to housing is one of the most basic entitlements.  People need to be able to buy a home, access a council house or rent at an affordable rate.  That is important.</p>  <p>  Health is equally important.  We have expanded our health service over a 30-year period.  Our population is growing.  We are living longer and are aging, which will create huge demographic strains in sustaining the system for our society in the future.  We need to discuss those issues with our social partners.  </p>  <p>  In respect of sectoral employment orders, I understand that no unilateral diminution of terms and conditions can happen.  We are committed one way or the other.  The Supreme Court may deal with this so we must await the outcome of the appeal.  Whatever decision is handed down will inform the primary legislation that will follow it.</p></speech>

I attended a special July meeting of the European Council in Brussels, the focus of which was the budgetary package for the European Union for the next seven years, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and a new recovery proposal, Next Generation European Union, NGEU.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the House that earlier today the European Council reached agreement on a &euro;1.8 trillion package to drive Europe's economic recovery and the climate and digital transformations.  These were especially challenging negotiations, lasting for more than four days.  With a significant number of other leaders I supported an ambitious approach, capable of meeting the scale of the challenges we are facing and equipping the European Union well for the future.  That is what was agreed. </p>  <p>  I met with my counterparts both formally and informally over the course of the meeting.  I set out Ireland's position directly in my discussions with President Charles Michel, including in a joint meeting that the Prime Ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg and I had with him and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.  </p>  <p>  As the House knows, protecting the Common Agricultural Policy was a priority for Ireland.  The outcome delivers that, including a special allocation of &euro;300 million to reflect the challenges facing the sector here.  In further support for peace and reconciliation, the European Union will provide &euro;120 million for the PEACE PLUS programme, an additional &euro;20 million to what we had secured prior to the meeting.  Together with funding from the Irish Government, which will match this contribution, and the UK Government, which has made a commitment in this regard, this paves the way for a very substantial fund to support valuable projects on the peace and reconciliation front. </p>  <p>  The European Union has stood shoulder to shoulder with Ireland during the Brexit process.  The package we agreed includes a &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve which will help to support those member states and sectors most affected.  The Government will now work hard to maximise the benefits available to Ireland.  In addition, funding for competitive funds such as Horizon Europe has been substantially increased through the MFF and NGEU.  We will work to ensure that Irish researchers and enterprises can access them. </p>  <p>  Our discussions took place in the context of one of the most serious situations the European Union has faced.  Covid-19 will continue to challenge our health systems and disrupt our economies for the foreseeable future.  Governments across the Union are spending and borrowing significant amounts of money to drive economic recovery and get people back to work.  Later this week the Government will announce an important stimulus package of our own.  The agreement reached in Brussels on the MFF and NGEU will complement and support these efforts.  It will also send a message to the world that the European Union has risen to the challenge and is united in facing it.</p> <p>I look forward to briefing the House in more detail in my statement tomorrow.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100022#V00200"><p>The Taoiseach mentioned the discussions in Europe about the need for a stimulus and the package that has just been agreed.  I referred to something earlier which I find quite shocking.  It beggars belief, to be honest.  The EU4Health programme was a &euro;9.4 billion programme to create strategic medical stockpiles and a pan-EU medical response force, strengthen public health systems, improve warning systems for epidemics and generally boost and increase healthcare capacity in response to Covid-19.  One of the outcomes of the discussions which the Taoiseach is trumpeting as a success was that this fund is being cut from &euro;9.4 billion to &euro;1.7 billion.  Is that true?  I find that absolutely unbelievable, and it is indicative of how all of the concern about the health dimension of the Covid-19 crisis has dropped off the agenda and it is back to business now.  I think that is reflected and will be reflected in the lack of focus on our health services in the Government's own stimulus.  It seems to start at the top in Europe, presumably with austerity hawks.  Was the Taoiseach aware of this cut?  Did he argue against it?  It is just shocking that when we should be massively increasing support to and investment in public health services, the original plan for &euro;9.4 billion in funding was reduced to &euro;1.7 billion.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether that is true, what he said about it, and what this reflects in terms of priorities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100022#V00300"><p>I too would like to hear a very clear answer to those questions in respect of the health funding.  Given that we are in the throes of a global pandemic and a public health emergency, it is extraordinary that moneys promised for a health programme would vanish like snow off a ditch, it seems, and we need to know what position the Taoiseach took on that.</p>  <p>  I would also like a clearer answer than the Taoiseach was prepared to give earlier in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget.  I would like him simply to confirm or deny, in very simple terms, whether the budget will be cut by 9% in constant prices when compared with the last seven-year multi-annual financial framework, MFF, programme.  It is a straightforward enough question and I would like the Taoiseach to answer it.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach tell us whether workers' rights formed any part of his discussion with EU partners?  I am very conscious that the levels of precarious employment, low-paid employment and all of that will be exacerbated in the Covid and post-Covid environment.  To what extent was that consideration part of the agenda?  Did the Taoiseach advance any of those issues and what positions did he take?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100022#V00400"><p>First, there is an existing health programme within the multi-annual financial framework.  There are two dimensions to this, namely, the multi-annual financial framework, which is the seven-year budget for the European Union, and, alongside that, the Next Generation EU recovery fund.  Going into the summit, the Commission's proposal was for a &euro;750 billion package.  The Commission and the President of the Council, along with a number of member states, including ours - I was a very strong advocate of this - wanted the proportion to be more grants than loans.  Going in, it was approximately &euro;500 billion in grants and the remainder in loans.  The frugal four, as they are called, of four member states, disagreed vehemently in regard to the size of the package - &euro;1.8 trillion when one combines the two - and in regard to the balance and ratio between grants and loans.  The entire dynamic of the Council was trying to resist efforts to cut the grant dimension which had been proposed by the Commission.</p>  <p>  The fund was not in any existing budget.  The fund was something that had not been agreed but was to include significant additional amounts, including for health.  The Deputies are correct in terms of what happened to the health funding.  I would have argued trenchantly in terms of the need to preserve the grants.  We fought for their retention and we wanted the maximum amount in grants.  I made the argument that there is no point in piling debt upon debt on member states that are in difficulty as a result of Covid-19.  That was my absolutely unequivocal position.  I said that Ireland, historically, had benefited from cohesion funding and solidarity in Europe when one compares where we were in the 1970s with where we are today.  Equally, Ireland is an exporting country, and if Europe recovers significantly, we will do well.  That is the overarching theme I approached this with, while also seeking to protect our core budgets and the Common Agricultural Policy.  The latter, on current, is retained, which is an extraordinary achievement in itself.  The issue regarding constant versus current is a fair point, but there is no way that people can understate the significance of what was achieved, given the UK's exit and the resources that went with the UK, in terms of the retention of Common Agricultural Policy plus the Brexit special reserve fund of &euro;5 billion, for which Ireland and others are in the front line in terms of being negatively impacted by Brexit.</p>  <p>  The real battle was to try to maintain the level of the overall package so that Europe could respond at scale.  What we are getting is that all those projected amounts were put into the Next Generation EU fund, which had never been agreed and was still there to be debated.   We had to get an agreement, which I think was important, with those countries that are net contributors but which were clearly - this is public knowledge, not just my view - vehemently against giving the grants at all.  They started out with a zero grant position and we have ended up at around &euro;390 billion in grants funding and &euro;360 billion for loans.  We have retained the level that was there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100022#V00500"><p>The frugal four, or is it five now, should be more aptly described as the austerity hawks.  "Frugal four" is just too nice for the attitude these people seem to be taking.  I am absolutely stunned that one of the victims of this negotiation should be an eightfold reduction in a health scheme to respond to Covid.  The EU4Health programme and the details of it are set out on the EU's website.  It tells us that there is this fantastic programme which is about recognising the lessons of Covid-19 and responding at every level to support and increase healthcare capacity.  The website goes into great detail about the programme, but now it has, in effect, been eliminated at these negotiations, which are being heralded as a success, when we are facing the very strong likelihood of a second wave.  It beggars belief.  I will bring this particular issue up later but when one thinks about the St. Mary's nursing home and Caritas convalescent centre on Merrion Road, which is being closed down by the Sisters of Charity at a time when we desperately need nursing home capacity, and when we think about what happened in nursing homes during the Covid-19 crisis, it is extraordinary that the EU has slashed the budget that might give us the resources and funds to invest in those critical areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100022#V00600"><p>When we think of the difficulties that were experienced across the European Union and beyond in respect of the provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, and the really harrowing scenes we saw in hospitals - I am thinking of northern Italy, where it was a race for ventilators - and reflecting on the fact that many Italians, understandably, took the view that the European Union did not stand in solidarity with them in terms of making supports and resources available, that makes it all the more extraordinary that resources for health, in particular, and a collective approach to health, have collapsed in this negotiation.</p>  <p>  I take it that the Taoiseach is confirming finally - it was my third attempt - that the answer is "Yes", that the CAP is being cut by 9% in constant prices when compared with the previous seven-year MFF programme.  The Taoiseach has answered that in the affirmative.  I want to say for the record that it is a far cry from the approach he took earlier with my colleague, Deputy Carthy, whom he attempted to dismiss.</p> <p> Ireland will be a net contributor to the package.  What will be the amount of the additional contribution that the State will make?  I have seen the calculation in terms of GNI, but, in cash terms, what will be the additional contribution from the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100023#W00200"><p>I am awaiting the specific calculations in the context of constant and current.  I will not take heed of any figure that is thrown about.  There was always a difference between current and constant.  The important achievement with regard to the CAP is that we have protected the funding during this round.  That is particularly important in light of the significant pressure in the context of getting an agreement to reduce the funding.</p>  <p>  There is a health programme within the MFF.  It is still there.  What was proposed was a significant addition to the next generation fund the Commission had proposed.  Ideologically, several states - they have been dubbed the frugal four - were against any grant-based approach being taken.  This is an unprecedented package.  Health is primarily a competency of member states.  Europe does not have competency regarding the provision of health services within member states.  There are certain rights and entitlements in this area.  This issue was about the procurement of vaccines and similar matters, as well as joint approaches to which Ireland has already signed up.  Ireland is involved in an EU-wide approach in respect of vaccine development and procurement in the context of Covid-19.  The discussion involved states that were in favour of loans, rather than grants, being allocated to member states which are vulnerable as a result of Covid and which might need them.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may remember that Chancellor Merkel and President Macron originally proposed a package of &euro;500 billion.  The Commission went way beyond that with a &euro;750 billion package that is divided into grants and loans.  That was the battleground for the summit.  I fought strongly and intervened regularly to state that Ireland wanted the right package in the context of responding to the scale of the impact of the Covid crisis on the European economy.  It was vital that an agreement was reached.  The agreement reached is unprecedented in terms of the European Union collectively borrowing for the first time ever to respond to a global pandemic of this scale.  That needs to be acknowledged.  The 27 member states represented at the Council meeting had all sorts of competing interests.  Several member states, including Ireland, took what I consider to be the correct line and stated that it is no longer about competing national interests but, rather, about doing the right thing for Europe as a collective.</p>  <p>  Ireland exports to mainland Europe.  European markets are vital to our agricultural industry and many SMEs and other companies, jobs and services.  The Single Market has been very important to Ireland and our growth and development as an economy.  Deputy Boyd Barrett may disagree that this is the case.  He may not agree with the Single Market or the economic model that governs it, but the development of the European Union has had a very beneficial economic impact on Ireland from the 1970s onwards.  That is the context in which member states argued over the agreement.</p>  <p>  On the issues Deputies identified in the context of the net contributor status of Ireland, the country is now a net contributor to the MFF.  The figures in that regard will have to be calculated because this latest package involved a higher number.  I will get the exact figures for the Deputy.  In fact, Ireland will now benefit in the context of the contribution to the fund in respect of the repayments that where to have been made until to 2058.  We would have been paying far more if there were more grants, to be frank, although I did not see it through that prism.  Rather, I saw it as a matter of engineering economic recovery in Europe and showing solidarity with other countries which, ultimately, will benefit Ireland.   In key areas such as Brexit, the PEACE PLUS programme and the CAP, we preserved the essentials we went in with in the context of the MFF.</p></speech>

It is motherhood and apple pie.  Some of us have criticised it because, when one looks at the detail, it is vague and aspirational and does not make tangible commitments in the key areas in which people demanded change at the general election.  That is where my question is focused.  For example, the section entitled "An Age-Friendly Ireland" sounds great and appears broadly nice, but it is totally aspirational.  We need to look at what is actually happening.  There was a disaster in nursing homes in the context of Covid-19.  There were significant infections and fatalities because our system of nursing home care is completely dysfunctional.  A report published by HIQA found that more than 50% of nursing homes were below standard.</p>  <p>  I refer to the situation involving two nursing homes on Merrion Road.  I wish to send a shout out to the workers and residents in the homes and their families.  The homes in question are situated on land that is directly or indirectly owned by the Sisters of Charity and both are closing down because, essentially, a religious organisation decided that the land on Merrion Road is very valuable.  It probably wants to flog the land to developers.  The Sisters of Charity unilaterally ended the lease for the Caritas Convalescent Centre and shut down St. Mary's Centre Nursing, leaving the elderly residents, their families and the workers high and dry.  By the way, these nursing homes did not have Covid cases.  These were the good ones.</p>  <p>  This situation is indicative of the dysfunctionality in this area of policy.  The Sisters of Charity are deciding to end care provision in these nursing homes.  What is the Government doing about this?  What tangible measures are going to be taken in the aftermath of Covid to ensure that the State is in charge of ensuring that we have the capacity we need in nursing home care?  What will be done to ensure that the State has genuine control in that regard, that the sector has the resources it needs and that workers and residents in nursing homes are properly protected?  Specifically, what will the Government do about the scandal that is unfolding on Merrion Road?  It is just one example of dysfunctionality in the sector.</p>  <p>  A similar point could be made in respect of the specific commitment in the programme for Government to protect tenants during Covid-19.  It is now unclear whether many tenants will be evicted on 1 August when the temporary ban ends.  Where is the tangible action on the things people asked for?</p></speech>

It would fatally damage any remaining prospect of a sustainable two-state solution as provided for under the Oslo Accords of 1993.  There are commitments in the programme for Government which read very well.  However, I put it to the Taoiseach that they are not sincerely made.  I put it to him that he has allowed one party, namely, Fine Gael, to defy the will of the Oireachtas in the ongoing failure to recognise the state of Palestine as per the 1967 border.  That decision was made in 2014, six years ago.  The Taoiseach has also allowed Fine Gael to face down the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, even though he and his colleagues in opposition supported those measures.</p> <p> I want the Taoiseach to act in good faith.  I want him to make real and give real meaning to the programme for Government commitments, for example, by honouring our commitment to recognise the state of Palestine.  That needs to be done now.  If the Taoiseach is going to uphold international law, face down any prospect of any level of further annexation and, critically, face down the ongoing breach in international law by the occupation itself, he needs to act to ensure that the occupied territories Bill becomes law and is placed on our Statute Book.</p></speech>

What is important is that I do think we have to take a stand in respect of any proposals by the Israeli Government to annex more lands, as has been proposed but has not happened yet.  There is significant opposition to that.  The provisions in the programme for Government are well made and sincerely made.  I have had an interest in this for quite a long time now myself, and when I was last Minister for Foreign Affairs I took action.  I went to Gaza and met with the UNRWA.  One of the most practical things the State has done along with the European Union for quite a long time has been supporting UNRWA with a huge investment in education in Palestine.  That is important.  It never gets said in here.  Where practically we can improve things, we should do more.  The issue of recognition of the Palestinian state is on the agenda of the programme for Government, to have other language in there, as the Deputy knows, in terms of timing and the optimal time to do it and in consultation with other EU member states.  There are important considerations.</p>  <p>  I take it that the Deputy is sincerely committed to this but I would suggest that the next time she or her party is in Capitol Hill, they might raise it.</p></speech>

They might raise it with Congress representatives or Senators there.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a sort of dual approach to this which is very strong here, but when it comes to United States, I do not get any sense that they raise this with the same degree of commitment as they do here in the House.  That is my sense of it.  I have raised it with US Congress members and Senators.  They have raised the issue with me and I have given my sense of it.  Israeli Government policy is wrong.  It is not conducive to the establishment of a two-state solution or better relationships.  Ultimately, people have to live together and share that territory.  Policies that have been pursued in recent times work against a proper, long-term accommodation between Palestinians and Israeli society.  This Government remains committed to the two-state solution and to doing everything it possibly can to achieve that and to opposing measures that will work against it, such as those the Deputy has outlined in respect of the proposed Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory.</p></speech>

Our system has evolved.  The Deputy mentioned himself that those particular nursing homes were Covid free.  We need to put on record that quite a lot of nursing homes in Ireland did well in preventing Covid from spreading within them.  I do take the Deputy's point that in the initial response, all the emphasis was on the acute services, for understandable reasons in terms of protecting ICU capacity and so on.  There was a very significant spread of the virus within nursing homes which caused loss of life.  That has happened in other societies.  The elderly are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.  To be fair, since then over recent months, a lot of support has been put behind nursing homes in terms of personal protective equipment, PPE, engagement with the HSE and clinical oversight.  That is important.  The testing has been really systematic and the HSE has organised to do testing of nursing homes and staff of nursing homes on a regular basis.  I would favour the development of home-based care.  There will always be a need for nursing home care but we need to resource home-based care significantly as well, and to enable people to avail of the fair deal scheme in the context of home-based care.  I will follow up with the Deputy in respect of the exact situation in St. Mary's and Caritas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100024#X01700"><p>My point, arising from what happened with Covid-19 in the nursing homes sector and from the Caritas and St. Mary's situation, is that we have a completely fragmented nursing home care sector.  Some of it is good and some of it is not so good, but we are in control of hardly any of it.  The nuns in this case seem to have turned into property magnates and to have lost any interest in the workers or the residents in the nursing homes.  They just decided to close it down because it is valuable land and they can flog it, and that is allowed.  This should be part of a cradle-to-grave national health service, yet its fate is decided by the Sisters of Charity, who have just become big business and see property value as more important than nursing home care, which was what was being delivered, and a good standard too, but the workers are just gone and the residents and their families are left high and dry.  That is not acceptable.  We need intervention.  The State should just take that land and make sure those nursing home places and jobs are protected.  That is the lesson more broadly of the Covid crisis.  Paul Reid said it at some of the briefings the Taoiseach attended.  When we asked him what was happening in the nursing homes, he more or less said he did not know because the HSE only controls 20% of them.  That is the problem.  They need to be part of a national health service so we know what is going on and we have the power to step in and ensure consistency, standards, proper resourcing and oversight.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach knows, that matter was settled and agreed by the Oireachtas six years ago.  I am saying to him to do it, and to do it while there still is a Palestinian state to recognise.  On the issue of the occupied territories Bill, the Taoiseach knows full well there has been a strong pushback against this legislation because it would be groundbreaking and would bring about a change in diplomatic, political and legal terms in respect of the issue and the economy of the occupation which the Israeli state has carefully fostered.  The Taoiseach knows the Bill is a game changer that would very much shape and confront Israeli policy.  In taking leadership on this matter, Ireland would lead the way for others to follow suit.</p> <p>We have to act on this.  There is no point of us being of good sentiment and being well-meaning and wishing the best for the Palestinians when the Irish State stands back and allows an ongoing occupation, and even the prospect of further annexation.  We can lead on this.  If I was sitting in the Taoiseach's seat I would be telling Deputies of the date on which the Palestinian State would be recognised, as per the collective view of the Oireachtas.  I would not have allowed Fine Gael, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, or anyone else, to face down the occupied territories Bill.  That is what happened.  One of the negotiators from the Green Party, when asked what happened to the occupied territories Bill, answered in two words: "Simon Coveney".  The Taoiseach cannot stand over that and nor should he.</p></speech>

I would like Israeli Government policy to change and for there to be a two-state solution but we will work within a framework that can enable us to do that and we will continue to support Palestinians in their basic entitlements to housing, education and healthcare as we have done consistently over many years, and <i>per capita</i>above many others.</p><p>To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, many State-owned healthcare centres have had huge challenges with Covid-19, some worse than nursing homes in the private sector.  Some of the significant clusters happened in some elderly care settings within the State system.

The guidelines for the 33rd D&aacute;il currently await Government approval.</p>  <p>  Appointments to the position of special adviser are made in accordance with section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 which states that the Government may by order, appoint special advisers to the Minister or Minister of State who is assigned to a Department or to a scheduled office provided that the number of special advisers shall not in the case of a Minister, other than the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste or the leader of a political party registered in the register of political parties, be greater than two, in the case of a Minister of State who regularly attends meetings of the Government be greater than two, and in the case of any other Minster of State be greater than one.  All appointments to the position of special adviser require a Government order to be made.</p>  <p>  Special advisers to Ministers and Ministers of State who regularly attend Cabinet are to be placed on the principal officer - standard - PPC scale, which is currently &euro;87,325 - &euro;101,114.</p> <p>Special advisers to Ministers of State are to be placed on the assistant principal officer standard scale, which is currently &euro;67,659 - &euro;78,816.  While appointments should normally be on the first point of the scale, Secretaries General have delegated sanction to approve any increment on the scale where they are satisfied that this is justified. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will publish the rates payable on its website.</p> <p> The above restrictions on salary scale do not apply to special advisers to the Taoiseach or T&aacute;naiste.  The individual pay rates will also be published on the website.   At this stage, no special advisers have been formally appointed by the Government.  This process will start once the guidelines have been approved by Government and details will be published on the website of my Department.</p></reply>

An Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is to have a chief of staff, a deputy chief of staff and three special advisers, not to mention an economic adviser.  The Fine Gael leader, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is to have an aide-de-camp, despite no longer being the leader of this country, or is he simply did Taoiseach-in-waiting?  In addition, he will have five or six advisers.  The Green Party leader, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is to have four or five advisers.  Given the events of the past week, one of them may be there to wake him up when he falls asleep.  This is fast becoming a circus.  The Minister said the details will be published online.  Can he commit to publishing an updated and ongoing list of special advisers as has been done in the past and can the list include more detail, including whether the advisers are related to the individual receiving the advice?</p></speech>

There is always transparency as to the persons who have been appointed and the salaries they are paid.  We will continue with that transparency.  The details will be published in the normal way.  That cannot happen until we have adopted a formal Government policy on the appointment of special advisers.  A memorandum will be brought to Government shortly to formalise this issue and to get Government approval for this policy.  All the details will be published in the normal way and will be open to question and scrutiny.  I know from my time in the Opposition that of all of those details are available in parliamentary questions and will be published directly on the website of my Department.</p>  <p>  The work special advisers do is really valuable.  I am a new Minister and have one person working with me at the moment.  The amount and volume of work that is coming our way is phenomenal.  I was in the office until after 11 o&rsquo;clock last night working through a range of issues.  One needs as much help as one can get.  Provided the right people with the right experience, qualifications and calibre are appointed, as a country, it is money well spent and we get a return for that investment.</p></speech>

We also hear a great deal about responsible Government and fiscal prudence.  Yet here, where taxpayers' money is concerned, it seems to the public - people have contacted me - like reckless spending on special advisers.  How can we reiterate time and again that we are all in this together when it is quite clear we are not?  I have no problem with people having to tighten their belts but the reality is we all have to be wearing the same size trousers at that point.  It is very evident that while many people are struggling and many SMEs are starved of capital, there is a select few who live in different reality.  Is it fair that at a time when so many people are doing more with less that Ministers continue to have more?</p></speech>

The rates of pay of any adviser appointed will be governed by that.  It is principal officer level for Ministers&rsquo; special advisers and assistant principal officer level for any special adviser appointed for a Minister of State.  The very issues and policies the Deputy has highlighted underline the need for a really good Government, one that is going to invest in the people, is going to underpin the income supports people have and is going to unveil this week a July stimulus package, which is designed to support employment, to support incomes and to help businesses to try to survive what is an incredibly tough economic period.  There will be a huge challenge ahead in trying to implement the objectives in the programme for Government at a time when we are in many respects trying to rebuild our country in the context of  the fallout from Covid-19.  Special advisers have a role to play but the Deputy has made some valid points and we will certainly take them on board.</p></speech>

He has put forward a really good question.  I will read the official answer and look forward to engagement on any particular issues he may wish to discuss in the course of this debate.</p><p>Covid-19 has been an unprecedented public health emergency with implications across the economy and society.  For that reason, there has been a whole-of-Government response led by the Department of the Taoiseach and involving all Departments with many other public bodies, including my Department.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has established the Cabinet committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, to assess the social and economic impacts of the potential spread of Covid-19.  The work of the Cabinet committee includes addressing the impacts, mitigation measures and contingencies for cross-sectoral issues which arise in areas beyond the health service, building on the effective public health work undertaken to date.  A whole-of-Government approach to the Covid-19 response requires cohesive decision-making, a partnership approach, expert public health advice and clarity of communications.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the health sector response has been led by the Department of Health and the HSE and questions in this regard are a matter for the Minister for Health.  Due to the nature of its role, my Department has been involved in a number of areas of the overall Government response including but not limited to the following.  There is a whole list of them and I will read a few into record.  My Department has engaged proactively with relevant Departments from an expenditure perspective throughout the crisis and the Deputy will be aware that the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to a number of Votes to meet additional costs, including, for example, in the social protection and health areas.  The crisis has had major implications for employers and staff across the Civil Service and public service and my Department has provided leadership, direction and a collaborative approach to managing the complex issues that have arisen for public service employers.  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer in my Department has worked with other public bodies in the context of the role of digital Government in responding to the crisis.  The Office of Government Procurement in my Department has played an important supporting role in respect of aspects of the public procurement response and there have been many innovative elements to the response to this unprecedented crisis.  My Department&rsquo;s reform office is seeking to capture those and will look to reflect them as appropriate in the next phase of the public service reform programme.</p><p>My Department has also had its own departmental response to the crisis through the implementation of its internal business continuity plan and the move to large-scale remote working.  Lessons have been learned about the value of effective communication and collaboration on cross-cutting issues, the importance of business continuity planning and the effective use of technology, and these will continue to inform the Department&rsquo;s future approach to such issues.  </p><p>In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to the way in which individual public servants and public bodies have responded to this emergency.  The response across all sectors has been immense and I am grateful to all the public servants who have played such an important role.</p></speech>

One of his areas of responsibility is expenditure and its management and oversight.  One of the issues arising in Covid-19, in particular, is the issue of procurement of supply chains.  We have had to run to China and spend inordinate amounts of money to try to secure the supply of PPE, when in fact there are a number of companies in this country which could provide that.  It is time for HSE procurement to take a very different view on this.  The private hospitals deal done recently excluded doctors with private patients and ultimately reduced the amount of capacity we are able to secure.  These are things I would like to see the Minister&rsquo;s Department taking some leadership on.</p>  <p>  There is also the question of indigenous manufacturing.  The Minister is quite right in that his Department is supporting employment, the pandemic unemployment payments and the wage subsidy schemes but what we actually need is procurement into the end SME sector as well.</p></speech>

One of the issues that will have to be considered by Ireland and by Europeans in general is whether we should reduce our reliance on other countries such as China for the provision and manufacturing of essential items that could be required in the event of the pandemic becoming more serious.  We need to become more self-sufficient in respect of critical services and goods for our economy. That is a key issue that I am determined that my Department will play a role in trying to manage.</p> <p>I think our economy will change as a result of Covid-19.  The increase we have seen in remote working and more flexible working will be here to stay to some extent, though not to the extent it is at the moment.  It will be present across the Civil Service and public service.  The aim is that next year we will move towards 20% of working time being remote working from home across the public service.  For many public servants, I think that would be a good change.  The public service has shown an ability to adapt.  It has adapted at a time of great change and has performed exceptionally well.  We need to see that level of flexibility implemented in adopting and putting into effect some of the reforms that are necessary to improve our public services further.</p></speech>

I look forward to engaging with him.  One thing that must be considered is that the State is the largest purchaser in the country.  We have to get far more radical about how we procure services and products in this country.  I point out to the Minister that there is a list of necessary pharmaceuticals, with about 175 in total.  Some 135 are made only in China and India.  We need to consider these things, as other countries do, with regard to securing future supply lines and safety in case of future pandemics and future health risks.  We can hopefully engage and look at that in greater deal in another forum.</p></speech>

The point he has made about essential supplies and securing the supply line is really important.  We will need to reflect carefully on it as we further develop our economic response to Covid-19, because those challenges could emerge again.  Not just Ireland, but many other countries were faced with that reality where much large-scale manufacturing has moved to the Far East.  A dependence has built up and it is a lesson for the entire European Union that needs to be taken on board and put into effect in new policies.  On the procurement issue, I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, when he served in that role previously.  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is keen to continue with the work to open up procurement opportunities for small and medium-sized indigenous businesses in Ireland.  That is a key objective of this Government.  It is reflected in the programme for Government and we are determined to build on the progress that has been made so far in collaboration with all the representative bodies to cut through some of the red tape and open up those procurement opportunities insofar as we can.</p></speech>

I have here a quote from the independent PwC review into this debacle.  It states, "There was a lack of formal planning, strategic direction and preparation in relation to the process by which the GMP would be determined."  Have there been any reforms to the procurement process related to the issue of guaranteed maximum price contracts to ensure that substantial cost overruns will not be borne by the taxpayer in future?</p></reply>

I will give her the written answer and then she can ask questions to follow up.  As Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform I have responsibility for the development of policy to ensure adequate expenditure oversight on capital projects and for public procurement.  The public spending code is the set of rules, procedures and guidance developed to ensure value for money in public expenditure.  It sets out the oversight and approval process for public expenditure proposals, including capital projects.</p>  <p>  All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the national development plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the capital works management framework.  It comprises an integrated set of contractual provisions, procurement templates, procedures and guidance which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.</p>  <p>  The general requirement is that public works projects are to be comprehensively defined prior to tender.  The standard form of public works contract is used on the vast majority of public works projects.  It is a lump sum, fixed-price contract with tightly defined conditions governing price increases and time extensions.  In limited circumstances, a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract may be sought by means of an application to the Government contracts committee for construction.  This process may be used for complex or large projects or for those which have specific requirements which do not naturally fit with the standard forms of contract.</p>  <p>  Since the public works contracts were introduced in 2007, two projects utilising a two stage award process resulting in a guaranteed maximum price have been agreed through this derogation process.  These are the new children's hospital and Dunkettle interchange upgrade works.  Due to the scale of the national children's hospital and the complexity of the Dunkettle project, the early involvement of the contractor, facilitated by these types of contracts, formed part of the risk management strategy.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the contracting authority, but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach than the standard.  It is a matter for the contracting authority and the approving authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regards to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the public spending code.  Accountability for the procurement strategy rests with the contracting authority.</p>  <p>  Significant amendments were made to the public works contracts in 2016 and engagement is currently underway in the Office of Government Procurement on a more comprehensive review of construction procurement.  The latest review of the public spending code was completed in 2019.  The update to this code specifically strengthens the existing guidance to better reflect the realities of project delivery with a particular focus on financial appraisal, cost estimation and risk management.  It will be supplemented by a new governance and assurance process for major projects with an estimated cost of more than &euro;100 million.  This new process will involve an independent, external review of major projects at key stages in the project lifecycle.</p></speech>

It seems to me from the Minister of State's response that there will be some sort of review and report.  Will he outline the areas and the issues that will be examined and confirmed?  Will it be made publicly available and, if so, when?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right to refer to the PwC report from last year.  Its analysis was that the national children's hospital involved a substantial overspend and it pinpointed an underestimation of cost.  It made two recommendations.  One was that we need to strengthen the rules of the public spending code.  Further, it stated that we needed an independent, external review of large projects at every stage, all the way through the project life cycle.  There was somebody outside the contracting Department who could say "Hold on a second, we need to stop here".  Both of those recommendations have happened.  The public spending code was updated last year, in 2019, and I advise the Deputy to have a look at that.  I met with the officials in charge of the public spending code and I am very impressed by their enthusiasm and ability.  Secondly, on large projects of more than &euro;100 million, there will be an external, independent review at all stages of the project life cycle.</p></speech>

It is a pity the PwC report also makes clear that the business case proposal upon which the State based this investment decision contained material errors regarding not adhering to the public spending code, to which the Minister of State alluded.  Will the Minister of State advise why it was not adhered to?  Who is responsible for ensuring it is enforced?  It will be the most expensive hospital in the world.</p></speech>

The shortfalls that were found will be addressed.  With regard to who is responsible, the sponsoring authority that wanted to propose this project is the Department of Health.  The body that sanctioned it, the approving authority, was the Government.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides the public spending code and advice and help to anybody who is undertaking large projects.  The PwC report indicated that it was not enough to rely on the sponsoring authority, which is the contracting authority, to monitor its own projects and that we needed an external, independent review so that someone could review it and say that it is not enough.</p> <p>That is the change that we need.  We have a huge number of projects worth &euro;1 million and more planned as part of the national development plan.  We need a robust control mechanism to make sure those projects do not run over in the way the children's hospital has done, and that we learn from that.</p></speech>

Work on putting the new structures in place is being implemented and involves the drafting of transfer of function orders.  It is expected that this work will be completed in the coming weeks.  In addition, legislation approved by the Government on 13 July will come before the House later this week.  The purpose of this legislation is to establish the new Department of higher education research, innovation and science.</p><p>Hence, I propose to answer this question on the basis of the capital allocations listed in the Revised Estimates Volume published on 19 December 2019, which set out capital expenditure allocations of &euro;8.166 billion for 2020.  The capital allocations were considered to be sufficient to meet the commitments of Departments at that point.</p><p>The following table lists the original departmental Estimates alongside their revised allocations to reflect the need to fund projects and programmes to alleviate the impact of Covid-19 of on our society.  It should also be noted that the allocations shown in the table will be further updated, in the context of the restated Revised Estimates which will be presented in the autumn in line with the new departmental structures and these will reflect the additional capital funding that is being made available as part of the July stimulus measures.  The table shows the original allocations of &euro;8.166 billion, the additional allocation of &euro;742 million, which brings the total of revised allocations to &euro;8.908 billion.</p><p><b>Capital Expenditure Allocations</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Original Allocations           &euro;,m</th>       <th>Revised Allocations        &euro;,m</th>       <th>Increase</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Agriculture,   Food and the Marine</td>       <td>274</td>       <td>294</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation </td>       <td>632</td>       <td>1,115</td>       <td>483</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Children   and Youth Affairs</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Communications,   Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment</td>       <td>382</td>       <td>382</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Culture,   Heritage &amp;amp; the Gaeltacht</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Defence</td>       <td>113</td>       <td>125</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Education   &amp;amp; Skills</td>       <td>922</td>       <td>922</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Employment   Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Finance</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Foreign   Affairs</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health</td>       <td>854</td>       <td>1,074</td>       <td>220</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Housing,   Planning &amp;amp; Local Government</td>       <td>2,240</td>       <td>2,240</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Justice</td>       <td>269</td>       <td>269</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Public   Expenditure and Reform</td>       <td>225</td>       <td>225</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rural   &amp;amp; Community Development</td>       <td>150</td>       <td>150</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Transport,   Tourism &amp;amp; Sport</td>       <td>1,943</td>       <td>1,943</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total   Vote</td>       <td>8,166</td>       <td>8,908</td>       <td>742</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I shall outline some of the issues that led to this growth.

These two families have suffered greatly due to flooding in recent years.  An elderly couple, a husband and wife in their late 70s, live in one of the houses.  Over the past couple of years, when they went to bed in the months of December and January, they were listening to hear if there was a sound of rain falling on the roof.

Unfortunately, the two counties I represent, Cavan and Monaghan, have been adversely impacted on many occasions.  The minor works programme, which provides some funding for local authorities to carry out remedial works is of great benefit and I would like to see the programme expanded.  I put it to the Minister of State that very little of my county, Cavan, is included under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  It shows that we have more incidences of flooding on single, smaller streams and rivers.  I would like to see, if at all possible, additional funding provided for the minor works programme.</p></reply>

In my previous role in the Department, the Deputy routinely asked similar questions to the one he has asked today. I look forward to working with him.</p><p>I am advised that local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each local authority to investigate and address.  In this case, it would be the Cavan and Monaghan county councils.  All local authorities may carry out flood mitigation works, using either their own resources, or by applying for funding under the OPW minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.</p><p>Under this scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each case.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management.  Full details of this scheme are available on<i>www.gov.ie/opw</i>.</p><p>This scheme is a demand-led scheme and is based on the applications received from local authorities, based on the authorities&rsquo; assessment of the individual projects within their areas.  The OPW works in close collaboration with all local authorities and offers any advice required to assist in the determination of these projects.</p><p>The allocation of funding for the minor works scheme is included in the overall allocation for flood risk management investment included under Vote 13 -Office of Public Works, in the Estimates for Public Services for 2020.</p></reply>

Cavan County Council has identified 11 sites that require urgent attention.  If the Minister of State could ensure that the applications are approved, the overall cost to the OPW would be less than &euro;300,000.  Up to 60 households would benefit from such improvement or remedial works.  Some people have to leave their homes at stages during the winter and others do not have access to their homes or farms.  Up to 60 households are directly affected and if the remedial works were undertaken these people would have their lives transformed, literally, in going about their daily business, especially in winter time.  The Minister of State will agree that spending less than &euro;300,000 of public expenditure to benefit up to 60 families would be a good return and it would try to ensure that these people have some normality during the winter months.</p></speech>

I am sure he will appreciate that I cannot make commitments on the floor of the D&aacute;il with regard to the spending of OPW money.  From my time as a county councillor, as a backbencher and as a Minister of State in two Departments up to now, I am aware that the engagement between local authorities and the OPW at a local level is crucial in advancing cases, including such cases as those referred to by the Deputy, as well as others.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to a particular area of Cavan being particularly susceptible to flooding and that a lot of the county is not included under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act.  It was for that reason - and I know the Deputy will appreciate it - that the scheme he referenced is of such importance.  In order to advance these and other cases that the Deputy might have in respect of Cavan and Monaghan, the most important thing is that engagement takes place between the local engineering staff of the councils and the OPW.  If there are particular issues that the Deputy wants to bring to my attention, I will follow up on them with the OPW directly on his behalf.</p></speech>

I have attended meetings, along with other public representatives, between the council and the OPW and have seen that good co-operation.  I would like to ensure the applications are progressed as quickly as possible.  We have a larger scale project which would benefit Cavan town and its surrounds.  It would come under the CFRAM, catchment flood risk assessment and management, programme.</p>  <p>  Over the next two years, I hope the Minister of State will ensure additional funding is provided to that particular scheme because of the benefits it could bring to many households.  As I said earlier, it could change the lifestyle of those affected in the areas in question.  Some older people actually leave their homes during the months when the areas are susceptible to flooding.  We have to ensure that people are not discommoded to that extent as much as is possible.  That type of small-scale financial investment can mean so much to many families and communities.</p></speech>

The State&rsquo;s office accommodation portfolio is large and geographically dispersed.  It currently comprises 543 buildings of various sizes totalling an estimated 888,000 sq. m of accommodation of which 61%, 542,000 sq. m is in owned buildings with the balance of 39%, 346,000 sq. m leased.  Up to 52% of office accommodation is in Dublin with 48% spread throughout the rest of the country.</p>  <p>  In managing the portfolio, the OPW actively seeks best value for money in response to requests for accommodation from Departments and State agencies.  Decisions taken on whether to lease, build or purchase accommodation have regard to several factors in order the optimum property solution can be achieved in each case.  The main factors are the operational requirements of client Departments and agencies, availability of capital for investment, property market trends, availability of sites for development and the timescale within which a solution has to be delivered.</p>  <p>  Arising from the 2018 spending review paper on OPW spending on State rents, a follow-on expenditure review is being undertaken by the OPW and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is focussing on the balance between capital and current expenditure within the OPW&rsquo;s estate management function.  The review involves research into the current models for providing office accommodation and their long-term costs.</p>  <p>  I envisage that the review, when completed, will make a valuable contribution to policy in this area and will provide an enhanced evidence base for managing the State office accommodation portfolio into the future.  I expect the review will be completed over the coming months and will be published later this year.</p></reply>

It was very specific.  I have the utmost respect for the OPW which does a tremendous job.  It has a portfolio of over 2,000 buildings, divided between Garda stations, heritage sites, offices for rent and storage spaces.</p>  <p>  There is always room for improvement, however.  Some of the weaknesses highlighted were from its own internal review at the time.  One was the lack of data on the numbers of buildings and so on it had.  That was also identified in the spending review.  With the absence of data, no decisions can be made properly on policy.  Everything was identified in that review for which we paid money.</p>  <p>  I know all of the criteria depend on the Department's numbers such as building type, occupation density, the average rent and cost per square metre.  What precise action was taken on the various recommendations from the spending review?  The Minister of State gave me one but no date for the publication.</p></speech>

However, I will prioritise this during my tenure in the Department.  I have only entered the Department in the past ten days.  From my previous time on the Committee of Public Accounts, I know this issue constantly arose, particular concerning the balance between rent and purchase or build.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that on rent alone, the OPW rental bill has dropped considerably.  Annual rental costs in 2019 were approximately &euro;97 million for 350,000 sq. m.  In 2010, rental costs stood at &euro;128 million.  We are making progress.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's point about the determination as to whether we want a model of more rental or more construction, the report made specific references to the benefits of both, particularly when Departments and agencies may have short-term needs which we might not be able to fulfil over a short period.  It is worth noting that the OPW has several projects in office accommodation in Dublin city that are well advanced.  We are trying to ensure they are brought to fruition as quickly as possible to reduce the overall requirement for rental properties.  It should ensure that we will be able to deliver the best possible office accommodation in the shortest period.</p>  <p>  If there are specific points the Deputy wants me to come back on, I can do so in writing.</p></speech>

However, the purpose of these reports is to ensure continuity, regardless of who is in government or how long they are in power.</p>  <p>  The spending review in question was undertaken specifically to look at the OPW and its whole portfolio of rented properties.  I am personally in favour of acquiring or constructing buildings.  It makes no sense that we are paying out nearly &euro;100 million per year in rents.  The Government and the OPW should be right there i l&aacute;r an aonaigh, in the middle of the market, acquiring properties.</p>  <p>  When weaknesses were identified, as were reported to the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2019, and this spending area was done, we must be seen to take action and justify this high level of rental costs as opposed to owning the buildings.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier in my reply, the decisions on whether we lease or build must have regard to several different factors.  I referred to two of them, namely the operational requirements of the Departments and agencies.  Many of them will come to the table with different and peculiar demands in a short period which we might not be able to fulfil.</p>  <p>  Availability of capital over a short period is another factor.  When one stacks up the business case, one must decide whether it is proportionate to go one route or another.</p>  <p>  I do not disagree with the Deputy that it is more desirable for the Government to own most of the properties on which it depends.  It is worth referring to the statistics on the percentage of offices owned versus those rented, as well as those offices in Dublin versus outside of Dublin.  I would have thought the figure for offices in Dublin would have been much higher when it is actually 50:50.  This is a point we can address from a regional point of view.</p>  <p>  The cost benefit of rent versus ownership is a matter that the Department will be coming back to when the current report is finished.  When that review is completed, I have no difficulty in sitting down with the Deputy or the new Oireachtas finance committee to go through what is the best course of action to take for our stock of accommodation to meet the demands of our civil and public services.</p></speech>

Strategic public procurement can play a key role in responding to societal, environmental and economic challenges.  Therefore, the inclusion of strategic public policy considerations in procurement processes is a key feature of the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has been actively engaged in putting in place the necessary process and policies that are designed to encourage SME access to public procurement opportunities.  In this regard, the OGP developed circular 10/14, entitled "Initiatives to Assist SMEs in Public Procurement".  Under the circular, public bodies are required to advertise all contracts for supplies and services with an estimated value of &euro;25,000, exclusive of VAT, and upwards on eTenders, the national tendering platform.  This means that as many businesses and SMEs as possible are aware of tendering opportunities.  Indeed, the latest analysis carried out by the OGP indicates that 94% of procurement opportunities are secured by Irish businesses, with more than 50% of those being classified as SMEs.</p>  <p>  I understand that an increase in the public procurement threshold was considered by the SME advisory group.  The group meets on a quarterly basis so that the voice of SMEs can be heard by the Government and the OGP.  The group's membership consists of officials from the OGP, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland, IBEC, the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and Chambers Ireland.  The issue was discussed, with members being invited to submit their views to the OGP.  It was clear from the discussion and the formal views expressed that the majority of members were against increasing the advertising threshold.  The OGP also took account of analysis of data on eTenders in its findings and decided in June 2018 that, taking openness and transparency into consideration, the current advertising threshold of &euro;25,000, exclusive of VAT, should be maintained.</p>  <p>  The thresholds for advertising on eTenders will be kept under review in light of the impact on operational efficiency, value for money and accessibility to business opportunities, particularly for the SME sector.  The OGP is continuing to monitor the issue in consultation with the SME advisory group and will continue to engage with business proactively in order to enhance the significant measures and strategies already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></speech>

The threshold of &euro;25,000 has not been increased for at least ten years.  In 2011, Deputies from all parties, including Government ones, set up a group in the House to see whether something could be done to increase the public procurement threshold.  We spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who had responsibility for this matter at one time.  The issue mostly had to do with supplying services to schools.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, referred to 94% of opportunities going to Ireland-based companies, but many of those could be internationals with offices in Ireland.  That is what was happening.</p>  <p>  The main issue facing small businesses is the rates they pay local authorities, but they cannot sell so much as a biro to those authorities.  Instead, we often see large container lorries coming along to supply local authorities, the HSE and other public offices.  The local shop in the town or village cannot supply them.  The same issue obtains in respect of schools.  As far as I am aware, one company is supplying most schools.  There are small companies trying to sell little bits to schools, for example, chalk and cardboard.  They are the ones being asked to sponsor various events in schools and the big multinationals get away without doing that.  The whole issue needs to be examined.</p></speech>

I met the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, at the start of my tenure and discussed this issue with him.  He impressed on me the importance of the SME advisory group and that there was a perception that it was difficult for SMEs to get contracts despite the fact that 54% of the contract value awarded by the OGP went to SMEs.  We must keep engaging with SME representatives and ask them what we need to change.  I am told that, from the previous engagement, it was clear that they did not want to change the &euro;25,000 threshold.</p>  <p>  There may be other measures that can be taken.  I intend to maintain the engagement that the Minister of State had with SMEs.  The next time we convene the advisory group, I would be happy to take Deputy Grealish's concerns to it for discussion.  With businesses under so much stress after the pandemic in particular, they need new contracts.  There is a large amount of Government spending occurring at the moment, and it is important that those businesses have a fair shot at getting those contracts.</p></speech>

During one of our committee meetings on this issue at which officials from the office of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, were in attendance, it was put to us and the groups appearing before us that four or five businesses should get together and tender as group.  That would not work, though.  There could not be four or five businesses in the same town tendering for something.  How would the contract be divided between them?</p>  <p>  The SME sector is responsible for employing more than 1 million people and it is important that we afford SMEs every opportunity and Government support possible.  Reviewing the threshold could be of help to many SMEs in getting back up and running.</p></speech>

I am new to this position and am willing to review with the OGP the &euro;25,000 threshold and any other existing condition to ensure that SMEs have a fair opportunity to win contracts.  I want to engage in communication, education and anything that we need to do in order to train people up, advise them on why they are not winning contracts, and ensure that the process is fair across the country and SMEs have a fair shot in competitions with larger companies and internationals.  If there is any way that I can co-operate with Deputy Grealish or any other Deputy, I intend to do so.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, who has had to leave for a Cabinet sub-committee meeting.  He asked me to take these questions on his behalf.</p>  <p>  Managing expenditure within allocations is the responsibility of every Department and its Minister.  Significant additional expenditure has been allocated to a number of Departments over the past number of months.  While we find ourselves in an unprecedented situation due to Covid-19, all of the usual measures remain in place in terms of the sanctioning and management of expenditure.</p>  <p>  The Revised Estimates Volume, REV, for 2020, which was published in December 2019, set out an overall allocation of &euro;70.4 billion in gross voted expenditure for the year.  Taking into account the additional expenditure agreed by the D&aacute;il for Covid-19 measures, the revised Government expenditure ceiling now stands at &euro;79.7 billion.  This includes an additional &euro;6.8 billion for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, nearly &euro;2 billion for the Department of Health and &euro;483 million for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  In addition, further measures have been announced by the Government in response to the Covid-19 crisis, including the decision to extend the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme to August.  At this stage, it is estimated that, based on decisions to the end of June, the overall increase relative to the allocations set out in REV 2020 arising from Covid-19 is almost &euro;12 billion.  In addition, supports are to be announced as part of the July stimulus plan and further spending may be required to support key sectors as the year progresses.</p>  <p>  A number of reconfigurations of Departments are in progress.  When work on all transfers of functions and related allocations is complete, restated Estimates will be presented to the D&aacute;il reflecting the new departmental structures and their allocations.  These Estimates will reflect decisions on additional funding to respond to Covid-19, including that set out in the July stimulus.  Over the coming months, it will be important that Departments manage within the allocations set out in these Estimates.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with budget 2021, a national economic plan will be published setting out the Government's long-term approach to restoring employment and outlining how we will secure our public finances.  As the economy returns to growth and employment is restored, it is important that the deficit be reduced year on year to underpin the sustainability of the finances.  To achieve this aim, a sustainable medium-term expenditure framework will be pursued that provides a clear pathway back to a balanced budget.  Throughout this process, the Government will prioritise policy actions that protect the most vulnerable and put in place new measures for economic decision making that reflect the welfare and quality of life of those living in Ireland.</p></speech>

To what degree does he foresee the Government's ability to monitor the various Departments' demands in the first instance as well as the possible shortfall in available resources in view of the fact that changes in the economy, market and so on may take place in the meantime?

The Department of Finance data for this quarter and forecasts for the remainder of the year and spending will be as accurate as is possible.  While we have seen a significant reduction in regard to those claiming one or other of the supports put in place for the pandemic, which is very welcome, our economy continues to be in a very vulnerable situation.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, and the wider Government will have to take this into consideration as they approach the preparations for the budget, discussions around which will begin as soon as the D&aacute;il resumes following the recess.</p>  <p>  On the specific elements of the Deputy's question, we will probably be able to get a better picture of the emerging situation once the new Departments have been configured and are able to present their own policy initiatives to the D&aacute;il, together with their legislative platform.  Together with the figures produced by the Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office in particular as to how our economy is likely to progress between now and the end of the year, the data the Deputy is requesting will become clearer at that stage.</p></speech>

The public spending code is one of the mechanisms the Government will have at its disposal in relation to the amount of moneys being spent.  The ongoing monitoring within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of the individual Votes from this House to each of the Departments gives it an indication as to outturn not only annually but across the year as well.  On the Deputy's question of Government being able to foresee anything of the nature of the pandemic it is hoped we are in the process of coming through, the response is "No".</p>  <p>  On the capital element of the Deputy's question, in response to an earlier question on public contracts, particularly our built contracts, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, made the point that in the context of the roll-out of the national development plan and identification of the major projects under that plan, each Department and State agency is being required by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on foot of reviews carried out by it, to ensure that outturn is proportionate to budget.  As the Deputy rightly stated, there have been a number of incidents in the not-too-distant past that were not satisfactory, to put it mildly.  Managing outturn is a challenge and the Government is taking it very seriously.</p></speech>

Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l is one of two UNESCO world heritage sites in the Republic of Ireland.  I welcome that a review is under way by the OPW in regard to the reopening of this site for the remainder of the 2020 tourism season.  I thank the Minister of State for being so proactive on this matter to date.  I am seeking an update on the review and I ask the Minister of State to expedite it because this site is one of the cornerstones of tourism in south Kerry and it would be helpful if a way forward could be found.</p></reply>

I know that this is an issue he feels strongly about because he raised it with me in the immediate aftermath of my appointment.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the OPW announced earlier this year that the Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l visitor site would not open at the scheduled date of 16 May because of Covid 19 concerns.  In the context of the significant restrictions in place throughout the country at the time, the decision was not wholly unexpected.  While it was greeted with general regret, it was broadly accepted that opening the Island to visitors was not feasible on safety grounds.</p>  <p>  Some weeks on, things have changed significantly as Government has announced an accelerated timeframe for reopening the country.   We can all see the changes around us and sense the pace picking up as society and businesses get back to normal.  In this context, it is appropriate that the position at Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l would be reviewed.  The OPW has, therefore, recently started a formal review of the Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l closure and it is going through a process to reassess all of the risks and see if they can be mitigated to the extent that an opening might be feasible.</p>  <p>  There are two main elements to the visitor journey at Skellig.  The first is the boat trip, which is delivered by local boatmen, and the second is the on-island experience, where visitors land on the pier and make their way to the monastic remains on the summit of the island.  These two aspects have to be analysed fully, and should either fail the crucial safety test, it may not be possible to make a positive decision.  My officials have been in touch with the Skellig Boatmen's Association within the past two weeks and have sought its formal input into this process, understanding that they, not the OPW, are in charge of safety on passenger vessels and must be consulted, which Deputy Griffin, as a local representative would know.  Separately, the OPW is also carrying out a thorough risk assessment of the visitor journey on the island to examine all aspects afresh.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the iconic place that the Skelligs hold in Irish tourism and its importance to south Kerry in particular, and as a former Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, I would be anxious to ensure that all our heritage assets perform to support our tourism economy.  However, we will have to be guided first and foremost by safety concerns.  I can assure the House that the review will be as thorough as possible in that respect.</p></speech>

I again emphasise how grateful I am that he is being so proactive on this matter and that the review is under way.  With the acceleration of the roadmap the overall situation is evolving.  I welcome that the OPW position is evolving alongside it.  It is important to state on the record that safety and health considerations have to be to the fore in this matter.  However, I ask the Minister of State to ensure every effort is made to ensure the health and safety recommendations and preconditions are factored into the economic need.  It is hoped that a middle ground can be found such that the site can reopen safely.  If this could be done, it would be a massive boost to the area.  The area has already faced huge challenges in the past couple of difficult years and in the context of Brexit.  This current challenge is a hammer blow to the area.  If the site could be reopened, even for the August, September and October, it would be a boost to the entire economy of the area and, in particular, the people who are directly involved in enterprises directly related to the Skelligs.  I again thank the Minister of State and I look forward to the outcome of the review.  If it could be completed as speedily as possible it would be advantageous to everybody involved.</p></speech>

I have asked the Chairman of the Office of Public Works to review its decision in regard to this site.  We are taking the matter very seriously.  It is hoped that the review process will be completed before the end of July, which is only a couple of days away.  It is worth pointing out that the Skelligs is unique in terms of its UNESCO status and in terms of access, which is through collaboration between the Office of Public Works and the local boatmen who have to be consulted.  There are a range of views within that cohort of people as well that we have to taken on board.  It is also worth pointing out that because of its uniqueness and its location in the Atlantic, which can be very wild, up to 40% of tourist days in any season can often be lost due to bad weather.  We are conscious of the need for social distancing.  We have to operate within the Government guidelines and to be cognisant of the staff manning the boats and those who are responsible for the Skelligs.</p> <p>We also have to be cognisant of our wider role as custodians of a national monument that has a particular economic and tourism potential, not only for south Kerry but for the wider country.  As Minister of State with responsibility for it, I am very conscious of it, together with the commissioners of the OPW to ensure the best possible presentation of our national monuments and heritage sites, not only Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l but the others too, especially in the context of what remains of the tourism season for 2020.</p></speech>

As someone who once held the junior Ministry with responsibility for tourism, the Minister of State gets this and knows what it is about.  In fairness to him, he was on the matter as soon as he was appointed.  For people I have spoken to in south Kerry, it has been very well received that he is prepared to examine the matter and give it his time.  People want to feel that there is a fair hearing and that the issue is given every objective consideration.  That is the main thing.  If that is done here, people will be prepared to take whatever outcome is found to be the suitable way forward.</p>  <p>  It would, of course, be preferable that there is the option for those businesses in a position to bring people to the Skelligs to go ahead and do so.  It may not be suitable for certain people to do that and I know that it is not quite as straightforward as people just getting back up and running and going back into business.  When the season is so short, economies of scale are lost and business plans have to be radically altered.  Even if the site reopens, it may not be the case that every boatman will avail of the opportunity to go, but it would be marvellous if people at least had the option.</p>  <p>  I am very grateful to the Minister of State for his work on the issue.  He was on it immediately, which is very encouraging.</p></speech>

As I have been calling for the reopening of Skellig Michael for some time, I am glad to support Deputy Griffin in his question.  The entire area of south Kerry is being adversely affected by the ongoing closure of Skellig Michael.  Portmagee, Valentia, Ballinskelligs, Cahersiveen and Waterville greatly depend on this major attraction being open.  As has been said, it is vital that we reopen it for the rest of the tourism season.</p>  <p>  One of the problems is insurance for the boatmen and the cost of the insurance.  Just as the Government has supported other businesses in other ways, it is vital that it makes some financial contribution to the cost of insurance for the boatmen if it is to be got up and running.</p></speech>

A number of sites have closed and Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l is not the only one.  Sites in Galway, Wexford, Laois, Clare, Dublin, Wicklow, Meath, Tipperary and Kildare are also closed.  They are closed on the basis of health and safety, which is important to point out to the House.  We have to be conscious of the potential of the virus to spread because we cannot maintain social distancing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to insurance.  Insurance is an element for the boatmen but our concern has to be the protection of the people who work on a site or visit it.  We have to ensure that if we open a site, we do so in the knowledge that the likelihood of people contracting the virus is minimised or eliminated.  The OPW is responsible for this building, for instance.  There are no members of the public here any more, for the same reason.  We have to ensure we can operate our sites safely and, before we bring people in, that they will be safe.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Griffin's point, I am supportive in general of the concept of trying to open as many sites as possible.  I will keep him up to date on the specifics of Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l.  I cannot currently comment further but I am committed to examining whether we can get some sort of roadmap, if not for this year then certainly for next year.</p></speech>

I am pleased that in recent correspondence from the previous Government received by the Labour Party, there is a commitment to honouring the next and final phase of the public sector pay deal that is currently in place.  The programme for Government commits to this Administration seeking to negotiate a new deal with public sector trade unions.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State provide details on the engagement that he, or the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, or departmental officials have had to date with the public sector committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?

I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 28 together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the current public sector pay agreement, the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, will expire at the end of the year.  The agreement was passed into law by the House in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 and we have committed to honouring the agreement in full.  The final commitment under this agreement is to a 2% increase in salaries, due on 1 October.  This will be made as scheduled under the 2017 Act.  Proceeding with the payment is both in recognition of the contribution that public servants have made in dealing with the public health emergency and a demonstration of our commitment to collective agreements.  It demonstrates the Government's belief in the benefits of a collective approach to public service industrial relations.  The Public Service Stability Agreement has allowed us as a Government to dismantle the financial emergency legislation while providing certainty in our fiscal planning.  I think most people would agree it has served us well.</p>  <p>  The House will also be aware that within the programme for Government, as Deputy Nash noted, there is a commitment to seeking to negotiate a new agreement with the public service unions.  Our approach to any engagement, however, will need to take full account of the State's current financial circumstances and outlook.  The Minister looks forward to engaging with the public service unions on these matters in the coming months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100032#FF01000"><p>The Minister of State stated, "Proceeding with the payment is both in recognition of the contribution that public servants have made in dealing with the public health emergency".  I do not necessarily agree.  It is simply a case of honouring an agreement that the Government is duty bound to honour with public and civil servants throughout the country.  I nonetheless welcome the commitment to the principle of collective agreements in managing the public service in future and engaging with the public sector trade unions on that basis for pay reform and other matters.</p>  <p>  If the pandemic tells us anything, it is that only the State has the power and authority to work collectively when push comes to shove to keep us all safe and well.  I hope that rather than simply applauding them, lighting candles for them or getting pictures taken for social media, as Ministers lined up to do in recent months, to thank and express our gratitude to healthcare assistants, radiographers, laboratory technicians, doctors, nurses and teachers we will ensure that the approach we take properly values the contribution that public servants make to our society.</p>  <p>  It should be remembered that not all public servants are well paid.  Many earn below what might be considered the hourly rate of the living wage.  If we are to talk about a living wage, the Government needs to lead by example and ensure that the few thousand public servants who do not garner an income that would qualify as a living wage are addressed in the context of public sector pay negotiations that may occur in the next few months.</p></speech>

We committed to that in the programme for Government and no timeframe has yet been laid out within which the Minister will enter into negotiations with unions.  He has committed to the House that he intends to do it in the coming months.  The next budget is only around the corner and we all know that when the recess finishes in September, discussions on that will get under way immediately.  There needs to be a successor to the agreement, which served us well.  It was negotiated against a difficult backdrop and in good faith, as has been demonstrated.</p> <p>Both sides, and not just the Government, have acted in good faith and come to the table responsibly.  The agreement has been demonstrated, across all elements of the public sector, to have been in the best interests of the public, which the public sector serves.  We are all public servants.</p> <p> Deputy Nash is correct that nobody has a monopoly on concern when it comes to front-line workers.  Many of us have family members working on the front line.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, was established to bring together representatives of employers and trade unions with Ministers to exchange views on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market and which are of mutual concern.</p>  <p>  The Government has not been prescriptive about what organisations have a seat at the LEEF but has left the decision to the lead representative bodies in the respective areas.  The labour delegation is organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and generally contains representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, F&oacute;rsa and the Nevin Economic Institute.  The employer delegation is organised by IBEC and generally contains representatives from IBEC, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation.</p>  <p>  The Minister notes the strong programme for Government commitments to the broader question of social dialogue.  As a Government, we are interested in new models of sectoral engagement and will utilise public consultations and citizens' assemblies, while strengthening existing mechanisms such as the national economic dialogue and the LEEF.</p>  <p>  I will address the second part of the question, which relates to access for SMEs to Department of Finance officials.  I have inquired with the Department of Finance and I am informed that officials engage with business representative bodies on an ongoing basis and have attended various events in this regard over the years.  The most recent of these engagements was a meeting of the SME and State bodies group that was jointly chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance on 10 July 2020, which was also attended by all the business representative groups as well as officials.  This is a programme for Government commitment and is focusing on the challenges facing our SMEs as the economy reopens.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Finance conducts a survey of more than 1,500 SMEs, the largest of its kind in the country, on a biannual basis to understand issues facing SMEs, especially relating to access to credit and related matters.  Finally, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform also indicates that representatives of ISME have been invited to and attend the national economic dialogue every year since it started in 2015.  All organisations are welcome to make pre-budget submissions to be considered as part of the budgetary process.</p></speech>

He mentioned an engagement on 10 July but I spoke about a lack of engagement that has gone on for many months, and even longer than that.  ISME represents approximately 700,000 employees, which is quite a large portion of our smaller employers.  That group finds it very difficult to get any access and I referenced the unavailability of senior departmental officials to ISME representatives and hence smaller businesses.  I point out that IBEC is a far larger grouping and a large number of its members would be considered larger employers with 40, 50 or more employees.</p>  <p>  The people operating small businesses in this country need to have a voice on the LEEF.  Some of the prescriptive arrangements to come from the LEEF, particularly with regard to employment law, taxation, etc., are forced on to smaller SMEs.  They are entitled to have a voice and I hope the Government will facilitate that in the near future.</p></speech>

I will communicate his point to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  I know it is a commitment by this Government, as it was with the previous Government, that SMEs would have access.  I know the former Minister with responsibility for enterprise, Deputy Heather Humphreys, facilitated access and the current T&aacute;naiste is doing so as well.  My old role which involved dealing with procurement has been taken over by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and I wish him well in his portfolio.  Representatives of ISME had regular access both to me and senior officials in the Office of Government Procurement.  A particular matter can be communicated either through my office or directly to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  As I stated at the outset, both the labour and employer delegation were laid out by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC.  My understanding is that this is the normal practice.  If there is a particular problem that Deputy Shanahan wants to raise but does not want to do it in the D&aacute;il, I have no difficulty in referring it back to the Minister.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for taking the question this afternoon.</p>  <p>  There is a 360 ha site in Cherrywood that is a strategic development zone in Dublin, in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It has a rich history, with several ancient monuments, buildings, ruins of the Tully church and two stone crosses.  Given the construction of the new town centre and associated housing in the area, will the Minister confirm what role the Office of Public Works, OPW, has in the preservation and protection of those historic buildings, the monuments and artifacts within that strategic development zone?  What are the plans of the OPW both during the construction and after construction?</p></reply>

As he states, the Office of Public Works is responsible for the maintenance and operation of a defined list of approximately 700 sites in the State.  Some of these include properties like Newgrange, Kilmainham Gaol and Dublin Castle, which are well known and visited by significant numbers of international tourists every year.  However, most of the locations managed by the OPW are not as prominent and are located across the country, many in rural locations.  The sites managed by the OPW are national monuments in the main and there are also certain prominent historical properties.  Within the general Cherrywood area identified in the question, the OPW has one national monument site only, which is Monkstown Castle, in its care.</p>  <p>  As an executive agency with the very specific remit I have described, OPW has no responsibility more generally for heritage sites, historic buildings, monuments or artifacts that lie outside of the 700 listed locations and which are, therefore, not in its direct care.  Policy matters more generally, including protection measures around Ireland's heritage properties nationally, legislation, enforcement of breaches of the National Monuments Acts and the response to planning applications near listed historic sites is the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, soon to be the Department of housing, local government and heritage, and the OPW has no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The OPW heritage services has not been directly involved or consulted in the creation of the Cherrywood strategic development zone and has not been assigned any specific responsibilities or duties within planning law arising from it.  The OPW is not responsible at a national level for the protection of heritage, generally, and we are instead focused solely on sites and priorities within our remit.  Previously, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht had responsibility for addressing the protection of Ireland's cultural assets more broadly.  The Department's national monuments service has been unclear, however, in recent days about its specific roles and powers at Cherrywood and refused last week to take this parliamentary question from us.  I have also been unsuccessful in getting it disallowed arising from the fact there is no function for the Office of Public Works.  It is a double-whammy for Deputy Devlin.</p>  <p>  Given our lack of responsibility in this area, the response to the question is relatively bare, unfortunately, and I have not been able to find out who, if anybody, is responsible for addressing heritage concerns in this area.  I assume in the absence of other information, in the normal course, the Department dealing with housing will continue to hold this function.  Although I have scant information, I expect the protection of heritage and other vital assets to be addressed in planning measures to be applied at Cherrywood.  However, I can find no categoric information to that effect and the people who should know are not clear on the subject.  That is of no benefit to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I suggest in these circumstances that the Minister would be circumspect about who exactly has responsibility for heritage protection.  When the reconfiguration of the new Department is finished, I will endeavour to find out who is responsible for this, if anybody.  It may even be the local authority but I do not know.  We will try to find out and assist the Deputy.</p></speech>

This highlights the point that these historical monuments, artifacts and buildings at Cherrywood are in real danger.  I acknowledge the work of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and, as its cathaoirleach in 2017, I tried to propose a committee at the council involving the National Monuments Service, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the council and other agencies such as the OPW.  That was not forthcoming.</p> <p>I know now from that response the reason that was the case.  However, I want to highlight for the Minister of State, and I appreciate his work on it, that according to a noted historian, Brian Mac Aongusa, Tully Church was the site of an early Christian community founded in the 6th century, which operated for almost 1,000 years until it fell into ruin in 1613.  The elements of the current building date to the 12th century and include important elements of Norman architecture, including a perfectly preserved Romanesque chancel arch.  The site is also the location of two standing stone crosses thought to date from the 10th century.  It is of utmost importance that we find out which Department is engaging with the county council because in recent correspondence I received from D&uacute;n-Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council I have been informed that geophysical surveys were to be undertaken and on-site meetings were to take place.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could ask his officials to confirm the number of on-site visits that have taken place and keep me informed of the progress on-site.</p></speech>

If we have a role in this, we want to be clear with the Deputy and the D&aacute;il, but the wider question he has raised is something I am already attuned to, which is the ownership of the monuments versus those who manage, protect and oversee them.  There is an issue in that respect that I would like to see cleared up.  The Deputy raises a very particular point that the transfer of responsibility for these areas, particularly the 700 sites that are on the schedule I referred to, from one Department to another when those Departments are broken up and changed is not helpful.  The one constant is the OPW and our role, but unfortunately, as new Departments emerge, we will have new linkages and relationships that we will have to try to rebuild.  It would be much easier if there was clarity regarding the management, ownership and ongoing protection of them.  It is a discussion I have already started with the Minister of State, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and it is an issue I hope we can get finality on in the coming days.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.393.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100034#HH00400"><p>I want to raise with the Minister of State the potential that exists from flood prevention embankments, for example, and other infrastructure across the country doubling as walking and cycling infrastructure.  We have referenced this in the greenways strategy, but it is an area on which I believe we can do a great deal of work.  We often look at flood prevention works and the infrastructure that is needed as money that has to be spent without a return, but there could be a huge return for communities and for the Exchequer if we double up that infrastructure and use it for walking and cycling tourism and as amenities.  Some embankments are already in use for that purpose.  In my locality, the River Maine embankment is used as part of the Keel uphill-downhill loop walk, for example, but across the country there is enormous potential to do a great deal for walking and cycling through doubling up this infrastructure.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on it.</p></reply>

I have a very short reply but if he asks a supplementary question it might improve matters.  The provision of walkways and cycleways is a matter for local authorities and the OPW does not have any function in the role.  The OPW is responsible for the maintenance of embankments that form part of arterial drainage schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  The embankments are not in State ownership but are on lands that are for the most part privately owned.  Also, the embankments were not designed or constructed to cater for such cycleways or walkways.  Therefore, the provision of cycleways or walkways on such embankments is not feasible.  In respect of embankments that might form part of future OPW-funded flood relief schemes, the OPW is happy to work actively with any local authorities that wish to explore opportunities for the provision, where feasible, of added value elements such as cycling and walking within the development of flood defence structures.</p></reply>

Regarding the future, something that is designed from a bespoke point of view can be used for two purposes but some of the existing embankments, for example, are already in use for walking purposes.  One of the commitments in the programme for Government is the development of consultation with communities on the development of the wild Atlantic walkway.  Some of the existing embankments could play a major part in rolling out that particular new product for the entire country.  It would be very helpful if the OPW would engage with other partners in government and other agencies with a view to seeing how that could work.  Also, through the OPW some fantastic relationships with landowners have been built up over the years, and that healthy relationship could be very helpful in getting a consensus approach to developing our tourism and amenity offering further, especially along the western seaboard but across the country by our riverbanks and on the east coast, which experiences flooding issues.  It is an opportunity, particularly in the context of where we are currently, because the great outdoors will become more important in the time ahead and it would be an area that would be fantastic to progress in the next couple of years.</p></speech>

A commitment I will make is to explore this further.  It is accepted that the existing and the older defences, which would be the traditional ones we are all used to seeing throughout the country, might not have the capability to have any sort of walking or cycling infrastructure placed on top of them.  However, in terms of some of the newer ones, this is something that could possibly go in at a very early stage in the design, and the public consultation element, with the Office of Public Works.  We have many flood defences in planning, some of which are in the early stage of design, with more of them being fairly advanced.  I will ask my officials, especially in respect of those at a very early stage, to see if we can get some sort of collaboration on this, together with local authorities.  Ultimately, there may be some sort of collaboration that can be done and, one never knows, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, under Deputy Eamon Ryan, might be able to help us also with some of the funding of it, which will always be welcome.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, some of the newer infrastructure could be designed in such a way that it would be perfect to cater for those additional needs, but some of the older infrastructure can be used also.  I gave the example from the main arterial drainage scheme in my locality close to where I live and where I often walk.  We have a fantastic amenity in the Keel uphill-downhill loop walk, which is along that old Maine river embankment.  We have many of those throughout the country.  That was done through consultation with the landowners following which a consensus was agreed.  My vision is that we would get all of these pieces of infrastructure, which fantastic people built over the decades, working for the wider community but also that the landowners, with their full consensus, would be able to gain from this financially in that there may be financial support for landowners through various schemes across different Departments.  That would be a very pro-rural step forward but it would also be something that would set us aside internationally as a destination for walking and cycling.</p></speech>

Any changes to the way the Office of Public Works would go about the design and roll-out of any kind of flood embankment would have to include the local community, particularly those on whose lands they are based because there would not only be a flood defence put in place but also a public right of way.  This is not something we would simply be able to make happen.  It would involve, as I said in my first response, a detailed planning and consultation process.  However, it is something worthy of consideration, especially the size, location and number of these embankments that will be required as the State finishes out the national development plan up to 2026.  Perhaps a collaboration between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Office of Public Works can be arrived at in conjunction with the local authorities and the local landowners, while there could be also some cost and burden sharing.</p> <p>It is certainly something I would consider, as would the Office of Public Works, OPW.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100036#LL00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to bring forward the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020.  This is another important piece of legislation that is part of the Government's efforts to help the wider enterprise sector meet the enormous challenges presented by Covid-19.  I thank our colleagues for their co-operation in helping to bring the Bill to the House this week so that we can get through it as quickly as we possibly can.  We have discussed this as part of the debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Act 2020.  I thank colleagues for their co-operation on that measure too.  It is important we respond as quickly as we possibly can to the needs of businesses and employees who want to get up and running and sustain their jobs.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this Bill is to make certain amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, as amended, in order to help businesses access essential finance through their banks and other financial institutions.  Finance is needed as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, which as we all know is having a devastating effect on communities, villages and towns in every county.  It is having an impact on jobs and businesses and we are responding in numerous ways with many interventions.  The Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020 will really help us to facilitate that response and help us to help those businesses that need our help.</p>  <p>  I will start by explaining why this Bill is so necessary.  Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on all parts of our society and our economy since early this year.  Our enterprise sector has been dealt a severe blow.  Many businesses have had to close their doors for months, with revenues drying up overnight.  Hundreds of thousands of people are out of work and many are seeing their wages reduced.  We continue to introduce measures to avoid mass unemployment and a wave of insolvencies.</p>  <p>  Due the unprecedented nature of the shock to the business environment caused by the outbreak of Covid-19, my Department and its agencies have worked hard to help businesses in meeting the enormous challenges presented by the pandemic both locally and globally.  Apart from my own Department and all the other Departments that have come together, I want to thank all the business organisations and business representative bodies across many sectors that have worked with our Departments in recent months.  They have suggested ideas and interventions and worked with us on how to manage the back-to-work protocols and get their doors open again.  These bodies have been around the table from a very early stage, helping our Department and other Departments.  I thank the various organisations for their effort.  It is in the nature of business that we will not agree on everything that comes forward, but the co-operation and the response in all sectors has been immense.</p>  <p>  All our Departments and agencies have been focused on various initiatives that were announced by the last Government.  The credit guarantee was one of those announcements, along with legislation we are bringing forward this week.  All of those Departments and agencies have also been contributing to the July stimulus plan, which will hopefully be announced in the next couple of days.</p>  <p>  The work has so far included the roll-out wide range of measures and advice for businesses, engagement with stakeholders, economic analysis and the provision of evidence to the Government on the needs of business and the impacts in the wider economy, while also continuing with our regulatory and governance functions.  While the number of people on the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment thankfully continues to fall week on week, the scale of the crisis is unprecedented.  Despite the challenges we have faced to date and those yet to come, with returning customers comes renewed hope for our businesses and their staff.  Different towns and villages have given varying feedback on the rate of return, but we know that many sectors are still under immense pressure and will be for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  As society and the economy start to prudently reopen, businesses need support to restart.  Initially they may have to operate at lower levels of activity than before but hopefully over time they will be able to increase activity again and ultimately expand.  As was said in the previous debate, this is about trying to survive and to be in a position to grow and thrive as we recover from Covid-19.  There are already some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy.  However, sectors that employ many people, such as tourism, hospitality, the leisure industry, arts, entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, remain in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are uncertain. </p>  <p>  Getting smaller businesses like hairdressers, barbers, caf&eacute;s, play centres and restaurants back open is not just vital for our economy.  It is also important to the emotional well-being of our people.  The impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, has been enormous.  SMEs are the backbone of Ireland's economy, representing 99.8% of business activities in Ireland.  In May 2019 there were 238,000 SMEs in our economy, employing more than 1.3 million workers at a time when overall employment stood at 2.3 million.  These enterprises are spread throughout the country, in both urban and rural areas, and represent a vibrant and diverse range of economic activity.  Our SMEs have already faced huge challenges in dealing with previous economic difficulties and more recently in preparing for Brexit.  They have shown that they are adaptable, innovative and agile in their responses to many challenges, but they also have specific needs when compared with other areas of the economy.  These needs are what we are trying to address.</p>  <p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, recently published new analysis of data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which shows the vital importance to the economy of the domestically-owned sector as a whole.  We have touched on this in recent debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The contribution from all sides recognised the importance of SMEs to our economies, communities, towns and villages.  Members noted the effort they put in on a daily basis not only to provide goods and services, but to respond to our community needs.  The overall contribution of the domestically-owned sector to net national product, NNP, in 2018 was just under &euro;117 billion, accounting for 79% of total NNP, with foreign-owned enterprises contributing &euro;31 billion, or 21% of the overall total NNP when repatriation of profits to their foreign owners is taken into account.</p>  <p>  In the three weeks since we took up our new roles in the Department with responsibility for enterprise, trade and employment, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Troy and I have mainly focused on preparing the July stimulus package along with other Departments.  As the Government has previously said, it will be radical, of scale and far-reaching.  It is part of a package, building on supports that have already been announced in recent months.  More long-term interventions will be introduced as we develop the three-year economic plan along with the budget in October of this year.</p>  <p>  Before I move on, I would like to thank those Deputies and Senators who offered their ideas on the July stimulus plan in writing, in conversation and during the debate in both Houses on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Act 2020, which was held two weeks ago.  As I noted at the time, they may not all be workable and some may take more funding than is available or may take a long time to put into motion.  However, all were noted and reviewed to see what additional steps we could take together.  If suggestions do not feature in the July plan, we can work on them as part of the budget or the three-year plan in October.</p>  <p>  In considering the various analyses, we see five areas in which we should focus on in helping our enterprises in the future: income support; direct grants for businesses; cheaper finance; new opportunities for future job growth; and support for the hardest-hit sectors.  This will include a specific focus on youth unemployment.  It was said in previous debates, predominantly in the Seanad, that we have to focus on getting our young people back to work and ensuring they are not left behind.</p> <p>I recognise that many of the Members in the House today were here when we brought forward plans in the period from 2008 to 2011, when it was very difficult to get young people back into work and education and keep them close to the system.  It took longer than it should have done to address those issues, and that cannot happen again.  This time, we are very clear on the need to make sure that our response deals with potential youth unemployment.<br/><br/>My Department and its agencies have worked hard since the arrival of Covid-19 to help businesses overcome the challenge presented by the pandemic.  The impact on SMEs in particular has been enormous.  We have, in effect, had an economic pandemic following on the heels of a health pandemic.  So far, the Government has introduced, on behalf of the taxpayer, a &euro;12 billion package for firms of all sizes.  We have already implemented a range of measures and schemes, including wage supports, advice, grants and loans for enterprise.  We recognise that this is not enough.  Groups representing the SME sector and businesses in general explained the need for assistance early in the Covid-19 crisis, with a particular focus from an early stage on liquidity.  Today, we are debating legislation that will make the amendments required to implement part of that liquidity approach by way of implementing a specific Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  This will help many more SMEs than the existing scheme because it is much larger and because the State is guaranteeing 80% of the loans included in the scheme.<br/><br/>The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme will expand the cohort of eligible businesses to include primary producers, namely, farmers and fishers, located throughout the country.  It predates my time in this Department but food producers and farmers in my own area, in counties Meath and Westmeath, were always saying they would like to have access to this type of support if they ever needed it.  We recognise that there was not such a big call on the existing credit guarantee scheme over recent years.  The scheme was there if it was needed and there was always a demand from other sectors to be able to avail of it.  They wanted to be able to access it if they ever needed something to fall back on.  I am glad that this legislation is responding to that request for inclusion.<br/><br/>The new scheme will also include small mid-cap companies with up to 499 employees.  This is something which we can do under flexibilities available from the European Commission under its temporary framework on state aid, which was introduced to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Act 2020, which was debated and passed by both Houses two weeks ago, was introduced to increase lending to the very smallest enterprises, coming directly from the Slate through Microfinance Ireland.  I noted during that debate that we were effectively discussing a State-owned bank, because that money is channelled through Microfinance Ireland and the local enterprise office, LEO, system, whereas the credit guarantee scheme applies to all retailers, which are on every street in the country, enabling them to reach out to the different companies and access the different loans once the guarantee is behind them.<br/><br/>The Bill before us today is aimed at putting in place a State-backed guarantee so that businesses which employ up to 499 people can go to the banks and other participating financial institutions that are lending across a range of financial products.  As part of state aid requirements, the businesses will pay a fee to the State for a guarantee related to their borrowing.  If a business defaults in its repayment of those loans or overdrafts, the lender can then call in the guarantee from the State, which will cover 80% of the outstanding debt.  The lender will still have to carry 20% of the default itself.  The State is providing significant certainty to the banks with this guarantee as we also propose to remove the portfolio cap for the financial institutions, which will see the removal of what was previously seen as a barrier and enable the banks to put more money through the system.<br/><br/>Given these measures, the T&aacute;naiste has been clear in recent meetings with the chief executive officers of the three main banks, namely, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, that the Government expects a significant reduction in the interest rate charged to enterprises for the loans and other financial products covered by the scheme.  As I indicated, a range of products will be covered.  At the moment, only those offered by the three main banks come under the scheme, but it will be available to all other lenders.  We have focused at the start on the three main banks because they cater for approximately 90% of all lending to SMEs.<br/><br/>I will go through the Bill quickly section by section.  Section 1 provides that the Act of 2012 refers to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.  Section 2 amends section 2(1) of the 2012 Act to provide for the inclusion of a new definition of a Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme in that Act, which is required in respect of changes made elsewhere in this Bill.<br/><br/>Section 3 amends section 3 of the 2012 Act to allow for the extension of classes of enterprises which can qualify for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme to include small mid-cap companies.  Primary producers - farmers and fishers - are also to be included in the scheme, but this will be done through the extension of classes of SMEs which qualify for the scheme through the statutory instrument establishing the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme<br/><br/>Section 4 amends section 4 of the 2012 Act to include the new credit guarantee scheme within subsections (1) and (2) of that section, thus giving the Minister the power to give guarantees.  This section also disallows subsections (3) and (4) of section 4 of the 2012 Act for the purposes of the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, as different provisions are being made for those aspects through the new section 4A which is being inserted by section 5 of this Bill.  The existing scheme is subject to a portfolio cap of 13% under the current legislation, but there is no portfolio cap for the Covid-19 scheme.  I understand this change is of great significance for a lot of my colleagues in the House.  The existing scheme also has a maximum yearly credit amount which can be guaranteed of &euro;150 million, whereas the Covid-19 scheme has an overall maximum credit amount of &euro;2 billion.  This is a major increase in the amount of funding being put behind the new scheme.  While it is important to create as much flexibility as we can for the Covid-19 scheme, we do not want to interfere with the terms and conditions of the existing scheme as it will continue once the new scheme has expired and must continue to comply with the normal EU state aid rules.<br/><br/>Section 5 introduces a new Section 4A into the Act of 2012 which gives power to the Minister to give guarantees in accordance with the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  The new scheme will be open for guarantees to be put in place until 31 December 2020 or a later date, not later than 31 December 2021, as ordered by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This allows for flexibility if the European Commission extends its temporary framework on state aid, allowing us to extend the scheme as required.  The temporary framework is <i>in situ</i>until the end of this year, but we will monitor it carefully and react if needs be.  The guarantees will not extend beyond six years in duration, which is a requirement of the state aid rules.  The maximum amount of credit to be covered by the guarantees will not exceed &euro;2 billion and the Minister's liability in respect of those guarantees will not exceed &euro;1.6 billion, in line with the 80:20 risk share.<br/><br/>Subsection (5) includes definitions relevant to the scheme.  I understand colleagues have submitted amendments in respect of the six-year limit, but to be clear, that limit is a requirement under the scheme as it stands.  That is what we have to work with under the state aid rules.  There are other schemes, such as the future growth loan scheme, which allow for longer term loans, and they have been quite popular.  As I mentioned earlier, the Government is working on making sure there are a range of different measures available to help businesses according to their different needs.  I am conscious of the case being put forward to have a longer term than six years.  We are trying to make sure there are different products on the market which will cater for that.  We recognise that for many businesses, there will be a need for finance beyond the six-year mark and we will tweak the different schemes to respond to that need.  Where there is demand in certain areas, we will try to respond to that as well.<br/><br/>Section 6 amends section 12 of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act 2016 to ensure that the maximum liability of the Minister in regard to the existing credit guarantee scheme will remain as not exceeding &euro;15.6 million and for a separate provision for a maximum liability of &euro;1.6 billion in regard to the Covid-19 scheme.  Again, we need to differentiate clearly between the two different schemes.  The Covid-19 scheme is temporary in terms of its ability to respond.<br/><br/>Section 6 is the final section and deals with technical matters concerning the Short Title, commencement arrangements and citation.<br/><br/>As businesses reopen, we need a plan of sufficient speed and scale to repair some of the damage that has been done and to restore confidence.  Businesses need to know that the Government and this House have their backs and that we are there to help them through this process.  The Government asked businesses to close in response to Covid-19.  Many of them could have continued to trade very well and might have expanded only for the intervention of the pandemic.  We are trying to respond to the challenge they face through a range of different measures, such as the wage subsidy scheme, the rates rebate and the enhanced guarantee scheme, which will make money available more cheaply through loans and so on.  We recognise that there is a demand for different types of finance and different combinations of grants, and we will try as best we possibly can to get the money into businesses to enable them to continue to flourish.<br/><br/>The July stimulus package will be the next element of our response, as promised in the programme for Government, and we hope it will be announced later this week.  That job stimulus plan, building on previous announcements, will help to save jobs and create new ones and will, we hope, get the majority of our people back to work.  It is a matter of enabling our SMEs to return to capacity where possible and, more broadly, strengthening the resilience, productivity and innovation of SMEs.  As we adapt to this pandemic, any future pandemics and other challenges that may face businesses in this country, we will see a lot of them show their innovative streak and the particular Irish quality of being able to change and survive.</p>  <p>We wish to build on that resilience and strengthen the position of companies.  It is about getting through this period.  It is also about building on the lessons from Covid-19 in order to be in a stronger position to allow companies to continue to prosper into the future.</p> <p> All Members recognise that SMEs are the backbone of our economy and of communities across the country.  Large numbers of people are employed in small firms in all parts of Ireland.  We must appreciate that SMEs account for more than 1 million employees or slightly more than 68% of total employment in the Irish business economy.</p> <p> A Deputy stated earlier today in the House that all the Government is doing is responding to the needs of business.  That is not the case.  When we support business, we support jobs, and that affects everybody.  It is not just money for businesses, it is money to save and create jobs and to support the economy.  That, in turn, provides the taxes we need to run all the other services.</p> <p> It is important that we respond to the needs of businesses and, most important, our SME sector.  Through enacting the Bill, we will ensure that financial institutions can provide these businesses with access to liquidity at more affordable rates and, more important, that firms can access funding.  Those working in small firms in the private sector have borne the brunt of the pandemic and that is why we need to focus our efforts on them.  The Government will continue to do so.</p> <p> The Bill is one of a suite of measures the Government has implemented and will implement to help SMEs in their recovery.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members on the Bill and hope that we can work together to get it through the Houses this week if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100038#NN00200"><p>I am sharing time with Teachta Doherty, who is on his way to the Chamber.   I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose.</p>  <p>  The legislation is quite technical in nature and makes significant changes to the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  It is an important scheme and the changes to its workings are to be welcomed.  I know from speaking to many businesses and various representative groups that there are issues with regard to the structure and workings of the loan scheme.</p>  <p>  The creation of the scheme on 1 May to facilitate bank lending of up to &euro;2 billion to SMEs, primary producers and small mid-cap companies was a welcome development.  A figure of &euro;2 billion for SMEs was reported in the media.  SMEs and other businesses saw the scheme as a significant development in the context of measures to help them to bounce back from the challenge of Covid-19.  However, as time went on the difficulties and flaws in the scheme became apparent to businesses and politicians.  The proof of its limitations is evidenced in the amount of money that has been loaned.  According to the reply I received last week to a parliamentary question, only &euro;1,606,000 in loans has been approved and sanctioned to date for successful applicants under the scheme.  If just &euro;1.6 million in loans has been issued under a scheme with funding of &euro;2 billion, there is clearly a problem.  In contrast, in Britain &pound;30.9 billion has been approved through the bounce back loan scheme which is widely regarded as being much easier and significantly less risky to access than the Irish scheme.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has spoken to SMEs and others on the issue.  They immediately pinpointed the limitations of the scheme and identified what needs to be done to address them.  The first difficulty they identified was the portfolio cap.  The removal of the cap is very welcome.  On 13 May, Sinn F&eacute;in wrote to the previous Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, calling for its removal.  We stated that the removal of the cap would remedy a problem in the scheme as a result of which banks were refusing to lend to small businesses in dire need of affordable credit.  The portfolio cap meant that banks saw it as unattractive to loan moneys through the scheme to SME.  It also resulted in extremely high interest rates being charged on loans that were issued.  The removal of the cap should make it easier and more attractive for banks to lend to SMEs.  However, its removal alone will not improve the loan scheme.</p>  <p>  The interest rates charged on the loans are the normal business loan rates charged by the respective banks with an additional 0.5% charge as a result of the Government guarantee.  Furthermore, the Department with responsibility for enterprise, trade, and employment, which funds the scheme through the guarantee, plays no role in the application or decision-making process which is fully delegated to the participating lenders.  As a result, the loans that are issued are subject to the respective banks' market interest rate.  In other words, as pointed out by Unite the Union, the banks that administer the scheme decide whether to issue loans based on their own for-profit criteria for loan issuance, rather than the priorities of a Department that is trying to keep companies afloat during a global pandemic.</p>  <p>  Nothing in the scheme speaks to the pressures that thousands of businesses across the State are under as a result of Covid-19.  Businesses have pointed out these flaws in the scheme, as have organisations such as Chartered Accountants Ireland.  It has highlighted the problems inherent in businesses accessing loans at high interest rates such as those charged under the scheme.  It stated in its document The Next Financial Year: Making Irish Business More Competitive that the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is too onerous and complex to administer and that the interest rates charged are prohibitive.  It stated that the interest rates need to be closer to ECB rates than to commercial rates.</p>  <p>  For several months, Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for similarly low interest rates.  We raised the issue in the letter to which I referred which was sent on 13 May.  We have been calling for interest rates that are capped at 2.5%.  Preferably, the interest rate applied should only be sufficient to cover the overheads of administering the loan scheme.  Low interest rates would encourage SMEs to take up the available loans.   We have heard that first-hand from businesses and their representatives.  They further stated that it would be a significant incentive and help if the loans were interest-free and there were no repayments for the first 12 months of the loan, as is standard practice for many Covid-19 credit guarantee loan schemes across the EU.  It would make a significant difference to the loan scheme here.  The Government should really be considering providing 90% to 100% State-guaranteed loans with no repayments for the first 12 months, the State covering the cost of interest over that period and significantly reduced interest rates thereafter.  The implementation of such measures would make the credit guarantee loan scheme much more attractive to businesses in this unprecedented and extremely difficult period.  The scheme would also be significantly improved if the Government guarantee of the loans was increased to 90%, with a review of its effectiveness to see if further increase was needed.  The trajectory of the loan scheme in Germany went from a Government guarantee of 80% to 90% on review and, eventually, to 100%.</p>  <p>  Reviewing the effectiveness of the scheme and enacting the necessary changes if it is not working is the only way we can be sure that it is meeting the needs of SMEs, microbusinesses and family businesses.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a loan scheme with these features.  It has been shaped for SMEs and microbusiness by SMEs, small family-run businesses and microbusiness.  It draws on the best aspects of European and international loan schemes.  If the Government persists with the current scheme minus the portfolio cap, its uptake will not going to increase in any significant way.  The failure of the loan scheme would mean the failure of our SMEs.</p>  <p>  In advance of the July stimulus, I wish to raise the issue of debt through loans.  Thus far, supports for SMEs have largely involved their taking on further debt in the form of loans, but that is precisely what small and medium businesses are saying they do not want.  Increased debt will not help SMEs and microbusinesses to get back to work or drive economic recovery.  The Taoiseach spent the recent days in Brussels, warning against pouring further debt onto European states.  He has instead called for the use of grants to help economies to recover from Covid-19.  It is essential that the Government take that approach in the July stimulus and include a comprehensive scheme of grants for SMEs, microbusinesses, the self-employed and sole traders.  In its Supporting SMEs and Protecting Jobs plan, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for grants ranging from &euro;12,000 to &euro;25,000 to be given to affected SMEs and microbusinesses.  In addition to this grant system, we outlined the need for a &euro;5,000 grant scheme for the self-employed and sole traders who have been adversely affected by Covid-19.  Such grant schemes have been successfully rolled out across the EU and beyond.  The policy of preferring grants to loans which the Taoiseach advocated in Brussels must be reflected in the Government&rsquo;s July stimulus package.  Loans are essential, especially in the longer term, but affected SMEs, microbusinesses and family businesses need significant liquidity injections.</p>  <p>  In addition to injecting significant liquidity into SMEs and microbusinesses, the July stimulus must also reduce businesses' non-pay expenses.  A rates wavier and a cut in the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector until the end of the year, with built-in extension review mechanisms, would suppress non-payroll expenses and allow some breathing space for affected SMEs and microbusinesses.</p>  <p>  The central plank of economic recovery from Covid-19 must be a real commitment to microbusinesses, the SME sector and family businesses, as well as a steadfast commitment to workers&rsquo; rights embedded in legislation and the creation of decent jobs with decent pay and conditions.  Some people have argued that every shilling of Government support should be linked to workers' rights.  I point out to those making such arguments that workers' rights cannot be bought and there should be no attempt to buy them in that way.  If an employer is allocated &euro;2,000 on the basis of such an understanding but the grant is not renewed, would it be acceptable for the employer to then cease recognising its workers' union?</p> <p>Workers' rights need to be legislated for - absolutely - but they cannot just be linked to schemes in this way because it is not going to work.  In the long run, it is not going to help workers.</p> <p> Some of the most negatively impacted sectors of our economy are also some of those with the lowest pay and worst conditions for workers.  Therefore, the recovery for affected sectors cannot be a reconstitution of the past.  As we try to help SMEs and microbusinesses recover from Covid-19, we must also try to rebuild our economy in a different way.  The vast majority of our economic base is low wage, low growth, and low value added.  We have to change that, and the Government has to be central in changing it.  We must progress to build an economy that is robust, diverse, decent wage, high growth, and high value added.  We cannot enviously look at the economic bases of Germany or Denmark as a pipe dream that we could never have here.  We need to strive for the best aspects of such economies and try to replicate them here on a domestic level.</p> <p> We must also reject the negative aspects of such economies.  We must reject the negative economic policies which exploit workers, stifle growth and deprive Governments of tax revenue.  Worker and community-owned co-operatives offer new ways forward for businesses; so too does investment in social enterprises.  These are the areas which should be focused on and encouraged as we move through the Covid-19 recovery.  The difficulties our economy and SMEs face are unprecedented, and grant schemes and loans will provide much-needed corporate welfare to businesses.  However, it is imperative that as a State we have a much broader plan for our economy.  We need an economy that works for the people.  That can be done, and it should be a priority.</p> <p> We will not be opposing this Bill as we support the general thrust of it.  However, we would prefer if the scheme had a greater Government-backed guarantee and lower interest rates as well as a number of other changes.  We can of course thrash that out on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

That has not happened in the past.  It is a trend that needs to stop right now.  The Government needs to respect this House and respect the representatives of the people who are sent here to ask questions and participate in the passage of the legislation.</p>  <p>  I welcome the introduction of the Bill before us.  Before discussing the provisions of the Bill, I wish to comment on the circumstances in which it has been brought before us and the challenges faced by our small businesses as a result of this crisis.  It should always be borne in mind that many of the challenges workers and SMEs face are a direct result of the public health measures implemented by Government.  That places a responsibility on Government to act to protect these jobs and support these businesses.  Public health measures have forced businesses to close throughout the State.  It has required them to implement measures that have significantly reduced their capacity to operate.  The losses experienced by SMEs now threaten their very survival and the jobs they provide.  Employing more than a million people with extensive linkages throughout their domestic supply chain, their very success is key to our economic recovery.  That means the recovery will depend on the Government's support.</p>  <p>  N&iacute; bheidh athshl&aacute;n&uacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta gan athshl&aacute;n&uacute; d&aacute;r gn&oacute;anna beaga.  Seo iad na gn&oacute;anna agus a gcuid oibrithe a d'fhulaing mar gheall ar Covid-19 agus mar gheall ar na beartaithe agus na srianta a chur an Rialtas i gcr&iacute;ch.  Mar gheall ar sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; riachtanach anois go dtugfadh an Rialtas an taca&iacute;ocht d&oacute;ibh.</p>  <p>  In the financial stability update published by the Central Bank in April, it was estimated that SMEs would require between &euro;2.4 billion and &euro;5.7 billion in additional liquidity and support to cover non-payroll expenses in the three months alone. It cannot be denied at this stage that the supports provided by Government so far have fallen far below these needs.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Since 23 March, four months into the crisis, less than &euro;300 million has been provided to businesses across all 15 schemes.  That is only a fraction of the liquidity support that the Central Bank had estimated our SMEs needed.  The restart grant has approved less than 75% of applications with an average grant of less than &euro;4,200.  This stands in stark contrast with what is happening in other jurisdictions.  Just up the road in the North, grants of &pound;10,000 and &pound;25,000 have been provided to SMEs depending on their size.  These grants, with a total value of more than &pound;300 million, were disbursed to SMEs by the end of March, providing rapid liquidity to businesses that needed it and the jobs they supported to help them survive.  In contrast, the Government's grant scheme here has been slow and inadequate and this must change.  Similarly, the Government's credit guarantee scheme, which we are discussing today in this legislation, has so far been an abject failure.  In reply to a parliamentary question of mine on 7 July, the Minister confirmed that since 23 March, a total of five loans have been approved with a combined value of &euro;1.6 million.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to address this failure.  It is clear that among the supports provided to our SMEs during the crisis, affordable credit must play a part.  The credit guarantee scheme was established in 2012 and amended in 2016 to facilitate lending and make credit accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, businesses that typically struggle to access credit from bank and non-bank lenders.  Under the scheme as it currently stands, the Government would provide an 80% guarantee of loans made to eligible businesses from a number of lenders.  The purpose of the State guarantee was to cover the cost of the loans that may default under the scheme, thereby increasing the bank's willingness to lend and to provide credit to SMEs.  However, with a portfolio cap of 13% in place, the effective guarantee provided on these loans has been reduced to 10.4%.  This has significantly reduced the willingness of banks to lend to SMEs.  It is why the Government's credit guarantee scheme has performed so badly so far, with negligible take-up from businesses and lending from banks involved.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has a difficulty understanding what he has called regulatory gobbledegook from the banks, but it is important that the Minister makes an effort to understand how they operate.  Thaispe&aacute;in an T&aacute;naiste d&uacute;inn le cupla seachtain anuas nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n tuiscint aige ar ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; na mbanc agus ar ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; airgeadais.  Caithfidh s&eacute; d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go dtagann feabhas ar an tuiscint seo go gasta m&aacute; t&aacute; rath le bheith ar an sc&eacute;im seo.</p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Bill amends section 4 of the 2012 Act to give the Minister the powers to give guarantees in the context of the credit guarantee scheme.  It also removes the portfolio cap from the scheme.  This is welcome.  On 13 May I wrote to the Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, proposing a suite of measures to support SMEs during the crisis.  Among them was to amend the credit guarantee scheme to facilitate lending to our SMEs.  I proposed that the portfolio cap be removed to facilitate lending and improve SME access to credit.  In his response on 29 May, the Minister for Finance reiterated Government policy of maintaining the portfolio cap of 50%, creating an effective guarantee of only 40%.  As I made clear, such a low level of guarantee would fail to address the fundamental issue, the unwillingness of lenders to provide credit to our SMEs.  The only way to address this issue was to remove the portfolio cap and I welcome the fact that the Minister and the Government have changed their position and adopted Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals in this regard.</p>  <p>  Section 6 ensures that the maximum liability of the Minister in respect of the credit guarantee scheme will be &euro;1.6 billion.  This relates to the 80% guarantee the State will provide to the &euro;2 billion in lending under the scheme.  It should be borne in mind that the cost to the State of this guarantee is likely to be much less.  With a guarantee of 80% and the default rate likely to be about 20% on loans provided through the scheme, the cost to the State and the taxpayers would be about &euro;320 million.</p> <p>I know the Minister has found it difficult in the past to understand how banks operate, but the following fact is worth bearing in mind when we consider this legislation.  The cost to the State is likely to be much less than the &euro;2 billion it would facilitate in lending, which is a good thing for this reason.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the level of the guarantee should be increased to 90% with a view to increasing it to 100% depending on the performance, or underperformance, of the scheme.  This would mirror other guarantee schemes established in the EU such as in Germany.  Assuming a default rate of 20%, it would cost the State &euro;360 million but increase the likelihood that banks would lend and credit would be provided to small businesses which need it, supporting and retaining jobs and getting people back to work.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose this legislation.  Indeed it adopts proposals submitted by Sinn F&eacute;in to the Ministers for Finance, and Business, Enterprise, and Innovation in May, but it can and must be strengthened by increasing the level of the guarantee and, crucially, by ensuring zero interest with no repayments for the first 12 months for borrowers and capping interest rates at a maximum of 2.5% thereafter.  What guarantees can the Minister give that these proposals will be incorporated into the credit guarantee scheme?</p> <p> The Government's response to this crisis as it effects SMEs throughout the State has been slow and totally inadequate.  I fear, and unfortunately it has come to pass, that the Government's lacklustre approach to date has cost jobs.  For that, the Government will be held to account.</p> <p> N&iacute; thiocfaidh feabhas ar bith ar ruda&iacute; muna dtagann feabhas ar ruda&iacute; do chomhlachta&iacute; beaga.

The Labour Party will support this Bill.  We appreciate the necessity for it and where the Minister is coming from in bringing it to the House.  We agree with some of the comments made by previous speakers, particularly on the lifting of the portfolio cap.</p><p>The Minister of State's opening remarks placed a heavy emphasis on the July stimulus package.  The Labour Party published its own draft stimulus proposals last week.  We have tests for every piece of legislation which comes to either House in trying to deal with the massive impact which Covid-19 has had on our country and our economy.  We all appreciate the economy has fallen off a cliff.  In many respects it is different from what happened ten years ago in that there will still be a capacity issue regardless of how much we can reopen and how much people are able to spend again.  Many small and medium-sized enterprises will have capacity issues around the number of customers they can cater for.  We know that it is easier to retain a job than create one, so whatever we try to do, whether in microfinancing or credit guarantees, the goal is to maintain jobs that already exist.</p><p>All measures that we take must be big enough to counteract the impact not only of Covid-19 but also of Brexit.  I wonder if Members of this House or people around the country are as cognisant of the impact of Brexit as they are of Covid-19, which is something that we are living with and thinking about.  It is creating a huge mental health issue for the whole country, but had it not arrived, we would absolutely be talking about Brexit instead, its impact and the actions of the UK Government around it.  The potential for job losses in Border counties and the south east is huge in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The impact on jobs, businesses and household finances will be huge.  The Labour Party recommended a package of about &euro;10 billion.  If reports are to be believed, the Government is suggesting a package of &euro;7 billion, so there is a gap between the two proposed figures, but the hole in the public finances must be bridged somewhere, which is why we believe that any stimulus, legislation or initiative must be big and bold to recognise the magnitude of what we are dealing with.</p><p>The stimulus must be directed at the creation of good quality jobs, especially for younger workers.  We believe there must be conditionality with all these measures.  I recognise what the previous speaker said about workers' rights, that it must be based in legislation and trade union recognition, and that it cannot be based on a <i>quid pro quo</i>, which I accept.  At the same time, it is important that we do not return to the old economic model which failed so many people.  I will keep using these statistics as long as I have a platform to speak about them, which are that 23% of Irish workers are on low pay and 40% of young people are in insecure work.  The old model was not working for many young people.  Now 45% of young people are unemployed.  We have one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Europe.  That must be recognised in any stimulus package, legislation or measures to build up the economy again.  We need good quality jobs that will last and not ones that are insecure.  Insecure employment leads to insecure accommodation and insecurities in many life choices.  We need a new economic model based on lifelong learning, caring and sustainability.  These measures must be aimed at reducing economic inequality which must be an overarching aim.</p><p>During a crisis, crisis measures are taken without thinking long term.  Many of us fear that we might support this legislation, but many Bills or packages and announcements are made in the white heat of the crisis.  We appreciate that and governments have to respond, but there are massive long-term impacts from the short-term measures that are taken or the big announcements that are made.  If whatever announcement is made adds to economic inequality, it must be resisted and rethought.  None of us on this side of the House are trying to be difficult or not help do whatever we can to get the country out of the difficulty we find ourselves in, but we cannot then return to an unfair and unequal economic model based on low tax and low pay.  That is not something we should stand over.</p><p>We should not be shy about demanding the strengthening of our public services.  Many business leaders speak about the challenges they have with rents, rates and so on, which is all understandable.  However, when we talk about rate cuts or holidays, we must remember that rates are vital funding streams to local authorities.  I am in no way suggesting that there should not be movement on rates - there should and there has been, which is welcome - but those funds needs to be replaced because local councils depend on them.  The Minister of State might suggest that local councils are overdependent on ratepayers and business, which is arguable, but the funding must be replaced because there must be funding for services to provide public housing, parks, playgrounds, libraries and the other council services that everyone depends on so much.  While we are trying to reboot the economy and ensure that businesses can survive, it will be challenging for local councils to survive if the rates they are used to obtaining from business to fund their services are no longer available.</p><p>Those are The Labour Party's five tests on the July stimulus: that it is big enough to make an impact - we suggest &euro;10 billion; that it creates good quality jobs for young workers, because 45% are unemployed and a huge proportion of them were in insecure work prior to the Covid crash; that it should be based on a new economic model of decent and secure jobs; that it reduces economic inequality; and that it improves public services.</p> <p> Having said all of that, the Labour Party will be supporting this Bill.  We have a strong track record in producing legislation that can be practical and that can work.  However, we constantly make the point to the Minister of State and the senior Minister, when he takes legislation through the House, that we are long-standing critics of any economic model which lets employers, a Government or an economy get away with exploiting people or that allows an economy or a Government to build a recovery on the backs of those who cannot stand up for themselves.  It is younger people, women and migrants, disproportionately, who are in these low-paid insecure jobs.  These people are also disproportionately affected by the rent issue.  All of these matters overlap and are interconnected.  The people I speak of do not have access to mainstream media or to powerful lobby groups that can speak on their behalf.  If they happen to join a union, the union has a veto.  The thing about industrial relations in Ireland is that it has been described as similar to joining a golf club.  One can join the golf club but one does not necessarily get to play.  That is the reality of the volunteerist model of industrial relations that exists here and that we will be challenging over for the next number of years in order to ensure that workers have a chance to recover as the economy recovers.</p> <p> We want to see businesses recover and enterprises survive and to see the development of an Ireland that can get out of these dark days.  We fully understand that many businesses were only beginning to turn the corner in the wake of the previous crash and believe in themselves again, and were, perhaps, taking on additional employees, building extensions or opening new outlets.  We completely understand that many people have been devastated not just by the collapse of the economy caused by Covid-19 but also by the fact that the dreams that they had up until Christmas have been destroyed.  Many feel that they may not open their doors again.</p> <p> We want to support the Bill and what the Government is trying to achieve but we cannot &ndash; we will be consistent on this - say that if we go back to the way matters were before Christmas, everything will be fine.  That will not be the case.  A great number of people are suffering in desperate conditions.  These are people who are working.  That is what is so this disappointing when one hears statistics regarding the level of unemployment being down and full employment being achieved in the country.  It is the type of employment that exists and the desperation in which people can live which is clouded by these unemployment figures.</p> <p> Those are my comments on the Bill, which we are not opposing.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State further on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100041#QQ00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and on the credit guarantee scheme.  It sounds almost trite to say that we are living in unprecedented times.  The only way we will emerge from this crisis will be by marshalling and investing an unprecedented amount of State resources.  In doing so, it is important that we ensure that the State response is targeted, ambitious and evidence-based.  In that context, there is a role for a State-backed loan scheme but it should only be one aspect of a much larger suite of measures.  These loans may be suitable for a number of companies but others may require additional supports, and yet still others may require grant aid.  The aim should be to achieve a job-rich growth whereby there will be good quality, secure employment.  While I see the potential in what is being proposed, there are still a number of important issues and details that are outstanding and that have not been fully provided for.  I would like these to be teased out, if not this evening then over the next day or so before the fate of this Bill is finally decided.</p>  <p>  While the wider economy and access to credit for small and medium-size businesses is extremely important, it should never be the limit of our concern.  For me, the benchmark by which we must judge all economic responses to the Covid-19 pandemic is our ability to protect people's jobs and livelihoods.  I certainly do not want a situation whereby the stimulus will be spent on, for example, paying rents, and inflated rents at that.  It has to be a stimulus and that means money in cash registers and in people&rsquo;s pockets that actually gets spent.</p>  <p>  According to the Department&rsquo;s report on the final quarter of last year, only 64 loans were drawn down.  The total value of these loans was just under &euro;15 million.  The Department estimates that this resulted in 1,057 jobs being maintained and an additional 274 being created, or a total of 1,331.  This was an increase in shared liability of just over &euro;11,000 for every job that was either created or maintained.  These figures also serve to demonstrate the major issue with the current scheme that I fear may be carried over into this one.  Since its inception, the level of take-up relating to the credit guarantee scheme has been constantly sluggish.  The 2013 independent review of the scheme noted that the numbers of jobs created and maintained were significantly below the target of 1,000 per annum.  This figure was disproportionately high given the generally low level of take-up relating to the scheme.  It would be very interesting and important that we know what the target is for jobs.  There has to be some link between both.</p>  <p>  In light of the new and uncharted waters in which businesses find themselves, it is hard to see how the current proposal goes far enough to address the issues that exist and to bring uptake in respect of the scheme to the levels envisaged.  Can the Minister of State outline what the ambition is?  It is possible that the removal of the portfolio cap may be a positive step toward addressing this.  The current scheme has a portfolio cap in place which limits the State&rsquo;s exposure to 13% of the loan facilities.  The Department has indicated that the removal of the cap is necessary to ensure that lenders provide the necessary liquidity.  There is also evidence that this aspect of the existing scheme has given rise to the banks refusing to lend to some small businesses and applying unsustainable rates of interest to others.  This aspect is going to be very important.</p>  <p>  One of the aspects of the microfinance scheme, for example, when one looks at trends, is how difficult it was for young people in circumstances where they did not have the collateral.  These well-educated people with good ideas should not be prevented from taking a risk to create new jobs.  The attitude of the banks in taking a conservative approach could be very problematic particularly when these young people do not have the safety valve of immigration.  This is a cohort of individuals of whom we should be very conscious.</p>  <p>  Reading the quarterly reports, it is difficult to see how this alone could be the root cause of the low level of loans granted under the scheme.  Between the beginning of the operation of the scheme in 2012 and the end of last year, only 730 loans were sanctioned.  These had a cumulative value of &euro;122 million, meaning that the average amount involved was just under &euro;170,000.  Even with the removal of the portfolio cap, I do not see any evidence that the Minister of State will be delivering a scheme that will be so attractive to businesses that the level of funding he is proposing is warranted.  Can he provide details of the business case for the level of funding that he is proposing to attach to the scheme and the expected number of loans his Department is estimating will be sought and delivered under the scheme before the end of the year.  There is no point in having something that is really ambitious in theory if the reality is very different for people who may well want to take it up.</p>  <p>  For me, the crux of the matter is whether the scheme is fit for purpose.  It is all well and good to throw potential liabilities on the balance sheet if one knows that they will never become real.  We have to look at what is being offered and ask what is the real potential liability of approving this scheme.</p> <p>If, for example, one is the manager of a struggling business, will it meet one's needs?  That is where we will need to have ongoing input about how it is working, because it is only one of a number of initiatives.  It ties up a significant amount of money.  I must be clear that I am not opposed to the 80-20 split, with the banks taking some of the risk.  I understand the arguments for the 100% State-backed loans but I also see where the T&aacute;naiste is coming from with regard to the shared risk being a disincentive to reckless lending.  However, I do not think the trust-but-verify approach in respect of the banks is good enough.  We all have strong memories of how the banks conducted themselves in the past and none of us feel any great confidence in how they will treat this scheme.  We are asking the same people to be involved even though we can see that there has not been a change in culture over the years.  I would be surprised if everybody does not make the same point.  Maybe the banks will surprise us - I hope that they do - but we have to be concerned about this aspect.</p> <p> Last week, we heard the statement from the chief executive of the Irish SME Association that he believes this scheme will be the subject of a limited take-up because the targeted businesses were understandably completely debt averse.  I have heard repeatedly that people are concerned about not having the capacity to take on more debt.  The T&aacute;naiste told RT&Eacute; that the loans provided under the scheme will be on much better terms and conditions than those currently available.  With the global pandemic and economic crisis, however, any level of uncertainty is too much for businesses and we should be concerned about this lack of clarity.  I am of the opinion that the interest rate should be as low as 0% for at least the first year, regardless of whether we take on 100% of the liability or split it with the lender, with the State still shouldering the majority of the risk.  Citizens should reap the major part of the reward.</p> <p> The purpose for which the money is loaned is also important.  The objective is to end up with good-quality jobs being either created or maintained.  That is, after all, the basic foundation of banking.  Banks take on risk with a view to receiving reward.  It is a calculated gamble whereby the deck is entirely stacked in favour of the lender.  With this in mind, I am concerned that the scheme does not go far enough to ensure ongoing lending by the banks.  I understand that they will continue to apply their normal underwriting decision-making processes to the applications regardless of the reduced risks they are taking on.  Perhaps the Minister of State will address that point.</p> <p> In normal times, this would be a challenge to businesses.  In the midst of a potential global credit crunch, it may be an insurmountable barrier for struggling businesses.  I have friends who have small businesses and they are wondering, in light of some of the challenges they face, if they will be able to stay open.  There have been occasions when businesses have felt that their applications have been unfairly treated.  This scheme will be time-bound and available on 31 December of this year, yet the T&aacute;naiste does not expect it to be up and running until September or October.  This leaves a very small window for businesses to make their applications.  Maybe I am wrong but that is my understanding of the position.</p> <p> It is not clear if there is an appeals process or if one will be put in place.  Under the current scheme, if an applicant is unhappy with a decision, he or she must follow the vendor's normal appeal procedure and have the option to escalate the matter to the credit review office.  The office's average processing time to deliver an opinion is four weeks.  We have tight timeframes here.  I am concerned that the lack of a speedy external appeals process will leave applicants highly vulnerable to unfair lending practices.  I point to younger people in particular in this regard.</p> <p> The level of uncertainty surrounding the operation of the scheme is a cause of great concern.  The interest rate and approval criteria are not set in stone and fully negotiated.  The scheme is set out but there is much uncertainty about how it will operate.</p> <p> In addition to the unspecified level of interest, there is a guaranteed premium attached to each loan.  I am glad to see that this will be paid to the State at a reduced rate compared with the one currently in place.  Under the proposals as they stand, the rate for SMEs will be 0.25% in the first year and 0.5% in the second and third years, then 1% for the remainder of the loan.  The Department's information on the current credit guarantee scheme states that the existing premium is paid by businesses as a contribution towards the costs of the State providing the scheme.  Even at the lowest cost proposed by the Government, this premium could serve to generate significant income for the State if anything approaching the full value of the scheme is drawn down.  There is a doubt about whether this will happen but it is a matter to keep in mind.  Is it the Minister's intention that moneys generated from the premium will serve any specific purpose?  Will it be ring-fenced?  Will it go back into the scheme?  Will it cover administrative costs?  If there is a business case available, I would appreciate seeing how this scheme was worked up.</p> <p> The Minister of State dealt with the issues of fisheries, aquaculture and agriculture.  Is there a prohibition in the current scheme for purchasing freight transport vehicles or in respect of other matters?  He might address the areas that will be included under the new scheme that are not contemplated in the one we are debating.</p> <p> I have some concerns about how we are handling all of this.  I understand that we are in unprecedented times and that there are time limits.  However, it should not go unsaid that there is a degree of speed involved in this that should cause some concern.  The time available from when the Bill was published to table amendments is not the norm and it is important to put that on the record.  At the same time, I accept that speed is needed.  Businesses and their workers need help and support to make it through this crisis.</p> <p> The full scale of the economic impact of the pandemic has yet to become clear but we know that we need to act now, taking bold steps to protect jobs and support indigenous industries.  State-backed loans have a part to play in achieving this but we have a responsibility to make sure that it is done in the right way.  The proposed scheme has the potential to help some businesses but it carries many of the hallmarks that held its previous incarnation back.  The reforms which are being proposed to the existing scheme would have been welcomed in a period of normal economic growth.  However, they do not appear to fully recognise the unprecedented situation that many businesses find themselves in due to circumstances completely beyond their control.  In saying that, I recognise that this is just one of a number of measures.</p> <p> The fact is that many businesses have racked up significant debts while trying to stay afloat during the lockdown.  Taking on additional debt regardless of whether they are State-backed is just not viable at the current rates of interest.</p> <p> I am concerned that the proposed scheme will not attract that level of uptake necessary to warrant tying up &euro;1.6 billion.  This will prevent us from doing other things if that proves to be the case.  Will the Government be looking at the drawdown and timing in order that it may intervene at an early stage if it is clear that this is not going to be fit for purpose?</p> <p>We cannot, however, make an accurate assessment of the scheme's potential effectiveness in the absence of that kind of information.  We do not know the rate of interest that will be charged and we do not know the terms or the conduct of the banks.  Would it be possible, for example, for some of the State agencies such as IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland to involve themselves more directly in that, to deal with it directly as opposed to the banks having that responsibility?  I am sure it might have been possible.  Those agencies have a jobs focus and they know what it takes to create and maintain jobs.  The bank has a different remit and looks at risk.</p> <p> I am not opposed to the scheme in principle but I cannot stand over any measure where the main beneficiary is the bank profiteering.  This cannot be allowed to happen and it must be monitored very carefully.  A more ambitious approach would be to build an element of social value into the application criteria of the scheme.  I would like to have seen that done.  If the scheme is to be reviewed, this should happen.  If the State was willing to take on a more active role in assessing applications it could prioritise loans that would create jobs, or those that protect jobs that already exist in vulnerable communities or sectors.  There is more than one way to achieve the goals of this scheme and I wonder what, if any, consideration was given to alternatives to the scheme.  Was time an aspect of this?</p> <p> I urge the Minister to present the business case for this scheme, alongside the full details of the terms and conditions he is seeking to agree with the banks.  It is essential that this is done before the House votes on this Bill so that Members can be fully informed on how the scheme will play out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100043#SS00200"><p>People Before Profit fully supports the objective of the Bill, which is to try to protect and support employment in the SME sector.  We are fully aware that small businesses are responsible for more than 1 million jobs.  It is absolutely right that the Government takes the necessary measures to protect and sustain the jobs in that sector.  While supporting the objective, we have a number of concerns about the approach being taken in the Bill and in the part it plays in the overall July stimulus measures, which we understand the Minister is planning.  In some ways it repeats the mistakes of the past pursued by the Minister of State and his coalition partners Fianna F&aacute;il in trying to deal with economic crises.  Even more so, there has been a failure in the Government's overall approach to register just how the world has changed as a result of Covid-19, the challenges it poses and the need for an absolutely radical shift in the way we run our society and to try to construct a sustainable economy in the post-Covid-19 era.</p>  <p>  What do I mean by that?  First, there is a sort of narrative, which I would call an ideology, that pervades the Government's approach in this Bill, and more broadly in the stimulus.  It has really pervaded the Government's approach for the last decade.  It is the view that the core of the economy is private enterprise.  In the last few months we have learnt that quite literally our health is our wealth, but I do not know if the Minister of State has learnt this.  It is not just a nice idea.  We have suddenly learnt that this is a fact: our health is our wealth.  When a pandemic as vicious and as virulent as Covid-19 arrives and public health is threatened in a fundamental way, and when this public health emergency threatens to overwhelm the ability of our under-resourced health system to cope, then the entire economy shuts down.  All of the SMEs pretty much shut down and quite a lot, if not most, of big business shuts down.  The economy shuts down.  It is essential: our health is our wealth.  If we cannot deal with the ongoing threat of Covid-19, all of these other measures are a waste of time.  I do not believe that this understanding has penetrated the heads of the two major parties.  They just imagine that if we nurse the system back to roughly where it was and hope that Covid-19 goes away then everything will be okay.  This is a fundamental mistake.  There is a failure to recognise this to the level of having systems in place necessary to cope with Covid-19 in the form of a health service that can deal with surges, an education system that has to function but which does not have the capacity, and a childcare system that has to function in order for the rest of the economy to operate.  These are absolute preconditions for the rest of the economy to function.  If they do not function then forget all the stimulus to SMEs, which would be irrelevant.  If we do not have an education system that is capable of operating, if we do not have a health system that is capable of dealing with surges, and if we do not have childcare that can allow parents to go to work then forget the rest.  This understanding has not permeated what will come out from the July stimulus.  There is no radical programme to recruit the 5,000 healthcare workers we need.  This is not just a health prerequisite, it is also an economic stimulus.  It is a sustainable one because, Covid or no Covid, we need those healthcare workers.  Those jobs will sustain the economy and sustain the ability of our health service to underpin our entire society and economy.  Exactly the same point can be made for our chronically understaffed education system and our chronically under-resourced and fragmented national childcare system.  I say this first as a key point.</p>  <p>  My second point concerns the Bill itself.  As I said earlier, of course we need to support the small and medium enterprises.  Extending credit to them is probably, for some at least, important to do.  Yes, we should do it.  As other speakers have said, however, it is telling that the previous scheme, which this expands in the light of Covid-19, is questionable in its success and effectiveness with regard to its take-up.  It is highly debatable whether the SMEs that really need the help will take on debts from banks that are, let us face it, not the most helpful people in the world to SMEs or to anybody else.  This is the bit that really gets me about not learning lessons.  Yes we need to extend supports and credit to the SMEs and it is right the State takes on the responsibility for doing it.</p> <p>The mechanism through which one plans to do this is by privatising the profits, if it succeeds, and socialising the costs or the debts if it fails.  Where have we heard this before?  The proposal is that if the banks lend a lot and if it works, they will profit from it.  We will get a tiny 0.25% premium but the profits will flow to the banks.  However, if it goes belly up, because the Government has not done the other things it needed to do in terms of the health service, education and dealing with Covid, and there are a load of the defaults, the people pay the bill.  It is a win-win for the banks.  When we need to deal with a big economic problem, we come up with a proposal that is a win-win situation for the banks.  They cannot lose.  Where did we hear that before?  How did that work out the last time around?  Not very well.</p> <p> The banks will be the arbiters of who gets loans, if the SMEs even want credit from them which, as we said, is debatable.  Why on earth would the Government not cut out the middleman in this situation?  I do not understand it if we are going to pay the bill.  The potential for massive defaults is very real if the pandemic continues to impact and we are forced back into further lockdowns.  Why on earth would we go through the middleman of the banks and tell them they can have the profits if everything goes well but we will pick up the bill if it goes really badly?  That is just madness.</p> <p> It will also be more expensive in interest terms, plus the premium, to go through the banks rather than for the State to do it directly itself.  I do not see how that can be the case.  The State can borrow money cheaper.  It can, by the way, have a more hands-on and human approach to support businesses as opposed to banks which have an utterly inhuman approach.  That is generally how most SMEs to which I talk see the banks.  They do not see them as helpful or particularly human or looking at the specifics of their business.  They see them instead as utterly ruthless.</p> <p> One argument the Government will come back with is that we cannot interfere with the commercial approach of the banks.  That would be completely wrong for the Government to do.  Instead, the Government will argue that we have to let the banks operate on a sound commercial basis except if the banks lose.  Then all the sound commercial stuff goes out the window and we will underwrite them.  That is the way it works for the banks.  It is one law for the banks and another for the SMEs and everybody else with whom the banks deal.  The only people who do not have to operate on a sound commercial basis, because they will be underwritten by the State, in other words, the people, are the banks.  That is not an approach I favour.</p> <p> I do not want to stop any flow of credit which might be beneficial to SMEs in this dire situation.  However, I have to seriously question whether this is effective and sensible as the way to do that.  It is not about the objective of doing it but the way of doing it.  It is about making it effective to actually help the SMEs.  It is about ensuring that if the State, the people, takes the risk and if the enterprise goes well, then the benefits will flow back to the people, not to the shareholders of the banks.  The latter is what the Government's proposal is offering.</p> <p> On the double standards involved, this is part of the wider stimulus package.  This is a scheme which the banks will love but which is of questionable value to SMEs.  If the leaks are to be believed, the Government is going to increase the possibility that this scheme will fail by cutting the income of those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own as a result of the pandemic.  If it is true that the Government is going to cut the pandemic payment from &euro;350 to &euro;300, how will this help the high street and SMEs.  I do not see how it will.  It is counterintuitive, unless I am missing something, that the Government is planning to cut the income of the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, as well as further tapering the wage subsidy scheme.  This will mean they will have less money in their pockets which, in turn, will mean they will be spending less money in SMEs.  How is that sensible?</p> <p> The only people who are being nicely insulated from any of the problems and risks are the banks.  Where did we hear that story before?  These are the banks we bailed out to a far bigger tune the last time around but still do not pay any taxes and are making hundreds of millions of euro in profits.  The Government, however, wants to make sure they do not have to take any risks.  It makes a joke even of capitalism, not that I am a fan of capitalism.  This is capitalism with no risk for capitalists.  In the enterprise economy, the pioneers of enterprise do not take risks because the chumps representing the people will underwrite the risk for them and make sure that we pay.  That does not seem very sensible.</p> <p> Our alternative is to nationalise the banks.  They would not be here without the bailout we have given them.  They have not treated the mortgage holders very well and are not treating the SMEs very well.  We are underwriting their losses anyway.  We cannot trust them to lend to the people who really need it but we are actually enabling them.  Why on earth would we not be running them and dictating their priorities?  Why can we not ensure that if they do profit, that those very profits come back to the people?  Some 30 or 40 years ago, even in capitalist countries, that would not have been seen as a completely radical idea.  Apparently, it is off the charts now.  We will learn eventually about the folly of socialism for the banks and capitalism for the people.  However, we continue to go round the hamster wheel of making the same mistake over and over again.</p></speech>

I certainly could not disagree with much of what he said just there, particularly in respect of the banking sector.</p>  <p>  The credit guarantee scheme of &euro;2 billion, based on the relaxation of state aid rules for a limited time, will be given primarily to primary producers, SMEs and mid-caps.  This is to be welcomed.  It is to secure employment and, in doing so, it will, hopefully, secure the future of our youth, our culture and our society.  These are not small things to be considered.  We are at a very difficult juncture in our State.</p>  <p>  I want to address the history of the guarantee scheme which is not too rosy.  The previous one was initiated in 2012 with more than &euro;1.2 billion made available over an eight-year period.  Only &euro;152 million of it, 13%, was drawn down in the eight years.  If the same drawdown was to occur with this scheme, it would represent an injection of &euro;260 million.  SMEs have been told they need liquidity.  One has to ask if the scheme is properly constructed.  Ireland is facing tremendous challenges and some earlier speakers referred to Brexit.  Again, society will be challenged by Covid and we will have to do more to keep this disease at bay.  What has happened in the economic environment is demand has fallen off a cliff.  That is a difficult place for businesses.  Sometimes, when one is in business, it can be hard to know how to stimulate demand.  Demand is often not stimulated but taken advantage of.</p> <p> Liquidity schemes are needed to support businesses, but some of the narrative, mostly in the public sphere, has been about giving out free money.  Some people do not understand what money is needed for.  I have a background in business.  Were I in business today, I might be using that money to clear creditors, buy stock, pay write-downs on existing stock or pay for utilities, bills for which I would probably have amassed over three, four or five months.  If I wanted to reinvent my business, I would have to look into new products and service development.  That would take time and money.  I would have to pay the annual fees my business incurred - utilities, rents and, if I had registered technology, patents.  I would also need something to support the losses incurred in returning to non-profitable work.  As many businesses have already seen, once they return to work, they find that demand and revenue are down and they have opened into markets where they are losing money every month.  They are hoping to climb, climb and climb, but they need this money to support them on the way.</p> <p> I will provide some examples of companies that might need significant funding currently.  There are pharmaceutical wholesalers that have to buy products with a one- or two-year lifespan.  They must be able to hold those products in the marketplace for a year.  They have potentially lost six to eight months in their supply chains, which means that products they bought for their stock will have to be destroyed, representing a loss on their books.  People involved in the large capital equipment business have lost orders after having bought machines on lease purchase schemes in the hope of selling them on.  They cannot sell that stock and will have to continue funding it in the hope the economy improves and some of their customers return.  Motor retailers are in a similar situation.  Consider the amount of stock write-off that was done by food manufacturers.  I will not mention the company's name, but a large yoghurt manufacturer in this country had stock primarily for a market outside Europe.  That trade stopped and all of the stock had to be destroyed.  These are the types of situation for which money is needed.</p> <p> A credit guarantee scheme is needed, but is this scheme the correct one?  Like others, I welcome the lifting of the portfolio cap.  It was necessary.  Compare this scheme with the most recent working capital scheme, though.  To date, it has seen a drawdown of &euro;86 million, 3,376 applications and only 705 loans sanctioned, or 21% of the total.  The Department tells us that the remainder are still under consideration.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste recently spoke about delays to stimulation and an interest coupon of 4% to cover defaults.  The SME restart grant has been more successful with &euro;128 million drawn down.  This grant through local authorities is for between &euro;2,000 and &euro;10,000, which is far more manageable for smaller businesses and is popular.  It lacks funding breadth, though, and as the Minister of State knows, it has run out.  It needs to be replenished.  Businesses needed that money as soon as it became available to them, given that they had been waiting.</p> <p> There are microfinance loans of up to &euro;50,000.  Some &euro;18 million has been drawn down to date, with 1,015 applications and 665 approvals, representing a 65% successful drawdown rate for a loan with an APR of 4.5%.  Germany and France are charging 1.4% interest to their microenterprises.  We are charging ours 4.5%, are passing on a relatively high interest rate to companies that are already facing challenges, operating at a loss and in debt, yet we somehow think we are helping them.</p> <p> I will reference another matter that has been mentioned, that being, the risk to banks.  It is as if small business people do not have skin in the game because they only need 80% backing.  There is the concept of moral hazard, but everyone involved in small business has a great deal of skin in the game.  Most people have spent lifetimes wrapped up in their businesses, their employment and their pensions.  There is no sense that they will take off into the sunset with money supplied by the State.  Rather, this money is to resuscitate them and, I hope, get them back into business.</p> <p> A number of business groups have appeared before the Covid committee.  They told us that they needed a quantum of money with few strings attached.  They primarily asked for grants to stimulate and recover the business lost and to protect employment.</p> <p> What are the implications of a fund that does not work at the level required?  First and foremost, there will be SME losses.  The smallest businesses and those in the regions will go the fastest.  There is internal demand in Dublin, but there is less demand in Waterford and far less in Cahersiveen.  These businesses must be protected.  We will have closures, unemployment and rural stagnation.  Many of us outside of Dublin know what that feels like.  How can we ask pillar banks to fund tourism-related businesses through loans when business plans are shot to ribbons?  Has the Minister of State ever tried to sit down with a bank manager and give him or her his projections when his turnover is down 50% and likely to stay that way for the next 12 or 18 months?  See how sympathetic the manager will be and how willing to jump on board to help the business.</p> <p> Debt is toxic, but that message is not getting through.  Grants are needed to shore up balance sheets, particularly of small businesses.  Loans on tops of previous debts make business recovery far more difficult, if not impossible.  This message must get through.</p> <p> What must we implement within this credit guarantee scheme?  All Covid loans being given by the commercial banks, which Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out have been backed by socialised debt for a number of years, need to be extended to five years.  People cannot be asked to start repaying money after one, two or three years when they are incurring losses during the first 12 months they spend back in operation.  The credit guarantee scheme loans up to &euro;1 million.  Its terms should be extended to seven years, given that it is a different quantum of money.  Repayments pose an issue in light of the coupon the Government is proposing to attach to it.  Loan repayments should be deferred for the first 12 months.  This would allow companies to get working capital back into their business.  Instead, we are asking them to give that capital up in order to repay a loan that the State is backing.  If the loans go bad, the State would lose on them anyway.  It makes no sense to me.</p> <p> Debt is toxic whenever turnover is non-existent.  That is a fundamental in business.  Repayment holidays would inject some capital into every business.  Interest rates should be as close to the ECB wholesale margin as possible.  As other Deputies have pointed out, it makes no sense to transfer money, put it back in our business case and then have the State try to add a coupon of its own to try to make something out of the transaction.</p> <p> Why is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, the right vehicle for this purpose?  Why have a banking vehicle that lends to the pillar banks?  It makes no sense to me at all and I have never understood it.  It is time to view the SBCI as a separate bank.  Maybe it is time to change its articles of association and allow it to become a commercial bank.  Why not use it as a vehicle for lending alongside credit unions and post offices?  Can we not be more radical in our thinking and dynamic in the way we view these problems?  There is quite an amount of money in credit unions that is earning no interest.  It could be put into bonds and funds, people could get some return on it and it could be put to work in our communities.  This would be a way of invigorating people's sense of ownership in their areas.</p> <p> I wish to discuss how the finances of our country are measured and GNI* versus GDP.  We moved away from speaking about GDP a while ago, yet when it comes to Europe, we still look at ourselves in GDP terms.  This sometimes leaves us at a significant disadvantage.  In 2019, GDP was &euro;356 billion whereas GNI* was &euro;214 billion, a 40% discrepancy.  This is what happens when we take out the moneys from aircraft leasing, off-balance sheet transactions, the knowledge box and so on, yet we count all of that as if we have created economic value.  It is a myth.  It is ethereal.  It does not exist.  We need to get back to quantifying what we do and what we do not do.</p> <p> Turning to the &euro;750 billion EU package, we are 1% of the European project's population, but I do not believe we are getting &euro;7.5 billion from the EU in rescue funding.  I might be wrong on that.</p> <p> Regarding the July stimulus, it has been said a number of times that we have to revisit VAT rates, in particular for the tourism sector.  We cannot go to 0%, but we can certainly go to 5%.  It might have to return to 9%, but there has to be a VAT holiday for a significant time.  People say that a VAT reduction does not stimulate demand, but it certainly does not hurt demand when prices drop.</p> <p> The Government must examine the issue of rents and utilities.</p> <p>There are significant problems for people who are caught up in upward only rent agreements.  The Government has spoken about this on a number of occasions but it has done nothing about it.  We also need to identify the landlords who are profiteering at a high rate.  There are a number of private companies providing student accommodation in this country that have not returned moneys to hard-pressed families and students who paid in advance for student accommodation.  The Government has done nothing about this as of yet.  I refer to a particular accommodation attached to University College Cork.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State's officials could make inquiries into what is happening in that regard.  A commitment was given through the university that moneys would be returned.</p> <p> On insurance, the reform of this sector has been under way since 2016.  The Minister of State needs to find a means to get behind the significant problem in the sector.  There are industries that are completely monopolised by one insurer such that companies have to take or leave it.  We need to get on top of this issue.</p> <p> Another issue is administration light, in respect of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the issues.  If a company is not turning over in excess of &euro;1 million it cannot afford to seek administrative assistance for its business.  Essentially, it goes under and the liquidators call-in its debts.  Larger companies can turnover that but small companies that are challenged, particularly in these times, need to be protected.  There are plenty of provocative people in the administration area.  The Government needs to consider the introduction of legislation, perhaps emergency legislation, to protect companies that are having their debts called in and being forced into liquidation.  </p> <p> On public sector procurement and the reference earlier to turbo charging a public procurement fund, the Government needs to review and radically reform public procurement, particularly within local authorities and the wider public sector.  There are people in the local authorities who are drafting and awarding tenders every week.  The manner in which the tenders are drafted and grouped does not favour local business.  It makes no sense to me to send Government income into an area and to have people then draft tenders to send it back out again.  The small business people find it too difficult to meet the tender criteria.  This needs to be raised with the people who are giving out money.  People working in procurement for the local authority are like customer services.  They have money to give out to hard pressed businesses and we need that money to stay within the regions.  An examination of the procurement process would take care of that.</p> <p> Ireland has challenges, including Covid-19 and Brexit.  We need to again socialise and save our commercial sector.  We must save our employers and in turn to save our citizens.  The time is now right for dynamic and innovative planning.  I hope that this credit guarantee scheme will be the beginning.  I look forward to the debate to follow in the hope that we will manage to craft legislation that will rescue our SME communities.</p></speech>

The purpose of this Bill is to make particular amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 to support the needs of businesses to access additional finance as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.  I support that principle.  However, I have some concerns.</p>  <p>  In May of this year I engaged with the Minister for Finance on the need to expand the way in which the credit guarantee scheme has operated to date.  At that time, I made the point that microenterprises and SMEs related to agriculture, horticulture and fisheries were excluded from 2012 onwards from the scope of the existing credit guarantee scheme because of particular restrictions in regard to state aid rules.  I was concerned about this and I suggested the introduction of the low interest loan Covid-19 market disruption support scheme which the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, and other farming bodies have called for.  I am happy to note that following my insistence and engagement with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, clarity was brought to this issue and the current Bill goes some way towards addressing these particular concerns.  That said, I would like specific assurances that SMEs related to the agri-sector are not excluded from accessing much-needed finance under this Bill.  This is incredibly important not only because the SME agri-sector has been hit by massive losses but because of the losses being experienced in the wider European context of a potential and highly damaging loss of CAP funding in future years.</p>  <p>  We know that as a net contributor to the EU what we will receive in EU funding is likely to diminish considerably in the long term.  It is important we have equality of access across the different economic sectors and agriculture should be no different.  Rural sectors must not be disadvantaged in a way that would amount to competitive favouritism by any provision contained within this Bill.  I note that one of the conditionalities associated with this Bill is that once the credit guarantee scheme is operational SMEs wishing to avail of the scheme will have to contact a participating Irish bank.  I understand from an analysis performed by Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran that it will be up to the bank to make the necessary assessments and to decide whether it is prepared to grant a loan to the SME.  Based on that Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran analysis it is highly likely that banks will require SMEs availing of credit guarantees to be of "good financial standing and commercially viable".  This is extremely worrying.  I am concerned that a number of SMEs, as a result of this criteria, will be locked out.  It is abundantly clear from recent and historical experience that when we leave it to the banks to determine what "commercially viable" means, trouble inevitably follows for the small farmer, the small businessman or the small businesswoman.  </p>  <p>  There is also a need to bring clarity to how interest rates will be applied to the scheme.  Again, as I understand it, a recent Government press release stated that credit guarantee scheme, CGS, loans will be made available at below market interest rates but the information available on the Department of Finance website and from some participating banks states that the interest rate is the standard SME interest rate plus a premium, which is currently 0.5%.  I find that confusing.  Which is it?  We cannot have any profiteering off the back of this scheme by the banks.  </p>  <p>  I would like to mention the publicans.  Last week was one of the most stressful for the 3,499 pubs that were due to reopen.  The lack of consultation only compounded the issue.  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly there are approximately 135 pubs affected.  If even a fraction of them were forced to close permanently, this would represent a massive blow to an already struggling region that is undergoing radical disruption under the just transition process.  The vintners have said that they will need grants of approximately &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 to survive.  I support that call.  What will this Bill do for those particular businesses that cannot contemplate further debt through loans, even low interest loans?  It is clear that what we need is a whole-of-Government approach where no business is excluded.  Everything from finance to the Department of Finance, local government and commercial rates must be brought into the  mix if our SMEs and microenterprises are to survive and thrive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="20:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100046#VV00500"><p>I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy English.  I am very concerned.  Like many speakers tonight I support the thrust of the Bill and the need for it.  With no disrespect to the departmental officials present, the Bill is drawn up by mandarins in the Department.  This is a problem for me.  Why do we not have business people in here who can be consulted and engaged with and who could then draw up a Bill?  This scheme will be a failure.  I do not want to be a prophet of doom and gloom or to be pessimistic but we already have rates waivers for business people who pay VAT and are registered for tax yet throughout July the councils sent out the July moiety of the rates for the next six months.</p> <p>I understand they have to do that under law but businesses have not got a shilling, not a red cent, from the previous or current Government.</p> <p> All the promises are rolling out.  First, the Government said it would be &euro;2 billion and now that will be &euro;1.5 billion, or whatever.  It is all schemes and rhymes but it is not practicable or workable.  It will hit ordinary businesspeople until such time as we tackle the utility companies, the insurance companies and the banks.  The banks are not functioning.  Why is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, in charge of the scheme?  Will it lend to its friends in the pillar banks - AIB, Bank of Ireland and some others - which are not functioning?</p> <p> The Minister of State stated this is the largest credit guarantee ever.  It is, but what about the bank bailout?  That was the biggest whopper we ever did.  My children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren and all our grandchildren will be paying it back.  Let us cut out the baloney.  We are in a huge crisis and pandemic.  I have called it a scamdemic.  The more I see of these schemes, and the more I see of what is going on, I am beginning to see I was 100% right.  There is scamming everywhere.  The banks are going to look at these business people, and if they do not have a good credit history, a line will be put through them straight away.  The banks are not functioning.  They are functioning to make profits.  We fought hard in the previous D&aacute;il and before it to bring in a model based on that of Kiwibank in New Zealand or that which existed in Germany.  I thought that in Germany, it would all be companies such as Volkswagen that we are well aware of.  When I was doing research, I was shocked to find out that between 80% and 85% of companies in Germany are small or medium enterprises, but they are supported.  There are community banks and the profits go back into the community.</p> <p> This is a bad start for the Government.  It and several of its predecessors are in hock to the banks.  We seem to be able just to adore and admire them on high, and we cannot say a word to them.  During parliamentary questions last week, I happened to be in the Chair when the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, did not come to the Chamber.  I know there were different circumstances, but nonetheless we need answers and he is not here tonight either.  He needs to get down and dirty instead of the Flash Harry kind of stuff he has on his Twitter, with #Leo and hashtag this and hashtag that.  He should get down to the ordinary people who are trying to put food on the table, who are trying to employ themselves, keep themselves employed and employ other people.</p> <p> This is all about jobs in the regions and it is SMEs that provide them.  Our tourism industry is on its knees.  It has not got a shilling.  While those businesses that provide public services have got money and have received 50% of the funding, I am talking about the whole tourism industry if we get the borders open and if we become a green country again.  It is more important that our country flourishes before we talk about green zones throughout the world.  We should look after ourselves.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We should look after our people, but I do not believe that this scheme will do so or that it has the ability to do so.  We have not touched the insurance industry, banking legislation or the utility companies.  A hotelier in my town of Clonmel paid almost &euro;9,000 in utility charges incurred while his hotel was closed.  God almighty.  That is daylight, night-time and 24-7 robbery.  It is a plundering.  Businesses are being plundered but the utility companies are getting away with it and are not being tackled.</p> <p> Earlier I raised a very sensible idea.  We are looking for a VAT reduction and the Government is minded not to give it, but it must give incentives to people so they will go out and spend.  I was contacted by a number of hoteliers and ordinary bed and breakfast owners.  There are many in my area and they are well noted.  If the Ceann Comhairle gets an opportunity on his staycation this year, he might come down to the Nire Valley, to Hanora's Cottage and to O'Gorman's of Glasha.  One will not get the like of them in the country: the hosts, the cuisine, the area and the way they look after people.</p></speech>

The Minister of State need not worry; I am always around.  A gang of his crowd arrived one night in January in a kind of clandestine raid to Hanora's Cottage in the Nire Valley.  I happened to turn up and knocked on the door, and the poor woman, Mrs. Mary Wall, nearly collapsed.  When I arrived, there were five or six of us, and they enjoyed it and I enjoyed it.  We were well looked after, with a nice drop of the craythur, a roaring turf fire, wonderful food and splendid mountains to climb.</p><p>As has been shown again with this pandemic, everything is booked online.  It is online, online, online.  It is all card payment, no cash.  Every time we make a booking, whether on <i>booking.com</i>or numerous other booking agencies, between 10% and 20% of the cost of the sale is taken by the companies.  Whether it is a bed for a night, a meal, a trip on a bus, a boat tour on a lake or whatever, between 10% and 20% is being creamed off by those companies.  One must deal with simple matters such as that.  We should try to curtail it.  Such companies have to live too but they should be given 5% instead, for example.  A charge of 10% or 15% cancels out a 12.5% VAT waiver.  The money is flowing out of the country and we cannot seem to see it.  We need to get down and dirty and get in business people such as Michael O'Leary or the many other self-made people who have started companies.  I am sure they will be attacked for having low-paid workers.  I am an employer myself.  Almost all small employers look after their staff well and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is a two-way street.</p><p>The scheme is doomed to failure.  It is too slow and has been nobbled by the banks.  They will have control of it and we know they will do what they have always done.  I am asking the Minister of State, even though it is probably falling on deaf ears.  He is wearing a face mask tonight but the Government has a mask around its ears.  It does not seem to understand what makes ordinary people tick, what makes a man get up in the morning, be self-employed and borrow.  The Government is trying to roll the credit unions out of business altogether.  The Minister of State is a Meath man and he should know it.  He should talk to the small employers there about what they want.  It is not loans at these interest rates.  They should be paying no interest.  They need stimulus and grants, but above all, they need to be allowed to live.  The Government should cut out the cabal of the insurance companies, the banks and the utility companies, robbing businesses in daylight every day.</p></speech>

While I am grateful for the thrust of the scheme, like Deputy Mattie McGrath I am doubtful of it.  The banks will be the distributors.  I was once told the banks will give a person money if he or she does not need it and if he or she has a good credit rating.  If a person needs money, however, the banks will not give it.  That is the truth of the matter.</p>  <p>  There are many problems specific to Kerry, in respect of seasonal workers, hotel workers, bus drivers and so on.  Take, for example, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, of &euro;350.  Many seasonal workers who work in hotels, drive buses or are otherwise involved in the tourism industry did not receive it because they had not been working for the week of 6 March to 13 March.  If the lockdown had not come for another fortnight, all of them would have been working.  Now the story about them is that their stamps have run down and they will not get jobseeker's allowance.</p>  <p>  On top of that, many of them will not qualify for the wage subsidy scheme either, because the guidelines state that applicants had to be working in January and February.  Hotels, therefore, that called back their workers are not entitled to the scheme and they too are caught.  I ask the Government to deal with that.  If someone worked for a lower number of hours, as some people did in January and February, employers can receive the wage subsidy based only on that number of hours.  I want the Government to address that.</p>  <p>  Many people over the age of 66 years who feel they have been left behind employ people.  I refer to people such as publicans.  One woman rang me all the way from Donegal when it was announced last weekend that pubs would not be allowed to reopen.  She and her daughter run a pub.  In April she turned 66 years old.  She has many commitments and outstanding bills to pay, like a lot of other publicans.  Many of them are older and all they get is their old age pension, which is not sufficient to pay the outstanding utility bills, whether they are for water, additional electricity or other charges that accrue.  Such people were employing others.  Those who are over the age of 66 should at least have been given as much as the PUP of &euro;350.</p> <p> There are several other matters to consider, such as the plight of businesses in sectors such as farming and fishing.  I ask the Government to consider the people involved in these sectors.  There is much talk about creating jobs but we must try to retain the jobs we traditionally had and which have worked.  We need to help businesses connected to farmers and fishermen.</p> <p> Others have been forgotten, including musicians who used to play around the counties and were paid for it and singers.  These people have been left behind.  We can take the likes of Siamsa T&iacute;re in Tralee as an example.  Siamsa T&iacute;re has done wonderful work promoting youngsters between the ages of 15 to 18 and has taken them all over the world.  The people involved with  Siamsa T&iacute;re got them going and recognised over the years.  It has had to close and, although it needs money, it cannot fundraise.  The Minister of State knows the groups that do so much work cannot fundraise so I ask the Government to consider their plight.  On top of everything else that the pandemic has done to people, we do not want to lose our culture.  We do not want to lose what people brought us over centuries and that they want to carry us into the future.  We must recognise that.</p> <p> I spoke about Skellig Michael earlier and I appeal to the Government to open the island again.  A part of the problem in getting it reopened is the cost of insurance for boatmen.  When paying insurance, these workers used to be able to spread their payments over a longer period but now their time working has been practically halved, assuming the island will be reopened.  Their premium will now be more than they can afford.  I ask the Government to help people like them.  It is important to consider how just that one place could affect all south Kerry.  We can think of the spin-off effect if we could even get it going at a slow pace.  The national park and traditional farmhouses in Killarney are closed but there is more in the area.  People are struggling because when places were open during the lockdown, it cost them much more.  People have not been remunerated and it is likely that those businesses will be in serious trouble.</p> <p> We have weathered much this year but next year we will see trouble.  We are looking to the new Government to do something to help retain the jobs and businesses we have had.  Many of those businesses will be in trouble next year and the banks are not the ones to save them.  I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to my comments about the pubs because as what has happened in that sector is totally unfair.  As I said last week, how does the virus know a person is eating a meal while drinking a pint?  It is absolutely ridiculous but as the Government kept the pubs closed, it must do something about giving the owners grants rather than loans.  These people have enough loans to repay.  I am asking the Government to look after the publicans in rural Ireland because if it does not, some of them will never open their doors again.  I mean that.</p></speech>

That process was introduced, ostensibly, to make the position fairer and to ensure fair competition.  From my limited experience of four years on the Committee of Public Accounts, however, it seems that there are serious problems in the way the process operates to the disadvantage of businesses in Galway and other areas.  It certainly must be looked at.  I understand that it was being examined, although I forget which Department was involved.  It would be great if the Minister of State could clarify the matter because we were in receipt of ongoing representations from the likes of the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, which highlighted the problems relating to procurement.</p>  <p>  As I always do, I thank the Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service.  I realise that it is under pressure but it has produced an excellent document to give us an overview of the Government's proposal and previous legislation from 2012 and 2016.  It is important to thank the Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service because it does a great job in educating us.  If we do not follow through on that, it is our own fault.</p>  <p>  Before getting into the intricacies of the matter, it seems Deputy Boyd Barrett has absolutely captured the nub of it.  We are setting up a &euro;2 billion fund, which is good to make credit available but this will be done through three pillar banks while ensuring that their level of risk is tiny.  We should really be looking at community banking.  The Opposition tried to suggest this to the previous Government, which said it could not be done, although other countries, such as New Zealand and Germany, have done it.  We are now looking at the three pillar banks to do this.  Although I will get to the minutiae, I must state that what is being suggested seems incredible.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is absolutely right in saying this is socialism for the banks and capitalism for the taxpayer.  I could not have put it any better than he has.</p>  <p>  To put it in context, we are being told that this credit guarantee scheme will be the largest of its type in the history of the State.  As with the existing credit guarantee scheme, it will be operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  We have been told that all loans and credit facilities will be made available through the three participating banks, which are AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  I listened carefully to the Minister of State and I understood that this is open to other credit institutions.  I am not sure why we do not know who they are.  When will we know?  I am sure the Minister of State will clarify that when he speaks again.</p></speech>

The sum involved is &euro;2 billion and liability to the State is to be capped at &euro;1.6 billion.  I will not get into the detail, particularly as it has been mentioned by many speakers before me.  We do not know the interest rate.  We have been told it is expected to be low and the rate will be reduced because the cap on the portfolio is gone.  The Government seems to be anticipating this but there is no guarantee at all that the interest rate will go down.</p>  <p>  We have all received letters from the bus and coach operators.  Among many points and recommendations these people tell us that the existing credit guarantee scheme needs to be altered in order to address the needs of small business because interest rates are too high.  The same points apply to this.  We know the uptake on the current scheme has been very low.  I am looking at the Covid-19 business supports tracker from 3 July.  The existing scheme was set up in 2012 and only 867 approvals had been made by this year.  I am not sure if these materialised into loans.  Different figures have been used tonight but what is absolutely clear is that the scheme was underutilised from 2012.  The value of total approvals made in eight years was &euro;152.56 million, while there was authorisation to go to &euro;150 million every year.</p>  <p>  We can consider the review, which was, unfortunately, carried out in 2013.  I would have thought the scheme could have been reviewed more frequently.  A second process was carried out by Indecon in 2019 but the credit guarantee scheme was only a small part of that analysis.  These analyses indicate that the existing scheme is too cumbersome and restricted, with too narrow a time span and many other weaknesses.</p> <p>It has taken a pandemic for the Government to put legislation before us to change the existing scheme.  I would have thought that a scheme which has been in place since 2012 and which was, given the importance of SMEs to the economy, under-functioning should have been reviewed and changed.  I know that legislation was brought forward in 2016 with some limited changes but that did not alter the level of uptake relating to the scheme.  The latter went up only slightly.  If we look at figures in isolation, we see that the sanctions went up, and that is welcome, but we have to put it in context of the number of enterprises in Ireland.  The Minister of State quoted the numbers, and they are staggering.  SMEs alone account for 99.8% or 255,000 of active enterprises in Ireland, representing 70.1% of all employment and generating 41.5% of the gross value added in the economy.  The Minister of State knows that, and he has quoted the figures.  We all know the position but it is worth focusing on those figures.</p> <p> Until the past few weeks when I took a particular interest in the legislation before us, I had not realised the importance of SMEs and microenterprises to the country and in the context of employment.  When we look at the figures and see that the existing scheme is not being used, I have worries that this scheme will not be used or that businesses will not draw down the loans being provided because of the interest rates involved and their experiences to date.  As other speakers stated, it is also adding to their indebtedness.</p> <p> There is a lack of clarity regarding the criteria that will be used.  I understand that a statutory instrument will bring in the fishermen, the farmers and other mid-caps, if that is the correct reference.  Again, there is lack of clarity on that or on when it will happen.</p> <p> In the context of the speed with which this measure is being dealt- this has been commented on by other Deputies - I realise that there is urgency required.  However, we have been aware for months - and we certainly know from the report produced by the Central Bank in April - that liquidity is a big problem for businesses.  It is now July and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett indicated, we are again rushing legislation through the D&aacute;il.  As with the legislation last week, which I spent a lot of time trying to get my head around, I have a difficulty.  I will support the Bill but I am supporting something that I am not entirely happy with.  I am supporting legislation in respect of which a regulatory impact analysis has not been carried out because of the speed with which we are being asked to put the legislation through the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> I look again at what the Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service has told us, which is that a short regulatory impact analysis was produced for this Bill by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The key points are included in table 4, which outlines the costs and the competitiveness.  The benefits are then considered and the analysis concludes: "North-South, East-West Relations, Gender Equality Benefits - None." and "Poverty Proofing, Industry Costs, Quality Regulation Benefits - None."  I am not sure how to interpret that but Social Justice Ireland, and I quoted it last week, tells us that, prior to the pandemic, rural areas generally had older populations, higher rates of part-time employment, lower medium incomes, higher dependency ratios and higher poverty ratios than the national average.  The Library &amp;amp; Research Service's material goes on to quote from a report I have previously used from the regional assemblies which looked at the impact of Covid-19 on a regional basis.  Their finding that the regions and the rural areas - and they mention Donegal, Kerry, Galway, Clare, Cavan and a number of other counties - are all suffering much more than other places because of Covid-19 is not surprising, yet there is no impact analysis as part of this legislation, which is very difficult to accept and to vote for.</p> <p> There has been a great deal of discussion about the new green way in Europe, and I welcome that.  I am looking forward to seeing the details of it but none of this legislation so far has mentioned climate change or our obligations in that regard.  We have stated on the one hand that we cannot go back to the way things were and that we have to learn from the Covid-19 pandemic and go forward.  On the other hand, we are actually making things worse in my opinion.  To take one example in Galway, we decided to run a cycle route out in Salthill on a pilot basis.  It worked a treat.  Under pressure, I understand, the local authority has stopped that.  It is gone.  The local authority bent to pressure and the traffic on the road is almost back to the way it was previously, at the same time that the Government is giving out a daily message that we should not use public transport.  The Minister of State should reflect on that message.  He should make public transport ready to use during the Covid pandemic.</p> <p> I am an example of someone who used public transport and I am now putting a car on the road, much to my shame.  I am part of a message going out to say do not use public transport, at a time when we have declared a climate emergency.  The Minister of State has got to reflect on that message and on what needs to be done to get public transport back in full use.  He has to tell us what he is doing for those in the bus and coach industry.  They have written to the Minister and to the Government on many occasions with very practical suggestions.  We cannot say that we are serious about climate change and the biodiversity crisis we have and that we will never go back to the way we were when we are doing that with every measure we are taking.  I have repeatedly stated that I represent Galway West and south Mayo, taking in the Aran Islands, Inisboffin and all of the rural areas in Connemara and beyond, namely, Kilmaine, Shrule, Cong and Galway city.  I stand here for sustainable development for my city and my county, not on a parochial level but because we need to do it for every county.</p> <p> We are getting a fund of &euro;2 billion.  We are guaranteeing it.  We are letting the banks set the interest rate, and we see nothing wrong with that.  I am a party to the debate on this legislation, which is giving the thumbs up to the banks to set whatever interest rate they want when struggling businesses want to access funds that we are getting at a zero rate.  That does not make sense to me.  What also makes no sense to me is that we are not looking at the sustainability of businesses, certainly from a financial and a business point of view but also in terms of the environment, climate change and energy.  We should be looking at all of that in regard to funds.</p> <p> Finally, we are not looking at grants at all.  We are giving out loans to companies and small businesses that are already indebted and that, according to the Central Bank's report, have liquidity problems.  Surely grants would make much more sense in view of the fact that we are accessing money at a very cheap rate.</p> <p> I intend to reflect on whether I will support this legislation.  I am inclined to support it because the concept behind it is very good.  We already covered small businesses and microbusinesses in other recent legislation.  The fishermen and farmers need our help but they do not need it in circumstances where they are going to be further indebted and in more trouble.  We need to look at sustainability on more than a financial level.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge the involvement of our stakeholders, who could not be with us today due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>I thank each and every one of them for their campaigning, advice and expert opinion.  This motion was drafted in close consultation with the childcare and early years sector and has been significantly influenced by the hundreds of emails from parents, workers and providers in the sector that both myself and my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have received.</p> <p> Families are crying out for a high quality childcare system that is affordable, accessible and sustainable.  It is obvious to everyone here and to the wider public that the early years sector is in crisis.  The current funding model is failing everyone.  It is failing children, their families, their educators and childcare providers.</p> <p> As the party spokesperson on children, disability, equality and integration, and as a mother of two boys, I am keenly aware on a personal level the serious issues facing the sector.</p> <p> Childcare was in crisis before Covid and during Covid and it will remain in crisis after Covid if the Government does not seriously commit to sustainable investment in the sector.  I and my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues believe strongly that this phase in a young child&rsquo;s life should be recognised as a distinct phase with unique learning and developmental requirements and all funding models should reflect this.  While other parties suggest tax credits will reduce costs, they will do nothing to address the pay of workers.  The childcare sector and the workers deserve better.</p> <p> I am constantly contacted by parents, workers and providers wanting to share their experience of using, working and operating in, unfortunately, what has become a broken system.  I know I am not the only Deputy in the Chamber who is witnessing the failings of the current funding model in their constituencies.</p> <p> The major issue facing the sector is sustainable funding.  Our early years sector must be resourced adequately to provide lower fees for parents, stability for workers and sustainable businesses for providers.  There are three main areas that this motion seeks to address.  First are the workers.  Of the approximately 30,000 workers in the early years sector many, who have spent several years at college studying and furthering their professional development and are extremely experienced and qualified after a lifetime in the sector, are still earning less than the living wage.  Many do not get sick leave and many have to sign on for social welfare during the summer break.  Yesterday, SIPTU published a survey, the Big Start Campaign, showing more than one quarter of all surveyed have suffered significant pay cuts post Covid.  It also shows that 32% indicated they intend to leave the sector due to low pay.  I know they do not want to leave the sector, but they are being forced out.</p> <p> This needs to be addressed and one move the Government could take immediately is to reinstate the wage subsidy scheme and extend it past the end of 2020.  Workers would have certainty and providers could concentrate on educating our young citizens.  In response to Covid a key and critical component of our plan was implemented: the State took on the wage bill, so it is possible to do this.</p> <p> Parents are burdened with some of the highest fees in Europe, which evidence shows creates a significant barrier to maternal employment.  Women are adversely affected by higher fees and forced to stay out of the workforce while their children are small.</p> <p> As workers and parents are squeezed at one end of the system, childcare providers, mainly small businesses and predominately managed and owned by women, are being squeezed at the other end.  The vast majority of childcare providers are delivering high quality education to our young children at an important stage in their learning and emotional development.</p> <p> The programme for Government rightly states that childcare should &ldquo;promote quality, better outcomes for children and make a career in childcare more attractive&rdquo;, but what is the Government&rsquo;s plan to deliver this?  To date we have seen lower wages for its workers, parents are more or less guaranteed fees will continue to rise and providers fear closure due to inadequate funding</p> <p> The motion sets out three clear objectives that Sinn F&eacute;in believes will deliver a fairer deal for the provision of childcare.  We are failing children, we are failing workers and we are failing childcare providers if this motion is not passed.  I am asking every Deputy here tonight please to support this motion and finally to give childcare and the early year&rsquo;s sector the funding and the recognition it deserves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100051#BBB00200"><p>This Sinn F&eacute;in motion, tabled by my party colleague, Deputy Kathleen Funchion, sets out to address the three big issues in the early years childcare sector.  The first of these is the crippling costs of childcare to working families.  The second is the lack of real respect, fairness and remuneration for the 30,000 highly qualified and skilled workers who deserve career opportunities and recognition for the essential work they do.  Finally, I refer to the need for financial support in the form of the 100% restoration of Covid-19 temporary wage subsidy scheme to enable childcare providers to continue to operate.  It is time to decide.  Either we see the early years sector as a cost and a burden to the State or we see it as an opportunity to invest in our most precious commodity, our children and our families.  It is an opportunity to invest in something that will give back many times over.</p>  <p>  In economics, we talk about the multiplier effect.  Investing in our children and the early years sector certainly has the multiplier effect.  While many multinational companies and financial institutions look for all kinds of innovative ways to shift their profits to avoid paying our corporation tax rate of 12.5%, this sector has been starved of investment and acutely underfunded for many years.  It is not by chance that we are the lowest-ranking country in the EU when it comes to investment in our early years sector.  Apart from the benefits of protecting the health, well-being and education of our children, the sector enables parents to work outside of the home, progressing their careers and returning higher levels of taxation and spending to underpin economic growth.</p>  <p>  The families that are most affected by this are entitled to nothing.  They pay through the nose for everything, including healthcare, school transport, third level education and everything else in between.  It is time to give these families a break.  I urge the Minister of State to use this opportunity to set out a new vision, underpinned by proper investment in our early years and childcare sector.</p></speech>

I wish to show my support for this motion and I strongly recommend that the other Members of this House also support it.  The childcare industry has seen a serious lack of investment on the part of successive Governments.  This has led to rising fees for parents while workers in the sector are paid some of the lowest wages among their peers.  This is shameful, but it is the unfortunate reality.</p>  <p>  Childcare costs are far too high here.  They are among the highest in the EU.  I can still remember, as I canvassed with my team during the run-up to the February election, continuously hearing about the same issue concerning childcare throughout the whole constituency of Clare, namely, the issue of cost.  The cost is not manageable and every week and every month is stressful.  I was stopped at many doors listening to many parents telling me of their struggles to pay for childcare, finding themselves questioning whether it is worth returning to work following the end of their period of maternity leave.  Some mothers told me they were sitting at home with their partners, adding up the costs, weighing their options, trying to make ends meet and struggling.  One mother told me of the real hardship of trying to work out if she could afford to go back to work after the birth of her third child.  This lady was working full-time with the HSE and earning a good wage, but she was still left in a position where she had to question whether she could justify the outrageous cost of childcare.</p>  <p>  I was deeply saddened to learn that other women I heard from had no choice at all.  They simply could not afford childcare and had to leave their jobs.  This is a disastrous state to be in.  No family should be worse off at the end of the week due to the cost of childcare or have to make these truly difficult decisions.  We must also ensure that the amazing staff working in our early years sector are paid properly for the work they do.  They are highly qualified and skilled and the value of their work often goes unnoticed.  It is about time they get the fair pay they deserve.  Again, I strongly encourage all Members of this House to support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100051#BBB00400"><p>Childcare,a two-syllable word, is enough to put the heart across any parent, first from finding it, then from paying for it.  Fees are among the highest in Europe.</p> <p>It could be called the baby mortgage.  Parents who are already working flat out to keep a very expensive roof over their heads are paying an absolute fortune for the privilege of dropping their children off in the dark of the morning and collecting them in the dark of the night for most of the year.  Many parents remarked to me that they have enjoyed being able to see their children in the light of day mid-week during the Covid crisis, which has raised new issues and is something we must consider as a society.  With workplaces now reopening, what parents need most is affordable childcare.</p> <p> We have excellent childcare workers in Ireland.  They are highly skilled and very well qualified.  The problem is the extent to which they are valued by the Government.  Parents value them.  They hand over the most precious loves of their lives to be cared for while they go out to work.  However, the Government has repeatedly shown that it believes these highly qualified childcare providers and early educators should be paid approximately the minimum wage.</p> <p> I have spoken to many cr&egrave;ches and childcare providers in north Kildare.  Some of them have been forced to close their doors.  The Government must step in or many of them will find it impossible to carry on.</p> <p> We must rethink how we look at the sector.  We must invest in it.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants better.  We want more for our people.  We want to be able to give families a chance and workers a break.  By and large, those are the same thing.  In the greater scheme of things, restoring the 100% wage subsidy scheme would subsidise everybody.  By looking after one group, we would look after the other.  Look after each other and we look after our community.  I commend my comrade, Deputy Funchion, on the motion.  I hope the House will support it.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Funchion on tabling it.  Childcare in Ireland is at crisis point and has been so since long before Covid.  It has been edging towards disaster for years, but little or nothing has been done to address the situation.  It is now urgent.  The cost of childcare was astronomical even before Covid.  Prices are now being forced upwards again as a result of restrictions on numbers due to Covid and the cost of necessary personal protective equipment, PPE, and deep cleaning essentials.  This means higher costs for parents.</p>  <p>  The State needs to take responsibility for childcare.  UNICEF recommends that 1% of GDP be spent on childcare.  Ireland is lagging well behind in that regard.  It is behind the majority of EU countries.  The average cost of childcare is &euro;184 per week.  For families with two children who require care, that means almost &euro;400 per week or &euro;1,600 per month.  That is more than the cost of a second mortgage.  It is not sustainable for families.  Many couples are faced with the prospect of one parent giving up work to stay at home to care for their children.  They have no other choice.</p>  <p>  Many staff working in childcare facilities have level 7 or level 8 degrees but are in receipt of the minimum wage.  It is no wonder that staff retention is a problem.</p>  <p>  I recently spoke to a parent who had to take 16 weeks' unpaid leave at the end of her maternity leave as she could not find a childcare service that would take her child.  She was told that children under one year of age could not be accommodated.  She could not afford to take the unpaid leave.  She did not know what she was going to do when her 16 weeks were up as she still could not find suitable and affordable childcare but had to return to work.</p>  <p>  It is time for greater investment to ensure affordability for parents and proper wages for workers.  Immediate action should be taken to reinstate the wage subsidy scheme at the full amount.  In addition, there must be a gradual increase in investment in the childcare sector to try to improve the wages of workers and reduce fees for parents.  It is time to start moving towards a publicly funded model of childcare.</p></speech>

She has championed this issue for many years and brought it to the fore.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Wynne, stated that childcare was the number one issue on doorsteps during the general election campaign.  The Minister will be aware that in the week of the general election there was a massive rally in Dublin.  Tens of thousands of people, many of them workers in the childcare industry, came onto the streets.  They were marching for decent pay, to ensure that the future of childcare was protected and that families could afford childcare for their children.  They were marching for their work and education and the courses they undertake to be reflected and valued by the Government as they are by Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  Two-income families with two children struggle with childcare costs, but for single-income families the burden is even greater.  People need to see some positive action and they need a break.  If the motion is agreed to, it will be a good day for families, workers and businesses.  I refer to the many parents, mainly mothers, who have invested in their education, earned promotions and established themselves in their jobs but whose achievements are being risked because, to put it simply, childcare costs are too high.  Affordable childcare makes sense.  It is an economic necessity.  Without it, skilled workers will be forced from the workplace.</p>  <p>  The current childcare system is not just a difficulty for families of children being cared for, it is unfair on staff.  Working in childcare is not an easy job.  Aside from the qualifications and skills required, a particular temperament is needed.  The workers are often paid close to or slightly more than the minimum wage.  How can we expect these skilled professionals to make childcare a long-term career choice?  We cannot do so.  Every year, more and more childcare professionals switch careers to avail of opportunities in other sectors.  How could one blame them?  They deserve at least a living wage.  Of course, judging by the vote last week in the House, the living wage will remain just a dream.</p>  <p>  The wage subsidy scheme was crucial at the height of the pandemic.  It saved jobs.  However, it has since been reduced to 85%.  It needs to be restored to 100%.  If that is not done, there is a risk of increased fees, lower wages and the closure of childcare facilities, which would only worsen the existing difficulties.</p>  <p>  The average cost of childcare is &euro;184 per week or &euro;744 for four weeks.  How can single parents who wish to work and own a home afford childcare?  After childcare costs, how can they afford a mortgage?  These costs are just not sustainable for young families.  The Sinn F&eacute;in proposal would see the average cost drop to &euro;160 per week within a year of its implementation.  I am proud to support the motion.  I thank Deputy Funchion for tabling it and I urge all Members to support it.</p></speech>

Cuireann s&eacute; bac agus constaic ar dhaoine dul ag obair n&oacute; &oacute; thaobh ioncaim de.  Most parents I know who look for childcare simply cannot find it.  Even if they do find it, they very often cannot afford it.  The reality is that the model of childcare and early education that successive Governments have relied upon for many years was all but broken anyway.  The pandemic has just made the cracks more obvious.  They have become crevices.</p>  <p>  I have a young family.  My two boys are nine months and nine years of age.  This is a significant issue for my generation.  The cost of childcare has been allowed to spiral to eye-watering levels which simply are not affordable for ordinary families and workers.  Ireland has among the highest childcare costs in the EU.  It is unfair and unsustainable.  Without affordable childcare, many parents, particularly mothers, are being forced out of the workplace.  It is preventing people from going to work or going back to work.  It is the cost of a second mortgage.  It is crippling people.  In many instances, the cost of childcare accounts for an entire income.  Some people find that they must give up their entire income to pay for childcare in order that they can get back to work and sustain their career.  People are faced with these absolutely unfair decisions.</p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Funchion on tabling the motion.  We need to decide whether we wish to treat childcare and early education as a public good and a public service.  We must move towards a radical transformation.  There will be significant changes in society in the coming years.  Central to that has to be a model of childcare and early education that is flexible, affordable and responds to people's needs.  It is in the interests of society, the economy and families.  Deputy Funchion has brought forward an ambitious and comprehensive plan that involves yearly increases to ensure sustainability and reduced fees and to ensure fair and lower costs.</p>  <p>  The situation faced by childcare workers and early years professionals is one of the major workers' rights issues in society.  N&iacute;l an t-ioncam a bhfaigheann siad ceart go leor.  In many instances, workers who have achieved very high qualifications, sometimes at their own cost or with very little support, are still on very low wages.  The situation needs to be resolved urgently.  I urge the Minister not to take the attitude taken by the previous Minister, who asked the workers to organise themselves and get a particular number of the workers involved in a union, at which stage a sectoral employment order, SEO, could be put in place.  There are already significant questions over the SEO system.  If the Government is to be the main funder of childcare, as is the case currently, then it needs to insist on a labour unit cost in the context of ensuring that those who are employed through its funding receive a fair wage.</p> <p>It has to be built into the calculations that go into any subsidy or funding scheme.  They cannot be operating on the basis of assuming the work only costs this much.  The work has to be paid well.  The Minister has control over that and I urge him not to wash his hands of it.</p></speech>

I congratulate Deputy Funchion on her appointment to the role of spokesperson and I look forward to working with her and the other spokespersons as we seek to ensure the highest possible standard of early learning and care for our children and our young people.  I am pleased to have this opportunity, as newly appointed Minister with responsibility for children, disability, equality and integration to present my own vision and that of the new Government for a transformation of early learning and childcare services in the State.</p><p>I am tabling an amendment to this motion.  Although the Government accepts that there is an urgent need to continue to develop and reform the early learning and childcare sector, we believe the actions set out in the programme for Government are the best way to bring real and lasting development and change that will benefit children, parents, the sector and its workers.  Before discussing the various policy elements relevant to this sector, I want to begin by recognising the valuable work being done every day by early learning and childcare practitioners and service providers, including childminders.  The commitment of the people who work in the sector to the children they look after is unquestionable.  I have met a number of early learning and care and school age childcare providers and their representative groups in the past few weeks and their dedication to the children they educate and care for is obvious.  I have been particularly struck by the positive experiences which providers have shared with me on the return of children to childcare centres since 29 June.</p></speech>

When the childcare providers and schools closed their doors in March, many parents were juggling working full-time while caring for their children at home.  For children, growing up during the pandemic has meant missing school and friends.  This has been a profoundly difficult time for everybody but both parents and children have shown real resilience and compassion since this crisis began.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that Government has been able to support providers since they were closed by Covid and particularly as they reopen their services.  I also refer to what a majority of childcare providers are saying regarding the lifeline that the financial supports to date are providing to the sector and that the continuance of these supports will help them to bring their business back to full health.</p>  <p>  The Covid pandemic has undoubtedly been extremely difficult for the early years sector, coming as it did after a number of challenges in 2019.  My Department has provided tailored supports for the sector to try to reduce the impact on service sustainability as much as possible.  The most recent package of &euro;75 million provided for services reopening from 29 June, including access to the Revenue's temporary wage subsidy scheme to cover up to 85% of staff wages; reactivation of Department of Children and Youth Affairs childcare schemes; a capital grant to assist with purchase of equipment or minor capital works-----</p></speech>

As we turn to the next phase of reopening from September onwards, I will be working with my Government colleagues on measures to continue to support the childcare sector in the period from 24 August onwards.</p>  <p>  I turn to the issue of investment in the early learning and childcare sector.  The Government has clearly set out the need for increased investment in childcare.  The past five years saw a significant increase in State funding by 141%.  Obviously, it has to be acknowledged that this was coming from an extremely low base.  This sector received virtually no State support for decades.  We are still catching up on this historic failure to invest.  As the Opposition has said, parents in Ireland pay very high childcare costs.  Like Deputy Wynne, when I meet constituents in Dublin West, many parents describe childcare fees to me as essentially a second mortgage.  This is not sustainable for parents, society or the economy, and reducing the fees which parents pay is a key objective of the Government.  The Government is committed to increasing funding and I want to use this to build on the national childcare scheme and make increased subsidies available to more parents.  I want to continue to develop the ECCE free preschool scheme, and the access and inclusion model for children with additional needs.  I want to make more childcare places available so that parents have real choice, and I want to improve the quality of service offered to children.  State support for childcare has traditionally been targeted at centre-based childcare provision.  We will provide financial supports for parents who choose other types of childcare, such as childminding.  I also want to support those parents who choose to look after their children themselves.</p>  <p>  To ensure that this extra State investment delivers as effectively as possible on affordability and quality, I will ensure that the new funding model for the sector being developed by an expert group will be delivered next year.  This group is examining models from across the world to design a model for Ireland that will ensure that extra investment will be used to support a sustainable and high-quality service, while ensuring that parental fees are significantly reduced.  I will ensure that there is an evidence base for the policies I will implement and I will consult with all stakeholders to ensure that their voices are heard, including parents, practitioners and service providers.</p>  <p>  In addition to developing a new funding model for the sector, I believe that structural reform is needed to ensure an effective system for the oversight and delivery of childcare services.  This Government has committed to establish a new national childcare agency, Childcare Ireland, to assist in the expansion of high-quality childcare, spearheading leadership, best practice and innovation.  Its goal will be to ensure that childcare is affordable, accessible and of high quality.  The creation of such an agency was a key ask of service providers in the sector.  As this measure is a significant element of the Government's commitment in this area, I will be bringing forward a memo to the Cabinet next week to advance the development of Childcare Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am committed to leading on the further professionalisation of the early learning and care workforce.  All childcare staff currently have qualifications of a least a level 5, with 25% of the staff having degrees.  I want to increase the proportion of graduates in this sector to ensure that we retain staff and that they have rewarding and fulfilling careers.  The workforce development planning group will publish an interim report by the end of this year and a final report in 2021.  The final report will set out a series of actions to ensure that by 2028, 50% of staff in the sector are graduates and that there is an attractive career structure with clear career pathways and a funded and accessible continuous professional development, CPD, programme for staff.</p>  <p>  The Opposition has accurately pointed out that Ireland has low staff wages in the childcare sector.  This has to change if we are to show that we value this workforce and if we are to attract and retain staff.  The staff need to be rewarded appropriately.</p> <p>I am fully committed to the introduction of a mechanism to determine minimum rates of pay and terms and conditions of employment for childcare practitioners.  I am fully committed to working with sectoral representatives to deliver this and will meet with SIPTU this week to progress this further.</p> <p> I already mentioned the Covid crisis.  Deputies may be aware from media reports that a person who works in the childcare service has been confirmed as having Covid-19.  The HSE has been involved, as has Tusla's early years inspectorate.  My officials have been assured by them that all necessary actions have been taken.  In times such as this, our concern is for any person impacted and to ensure that the necessary actions have been taken to prevent any spread of the virus.  Guidance made available by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, the regulator, Tusla, and my Department has proven valuable in ensuring the appropriate management of the case.  I hope Deputies will understand that it is not possible to comment on individual cases, but I want to assure Members that the HSE and Tusla have been involved and that all appropriate action has been taken.</p> <p> I realise there is much to be done in the childcare sector.  We have set out clear commitments in the programme for Government outlining the type of childcare system we want to provide.  We are already taking action to develop the new national childcare agency, Childcare Ireland.  Work is ongoing to create a funding model that, with additional investment, will deliver affordability to parents while creating a workforce structure that appropriately values the staff working in the sector.  I am heartened there is broad agreement on the challenges facing us and the urgency in addressing them.  I look forward to engaging with all political parties and all stakeholders to develop a more affordable early learning and childcare system for everybody and delivered by a more valued workforce.</p></speech>

The challenges faced by childcare workers in my constituency of Tipperary are mirrored throughout the country.  They have been underfunded, under-resourced and undervalued by successive Governments.  Locally we have been warned that the sector is in great danger unless it receives the funding it needs and deserves.  Childcare workers need to be given the respect they have earned.</p>  <p>  The sector has been historically under-resourced, with high costs and low pay.  Attempts to sweep this under the carpet have gone on for years, but this pandemic has shone a light on the weaknesses in the system caused by underinvestment.  That has created severe hardships for families who give large chunks of their incomes to take advantage of these services.</p>  <p>  Tipperary is as aware of the challenges facing these services as anywhere.  Many childcare services there have not opened because they cannot afford the additional costs involved.  Those which have speak of the additional costs and workload which they must bear while they also despair that the tradition of not giving them the support they need continues.  Sinn F&eacute;in's plan is to address this.  We propose proper investment in the childcare sector, which brings the wage subsidy scheme to the sector back to 100% to keep childcare services open.  Our plan fully commits to implementing pay scales and full continuing professional development for all staff.  This would show that we properly value childcare as a viable long-term career choice.  Our motion would also ensure that when investment reaches the right level, a maximum weekly childcare fee is set, incrementally reducing until the service is free at the point of use.</p>  <p>  Action is what is needed now.  The reports and talking have been done, as well as spin from previous Governments.  Now is the time to move.  We look forward to a better way of providing childcare and I appeal to all the Members of the House to support the motion.</p></speech>

Childcare costs in this State are among the highest in the OECD.  It is the same as the cost of a mortgage payment for many families.  We require a State-funded model of childcare that is in line with international best practice, that views childcare as a start of a child's educational journey rather than somewhere for them to wait until they are ready for primary school.  We need to ensure that access to childcare facilities is convenient for parents and that we do not have the limited numbers of spaces that cause parents to find places nowhere near where they live.  The system's lack of capacity is driving prices sky high.  People simply cannot afford the costs they are asked to pay each month.</p><p>Turning to workers, the Big Start campaign featured in a big piece in this morning's <i>journal.ie.</i>It painted a bleak picture of the reality faced by workers in the sector.  The most startling statistic was that over 60% of early years educators are paid less than the living wage.  That is disgraceful.  The coronavirus crisis has shown us that they are the definition of essential workers.  They should not have to struggle to make ends meet.  They should be treated with the respect they deserve.</p><p>This motion will keep cr&egrave;che doors open, reduce fees for parents and pay a living wage to early years educators.  All Deputies should support that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100054#EEE00500"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Funchion, for putting forward this timely motion.  We all agree that childcare is the keystone that holds together the building blocks of our economy and society.  Unfortunately, it took the dual crisis of outrageous insurance premiums, which almost shut the industry down permanently, combined with a global pandemic for some in this House to understand how important the sector is for workers and families.</p>  <p>  This wilful ignorance has for too long created a system that is creaking at the seams.  Many parents rely on grandparents.  Many people I know in the area where I live are the childminders while the daughter or son go out to work.  We should not be over-reliant on them.  We saw the challenge many of those grandparents faced during the Covid pandemic when many had to cocoon, creating a crisis for many families.  We are still in the middle of the pandemic and there is much talk of a second wave.  What will those families do?  Everyone wants to go back to work but the parents are faced with this difficult choice.</p>  <p>  Hardly a parent in the State would disagree that, without some childcare provision, they would not be able to rejoin the workforce after starting or growing a family.  That is the reality.  No responsible parent will disagree that the cost of childcare is overwhelming and downright scary at times.  It is nearly a clich&eacute; that too many families pay the equivalent of another mortgage, that their children can be taken care of while they go out to work.  Fees are too high while the wages of many of the workers are described by my union, SIPTU, as poverty wages.  At the same time, many childcare facilities cannot afford the costs of doing business.  That is the conundrum.  Why is that?  On the one hand, people are not being paid enough - SIPTU's survey has shown that many childcare workers are on tiny wages - and they are expected to upskill.  We went from little or no regulation to a system where multiple agencies demand endless reports, and from affordable insurance to unaffordable demands.</p> <p>It is simply not credible to me and to many others out there to expect young people to achieve the high qualifications necessary to mind children, for them then to be unable to live on the wages that many in the sector provide.  That is the big challenge we have to face and what we are trying to address here.  This has to be about affordability and about parents, particularly women, being able to participate in the labour market.  This reduces inequality and benefits society and the economy as a whole.  It also helps them to return to education.   Again, I know from the experience in my own constituency and from many of the courses that are being run, that without that childcare element people would not be able to continue with their education.</p> <p> What do we need to do?  We need to transform the childcare sector if we are to have any hope of getting parents back to work and jumpstart our stalled economy.  We need to be looking for a 21st century childcare service which should be about child minding, child learning and a child&rsquo;s development but not endless form-filling and living in fear of the next bill in the post.  When one talks to anyone who has run a cr&egrave;che, the big complaint is that multiple agencies are looking for repetitive reports and with the time spent on that, there is less time available to look after the children.  Some of the signage seems to be a duplication of many of the things that are needed.  If we want to see quality outcomes we need to bring about positive change.  The big headline issue that we are facing at the moment is that fees are set to rise.  This is the challenge for the Minister.  We need to sort out one way or another that the people who are doing the job are paid a fair wage, that those working in the sector are looked after, and that it is safe.  It must also be the case that parents who are bringing their children to these childcare facilities are not being charged another small fortune to try and get their child into that system.</p></speech>

It is only fair that we give the new Minister an opportunity to set out his stall and follow through on the many promises that are being made within the speech.  It is for us then to support that as those initiatives roll out or call the Minister to book if he is not progressing with his own vision.</p>  <p>  I do not need to rehearse for the House the issues that are inherent within childcare as we have been talking about them here for years.  I do not need to rehash old arguments about the insecurity of employment and the costs of childcare.  These are well-rehearsed and well-known to everybody and to all of us as public representatives and Members of this House because we are representing the people who are affected by these issues day in, day out.  </p>  <p>  The Minister will have regard to SIPTU&rsquo;s research on the rate of attrition within the sector, of which his own officials will also be aware.  The bleeding needs to stop very quickly.  The Minister states that he is putting in place some structures to seek to stop the haemorrhage of people moving out of the sector.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is meeting with SIPTU next week to address some of the issues that it has been highlighting for quite some time.  Let us take that at face value, accept the Minister&rsquo;s meeting with SIPTU and see what arises from that.  I am hopeful that the Minister will be in a position in the short term, after 23 August, to give us some solace on the status of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  While the Minister states that he is working with his Government colleagues in respect of the time after 23 August, I ask that the Minister and Government give consideration to the continuation of the TWSS.  He is not telling us outright that this is what will happen but I am hopeful that if we are talking about real support for the sector, this is one of the bedrocks by which one can support employment in the sector.  If one looks at the rates of attrition, with due respect to the Minister, I would not be trumpeting as a win the fact where he states in his speech that over 85% of all services which are usually open in the summer months have already reopened just three weeks into the reopening period.  That signifies that there is a rate of attrition already of those services that would normally open in summer.  I know that there is a natural rate of attrition which the Minister&rsquo;s officials might tell him of and which he will be aware of.  What I fear is that, come September, with the uncertainty that exists now around the reopening of schools, where we do not have a clear pathway, this will feed into a further uncertainty for childcare.</p>  <p>  For the fourth time in this House I will speak about the regressivity that exists for women and working mothers as a result of Covid-19.  We have to stem that immediately.  If there is uncertainty about September and the further reopening of schools, that has an obvious knock-on effect on cr&egrave;ches and on preschool and early years.  What we need now, and what parents and those who work within the sector demand, is that there is some certainty brought to bear as soon as possible.  I am not talking about weeks but days, so that people can plan and have some certainty and confidence.</p>  <p>  The Minister speaks about a package of funding measures that have been put in place by the Department and they are to be welcomed.  We will also be aware of the fact that there has been some pushback on that, with some justification, by the sector where the package of measures that were announced would not necessarily meet the true costs of meeting the public health regulations.  Perhaps that is something that is being addressed on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  One cannot stand here tonight and talk about childcare without talking about all children.  I refer briefly to children in this State who are users of disability services.  It is a frightening fact that there is still no certainty about children who use services such as those in my own area such as St Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation, Enable Ireland and Cope Foundation, where the perception is that there is no communication directly with parents with respect to their children and as to whether or not they will have access to services come September.  This distils down to services provided by St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation as regards its respite facility called Cooleens House.  I will quote from a letter I received which stated that this was the only residential facility available to St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation to accommodate residents who require isolation as per HSE and public health guidelines.  It is liaising with the HSE on reopening services but states, "While we await a positive response from the HSE, we are exploring possible alternate options in St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation to provide urgently required breaks for priority families."</p>  <p>  The funding position of organisations like St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation, which we have right across our constituencies, is that their ability to fundraise at present is severely hampered and there is still the uncertainty.  I take the point that the Minister will make and welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is here.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State is working with the HSE and through her Department to work through these issues.</p> <p>If we could treat this issue with a sense of urgency to give all families who access disability services some certainty about where they stand for September, I think it will give people some confidence.  There is no doubt that it will require a funding package because there is no way that organisations such as St. Joseph's, the Cope Foundation or Enable Ireland will be able to provide or adhere to the public health guidelines unless they are provided with a funding package to be able to meet the regulatory requirements.  This particularly relates to transport and access to services that are so vital, such as Cooleen's Respite House.  There are hundreds of Cooleens throughout the State.</p> <p> I do not think we can talk about children without talking about all children.  I want to speak for those children, as we all have and do through our parliamentary questions, whose parents are beside themselves with worry about where they stand in all of this.  They feel like forgotten people at present.  I do not want to sound condescending or patronising but I know both Ministers to be inherently good and decent people.  I was proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with people such as Deputies Function and Rabbitte when we were all in opposition, because they fought the good fight.  I know the Ministers will fight the good fight for the people I speak of tonight.</p> <p> I give some welcome to the Minister's speech.  It is a guarded, cautious welcome, as the Minister will appreciate, but we need to move towards a fully-funded model.  If it is a fully-funded model and private operators are operating within that system, there is a challenge which everybody acknowledges.  The one thing that I think everybody is united on is that we have to stem the tide of attrition of workers within the sector.  If the Minister, through the working groups, comes up with a model of childcare that every parent and child can be happy in, whether it is a blended model, a fully-funded model, a for-profit or a not-for-profit, then let us work through all of those when the proposals come before us.  We have not even got to that starting gate yet.  We recognise that it is funded to the tune of 60% but I think that we can go further.  In the current climate, there has never been a greater opportunity to take that one step further, and in this crisis that we have at present, now is the time for lateral and imaginative thinking.  The Minister will find that if the Government moves in that direction, we in the Labour Party will certainly move in lockstep with the Minister if we feel that it is a genuine effort to create a properly and fully-funded model of childcare.</p></speech>

I would like to address two issues relating to childcare.  The first issue is the short-term needs of the sector post Covid and the second is the long-term reforms that are required.  I think we are all in agreement that significant reforms are required in the sector to meet the needs of families and providers.</p>  <p>  On the short-term issue, many parents, providers and staff are worried that they do not have any certainty about what will happen after 24 August.  I know that the Minister is working on it and needs time to get those plans done.  The uncertainty is causing significant concern.  The recent discussions in the media about capping fees have added to pressures and concerns and I am aware of a number of providers who are raising their prices.  The kite flying about fee capping may be forcing them down that road.  I ask that the Minister expedite those plans for the sector.  It is important to give them some certainty as quickly as possible.  With regard to the long-term reforms that are required, the reality is that successive Governments have failed to properly support families in this country when it comes to childcare and early education.  Governments have failed to invest properly, and have failed to put children front and centre of childcare provision.  While all countries throughout Europe have managed to get it right, Ireland has not.  It has refused to shoulder its responsibility to support parents and to provide the publicly-funded, universal system of childcare and early years education that we need and that our children need.  Instead, we are forcing children into a system that is piecemeal and under-funded.  It is not meeting their needs or the needs of parents, staff or providers.</p>  <p>  Ireland's predominantly market-driven approach to childcare has not worked.  It has failed to provide parents and children with the flexibility required by modern working families.  It is expensive, creating barriers for women entering the workforce.  We know that the market-driven model has not worked for the majority of childcare providers either, since they have been saddled with layers of bureaucracy and over-reliance on Government supports because they cannot compete in a full free market model.  This approach has also riddled the sector with chronically low pay and little job security for early childcare workers and professionals.</p>  <p>  It is evidently clear that we need to move away from the existing market-driven approach and towards a public service model which has the child at its centre.  Not only will this address the sustainability issues within the sector, it will benefit our children as well.  We can see this in other countries which have similar provision of childcare.  Available research has identified positive outcomes of public early childcare programmes including improvements in children's social and emotional development.  Increasing investment in a public childcare service is not just beneficial to the economy.  It benefits children's development and that will affect their outcomes later in life.  We need to look after our children.  If we get childcare right, everything else will follow.</p>  <p>  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We need to look towards other countries to see what works and to identify where Ireland is falling down in comparison.  Ireland has the highest level of private provision of early childhood care and education in the OECD, along with relatively low Government investment, low wages for educators and high fees for consumers.  Some 99% of children attending pre-primary education were enrolled in private childcare institutions compared with the OECD average of only 34% and the EU average of 27%.  That is a shockingly high number and shows where we are going wrong.</p>  <p>  The evidence base also indicates that in countries where there is public provision, childcare tends to be more affordable, accessible and of higher quality than in private provision countries.  The OECD states that the predominance of public childcare institutions in the EU reflects a policy shift towards public provision in this sector.  It states that sustained public investment is vital for the growth and quality of early childhood care and education programmes.  Further, if these programmes are not sufficiently subsidised, the ability of parents to pay for childcare will greatly influence the participation of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  That means our current market-driven model perpetuates educational disadvantage from when the child is an infant.  That is a shocking indictment of the current system.</p>  <p>  In 2016, despite tripling of public investment in childcare programmes between 2011 and 2016, Ireland spent the second lowest amount on education for three to five year olds in the OECD as a percentage of GDP.  In comparison, Norway, Sweden and Iceland each spent 1% of GDP, which is more than double Ireland's spend of 0.4%.  Our model reveals that we have the worst of both worlds.  Not only do we have a high level of private service provision in the country, we have some of the lowest levels of public investment in the sector.</p>  <p>  The current childcare model creates a two-tier workforce, reducing the workforce participation rate by women.  This is something that I have raised repeatedly in this Chamber, especially since Covid struck, because it has highlighted the vulnerabilities in our system.  I have a fear that once we get to September, if there are issues opening the childcare facilities or schools, it will be predominantly women who have to shoulder that responsibility, whether by taking time off work or seeking more flexible work, which means that they are moving out of their role in the workforce.  That is not something that we can afford to happen because if it happens in September and October, it will be with us for years.  It will take a long time to roll back on that issue.</p>  <p>  The Parliamentary Budget Office identified a higher workforce participation rate among males than females in the 25 to 44 age group in Ireland.  We can see the gender gap, which is larger in Ireland than the EU average.  In 2018, a study conducted by the ESRI found that mothers with higher childcare costs when their child was three tended to work fewer hours when their child was five.</p> <p>This indicates that high childcare costs are a barrier to maternal employment.  Lack of childcare supports also affect maternal well-being and this is important to acknowledge.  Greater investment in childcare increases maternal life satisfaction, which in turn benefits the child.  Covid-19 has revealed the stress on women who have taken on the burden of childcare and school closures, and who have been affected disproportionately by the public health crisis.  Without providing clarity and direction urgently, the challenges for this sector and for families will just be compounded, with a serious impact on the capacity of women to return to work.  This will have an impact on both women, their children and their families and on the economy.  We can put as much money back into businesses as we want but if we do not have the staff to work in those businesses it is really all for nowt.</p> <p> In Ireland, despite the relatively high fees, details of which we have heard much about tonight, the wages of workers in the childcare sector remain low.  The average hourly rate for early years is &euro;11.44, which is below the living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour.  These are the people we want to care for our children and to educate them.  We are not valuing these people enough to pay them a proper living wage.  This sector employs approximately 30,000 people and has some of the most highly qualified professionals who are paid some of the lowest wages of any sector, with many existing on minimum wage rates.  Last week, the Social Democrats acknowledged the chronic problem of low wages in the sector by introducing a motion calling for a living wage.  The Government shot it down but I believe the message came through from the public that we no longer want to see workers who educate and care for our children exploited and undervalued despite the incredibly important work they do.  I made a point in my speech last week that it is no coincidence that sectors which are predominantly female have some of the lowest wages in the country.  Care work is undervalued and exploited and this has to change.  This must be a central tenet to any new public childcare model that we seek to introduce.</p> <p> I agree with the motion calling on the Government to fully commit to implementing pay scales and full continuous professional development for all staff, and which properly values childcare as a viable long-term career choice, and I hope to see some commitment by the Minister on this today.  The evidence proves that Ireland's market-driven model does not work.  It does not work for children, parents, staff or providers.  We need a tailored public childcare model that meets the specific needs of children, families and communities but which also incorporates the 3,000-plus small providers who have invested so much in the sector when Governments have failed to do so.  Using evidence-based approaches, we need to visualise what kind of national childcare service we want, one that puts children front and centre of the system.  A pathway towards implementation must also be matched by investment, the likes of which we have not seen to date but which will be absolutely necessary if we are going get this right.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Funchion on her consistency on this issue.  It is a very good, structured motion.  I welcome some elements of the Minister's statement, especially with regard to meeting representatives of SIPTU, and good luck with that.  I put it to the Minister that it is not an exaggeration to say that the provision of childcare is extremely fragmented in Ireland, if not almost archaic.  There are very high costs and the workforce of educators is underpaid and undervalued.  According to the latest SIPTU survey of workers in the childcare sector, they are going under and leaving the sector.  The SIPTU Covid-19 Back to Work survey shows that since the end of June some 29% of the workers indicated they are earning less than before the pandemic, with 32% of the workers intending to leave the sector in the next 12 months, which is very alarming.  Most early years professionals earn below the living wage of &euro;12.40 per hour.  This has resulted in a turnover of more than 40% of workers leaving full day care services.</p><p>Only five months ago there was a huge demonstration of childcare workers.  It seems like years ago but it happened five months ago, with at least 15,000 to 20,000 people attending that demonstration.  It was one of the best demonstrations I had been on in a long time.  Those workers were demanding a couple of simple things, including, obviously, pay and conditions.  The early years educational sector is not working for those workers, it is not working for parents and it is not working for children.  We cannot be unambiguous about this.  We need a State-led childcare system.  It is a fact that in other countries such as the Scandinavian countries the best outcomes are State led.  There is a very good article in today's edition of<i>The Irish Times</i>that names three of the leading countries with the best outcomes in childcare.  They are Iceland, Sweden and Norway.  They each spend more than &euro;4.5 billion every year on childcare. The Oireachtas report says that Ireland needs to spend &euro;2 billion to match that.  We need to do this through general taxation.  Hopefully this campaign is the start of a national childcare service that can benefit everybody, that is not fragmented and is not left to private operators.  It should be a national service that benefits everybody.</p></speech>

There was an emotion and anger about it that had been building up for years.  One could see it being released on 5 February.  There were demonstrations in Dublin, Cork and in other towns and cities across the country.  There are 4,200 childcare centres in the State and it is estimated that more than 2,000 were closed on that day.  This is a quote from one of the workers at the Dublin demonstration:</p> <blockquote> 	I&rsquo;m paid &euro;12 per hour for 38 weeks a year.  I can&rsquo;t get a mortgage.  I have a level eight course.  I&rsquo;m still where I was seven years ago &ndash; and still paying education loans back. </blockquote>  <p>She was paid &euro;12 per hour, which is actually higher than the average rate in the profession, which is &euro;11.45 per hour.  This is nearly a full euro less than the official living wage.</p><p>Reference was made to last year's SIPTU survey of more than 3,000 childcare workers and early years educators.  One of the questions in the survey asked &quot;Are you able to cope with unexpected expenses?&quot;  An example was given of a broken boiler in the person's home.  A total of 84% said &quot;No.&quot;  Another question asked &quot;Do you think childcare workers are paid a fair wage?&quot;  Does the Minister know how many people answered positively?  It was 1% of those surveyed.  The situation now is worse than it was then with 29% of childcare workers on less money now than before the pandemic struck, according to reports in the last few days.  This is the paid work, but what about the unpaid work such as record keeping, cleaning or liaising with parents?  A total of 72% who were polled said they do unpaid work, including working through breaks for many workers.  More than half, 52%, said they do not have time to take a break.  When asked if they purchase their own supplies in the workplace or pay out of their own pocket, 65% said &quot;Yes&quot;.  When asked if they do training in their own time, of those polled 85% said &quot;Yes&quot;.  Training for what?  The survey asked if higher qualifications led to higher wages and 68% of respondents said &quot;No&quot;.  Only 13% stated that having done more training and receiving more qualifications, they felt their professional qualifications were recognised in society. </p> <p>No wonder demoralisation in the sector is so great.  It is no wonder that more than two thirds, 67%, said they were probably going to leave the profession within five years if the situation remained the same.<br/><br/>The Covid crisis is an opportunity to change all of that.  It can be a fork in the road.  What kind of sector do we need and what kind of sector now needs to be built?  There was an interesting three-page report done by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service several weeks back in which it asked what the barriers are to the universal provision of childcare in the State.  It named two factors.  It did not give one greater prominence over the other.  Instead, it gave them equal prominence.  Number one is the negative economic consequences of Covid.  Number two is the market-driven approach to childcare provision in the State.  I believe that the campaign for decent pay and conditions for childcare workers goes hand in hand with ending the market-driven approach and replacing it with childcare provision for the needs of people based on State investment in a State child care system.  I am not referring to State investment at one of the lowest levels in all of Europe but bringing this up to the EU average at least.<br/><br/>According to <i>The Irish Times</i>today, to bring it up to the EU average, one would need an investment of &euro;2.27 billion.  It is not cheap.  It is a lot of money but it is worth doing.  It is possible to do if one goes after the likes of the &euro;14 billion in the Apple escrow account rather than joining forces with Apple and saying that we do not want it.  It is possible if one goes for a steeply progressive taxation system which makes the people who have got serious money in our society, the upper echelons and the big corporations, pay at a rate they can afford to create a pool of initiatives such as a free childcare service provided by the State.</p></speech>

I stated then that the one point we must accept is that Covid-19 has changed matters utterly and we cannot simply dismiss proposals like those that were rejected out of hand by Governments in the past.  Who would have thought that the Government would introduce a one-tier health system overnight or ban rent increases, a policy the very same Government had opposed previously?  The same approach is now needed with regard to both childcare and maternity leave.  As I stated last week, both are inextricably linked.</p>  <p>  The issue of maternity leave masks a far greater problem with regard to childcare capacity, as well as the reopening of schools.  These two issues will impact women in particular.  We must do everything possible to ensure that the schools can fully reopen this September.  My concern is that any reduction in the number of hours or days that children can attend school, particularly primary school, will disproportionately impact on thousands of women across the country.  We have already seen the impact of the lack of childcare on our front-line staff.</p>  <p>  We are seeing this again as parents are struggling to find care for young children where they cannot work from home and grandparents are unable to help out as many would normally have done.  If schools do not fully reopen, we are going to see this childcare crisis on a far wider and greater scale.  We are looking at a situation where childcare facilities may not open, provide for reduced numbers or not cater for children under two, while schools may only take a limited number of primary school students.  Due to Covid-19, grandparents are no longer available to provide the support they historically have provided.  All this will create a perfect storm, leaving parents without childcare options.  We now need to look at innovative solutions which we would not have contemplated prior to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister's speech earlier and welcomed his determination to bring about a review to consult with the various partners to bring about a new scheme.  I wish the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the very best in their endeavours.  I know the Minister is sincere and that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, knows this sector inside out and upside down.</p>  <p>  With all due respect, however, it is kicking the can down the road.  If we had time, I could understand that.  At the end of this road, however, we will be at a cliff edge.  My fear is that we could be on that cliff edge this September.  We do not have that luxury of time.  I wish we did but I do not believe we have.  It would be great if we can come up with a solution to this.  We have had consultation after consultation, review after review and engagement after engagement.  We need to see real and practical movement now.  We need to see this in weeks, not months or years.  Due to Covid-19, we do not have that luxury of time that every new Minister should have to carry out consultation and engagement.</p>  <p>  I find it bizarre that the education spokespersons were informed by the Minister for Education and Skills today that she is to set out a plan for the reopening of schools after the D&aacute;il closes next week.  I am concerned about that.  I sat on the other side of the House.  If the Government has bad news, it will wait until the D&aacute;il closes.  Whatever the Minister is going to announce next week, it will be approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday.  She can then go from the Cabinet meeting to the D&aacute;il to tell us exactly what is going on.  She does not need to wait until the end of the week, unless there is something that she does not want to have debated.  That really concerns me.  If that is the case, the Minister opposite is going to have a far bigger problem in a few weeks' time than he currently has today.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government states under the heading for a new social contract that it will progress a living wage over the time of the Government.  That is commendable.  However, we need to use the childcare staff sector as the pilot for the roll-out of the living wage across society.  We cannot accept a situation which was highlighted to me by an individual, qualified both as a beautician and as a childcare practitioner, that she would earn more money painting nails than educating preschool children.  We need to prioritise the sector.  We need to put our children and their early years educators first and use them as the pilot to model the new living wage for all.  It must be one that is not funded out of the pockets of parents who are already paying a second mortgage in childcare costs.</p> <p>That would be an innovative approach to take instead of doing this incrementally across a broad range of sectors.  No sector would disagree that this particular cohort of staff, who are mainly women, need to be prioritised because without access to childcare, other women cannot get into the workforce or earn that additional income.</p> <p> The Government subsidy under the ECCE scheme pays childcare providers just &euro;4.60 per hour for three hours a day to provide a preschool service.  Many childcare providers were struggling to deal with the large number of challenges facing the sector even before the onset of Covid-19.  It will be impossible to reopen the sector and provide the type of capacity needed for working families without a new funding model.</p> <p> We saw what happened last December when providers faced a hike in insurance premiums.  Prior to Covid-19, there was also an ongoing problem in recruiting and retaining staff due to the sector's inability to pay them a living wage.  Before Christmas, I facilitated a delegation of childcare providers from across the west in meeting the then Minister, Dr. Katherine Zappone, where a number of issues were raised concerning financial support and the need to ensure staff were properly paid.</p> <p> Many childcare providers are struggling to recruit staff because of the pay they can offer.  That is unsurprising, given the fact that staff packing baby wipes on supermarket shelves can earn more than the staff member using those very same wipes who is responsible for the care of that baby along with two other babies.  That is fundamentally wrong.  We need to ensure that proper pay scales are put in place for those providing this vital service across the country.</p> <p> I wish to highlight that the policy behind our funding model is primarily based around child benefit as the main mechanism to support childcare costs rather than a properly structured and funded sector, as is the case in other EU countries.  This was outlined in budget 2001.  In the past 20 years, that monthly payment has increased by 34%, a far cry from the rate of increase in childcare costs in a sector that is so dependent on low-wage employment.  This policy is flawed and unsustainable.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Funchion a rinne s&aacute;r-obair ar an r&uacute;n agus a chuir &eacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair.  I commend Deputy Funchion on highlighting what is clearly an issue of major importance and relevance for thousands of working families across the State.  For too many of them, the cost of childcare is equivalent to a mortgage.  It is a significant financial burden that many families struggle to carry.</p>  <p>  In budget 2019, it was announced that income thresholds for assessment under the national childcare scheme were to be raised substantially, with the maximum net threshold rising from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum.  The purpose of the scheme as formulated was to ensure that the maximum subsidy rates would be paid to all families with a reckonable income of up to &euro;26,000.  According to the then Minister, Dr. Katherine Zappone, the scheme was supposed to be poverty proofed by ensuring that families at or below the relevant income poverty line would benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the scheme.  That has not happened, however.  Families are still making an enormous, and almost unsustainable, level of childcare payments to providers who, through no fault of their own, have faced unmanageable increases in operational costs such as insurance.  Like many other businesses, they were treated disgracefully by the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  Childcare providers need support urgently.  A large number of them are struggling to get back on their feet.  From speaking to many childcare providers in my constituency, I know that Government intervention is urgently required to sustain the sector, which some parents depend on as their preferred childcare option.  Not all parents choose this option, of course, but it should be there for those who do.</p>  <p>  In 2018, an ESRI study stated that the high cost of day care was leading to fewer working mothers and that "greater government support for childcare costs will increase maternal employment."  For many women, it is a significant barrier to working.  It is also a barrier to further education.  I am aware of many young women who cannot pursue the careers or education they would like due to childcare costs.</p>  <p>  The ESRI study stated that the high cost of childcare was a major issue, but as one stay-at-home father commented at the time, "The Government must not use this study to justify further big subsidies for day-care at the expense of other child-care options."  Government support must be fair and balanced, all options need to be available to people and the childcare sector must be sustained.  We cannot ignore those parents who want to mind their children in their own homes.  All of them would prefer it if a family member minded them during the day.  It is all about choice and preference.  The State must support all parents equally regardless of their childcare preferences.  That is the model that we should aim to work towards, one where both the providers and the parents are supported equally instead of an insistence on a one-size-fits-all approach that does not take into account what parents want for their children if given the choice.</p>  <p>  I commend the childcare workers who work diligently and hard in preparing children for primary school.  I saw this at first hand as a primary school principal.  When the children came to school, they were fantastically prepared for primary education as a result of the roll-out of the Aistear programme.  The childcare workers did fantastic work and a significant effort was made during the programme's roll-out.  It was done to a high standard, efficiently and effectively.  It is just unfortunate and disheartening to see that the workers are undervalued and underpaid and that morale is at an all-time low.  This matter must be addressed urgently in addition to the many other issues I have highlighted previously.</p>  <p>  It is evident that many cracks are starting to appear in the childcare sector.  Rebuilding it and ensuring there is a solid foundation is urgently required and, indeed, the only way to proceed.</p></speech>

As we all know, our children are our future and we must try to promote and protect them at every opportunity we get.  I agree fully with some of the comments that have been made.  The steep costs accrued by parents for childcare places them in a vulnerable position, one that they cannot afford.  It is clear that, even before the coronavirus started, many cr&egrave;ches were in a serious situation in terms of keeping going and providing a service.  It will be much more difficult for them if they can get going again in September.  We hope they can, but I fear that will be impossible for many.  It is sad because the people working in those cr&egrave;ches were capable, properly trained and vetted and worked under strict regulations.  If we do not have cr&egrave;ches, many mothers will not be able to return to work.</p> <p>People working in cr&egrave;ches do not get holidays.  I do not know what they do.  Perhaps they draw from their stamps.  They are paid very low wages.  This is not fair or right.  We want properly trained, responsible people dealing with our children.  As the saying goes, if you pay peanuts you get monkeys.</p> <p> I congratulate Deputies Rabbitte and O'Gorman on their appointments and I wish them the best in their new roles.  We are facing a serious predicament come September if the schools do not reopen.  I am very worried.  If the schools were going to reopen in September a lot of the necessary measures would already be in place or being put in place.  If the schools do not reopen fully, we will need to organise extra space in community halls and churches.  If school buses cannot cater for all of the children on one run they will have to do another run later and work later in the evening.  All of those things need to be done but I do not think anything has been done.</p> <p> Unlike the Labour Party Deputies, I am not criticising the new Minister for Education and Skills or political points scoring.  We all remember what the Labour Party did to the mothers of Ireland who raised the current generation of people that are running the country.  They cut their pensions.  For all of the motions and talking done in the last D&aacute;il they still have not got their pensions back yet.  Instead of working with the new Minister, Deputies Alan Kelly and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in chose to take a pot shot at her.  We must work together to ensure that our schools are reopened in September.  There is an awful lot of work to be done.  If we cannot finish it off next week I am happy for the D&aacute;il to sit another week because this is important.  People were hurt about the rural pubs not being allowed to reopen.  They are listening to hear if the schools are going to reopen fully.  If they do not, many mothers and fathers will not be able to go back to work.  Parents have to mind their children.  If the schools do not reopen and the cr&egrave;ches are not operating many parents will not be able to go back to work.  </p> <p> The Minister and Minister of State are in government.  They must collaborate and work to ensure that if schools and cr&egrave;ches need more money to deal with the Covid regulations they will get it.  They need to be assured that they will get it.  One cannot live in the wind.  If these people are to provide a service they must get funding.  It is clear to me that more funding is needed for the schools and cr&egrave;ches.  It is our children and the future of Ireland we are talking about and we need to get our act together.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their appointments and I wish them the best of luck.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to this sector as "chaotic, inefficient and an indictment on our country", particularly in that it forces parents to pay the money and it is disproportionate to women.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong but I understand from the Green Party document on childcare that it is committed to public childcare.  While I welcome the discussion, what is absent from the speeches is a commitment to public childcare and a recognition that childcare based on market driven ideology has not worked, is not working and will not work.  If the Ministers do not believe me they need only look to the research.  I agree with Deputy Naughten that the Government is kicking this down the road.  I am all for consultation but what is missing is leadership.  I am not sure which Minister will make the closing statement but if it is Deputy Rabbitte, who is a strong Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, she might show leadership in regard to the provision of public childcare, which is what we are looking for, and which came up on the doorsteps frequently, along with climate change, housing and public transport.  </p>  <p>  Again, I find myself thanking the Oireachtas Library and Research Service and the Parliamentary Budget Office on their excellent work.  The key message in June of this year from their research - and they say more research is necessary - is that Ireland has the highest level of private provision of early childcare and education in the OECD, along with relatively low Government investment, low wages for educators and high fees for consumers.  Let us make a connection here.  I acknowledge the work done by the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, and her predecessor and the amount of money that goes into childcare but it is going in in a piecemeal fashion.  It is being provided to enable people make a profit.  There is nothing wrong with profit but not in childcare.  We must have public childcare because the research shows it is best.  The existing research shows it is best all round.  It gives continuity, it is good for the children, it is good for the mothers and for parents.  </p>  <p>  The available research has identified positive outcomes of public early childcare programmes, including improvements in children's social and emotional development and an increase in maternal life satisfaction.  The evidence also indicates that in public provision countries childcare tends to be more affordable, accessible and of higher quality than in private provision countries.  As has been already said, the key challenge is our system which is market driven and the challenges of Covid.  Once again - I made this point earlier in regard to the credit guarantee scheme -  it has taken Covid to put the spotlight on childcare and how badly we are doing it.</p>  <p>  Let us look to the northern countries that have already been mentioned by my colleagues.  The Nordic countries, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, which are considered to have the best systems in the world in regard to early childhood care and education, recognise universal childcare as a social right.  We do not do that here.  Another piece of research found that childcare services in three public provision countries - this time Iceland, Slovenia and Sweden - were characterised by high service, accessibility, availability, affordability and quality, although there was some variation.  </p>  <p>  I make my contribution tonight in a country that has 230,000 children living in poverty, one in five children under 18 in families with income below the poverty line and one in four children living in households experiencing deprivation of one or two basic necessities.  Let us show leadership.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House.  I would like to be able to welcome their response to the motion but, unfortunately, I cannot but I will elaborate on that later.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that childcare is a huge cost and burden on everybody across the State.  For people who do not have children, it is a huge burden too because it prevents citizens from participating fully in the State.</p> <p>Although there has been much talk of it tonight, it has to be restated that there are people who simply cannot get a job because they cannot afford childcare.  I know and have spoken to many people - mostly women - who work purely to pay the rent and to cover childcare costs, and that is it.  That is their entire income.  They make good salaries but that is the entirety of what they can hope for.  They cannot afford to have another child because it would increase their childcare costs and they would have to give up work.  They would probably also lose their place to live.  That is the reality of the system the Minister faces, which he has taken control of to ensure that it works.</p> <p> The current system does not work for anybody.  It does not work for the children who are in it, for the parents, who must pay unaffordable costs, or for the workers, who are very well qualified with degrees and so on but are working for the minimum wage.  It has been stated by many speakers but it has to be stated again and again that workers with degrees are working for the minimum wage.  That is what we expect them to do and then we wonder why they leave the system.  Why would they even consider staying?  The system does not work either for many of the people who have started a business in the industry, because it does not pay and because the private sector we have devised in the State to provide for childcare does not and cannot work.</p> <p> In the Minister's countermotion, the Government commits to "establish an agency, Childcare Ireland, to lead in the expansion of high-quality childcare and the professionalisation of the workforce".  It has been said by many speakers that there have been talks, consultation and discussion about the matter.  Now the Government will spend the next couple of years setting up Childcare Ireland and getting it up and running, and then we will have to wait a further couple of years for Childcare Ireland to do all the research and so on and come up with proposals.  I am sad to say that what will happen is the next three or four years will be spent on the establishment of Childcare Ireland, waiting for it to work and happen, and nothing will happen.  Every response to questions we have submitted to the Department states that when Childcare Ireland is up and running, people will be doing research and that is what we will be getting.  It is very unfortunate that that is what we will get.</p> <p> It is disappointing but it is not very surprising.  Given that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are in government, that is what we will get.  Fianna F&aacute;il established the system in 2000 or whenever it was, and we saw how that worked, while Fine Gael worked with it through the subsequent years.  The Green Party will show that it will do the same as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and work with a system that will not work.  Unfortunately, in five years' time, when the next Government is in office, we will probably be talking about the matter again.  That is sad.</p> <p> It is sad for families who will live through the system, but we could talk about it in a Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il way and say it is sad for the economy because it means our economy cannot grow.  Perhaps that is the way we have to talk about these issues, to shake that magic money tree.  It is about the economy and about making the economy grow.  If we can get proper childcare facilities for these people, it will free up workers and help the economy, and it will probably even reduce wages by increasing the availability of labour.  That will all stimulate the economy and keep it going.  Perhaps if we change the way we talk about it and we talk about it in economic terms and the benefits to the economy, it might sink in with the Government and we might get a system that delivers.  That, in itself, is sad too.</p></speech>

Like her and Deputies Sherlock and Mitchell, who contributed earlier, I sat on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  Deputy Connolly is correct that I have been very outspoken on this matter.  There are so many reactions I would like to give, having read the motion and understanding the programme for Government in depth.  I am sure the Minister would like to respond to all the Deputies who contributed because he will have an answer for each of them individually.</p>  <p>  I begin with the final Deputy to speak, Deputy Pringle, who took a negative tone that I do not think contributes to the spirit of where the Minister and I will be coming from within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I might remind the Deputy of what happened last September, when an expert group was formed to consider the best funding model for childcare in Ireland.  Its report is due at the end of the year and we all welcomed the expert group's formation at the time. The needle has been moved because of Covid-19.  I want to see the findings and the report of the group, because it will include the advice of international experts and will consider international best practices in recommending a new model.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I have been in the job for only 20 days, while the Minister has been in his current role for only 24 days.  In all fairness, I welcome the debate tonight because it is urgently required and we need to set out our stalls.  It also gives both of us an opportunity, from where the Department is sitting at this time, to flesh through where we are coming from and discuss what we are going to do and what is in the programme for Government.  We do not want to shy behind one or another agency; that is not what this is about.  It is about the parents, the workers, the providers and ensuring the Exchequer is protected.  What anybody would want from a Minister who addresses the House is that all segments be protected.  It is not simply a matter of approaching it or simplifying it in one move because it demands a multifaceted approach.  Approximately 25% of the sector comprises community centre-based settings, while the rest comprises mostly private individuals, as well as a small number of childminders, a group that has shrunk in recent years.  I am highly critical of that trend because it is not one size fits all.  We need to ensure we can provide childcare options with subsidies for parents so they can afford to go out to work in the morning.  That is what it is all about.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the motion, I will support the countermotion put forward by the Minister.  It is gas that we are all in agreement tonight, although that probably will not happen often.  It is clear from the debate that the provision of early learning and care of school-age children needs to be reformed.  We need to reduce the costs for parents, improve wages and conditions for the workers, reduce the regulatory and administrative burden on the providers and, most important, ensure that children get the very best possible start in life.</p>  <p>  The Government has set out its commitments to childcare in the programme for Government, which sets out a wide range of reforms, including increased investment, the establishment of a new agency, Childcare Ireland, and the introduction of a new funding model.  In opposing the motion and putting forward an amendment, the Government is not saying there are no challenges in the sector but is putting forward proposals to improve fundamentally the structure, regulation and funding of the sector, to make lasting changes to the way that childcare services are subsidised and supported. </p>  <p>  Opposition speakers have set out problems faced by parents and providers, but some Members of the Opposition have been a little disingenuous.  In an attempt to tackle insurance costs, Sinn F&eacute;in's election manifesto proposed to guarantee insurance cover for childcare providers under public bodies such as schools and hospitals.  While it is a good suggestion, I am not sure whether providers are aware that such a plan implies that private providers, which constitute 75% of the sector, would have to be nationalised to qualify for the insurance.  From my discussions with providers, I know that most did not realise this could mean the loss of the business they had spent years building up.  It is only fair that Sinn F&eacute;in at least be clear with providers as to what its plans mean and that it reveal where the money tree for funding such an option would come from.</p>  <p>The Government recognises that the issues in the sector were highlighted with the insurance crisis in December last year and the massive protests that took place in February 2020.  This really brings home how the Department can respond to this Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p> I recognise the contribution of the State's 4,500 providers in centre-based settings to the development of the early learning and care sector, with 31,000 staff working in those centre-based settings.  Much of the push for reform comes from the sector, which has always demonstrated a commitment to getting the most for children in its care.  The Government will continue to work with providers, practitioners, parents and children's representatives as much-needed development and reform continues.  I also acknowledge the important work of childminders and say that the Department hopes to continue the development of this sector to enable much larger numbers to avail of Government supports.</p> <p> The closure of childcare services during the Covid-19 pandemic has brought home to many the importance of childcare to our economy, specifically to working families, and for children's positive development.  The excitement and happiness shown by children returning to cr&egrave;ches on 29 June demonstrated the importance of learning and care outside of the home and the value that children put on fun, play and play-based learning and social interactions in cr&egrave;ches, preschools and minders' homes.</p> <p> Childcare is the shorthand we use for early learning and care services, and it is an inaccurate term in many ways.  For children, their cr&egrave;ches, preschools and minders' houses are not just somewhere they go when their parents go to work; they form an enriching contribution to their well-being and development.  We need to ensure not only that parents are supported in working with accessible and affordable childcare but also that children receive a world-class early education provided by valued educators.</p> <p> The reforms set out in the programme for Government will ensure the quality of early learning and care will continue to grow.  Ireland has made strides in the past five years, with all staff qualifications at a minimum of level 5 in early learning and a quarter of staff qualified to degree level in early childhood studies.  These qualifications allow staff to deliver the best learning and care to the children they look after.  The Government is committed to increasing the number of staff with higher qualifications in the sector.  We are aware that the providers will need to ensure staff wages, terms and conditions improve.  There is a legacy of low pay in the sector and we will work to change that to ensure that staff earn a fair wage and that they can build an attractive career in the sector.</p> <p> I have mentioned the happiness of children in returning to childcare from 29 June.  There was undoubtedly also great happiness and perhaps relief experienced by parents.  I thank all those services that have opened so far for the preparations they made to address the health, safety and well-being of children returning, for their adherence to public health guidance and for the way they reached out to parents to assure them of the measures being taken.  It is great to see over 85% of services normally open over the summer now open.</p> <p> Deputy Sherlock mentioned disability and I will address it in the few seconds I have left.  He should be aware that the guidance around the reopening of services has been issued by the HSE, with the aim of services opening from August onwards.  It is very important to note that each service must incorporate HSE guidance as part of the reopening roadmap for adults.  There are 1,000 services and 18,000 adult service users.  At this time, the HSE and individual service providers are putting together individual care plans for users so they can step back into those services.  Funding will be required and proposals are being put together on what is needed and the funding model.  This is an open piece of work and I am happy to say I have asked the HSE to update its website with information on the 1,000 services so there can be clear communication on when they are anticipated to open.  This is ensure everybody can know what is going on, and all service users, parents and guardians can be informed of the pathway to reopening.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work she has done on the many issues around childcare over the years.</p>  <p>  I contacted the manager of a local cr&egrave;che in my constituency ahead of my contribution this evening.  She told me she is down two full-time staff and two part-time staff and has advertised the positions without success.  Not one curriculum vitae has been received by her for the positions.  If at least one full-time position is not filled, one of her rooms cannot be opened.  She has told me the voluntary management committee will have to decide if that will be the baby room, the toddler room, the preschool room or the after-school room.  This will leave parents who rely on the cr&egrave;che without childcare, and these are the kinds of decisions being made in cr&egrave;ches right across the State.  Of course, such issues are nothing new.</p>  <p>  I re-read an email I received from the same cr&egrave;che manager back in June 2018 telling me about the number of people leaving the early years sector.  Two years later, the numbers leaving the sector are only rising.  The staffing crisis has repeatedly been brought to the Government's attention but the response to tonight's motion is similar to that last week when we discussed the extension of maternity leave.  The Government acknowledges the issue but does not propose to do anything to address it.  This is quickly becoming a trend of this Government.</p>  <p>  The Government argues it values the work of early years educators but it does not want to pay them properly for that work.  It speaks about encouraging retention and supporting the achievement of appropriate terms and conditions for the early learning and care workforce but how is it proposed to do that?  It has not told us that and there is nothing in the amendment to the motion about pay.  Parents will take little comfort from the Government response to the motion this evening.  For some families, because of the crippling cost of childcare, they are better off with one parent at home.  It does not pay to work, which is a very poor reflection on any Government.  The issues are clear and the solutions are in front of us in this evening's motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="22:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100062#NNN00400"><p>Covid-19 has demonstrated the weaknesses in how we look after the young and elderly and how we have not appreciated our caregivers.  With our current system of childcare we have been failing parents, children and those working in the sector.  Deputy Funchion, my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and others have made arguments and condemned the system we have while offering the economic and societal alternative of a working and sustainable childcare model.  Deputy Funchion has offered a roadmap for the transition to such a public childcare system, free at the point of use.</p>  <p>  We have seen through the pandemic the failings of our outsourced system of care for the elderly and the difficulties this created when preventative action was needed.  Today's HIQA report states nearly 60% of nursing homes inspected after Covid-19 outbreaks were not following proper infection prevention and control measures, possibly with devastating consequences.  We need elder care, disability services and childcare systems worthy of all our citizens.  We need to deliver for our people from the cradle to the grave.</p>  <p>  As we open greater parts of our economy and society, I ask the Minister of State to ensure we have and maintain the capacity to test, trace and isolate, particularly following the news today that a cr&egrave;che on the north side of Dublin has become one of the first childcare facilities to report a case of Covid-19.  All reports are that all protocols from the HSE and Tusla have been followed.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to look into the case of four childcare schemes within County Louth that deal with disadvantaged kids and will close unless exceptions or changes are made to the national childcare scheme.</p> <p>He needs to deal with his ministerial colleagues or we will have a complete disaster.  I commend the motion and the only long-term viable system of childcare as espoused by the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="22:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100063#OOO00200"><p>I want to use my couple of minutes to wholeheartedly support the motion brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Funchion, but also to raise a major childcare issue that is ongoing in my constituency.  We all accept that we are in a childcare crisis that has been caused by long-term Government inaction and compounded by the Covid emergency.  Sadly, I did not hear anything tonight from either Minister that would give me any optimism that we will see any real improvement or change in the near future.</p>  <p>  We have a situation in Togher, County Louth, where a facility called Scallywags that provides cr&egrave;che services and afterschool care for children in the locality has closed down.  The service is run by the Togher Community Project and it is a limited not-for-profit company and registered charity.  The 40 parents and the 14 full and part-time staff members who have now lost their jobs were informed of the closure out of the blue by a text message.  Parents and staff believe that the business is viable and say that it has cash reserves of &euro;450,000.  Media reports say that the Garda has launched an investigation.  Media reports also say that the board of management of the cr&egrave;che blame the pandemic for the closure of the business.  It is unacceptable that community cr&egrave;ches under the remit of the Department and in receipt of significant State investment would close under those circumstances.  Parents and staff were not even consulted so it is important that the Government is on top of this issue and ensures that it is not happening at a time when childcare is already in a shambolic state.  I have sent all the details to the Minister and I will send them to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, also.  I trust that both Ministers will look into the matter given its urgency.  In general terms we need to ensure that these services are accountable and that parents and staff can feel secure with local community services.  I trust that the Ministers will revert to me on this issue and ensure that their offices leave no stone unturned to make sure that this viable community cr&egrave;che stays open.</p></speech>

I should know better at this stage but I actually thought that the Government might support my motion because what is contained in it is solutions.  It is all done in very serious consultation with the sector, and it was not done overnight.  It was not a case of a few phone calls a few days before we decided to put down this motion.  This consultation has been going on for years.  I recall doing a report for the children's committee in 2017 about the terms and conditions and the wages in the childcare sector.  Three years later the same issues exist.  I got a text during this debate from somebody to say that they have heard of a closure just today in Limerick, with 90 staff let go.  These are very serious issues.  Part of me wants to give the Minister of State the benefit of the doubt.  As someone who has worked previously with her I genuinely wish her, and the Minister, well.  I see myself as somebody who wants to work constructively with people but, unfortunately, my instinct is telling me that if the Minister of State were genuine about this and really wanted to see solutions and action she would have supported the motion and not tabled the amendment.</p>  <p>  The amendment states that the Minister wants to support the achievement of appropriate terms and conditions for the early learning and care workforce.  What does that even mean?  What does she believe are the appropriate terms and conditions?  I believe everybody should start on at least the living wage and deserve to have a wage scale.  That is an issue we have been talking about for years in this Chamber and in the children's committee.  The consultation has been done.  I can give the Minister scores of names of people in organisations who will happily consult with her in the morning.  All of them support this motion.  The sector supports this motion.  The consultation and the solutions are available.  If the Minister of State is genuine and serious about this, and if she does want to work with people, I urge her to withdraw her amendment and support our motion.  The one thing she can do because it was done at the end of March or in April is reinstate the wage subsidy scheme at 100%.  I refer to the number of people who have had their wages cut, and it is not the fault of the providers.  They do not have the funds.  If she did that much at least it would demonstrate that she is serious and that she wants to take real action.  It would also mean that people could keep their jobs and their wages.  That would be the very first step.  There is much more to be done but those of us here who have been working on this issue for the past number of years have many solutions, in consultation with the sector.  The one piece of advice I would give the Minister is to consult with the sector.  Do not use it as an excuse to draw something out over years but have meaningful and genuine consultation.  I really hope that the meeting she has with SIPTU is not to say to its representatives that she supports a sector employment order.  As someone who worked in the trade union movement for years, that is not the answer here.  The Minister of State has the power to introduce a wage scale starting at the living wage.  She should at least start at reinstating the wage subsidy scheme at 100% because there will not be a sector this time next year if there is not genuine investment and if this issue is not taken seriously.  That is the reality.  Every Deputy on this side of the House has said that, and both Ministers have acknowledged that there are issues.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do the right thing and withdraw her amendment, support our motion, be serious about it and work with us on the solutions.</p></speech>

The Deputy wants to talk about the funding for the new building for the Holy Angels School for Children with Special Needs in Carlow.  All of us in that part of the world are aware of the superb service provided by the Holy Angels school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="22:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100063#OOO01100"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for taking this matter.  I ask the Minister for a report on the very special Carlow school, the Holy Angels School for Children with Special Needs, which I have raised on a number of occasions in the Seanad.  It is an issue very close to my heart.  I am specifically looking for a report on a new building for the school as we head into another school term this autumn with Covid-19 very much at the forefront of our minds.  The Holy Angels centre in Carlow was established in the basement of Carlow's old district hospital in 1978 because there was a need for day care for children with special needs.  It is still operating more than four decades later as a specialised preschool for children aged 18 months to six years with special needs and caters for children with a range of disabilities.  They are in urgent need of a school.</p>  <p>  Holy Angels school has been on the priority list for a new build for more than five years.  The HSE has made land available at Kelvin Grove for the new centre and I would like to know if any detailed delivery plan for the new building is being set out because this has been going on too long.  I am concerned that the site at Kelvin Grove, as I am reliably told, is on the vacant properties register but I also believe we are meant to be looking at locating a women's refuge on the site.  That is welcome because the site is big enough.  However, there is no concrete plan in place.  The children, their families, the staff and the management cannot wait any longer as the current conditions in the school simply are not good enough.  I reiterate that the staff in Holy Angels are among the very best in the country but it is not fair to expect them to make the best of things when it is clear they are operating in a school which is not fit for purpose.  As we all know, early intervention is essential for children attending such a specialised service to develop new skills and reach their full potential.  The children, their families, the staff, the management and the wider community are relying on me to ensure that the centre will get their long-promised school.  Holy Angels is at the centre of our community in Carlow and it is a centre we all actively support in whatever way we can do so.  For far too long they have been on a priority list for a school that is fit for purpose but they still do not have their school.</p> <p>These special children need a place to go that is fit for purpose.  Their families and the staff need a building that is fit for purpose to continue with the great job they are doing.</p> <p> The programme for Government states that we must plan early for adolescents and young adults with care needs such as special education, disability services or juvenile justice so they too can play a valued role in our society.  With all the current constraints on capital funding, can I get a commitment that this long-promised school building will be forthcoming for the Holy Angels day care centre?  It worries me that after 40 years the centre is still housed in prefabs.  It is disgraceful.  Children with special needs are in prefabs.  Last year the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, allocated a small amount of funding because the roof was leaking and there was a problem with the floor.  If we do not get a new school I will have real concerns that the Holy Angels centre will not exist any more.  I am seeking a commitment from the Minister of State.  I look forward to hearing her response and I hope it is a good one.</p></speech>

The Deputy has long advocated a new building for the Holy Angels day care centre and her commitment to seeing progress on this project deserves to be acknowledged, as does the work the staff at Holy Angels do for children with disabilities.  As can be seen in the programme for Government, we are committed to improving the lives of children with disabilities through further developing services and supports, particularly early access to assessment and intervention.  This provides children with the best start in life, enabling them to reach their full potential.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for State with responsibility for disabilities, I want to be open and transparent with Deputies on all issues raised with me, as well as my plans to improve and strengthen these areas.  It is not just Deputies that deserve this degree of openness, but also people using disability services themselves.  People deserve honesty, not waffle.  </p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware the area of disabilities is moving from the Department of Health to the newly reconfigured Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It will take time for this to happen.  My hope is that once complete, this move will ensure a greater focus on disabilities.  Instead of the sector being swamped by other issues in the Department of Health, this move will allow for clear pathways to be developed to ensure progress on capital projects like the Holy Angels day care centre, the reduction of waiting lists and access to disability services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of a building for the Holy Angels centre with the then Minister of State, Finian McGrath, last December.  Having looked at the file, I do not want to rehash information the Deputy already knows, which is of no real benefit either to the Deputy or to the children and staff of Holy Angels.  As the Deputy will recall, following the meeting between the head of disability services and the board of management of Holy Angels in October 2019, a further meeting was to take place in March 2020.  That meeting was put on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  A new meeting has been scheduled for 4 September.  The head of disability services will meet with the board of management.  This will take place in line with all Covid-19 guidelines.  I can confirm that on the floor of the House tonight.  The follow-up meeting which was arranged with the then Minister of State will take place on 4 September.</p></speech>

It will have implications for Brexit, foreign direct investment and foreign trade.  Quite simply, on foot of this judgment, the EU-US privacy shield has been declared invalid.  As such, there is no safe and legal way to transfer data from a European Union citizen to the United States.  Any company carrying out such data transfers is doing so at significant risk.</p>  <p>  This case started in June 2013, seven years ago.  Hopefully now that we finally have the judgment, we can see some real action to protect the fundamental rights of European citizens concerning their own data and privacy.  The collapse and demise of the EU-US privacy shield was inevitable and widely predicted.  It was a replacement for the previous safe harbour arrangement, to which little change had been made.  As that arrangement had been declared invalid, this ruling was inevitable.  It would be really positive if we could see some action from the Data Protection Commissioner to prevent what are, according to the European Court of Justice, unsafe and illegal transfers of data.  The German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information has already been warning people that they should stop these data transfers because of the demise of the EU-US privacy shield and the insufficient safeguards built into the standard contractual clauses on which companies will now have to rely.</p>  <p>  The plaintiff in the case, Max Schrems, has published an open letter to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner asking when she will take action.  One point we need to know is when the action will happen.  The important follow-up question is whether the Data Protection Commissioner actually can act.  Have we given her the resources to act properly?  While her budget has increased, it is only a third of what she asked for.  Her budget has failed to keep pace with the complexity and volume of complaints her office receives.  We have seen her struggle to deal with this case.  Serious complaints concerning real-time bidding, a very scary practice where data privacy is concerned, seem to have stalled and are going nowhere.  Other data protection authorities around Europe have called us out as the roadblock to meaningful enforcement of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  We need to say when the action will happen.  Are we giving the Data Protection Commissioner what she needs to act?  I have said several times in this Chamber that we have not.  After this judgment, her workload will not just become more complex; it will also massively increase.  She does not have enough resources as it is, so we need to do more.  This has huge consequences for many areas.</p></speech>

I am glad to be responding to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is a very important case.  The Deputy has mentioned the implications for Ireland's data protection regime of the recent judgement of the European Court of Justice on the EU-US privacy shield.  I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the matter.</p>  <p>  The Government respects the views and findings of the European Court of Justice and is fully supportive of the need to protect European citizens' data.  This is an issue that affects us all and should be subject to the highest protections.  The Minister acknowledges that the court's decision to strike down the EU-US privacy shield is a matter of serious concern for Irish and European businesses that transfer data to the US but welcomes the court's findings upholding the use of standard contractual clauses to facilitate the transfer of data between the EU and countries outside it.  The Minister notes that in these matters, it is important that we respect the independence of the courts and the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  The Data Protection Commission is an independent national authority responsible for upholding the fundamental right of individuals in the EU to have their personal data protected.  The DPC is the Irish supervisory authority for the GDPR and has functions and powers related to other important regulatory frameworks, including the Irish e-privacy regulations, and the EU directive known as the law enforcement directive. </p>  <p>  Matters concerning data protection are governed by several legislative frameworks, including the GDPR, the Data Protection Acts, the law enforcement directive and the 2011 e-privacy regulations.</p> <p>The DPC is entirely independent of the Government, as is required under the GDPR.  Together with our EU partners, we will need to examine the impact the ruling of the European Court of Justice will have on the continued use of standard contractual clauses, SCCs.  Although the original reference to the Court of Justice originated from our High Court, this is not solely an Irish matter, as the Deputy noted, and it is not one that we can unilaterally fix.  The ruling strikes down the European Commission's adequacy decision on the EU-US privacy shield.   We will need to review the judgment and will work with the European Commission and our European partners to contribute to a solution.</p></speech>

American data protection standards do not meet that adequacy standard, as we have seen in the context of Safe Harbor and now the EU-US privacy shield.  There is no way that these SCCs will hold up to examination.  What will happen is that the DPC will have to examine individually each of the approximately 5,500 SCCs, which will add to its workload.  It is deeply predictable that they will not stand up because the adequacy is not there.</p>  <p>  The same problems that mean the US data protection controls are inadequate exist in the UK.  Very soon, we will not be able to transfer data to the UK, which will make Brexit just a little bit more awkward and, as we know, it is already damn awkward.</p>  <p>  The Data Protection Commissioner is not entirely independent of the Government.  It is the Government that provides her budget and ensures she has adequate staff and resources to do this work.  Her work has just become significantly more complicated.  Her office was already struggling under the weight and complexity of complaints.  We need to provide more funding for the DPC and look very seriously at the consequences that may ensue because the SCCs quite simply will not stand up and are not safe.  In fact, the transfer of data should not happen until they are certified as adequate.  It is evident that they will not be so certified, given the record of decisions on this matter.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy McEntee, supports the entitlement of people across the EU to exercise their rights of data protection.  However, the independence of our courts and the European Court of Justice must be respected, as must the independence of the DPC.  I take on board the point made by the Deputy regarding the funding of the DPC but it does not detract from its independence.  All Members accept that it is independent.</p>  <p>  Although the Minister appreciates that the Court of Justice decision to strike down the privacy shield is a matter of serious concern for Irish and European businesses that transfer data to the US, she welcomes the court's findings which uphold SCCs.  She is confident that the issues arising from the judgment can be resolved by working in conjunction with our EU partners.  In so doing, the Government will endeavour to arrive at practical solutions.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for his very helpful comments on the matter.</p></speech>

I am sure he will continue the excellent work done previously by his constituency colleague, Deputy McEntee.  The Minister of State and I have discussed matters pertaining to Europe and, indeed, Brexit, many times in recent years in the media and various other forums.  As he well knows and has seen in recent months, Ireland holds a great deal of influence around the world, particularly in the EU.  In recent years, two Irish people have held the vital role of Secretary General of the European Commission.  Ms Emily O'Reilly is the current European Ombudsman, while Ms Emer Cooke is head of the European Medicines Agency.</p>  <p>  However, all is not well.  These achievements do not hide the fact that officials expect a significant reduction in the number of Irish officials working in the EU institutions in the coming years as many high-ranking officials are nearing retirement age.  There was a surge of talented Irish people taking up roles in the European institutions in the 1970s and 1980s, but our representation there has not been consistently replenished.  Like our colleagues in Denmark, we are well below the replacement level, which will reduce Ireland's influence.  Ireland has an incredibly strong diplomatic presence around the world.  We must not allow that to fall by the wayside within the EU which is so close to home.  Since 2015, only five Irish citizens have entered the EU Concours programme, while 150 have completed a blue book traineeship.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to developing a strategy to increase Ireland's presence in the senior ranks of the EU institutions.  The best way to do that is to encourage and facilitate young Irish people who apply for internships or entry-level positions.  It is vital that a plan be published to support and promote this strategy as soon as possible.  Another way of maintaining our influence would be to second civil servants to EU institutions where needed and appropriate.  On average, 24 secondments take place annually to the EU.  The scheme is vital in building up expertise in the Civil Service and should be expanded.</p>  <p>  There is much more that can be done.  To put it bluntly, Ireland struggles in the context of foreign languages.  While most of the measures that would address this problem are outside the remit of the Minister of State, I hope he will put pressure on the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to roll out an increased focus on European languages at primary level.</p>  <p>  Beyond that, we need to be more creative.  On the day of his funeral, perhaps we could take a page out of Jack Charlton's book.  How many Irish citizens are living in Brussels, may have grown up there and are keen to pursue a career in the EU institutions?  Ireland is far more cosmopolitan now than it was when we joined the EEC.  Many young Irish graduates are multilingual as their parents grew up outside Ireland.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there is an issue that relates to our native language.  Dozens of positions for Irish lawyer linguists are not being filled.  There are extremely lucrative careers for Gaeilgeoirs in the EU which could provide Ireland with great influence.  How can we make the most of that opportunity?</p>  <p>  Moving beyond the issue of language, the Concours is an unwieldy and difficult examination process that requires dedicated supports to be provided to candidates by the State.  In addition to the extremely important third level recruitment campaigns in which the Minister of State will doubtless take part - I have taken part in them in a private capacity - there is far more that needs to be done at the stage after traineeships.  Irish candidates for the Concours need real support in the process.  We need to encourage Irish people who are already living in Brussels to apply for these positions.  It may be possible to engage with Irish people who have recently retired from the EU institutions with a view to them providing a mentoring service.</p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, we have seen European solidarity in its finest form.  The solidarity with Ireland shown by our European partners and the EU institutions during the Brexit process is the result of many years of strong Irish influence on and within the EU.  It is, therefore, vital that we address this glaring problem.  We need a revamp and an imaginative strategy to address this issue because, simply, time will not wait for us.</p></speech>

As he is aware, dealing with this issue is a key commitment of the programme for Government and, in fact, a key personal commitment of mine.  It is an issue I identified early on as one I wish to champion in my role.  I am glad that the Deputy is singing from the same hymn sheet, as I knew he would.</p>  <p>  Ireland's membership of the EU brings with it a range of employment possibilities for Irish citizens in the EU institutions.  We have punched above our weight at EU level for many decades, with the most notable current examples of that being Ms Emily O'Reilly, the European Ombudsman, as well as a number of very senior officials in the European Commission.  Of course, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was recently elected president of the Eurogroup.  As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I was in contact with colleagues regarding that election.  A former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, serves as EU special representative for human rights.  A former Deputy from my county, John Bruton, has served as the EU's ambassador to the US.  It is noteworthy that an Irish official, Ms Emer Cooke, was recently selected as the incoming executive director of the European Medicines Agency.  She will be the first woman to lead that regulatory agency since it was formed 25 years ago.</p>  <p>  Ireland has benefitted greatly from its citizens having key roles in the institutions.  Mr. David O'Sullivan and Ms Catherine Day are two of the most recent Secretaries General of the European Commission.  Irish officials working in the EU institutions know our culture, system and priorities and can provide a crucial understanding of the Irish context during the process of policy formulation and implementation at EU level.  However, as the Deputy stated, it has become clear in recent years that we are heading for a demographic cliff in the context of our representation within the EU.  Approximately 29% of Irish officials there are over 58 years of age and will retire within the next decade.  The level of Irish representation will fall dramatically in light of projected retirements.  As the Deputy stated, we are far below the replacement rate at our current rates of recruitment and that poses a serious challenge for us.</p> <p>That is why the programme for Government commits to the development of a new strategy to increase the presence of Irish people in the senior ranks and generally in the EU institutions.  We will also aim to increase the number of young Irish people applying for internships and we will work with Irish officials and universities on outreach.</p> <p> The strategy, which I have already started to work on, will build on and bring together the significant work already being done by the Government and by my predecessor in this role, the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee.  I echo the compliments Deputy Richmond expressed about her.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade runs the EU jobs campaign, which promotes careers in the EU.  As part of the EU jobs campaign, my predecessor as well as Department officials attended careers events in a range of universities in 2019 and 2020.  I will also participate in those as part of the strategy, virtually or in-person, as public health guidance permits.  The EU jobs campaign also provides support to Irish candidates and provides direct assistance to Irish citizens who have applied for permanent jobs in the EU institutions, providing information and advice for the duration of the recruitment competition.  Only tonight, a constituent contacted me for guidance on those processes and procedures because they are very difficult.  </p> <p> My Department also works closely with the European Personnel Selection Office, the key body responsible for the recruitment of staff to the institutions, on the EU career ambassadors programme.  This programme works in collaboration with Irish universities to select around a dozen students each year to promote career opportunities in the EU to their fellow students.  We work with a range of other stakeholders, including the Public Appointments Service and European Movement Ireland, in this regard as well.  The recruitment of Irish graduates to the European Commission through AD5 competitions has been at the rate of one to two successful candidates a year.  While this might not seem very impressive, it is proportionate to our population.  However, this will not be sufficient to match the numbers of those expected to retire in the coming years and we will be reinforcing our efforts very significantly in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

It is a very difficult process that lies ahead of everyone, not just the Minister of State.  It behoves everyone in this House and throughout society to see more Irish people working within the EU.  One of my biggest criticisms of the European project - I do occasionally criticise it - is its inability to sell itself.  The European Commission is brilliant at informing people as to how they can criticise the Commission and its work but it does not sell the brilliant achievements it has made over the last 60 or so years.  Equally, the Irish Government is not selling Europe.  Regardless of what party is in power and what party holds the Minister of State's brief, we are not selling Europe.  We are not convincing young Irish graduates that a career in the European institutions should be an attractive one.  I will declare an interest.  I lived on the Continent for two years and did not pursue that career for personal reasons.  We need to make sure that people realise employment in the European institutions is lucrative and well paid and offers great opportunities for travel and to build experience.  Many people have countered this saying it may be because of the economic boom in Ireland but that is not a fair comparison.  I encourage the Minister of State to look at some of the more imaginative suggestions I have made on attracting talent.  I very much welcome his commitment to engage with stakeholders.  Vital among them is European Movement Ireland.  I also urge the Minister of State to engage with the College of Europe.  Every year, Irish individuals go to the College of Europe on scholarship but how many of them, having been trained to work in the European institutions, go on to work in the Commission, Parliament or Council?  How many of them instead work in the private sector?  While the latter is a fine choice, it does not always benefit Ireland Inc. and our importance of imagination.</p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting my Topical Issue matter and thank the Minister of State for his engagement.</p></speech>

It is a priority to address the decreased number of Irish people working in the institutions.  With that in mind, I have had extensive meetings on this to continue to develop the strategy that is already under way thanks to my predecessor.  I have arranged a number of meetings with stakeholders for the coming weeks.  The Deputy raises the very important point that it is not simply about the application procedure and encouraging people.  We have deficiencies in this country in terms of languages.  Certainly in the programme for Government negotiations I was very keen to have the modern languages initiative reinstated at primary school.  That is in the programme for Government and I will working on that with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  We have a national hang-up about languages and it is about time we got over it.  I do not know what the reason is but we are bad at learning languages and that includes our national language.  I was very pleased to speak Irish last week at the General Affairs Council.  There is not much point in fighting for its status and then not using the language when we have that status.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government makes a very clear commitment to the development of a new strategy to increase the presence of Irish people in the senior ranks of institutions and in respect of the number of young people.  This is a critical issue for this country.  I join the Deputy in saying that it is so important for us to constantly talk about the benefits of European Union membership.  I have endeavoured to do so even over the last two days.  The very fact of an agreement at European level this weekend, that give and take, those negotiations, those tough talks will undoubtedly bring immense benefits to all of the European Union.  We have seen that over the decades and will continue to benefit from it.  We have peace and stability in Europe and thank God for it.</p>  <p>  I would be more than happy to engage with all colleagues in the House and with Deputy Richmond on this issue.  It is a challenge that, working together, we can address.  I fully intend to continue to build upon the work of my predecessors on this issue and to bring real improvements to the numbers of Irish people working in the institutions.  I also wish to pay tribute to those who are working in this country in the various offices and agencies of the institutions, including at Grange in my constituency.</p></speech>

I am focusing on the cases of Belgooly and Shannonvale tonight but I will send details to the Minister of State about issues in areas from Bandon to Goleen on the Mizen Peninsula.</p>  <p>  From an environmental and health perspective, the very least people should expect is the proper treatment of wastewater and household sewage.  However, years of under-investment in water infrastructure has left communities and areas exposed to discharges and serious malodour.  The EPA report entitled Water Quality in Ireland 2013-2018 found that almost half of our rivers, lakes and estuaries are ecologically unsatisfactory.  Wastewater discharge is listed as one of the main causes of deterioration, after agriculture. </p>  <p>  The programme for Government acknowledges our water infrastructure deficits and their role in pollution and environmental damage.  I welcome the commitment to ensure Irish Water can invest in wastewater treatment and want to raise two cases in west Cork which need to be prioritised.  Belgooly is a wonderful village between Cork city and Kinsale, a great place to live near the coast.  However, the quality of life for residents in Riverbank and surrounding estates has been seriously affected by awful odours coming from a wastewater treatment plant for close to two years now.  Residents there have to keep their windows closed, and at times they cannot let their children out to play.  There are also reports of untreated wastewater from this plant being discharged into a nearby estuary.  I will quote a tweet by a local from 11 July: "Another beautiful day ended abruptly with the horrendous malodour from our treatment plant, the smell is in my home, we had to close all windows again and endure the smell indoors as well as outdoors.  We can't even open our windows tonight to cool down!"  This plant is not working.  It is clearly not fit for purpose.  The most distressing thing for residents is that this is not being resolved.  Repeated complaints have been lodged with Irish Water and the EPA.  Engineers visit, the tank is de-sludged and we are assured the plant is within capacity, yet the issue remains. </p>  <p>  I and my team have been attempting to deal with this issue for considerably less time than the residents, but we are finding ourselves lost between Irish Water and other bodies, between different reports, and other bureaucratic barriers.  The people of Belgooly are being fobbed off.  This cannot go on.  Will the Minister of State give me an assurance that he will take action on this?  </p>  <p>  That is not all.  There is one more case I want to raise.  There is also a desperate need for immediate action on the issue of an overflowing septic tank in Shannonvale near Clonakilty.  The plant, which services nine houses in the area, was put into the park in the middle of the village.  It is a beautiful site next to the Argideen river, which used to host many community events until this was installed.  It was the town park and public amenity area.  Now it is overgrown and dilapidated with a septic tank that is overflowing with untreated water that is flooding into the area and then entering the river.  The Minister of State can imagine how awful that is for residents in Shannonvale.  The park should be the heart of the village but instead it is currently unsafe for children to play in.  Irish Water, Cork County Council and the EPA have all been aware of the situation for years, but it has not been resolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-21a.550" nospeaker="true" time="23:35:00" ><p>The council empties the plant regularly and sedimentation has been added, but the underlying issue remains.  The people of Shannonvale also need action.</p><p>I have visited these communities in recent weeks.  I do not want to return and tell them the same thing they have been told by Irish Water or the council.  I want to tell them they do not have to put up with this anymore.  It is unacceptable.  Will the Minister of State please do something about it and not do an Irish Water on it and pass the problem onto someone else, carry out a report that achieves nothing or simply ignore this?</p></speech>

At the outset, I should highlight that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as environmental regulator, is responsible for setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU directives and national regulations for drinking water supplies and wastewater discharges to water bodies.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  Irish Water's primary function is to provide clean safe drinking water to customers and to collect, treat and return wastewater safely back to the environment, including the two wastewater treatment plants raised tonight by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  My Department no longer has any direct role in monitoring or supervising the delivery of water services.  However, from inquiries made with Irish Water, I understand that while refurbishment works were carried out in 2018, further investigations for sewer network blockages and possible malfunctions have been carried out and issues rectified where possible. Notwithstanding these actions, Irish Water is considering the need for an upgrade to the treatment plant at Belgooly to cater for the existing and projected future loading in the area during the investment planning process for their next capital investment plan.  I understand from Irish Water that the treatment system at Shannonvale consists of a septic tank and percolation area that serves a terrace of nine houses.  The septic tank is not overloaded, however Irish Water's investigations suggest that the source of the issue is the percolation area.  Irish Water is examining what operational, remedial works or capital maintenance works are required to be undertaken in advance of any infrastructure project at Shannonvale.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate the investment needs across our entire water system are considerable; they will take a number of investment cycles to fully resolve and will require significant and sustained investment.  Under the recently adopted programme for Government, the Government has committed to continuing the &euro;8.5 billion funding package agreed in Project Ireland 2040, which will be invested in public water services to ensure the continued operation, repair and upgrading of Ireland's water and wastewater infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and ensure compliance with EU directives.  In more general terms, the Government's river basin management plan 2018-2021 outlines what Ireland is doing to protect and improve all of our waters.  The next river basin management plan is currently being prepared by my Department.</p>  <p>  I accept that Deputy Cairns makes a very strong argument for her constituents in the two areas mentioned, especially in relation to the safety of those in Shannonbay, particularly children.  I will revert back to Irish Water through the Department and see what we can get.  There are many areas throughout the country which have significant pressure points that are urgent and will require significant capital investment in the coming years, including in my own constituency.  It takes money to fund them but Project Ireland 2040 has a significant budget behind it.  </p></speech>

I know it is Irish Water's responsibility but there seems to be some confusion.  The Minister of State says it is all Irish Water's responsibility but I know that Cork County Council is responsible for desludging, for example, so there are grey areas.  When it affects people's quality of life, at what point can the State intervene if Irish Water continually fobs off communities?  I said it was affecting people's lives, which this included not being able to take children out during lockdown.  Some might be at the stage of wanting to move and their house prices are affected.</p>  <p>  We need greater transparency around how projects are prioritised as funding becomes available.  Shannonvale has been an issue for years. </p>  <p>We have been in contact with the EPA which, as the Minister of State noted, has responsibility for this too.  It is appalling for the local community that this has not been resolved. </p>  <p>  Can we have clarity on how funding is prioritised?  The Minister of State said the project was on the next capital grant list.  Is that guaranteed?  When will it happen? </p></speech>

In providing these critical services Irish Water plays a role enabling social and economic growth.  It faces a great challenge because more than 1 billion litres of wastewater from homes and businesses are collected every day in Ireland's public sewers and treated in 1,100 different treatment plants across our system.  As I pointed out, the capital investment programme is significant but the scale of the problem in the country is also quite significant.  I commit to go back to Irish Water about the two areas mentioned.  It is examining what remedial capital maintenance works in Shannonvale can be carried out in advance of the capital programme.  Belgooly is a significant issue for the residents of Riverbank and is serious, as the Deputy has noted that effluent is possibly being discharged into the estuary.  The Deputy has made a strong case about both matters and I will bring it to Irish Water but I must also be clear that there are quite a number of competing issues for Irish Water's capital investment programme.  There are problems across the country and they must be assessed independently by Irish Water.  Those in most need must be catered for first.  I will do my best to bring something back.</p></speech>
