More than 70% of EU traffic literally travels over our heads but we can only see those aircraft if they choose to allow us to do so by turning on their transponders.  Why is this, and what is the Minister's view on the provision of primary radar?</p></reply>

As this is the first time she and I have had formal questions, I congratulate her on her appointment.  I look forward to working with her.</p>  <p>  My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.   </p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me.  Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence and as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period covered by the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.   </p>  <p>  Regarding primary radar, the 2015 White Paper on Defence states that should funding beyond that required to maintain existing Air Corps capabilities become available, the development of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps is a priority.  The 2019 White Paper update pointed out that the National Development Plan 2018-2027, which provides &euro;541 million in capital funding for defence for the period up to 2022, does not make provision for a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps. </p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan 2020-2024, which was published in June 2020, sets out the key priorities for equipment investment in the Defence Forces.  The provision of a primary radar capability is included in the equipment development plan's pre-planning category.  Funding for the provision of radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps has not been provided in the current resource envelope under the equipment development plan.  Any future decisions in this regard will be in the context of Defence Forces priorities, having regard to the ongoing security environment and any associated developments.  However, the inclusion of a primary radar project on the equipment development plan will ensure that should funding become available, Department officials and Defence Forces colleagues will be in position to progress the matter through the equipment development plan's prioritisation and decision-making process.</p></reply>

I understand that agreement was signed by the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Irish Aviation Authority, a commercial State body not directly answerable to the Oireachtas.  Is it true that the input of the General Officer Commanding of the Air Corps, who has statutory responsibility for military aviation, was not included in these negotiations?  When was that agreement reached?  What are its details?  What impact will Brexit have on that agreement?</p>  <p>  The lack of primary radar is the reason other state entities have been probing our airspace for years with high-altitude bombers and escorts.  These foreign aircraft can see us but we cannot see them.  They are not testing their capabilities, but those of the RAF.</p></speech>

The Air Corps is not equipped to monitor aircraft flying over the entirety of Irish airspace, nor is it tasked with that role.  We have a relatively small Air Corps which does a really good job at what it is asked to do.  We are not like many other countries that spend hundreds of millions or billions of euro on fighter aircraft that can monitor and defend airspace.  For many years, we have chosen not to prioritise that equipment and funding.  As Minister of Defence, a brief which I have held previously, I think it is important to be upfront about our capability and the role we ask the Air Corps to perform.  We have just purchased three new Pilatus PC-12 aircraft which are very well equipped for surveillance.  The Air Corps has a limited defence capacity, but it is important not to pretend to have a capacity we do not have.</p>  <p>  Regarding relationships with our closest neighbour on defence issues, we have a memorandum of understanding with the UK on training and several other issues.  Some arrangements for sharing capacity, which might be expected of two countries next door to each other, are in place.  </p></speech>

At the moment, our skies are patrolled by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, an organisation we consistently refuse to align with, citing our neutrality.  Our pilots are trained in America and Australia, one of NATO's largest troop contributors.  These facts can be viewed as eroding our expressed neutrality, the cornerstone of our foreign policy.  The international standing of Ireland can now be legitimately questioned in this regard.  In my opinion, this is a serious loss of sovereignty.  I will ask the Minister again.  What are the details of the agreement with the RAF and what impact will Brexit have?</p></speech>

Ireland is not a member of NATO and is not going to join it.  We are not compromised by our relationship with NATO.  We are a neutral State that is militarily non-aligned and we behave as such.  That does not mean that we do not speak to NATO or engage in overseas peacekeeping operations in a way that is linked to NATO, as we have done in the past.  We currently work with NATO on operations in Kosovo, for example, and we previously worked with it on de-mining in Afghanistan.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It does not mean that we are compromised in any way.  Rather, it means we focus on interoperability to ensure that when we have peacekeeping missions abroad, we can work with others to make sure we protect our troops and do a good job.</p></speech>

They have been the last form of defence for the country on many occasions.  They travel the world to defend peace in difficult and dangerous places.  They work in shockingly difficult conditions with very low pay.  That has been very damaging to morale within the Defence Forces and has also dealt a blow in terms of their numbers to the extent that it is increasingly difficult for the Defence Forces to function in the manner they wish.  When will the Minister meet representatives of the Defence Forces?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-08a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100800004#B00400"><p>On assuming my role as Minister for Defence, one of my first actions was to meet the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, namely, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO.  At the meeting in a barracks in Cork, we agreed that we should commit to meeting on a more regular basis and I am happy to follow through on that.  I hope we can meet quarterly or at least three times per year or as needed.  As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces was published on 4 July 2019.  The report was accepted in full by the then Government and, in order to facilitate implementation, an extensive high-level plan entitled Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One, was agreed and published on the same date.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the representative associations have been briefed on a regular basis by the officials of my Department charged with co-ordinating all the projects in the high-level plan as to progress in each of the project areas.  I understand that some ten briefings, oral and written, have been provided to date, with the latest taking place on 1 October.  In addition to the briefings, there is a standing invitation to the representative associations to submit any material they wish to be considered relating to any of the projects.  In this context, several submissions with extensive observations have been made and I appreciate this engagement.</p>  <p>  The immediate pay recommendations in the high-level implementation plan have all been delivered on foot of their acceptance by the representative associations.  The timelines for the other projects which are set out in the plan were reviewed as the projects progressed and as work requirements become more evident.  I am satisfied that the projects outlined in the plan are being prioritised and delivered as quickly as possible.  However, it must be acknowledged that the anticipated timeframes for certain projects were overly ambitious.  In addition, the Covid-19 emergency has impacted on some of the project timeframes.  In some cases, personnel resources were necessarily reassigned to matters relating to the Covid-19 response and where other essential work was necessary, that took priority.  However, work is ongoing on all projects and they are being progressed as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  I intend to develop a very good relationship with the representative bodies.  I hope we can meet regularly.  I expect that we will meet next week to go through the terms of reference for the upcoming commission for the review of the Defence Forces.  I also wish to speak to them about a series of other issues.  My style and approach as a Minister will be one of engagement.  If necessary, that will be robust engagement, but I certainly wish to hear what the representative bodies have to say.  We will respond as best we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-08a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100800004#B00500"><p>I welcome the Minister's statement because I have spoken to representatives of the Defence Forces and they have asked when the implementation plan for the strengthening of the Defence Forces will be discussed.  A representative of RACO recently stated that there are 300 fewer personnel in the Defence Forces than there were when the plan was put in place last year.  Although there is a plan, we are still going in the wrong direction.  Military officers have been quoted in newspapers as stating that, so far, it has been allowed to fail.  It was obvious that the plan was failing well before Covid hit, so it is not necessarily the case that the pandemic has affected its implementation.  A retired general told me that the low numbers are affecting operational capability on land and sea.  I understand the Minister may have a different perspective and approach and I welcome that, but it is really important that he discuss with representatives of the Defence Forces how each level of the strengthening of the Defence Forces plan is implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-08a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100800004#B00600"><p>To be blunt, that is happening.  It is true the benefit of the plan has not yet been seen in terms of increasing numbers in the Defence Forces.  We had and continue to have a recruitment and retention challenge in the Defence Forces.  That challenge was particularly acute in the Air Corps which, frankly, did not have enough pilots.  That has been turned around in the past 12 months or so and it now has enough pilots.  As Members are aware, there are particular problems in the Naval Service.  Ships that should be going to sea are tied up because there are insufficient crews and specialties in terms of skill sets to crew them.  That is not acceptable to me or this House.  We have been working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to address some of those issues and we are continuing to so do.  Likewise, investment is required in certain areas of the Army.  It is often the case in politics that when things are done they tend to get banked and people move on to the next thing.  A significant amount of implementation of the plan is already in place and signed off on.  There are some matters outstanding but we are prioritising getting them done as quickly as possible.  There are other things that need to be done beyond the plan, which is why we are putting a commission in place which it is hoped will be set up in the coming three or four weeks, ahead of schedule.  That will be a clear statement to the Defence Forces that we are prioritising the upcoming commission and the work it will do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-08a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100800004#B00700"><p>I acknowledge the Minister stated things have been done, but this issue did not arise overnight.  It is not the case that people have just put in requests for these changes.  This is not recent analysis on the weakening and reduction of the Defence Forces.  The Minister rightly indicated that it is quite shocking.  It is amazing that ships are currently tied up because crews are not available to deliver services on them.  I refer to the working time directive, which I will discuss at a later stage.  That legislation dates from 1997 and was the subject of a court case in 2010.  It is now 2020 and we are still wondering when the implementation will be ready.  I understand the Minister cannot do everything overnight but these are critical issues and I am asking that he meet the representative organisations to ensure the measures are fully implemented.</p></speech>

My Department has been working with representative organisations to get many things done relating to the reports that have been completed.  I am looking at a list of projects, most of which are complete and some of which are under way.  Some of the asks of the report were for reviews etc.  There are some asks which will be considered under the new round of pay negotiations and so on.  It is important to state that much has been achieved because often the narrative around the Defence Forces focuses on what is not working and what has not been achieved.</p> <p>Sometimes that contributes to our recruitment challenge because of the impression that is being given.</p> <p> There are real problems.  We are trying to address them and I intend addressing them head on.  Some of them involve resources and money and some involve ensuring we have open terms of reference for this upcoming commission and we appoint top-class people to that commission to make sure the work the commission will do over a 12-month period or so can impact significantly on the future of the Defence Forces.  It is an exciting time to be Minister for Defence.  We have problems to solve but we also have robust mechanisms with which to do that.</p></speech>

The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and it is currently on a developmental path arising from the recommendations of the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The primary roles allocated to the Reserve remain to augment the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, in crisis situations and to contribute to State ceremonial events.  The commitments in the White Paper serve to underpin these important roles.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent commission on the Defence Forces.  I referred to this earlier.  This commission will examine the role and contribution of the RDF, including its legislation, the regulations governing the RDF, the development of the first-line Reserve, and whether specialists from the RDF should be able to serve overseas.  I have made comments in response to Deputy Cathal Berry's questions on this issue and on whether we should accommodate it in the legislation on defence that is coming through the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The assignment in 2018 of responsibility of director of Reserve Defence Forces to the director of combat support and intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, ISTAR, based in Defence Forces headquarters, has allowed for the provision of guidance, across all units and formations with RDF assets, in developing their capabilities.  This is in line with the single force concept and the role of the Reserve as described in the White Paper.  The focus is to harness RDF skills and talent, maximising its potential development on the basis of mutual engagement with the PDF.  Specific project areas focus on training, regulation, recruitment, retention and promotions and are supported through RDF and PDF reciprocal training, mentoring and education.</p>  <p>  In relation to Columb Barracks, it is the assessment of the Department that it is no longer required for military purposes.  The current financial and administrative burden resulting from its retention cannot be sustained forever.  For this reason, my officials have been proceeding with the disposal of the barracks in line with Government policy.  They have been working with the new Land Development Agency on that process.  I will come back to it because I am sure the Deputy will have questions on it.  The site certainly has considerable potential.  The barracks was closed in 2012, which is some time ago.  The whole point of the Land Development Agency is to try to maximise for the State the potential of strategic sites such as this one.  That is probably where the focus needs to be now.</p></speech>

We are now at a critical junction where a decision needs to be made on both the Reserve Defence Force and Columb Barracks.  The investment in development and education, particularly for the youth, in experience in military lifestyles and military skills is best evidenced in the Reserve.  It encompasses positive life choices that we want for our younger people, for example, healthy living, dedication to others, skills and leadership building.</p>  <p>  When the Defence Forces reorganised in 2012, most elements of the Reserve were twinned with a parent regular unit.  In theory, this leads to greater integration, but we live in the real world, not theory.  This concept only works where there is a genuine commitment on the part of the State to develop the Defence Forces.  I think we can all agree that the commitment level needed by the Defence Forces has not been met in previous years.  We are now at a pivotal stage of considering the geographical location of Columb Barracks and how the barracks could meet the need of the Reserve Defence Force while also meeting other needs.</p></speech>

Departments and other public bodies, including Westmeath County Council, have been invited to declare an interest in acquiring the property.  However, no interest was expressed from any of these bodies.</p>  <p>  In May 2016, officials from my Department attended a public meeting in Mullingar on the future use of the barracks.  A local group was subsequently established to prepare a feasibility study on the community use of the premises.  For all sorts of reasons, a report from that group has not been furnished to the Department.  This is not about blaming anybody.  We have tried and we had a lengthy process of exploring options for use of the barracks that could add positively to the local community and the area.</p>  <p>  More recently, the Land Development Agency, on its establishment, was tasked with developing an initial tranche of eight sites, which were seen as strategic sites nationally, including the barracks in Mullingar.  Since the establishment of the Land Development Agency, the Department has actively engaged with it on the modalities associated with legal transfers, etc.  We will continue to work as best we can but it is important that I do not raise expectations around the military use of the barracks in the future because that may not be the direction of travel.</p>  <p>  I am interested in developing the potential and capacity of the Reserve Defence Force.  The Reserve is under strength and I hope we will be able to change that in the months ahead.  As I say, I am certainly open to new thinking with regard to how the Reserve functions and its role complementing the Defence Forces both at home and, potentially, abroad.  We have started that conversation within the Department.</p></speech>

Mullingar occupies a strategically important geographical location.  It is less than one hour from Dublin and less than 100 km from the Border.  It is within easy reach of Carna, the Curragh and the Glen of Imaal.  It has a multitude of land suitable for small and large-scale military exercises.  It is close to lakes and rivers.  It is ideal for water-based training.  Most critically, it already has in place infrastructure to house military units and water units on a temporary occupation.  Given the size of the site - I presume the Minister is familiar with the layout of Columb Barracks and how its existing structure is essentially landlocked by existing housing developments - it could be adapted to serve the needs of the Reserve, the groups that currently use the facility as well as other needs in the town.</p></speech>

The community groups currently using the barracks are Westmeath GAA, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, Lakeshore Wheelers, the Order of Malta, Mullingar Boxing Club, a crafts school, Mullingar Sub Aqua Club, the north-Westmeath adult literacy service and a youth organisation.  As I said, the Land Development Agency was established for a reason.  It is looking at how we can maximise the use of strategic assets nationally.  We must also protect the infrastructure that has already been put in place, which is very significant in the case of the barracks in Mullingar.</p> <p>That is likely to be the way the future gets designed and implemented, through the LDA.  We are there to support that process and offer any input that we can regarding some of the ideas the Deputy suggested.</p></speech>

This has been a long-standing request, particularly from PDFORRA, since 1994.  Will the Minister outline the rationale for this continued refusal?</p></reply>

Under the Defence Acts, 1954 to 2015, the permanent Defence Forces representative associations are prohibited from being associated with or affiliated with any trade unions or any other body without the consent of the Minister. </p>  <p>  To compensate for these restrictions, there are a range of statutory redress mechanisms available to serving members, including redress of wrongs, a Defence Forces Ombudsman and a conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the European Committee of Social Rights, in a non-binding ruling, found that Ireland was in violation of the European Social Charter in respect of the right to organise, that is to affiliate to certain organisations, and the right to negotiate collective agreements.  It found that Ireland was not in violation of the charter in respect of the prohibition of the right of military personnel to strike.  </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the long-standing desire of PDFORRA to associate with ICTU.  However, association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective.  It is critically important that Defence Forces operations are not restricted and this is a key concern.</p>  <p>  The European Committee of Social Rights, in arriving at its decision, took into an account a statement made in the complaint which claimed that ICTU had stated that &ldquo;PDFORRA could be affiliated to ICTU with whatever conditions the Government deemed necessary&rdquo;.  Defence management, civil and military, have engaged in discussions with the permanent Defence Forces representative associations and ICTU regarding the practicalities of a Defence Forces representative association forming association or affiliation with ICTU.  These discussions have encompassed matters of concern to all parties.</p>  <p>  PDFORRA subsequently initiated legal proceedings on this matter on 26 June 2020.  As this matter is now subject to litigation, it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p>  <p>  This is an issue I would rather was not in court and was not concluded by legal ruling.  What we are trying to do in setting up a commission to look at all issues, including pay and structures within the Defence Forces, and the commitment in the programme for Government to set up a separate pay entity to assess pay within the Defence Forces after the initial commission's work is to recognise that serving in the Defence Forces is different to other public sector work.  People take an oath to the State, they are the last line of defence for the State and compromises come with that.  My job is to ensure that we more than take account of that in the structures that are there to represent Defence Forces personnel properly, whether that be in public sector pay talks or in any other area.  I do not have a closed mind in this area but I have real concerns and will continue to speak to PDFORRA and other representative bodies about their concerns.</p></reply>

The numbers of members of the Defence Forces who have to rely on the working family payment is a stark illustration of this and for public sector talks to go ahead with no input from members of the Defence Forces is not right.  Unfortunately, legal proceedings had to be initiated because of the Government's heel dragging on the issue.  It is not a route that anyone would like to go down, particularly members of the Defence Forces or their representative bodies.</p>  <p>  Many European states allow members of their defence forces to engage with trade unions and enjoy the right to collective bargaining.  It should be no different here.  Many of the concerns that have been raised in the past have been addressed by PDFORRA and other representative bodies.  Will the Minister outline his concerns?  It is a fundamental right to be able to associate with a trade union.</p></speech>

I understand there are as many people in my Department on working family payment as there are in the Defence Forces.  The payment is calculated based on a range of factors.  I do not want there to be an impression that members of the Defence Forces are the only people in the public sector that are on working family payment; that is just not true.  Of course, we are looking at pay and conditions in the Defence Forces to try to ensure that it is an attractive career path and we can deal with the recruitment and retention issues that everyone knows has been a problem, but let us not exaggerate for effect, please, because that also has an impact, as I keep saying, on our ability to be able to attract people into the Defence Forces.  Every time we talk about the Defence Forces in this House, the questions come up in a very negative light.  My job is to be real and to accept problems when they are there.  I do, and there are problems which we need to fix, but there are also very positive aspects for people who choose a career in the Defence Forces in what that career path offers.</p>  <p>  I do not have a closed mind on this issue but my primary focus is to ensure that the Defence Forces are always there when we need them and that no decision I make can impede the ability of that response that we rely on the Defence Forces for.  We need to ensure that concerns are reflected and that there are systems in place to support Defence Forces personnel in that regard.</p></speech>

That is shameful and really low.  The stark reality is this sector has no input into national pay agreements and must take the agreement or leave it, unlike other workers who are allowed have representatives around the table.</p>  <p>  An argument put forward is that it would be completely wrong if members of the Defence Forces, having associated with ICTU, might go on strike.  That red herring has been put forward time and again.  PDFORRA has stated categorically that it has no intention of doing so and that it would withdraw if there were any concerns on that issue.  The European Committee of Social Rights stated that the right to strike is incompatible with military service and PDFORRA completely accepts that argument.  From my perspective, and that of the representative bodies, there are no reasons they cannot freely associate with ICTU.  The Minister said he is open to it; now is the time to do it.</p> <p>No one wants to go down the route of taking legal proceedings, but they can be withdrawn if there is a commitment from the Department and the Government to allow the freedom to associate with ICTU.  I ask that the Minister make that commitment on the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

That is not my style.  That the Deputy would try to create that narrative reflects his approach to this issue.  I am working hard to ensure that everyone in the Defence Forces is understood in terms of the frustrations and challenges he or she faces and that we respond to those financially and from a policy perspective.  This is what I am doing to try to ensure that we can attract the numbers and talent we need into the Defence Forces.  I am not pitting anyone against anybody.  I am simply giving the Deputy the factual position on the working family payment.  Unfortunately, he chooses to try to twist that into something else.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that representative bodies in the Defence Forces will have representation in this round of pay negotiations.  I will ensure that.  It does not necessarily mean being affiliated to ICTU, but those bodies will be heard and they will be in the room to make their case.  Not only that, but we are setting up a structure separately to the pay negotiations to consider the specifics of serving in the Defence Forces.  Not only have we committed to setting up a commission to consider the future of the Defence Forces as well as all of these issues, but we are committing to establishing a pay body specifically to consider the future of Defence Forces personnel's pay and conditions.</p>  <p>  Please do not give the impression that we are not trying to prioritise Defence Forces personnel.  We absolutely are trying to prioritise them, recognising that they play a unique role in public and national service.  I do not have a closed mind on the question of whether their representative bodies being affiliated to ICTU enhances that process but I have not been convinced by the arguments.  People have a right to take legal challenges, but the issue that will determine this for me is the question of what is the right thing to do for the Defence Forces and the country in the context of the role the Defence Forces play.</p></speech>

As the House will be aware, the Defence Forces are excluded from the provisions of the Act.  However, it is important to say that the Government has committed to amending this Act and bringing the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the scope of its provisions.  There is no resistance to that.</p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for introducing this legislative change.  My Department has worked closely with that Department to progress the legislative changes required.  I am advised that responsibility for this legislation will transfer to the new Department of enterprise, trade and employment in the near future and work on progressing the requisite legislative changes will continue with that Department.</p>  <p>  The working time directive recognises the unique nature of certain military activities and allows for derogations and exemptions of such activities.  A significant amount of work has been undertaken by civil and military management in determining the military activities that fall within the scope of the directive.  I am advised that a high percentage of the normal everyday work of the Defence Forces is already in compliance with the working time directive and that a range of activities also qualify for exemption.  Deliberations on these matters are continuing between civilian and military management and will feed into amendments to the legislative framework.</p>  <p>  A subcommittee of the conciliation and arbitration council, one comprising the representative associations and military and civil management, has been established to discuss matters relating to implementation of the working time directive.  Arising from these discussions, amended practices regarding compensatory rest have been introduced.  This builds upon existing work practices relating to compensatory rest that comply with the directive.  Discussions with the Defence Forces representative associations will continue to be undertaken through this forum as the current work evolves.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Defence Forces remain fully committed to ensuring that the provisions of the directive are applied throughout the Defence Forces.  I assure the Deputies that the health and safety of personnel in the Defence Forces remain a priority for me and the Chief of Staff.</p>  <p>  We are committed to doing this.  Mine is not the primary Department introducing legislation.  It will change from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the future Department of jobs.  I assure the Deputies that I will pursue this issue and try to move it on in as timely a manner as we can.  There has already been considerable discussion, as well as a structure to facilitate that discussion, to ensure that we are doing what we can to act in the spirit of the working time directive before we introduce the amending legislation to get it done in law.</p></speech>

That is a shocking admission.  The fact that members of the Defence Forces are being paid such an income while being excluded from the provisions of the working time directive and doing many more hours than 48 hours per week is incredible.  The ECJ has stated that there is no blanket exemption and other European defence forces have implemented the directive.</p>  <p>  An incredible number of people in the Defence Forces do incredibly serious, technical and dangerous jobs.  Bomb disposal officers can be on call for 168 hours per week.  Portlaoise duty officers can be on call for 72 hours.  Individuals in the Naval Service can be on duty for two to four weeks.

It recognises the need for increased income and support from the State for people who are on low pay.  It is a safety net, as it were, for people in certain family situations.  Obviously, it is not the responsibility of my Department primarily, but it is an important safety net.</p>  <p>  We need to reflect constantly on pay levels across the Defence Forces, and that is what we are doing.  It is why we are establishing a commission and have committed to establishing a pay and conditions body specifically to examine these issues within the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  We are committed to passing legislation in respect of the working time directive as it relates to the Defence Forces and the Garda.  The reason the directive is more complicated to implement in the Defence Forces is self-evident.</p> <p>If one is off the west coast in February on patrol on a naval vessel, it is pretty difficult to fully comply with the working time directive for all roles.  We need to have derogations and exceptions, which I understand are catered for in the working time directive, for military service.  Between now and when the legislation is amended, we want to implement the spirit of what we will legislate for as best we can.  That is why the representative bodies are part of that discussion</p></speech>

The objective of the directive is also to provide for the greater compatibility of work with family life, which is massively important for everybody, but the non-adherence to the directive is also a key driver in Defence Forces personnel leaving.  This is not an effort from us to talk down the Defence Forces.  It is a demand, a request, a shout and a plea from the Defence Forces themselves.  There has been a significant loss of personnel from all ranks in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned that it is practically difficult to configure naval personnel who are off the west coast in the Atlantic Ocean for weeks on end but their hours can be averaged over a period of three, six or 12 months.  That could be done in such a way as to give them time off in lieu to allow them to still adhere to the directive.  A functioning military service and functioning Defence Forces are not incongruent to adherence to the directive.</p></speech>

We are talking to the representative bodies about that and I have outlined some of the structures that happens in.  We are listening to them, we are trying to put supports in place and we are trying to ensure that, while everybody recognises that there are exemptions for serving Defence Forces personnel, we need to try to act in a way that is consistent with the working time directive, even in the absence of the legislation being finalised.  That is what we are trying to do.  I assure the Deputies that I will push for this amending legislation as soon as is reasonable.</p></speech>

Arising from the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing, a new national security analysis centre was established during 2019 under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The purpose of the new centre is to co-ordinate between the various State bodies with national security functions and to provide strategic analysis for the Government on security threats.</p><p>Defence policy and operations form a centrally important aspect of this work, given the nature of the threat environment.  In this regard, NSAC commenced work on the development of a national security strategy in 2019.  The strategy will aim to set out a whole-of-government approach for how the State can protect its national security and vital interests from current and emerging threats.  An expert policy forum and a public consultation process have provided significant inputs for this process.  While further consultation has been constrained by the restrictions necessitated by Covid-19, the centre has continued its research activity in this regard over the recent months.</p><p>A director has been appointed to lead the NSAC and a number of support staff have been appointed.  A number of personnel with a range of expertise have been assigned from the partner bodies to the centre, including two experienced personnel from the defence organisation, one civil and one military, who were seconded in 2019.</p><p>The national cybersecurity centre, NCSC, which is part of the Department with responsibility for the environment, climate and communications, is the primary authority responsible for cybersecurity in the State, including incident response, cyber resilience and information provision.  The NCSC maintains a significant threat intelligence capability and this is a key tool in the work of the NCSC in mitigating risks to the State and its people from cybersecurity threats.  The NCSC works closely with the Defence Forces in this regard.  While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to cybersecurity relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, the defence organisation is committed to participating in the delivery of measures to improve the cybersecurity of the State.  This is being done in line with the programme for Government commitment to implement the national cybersecurity strategy.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s current national cybersecurity strategy was published in December 2019 and follows on from the country's first strategy, which issued in 2015.  There is a particular emphasis in the strategy on improving the protection of government ICT and other critical national infrastructure; on education, research and training, and on enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international engagement.  My Department and the Defence Forces have inputted to the development of this strategy.  Department officials and the Defence Forces are also actively involved in the implementation of the new strategy which, in conjunction with the White Paper on Defence 2015, will continue to inform our engagement in this critical area.  This includes work to develop an updated and detailed risk assessment of the current vulnerability of all critical national infrastructure and services to cyberattacks and the provision of a member of the Defence Forces for secondment to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia.  In addition, my Department actively participates on the interdepartmental committee overseeing implementation of the strategy, which is chaired by the Department with responsibility for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></speech>

We have seen similar attacks in Britain on the UK National Health Service, which was a specific and targeted attack.  Organised crime is seen as on a par with terrorism by the UN office on terrorism and terrorism prevention in terms of threats.  Why then does the NCSC fall under the remit of the Department of environment, climate and communications, and not under the Departments of Justice and Equality or Defence?  The Minister has referred to security and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as having been a key tool.  It seems to be a piece of a jigsaw that is slightly misaligned with where the NCSC is sitting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-08a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100800008#F01100"><p>I can understand that concern and I have asked that question because it was when I was last in the Department of Defence that we put together the White Paper.  At that time, there was a discussion within government on national security infrastructure, how the Defence Forces interact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how we can respond to an emerging cybersecurity threat.  There is significant expertise in the Department with responsibility for the environment, climate and communications from a communications perspective, which is essentially the platform for cybersecurity attacks.  One could argue for the NCSC to come under the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Defence or the Department with responsibility for the environment, climate and communications or for central co-ordination from the Taoiseach.  The decision was made, after a lot of discussion, that the national cybersecurity centre should come under the Department with responsibility for the environment, climate and communications because we are talking about communications networks being intercepted and compromised by security threats.</p>  <p>  I understand the argument the Deputy is making but there is significant expertise in that Department.  Most important, the message is that the NCSC is about pulling together all of the expertise from different Departments, including the Defence Forces as well as the Department of Defence, to make sure we have a central office that is using all of the expertise available to make sure we are protecting the interests of the State from cybersecurity attacks, which are a significant threat internationally.  Ireland rates well internationally and we are learning from others.  There is a European centre of excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which we are interacting with to make sure we are fully up to speed with the kind of response that is needed.</p></speech>

It includes State assets as well.  I recognise, however, that he referenced the continual learning because that is critical when it comes to issues such as this.</p><p>Ireland has a high level of foreign direct investment.  We have multinational corporations here that are household names.  The investment they have made here is colossal.</p> <p>However, in terms of State protection that can be offered to them, it seems like very little to none.  Foreign direct investment alone, as one entity, needs assurance that at the very least, our national electricity grid is protected from a cyberattack.  Is this an assurance the Minister can reasonably give and reasonably stand over?  Foreign direct investors also assume that our national technical means are of a standard that is fit for purpose in the current environment in 2020 and that we properly monitor our cyberdomain and our digital space.  Is that a reassurance the Minister can give to them and stand over?</p></speech>

I do not believe there is a country in the world, even the superpowers of the world, that can give an absolute 100% guarantee against the threat of cybersecurity challenges.  There is not.  We have seen such attacks on the United States of America and in China.  Even the countries that spend hundreds of billions on this issue are not absolutist in the guarantees they can give.  Having said that, the Deputy has asked if we can assume a reasonable level of assurance and I think we can.  In our cybersecurity strategy, we recognise that Ireland has a significant international presence in this area.  A lot of data are managed and held in Ireland in very large data centres.  Many communications and IT companies are based in Ireland managing sensitive and confidential data from all over the world.  We have focused on this area in a way that prioritises it significantly.  We can give a reasonable level of reassurance on the policy response in that regard.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate that recruitment during a pandemic is not straightforward.  The Minister has heard me say previously in this House and at committees that the role of the Reserve Defence Force, and prior to that the Forsa Cosanta &Aacute;it&uacute;il, FCA, has never been given due recognition.  In the area I come from I am very conscious of the good work done by the FCA and the Reserve Defence Force in ensuring an outlet for young people, and particularly young vulnerable people who may have got into wrong company and associated with undesirable groups in the past.  The FCA did exceptional work in ensuring a good outlet for many young people.  Subsequently, those young people were able to go on to have distinguished careers in the Permanent Defence Force.</p></reply>

The Government recognises the important role that the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, plays in contributing to Ireland's defence capability. The White Paper on Defence sets out a blueprint for the development of the RDF and that its primary role is to support the Permanent Defence Force in crisis situations.</p>  <p>  The Army Reserve, AR, and Naval Service Reserve, NSR, has a combined establishment of 4,069 personnel, which is 3,869 for the Army Reserve and 200 for the Naval Service Reserve.  A key ongoing challenge for the AR and NSR is to recruit and retain personnel and I am aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment.  We are trying to address this.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that recruitment is ongoing and a recruitment campaign for the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve was opened in March of this year.  Assessments are continuing at formation level and, while there are no specific dates yet, it is anticipated that another recruitment campaign will be opened in autumn 2020 with two further recruitment campaigns in spring and autumn 2021.</p>  <p>  I understand that 2018 and 2019 saw inductions totalling 142 and 144, respectively, into the RDF, however, the ability to conduct RDF inductions this year has been impacted by the Covid-19 public health pandemic.  Nevertheless, 63 additional new members have been inducted thus far this year, with 57 inducted into the Army Reserve and six inducted into the Naval Service Reserve.</p>  <p>  Supports being provided to maximise recruitment to the Reserve include the use of social media and outreach activities by RDF members.  The Permanent Defence Force exit interviews now also contain information on applying for membership of the RDF.  The Government remains committed to increasing the strength of the AR and NSR and to further developing the Reserve.</p></speech>

It is essential that the recruitment numbers are more substantial than the number of retirements.  I understand there has been a substantial number of retirements in recent years.  Naturally, this will occur again.</p>  <p>  I advocated at previous committees that a more aggressive recruitment campaign is needed and perhaps a focus on second-level schools, colleges of further education and third level colleges.</p>  <p>  I believe that currently there is no engagement between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve due to the pandemic.  It is important that a plan be put in place for a return to training, with all the necessary safety guidelines.  The Permanent Defence Force needs to have that engagement with the Reserve members, and members need to be involved in training.  If there is no ongoing training activity, skills will be lost and it will be very difficult to replace such skills.  I seek assurance from the Minister that a level of training within the necessary safety guidelines can be put back in place.  I know some young people who are training as members of the Permanent Defence Force and there should be some engagement and some level of training for the Reserve members also.</p></speech>

This even impacts on my ability to visit barracks at the moment, for example, and in the numbers of serving personnel I can meet at any one time.  We all have to try to lead by example in responding to the pandemic in a responsible way.  This has impacted on some of the issues the Deputy has referred to.</p>  <p>  We have a single Defence Forces concept committed to in the White Paper, which means that Reserve personnel should be training in a way that is complementary to the Permanent Defence Force, to ensure complete interoperability between the two so one supports the other.  In the coming months I will be asking the upcoming commission to look at the role of the Reserve, how we can enhance that and how we can make it a more exciting option and choice for people who may want to join.  I am certainly open to looking at specialties that can help to fill gaps and support in a complementary way to the Permanent Defence Force, and to allowing Reserve personnel to potentially work overseas also.  This would significantly add to the attractiveness of joining the Reserve.</p></speech>

Often the Reserve is not given the attention it needs.</p>  <p>  I fully agree and fully understand that we must be guided by the health and safety guidelines.  That is absolutely essential.  If we do not have some level of training, however, there will be a big wastage of skills.  It would be very difficult to replace those skills and that knowledge in the future.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, given the medical opinions, we will all be living in a Covid-19 environment for some time.  We must develop new ways of training and doing business.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter attention.  If engagement is not resumed for the Reserve Defence Force its value and the recognition it needs in society will be lost also.  It is extremely important, within the safety and health guidelines, that training activity is resumed if at all possible.</p></speech>

They are not there just to say they are a member of the Reserve.  They join up because they want to be part of the action and to make a contribution through training and putting that training to use.  This is why we have a Reserve.  As of the end of August, the effective strength of the Army Reserve was 1,501 in personnel and that of the Naval Service Reserve was 123.</p> <p>We are significantly below where we would like to be in terms of the establishment numbers.  <br/><br/>What is required is a really proactive recruitment campaign that is public, targets the right people and offers, through a communications campaign, options that will interest and excite people and encourage them to join up.  We are going to focus on both elements.</p></speech>

Personnel in the Naval Service are paid basic pay, military service allowance and, where appropriate, technical pay at the same rates as their colleagues in the Army and Air Corps.  Enlisted personnel of the Naval Service also receive naval pay.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that a small number of personnel have left the Naval Service in recent times to pursue a career in the Army.  This can be for a variety of reasons, including career progression or personal circumstances.  The range of duties undertaken differs across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Where there is commonality, such as base security duties, the same duty rates are paid.  However, members of the Naval Service undertake seagoing duty which differs from duties undertaken by other members of the Defence Forces.  When on their two-year seagoing rotation, members of the Naval Service can be away from home on a regular basis.  For this reason and because of the nature of the duty, seagoing service can prove unattractive.  Jobs in the private sector and elsewhere which do not require such absences at sea have proved attractive for members of the Naval Service, both new entrants and more experienced personnel.</p>  <p>  Naval Service personnel undertaking seagoing duties are paid a patrol duty allowance for each patrol day that they undertake.  This is in addition to their basic pay, military service allowance, naval pay and technical pay, where applicable.  An increase of 2% on annualised salaries is being implemented from 1 October 2020 under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The 5% cut in allowances imposed under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, legislation is also being reversed from 1 October this year.  This will benefit Naval Service personnel with an increase in the daily patrol duty allowance to &euro;56.14 per day for personnel enlisted prior to January 2013, &euro;59.09 per day for personnel enlisted after January 2013 and &euro;58.86 per day for officers.  Each ship has a target of 165 patrol days each year.  A special tax credit was introduced on a one-off exceptional basis in the Finance Act 2019 to incentivise seagoing duties.  A seagoing naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270 applies for the 2020 tax year and is based on the number of days served at sea in 2019.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that we are continuing to work with the Naval Service to find ways of ensuring that we can enhance even further the attractiveness of committing to go to sea.</p></speech>

I particularly applaud the co-ordination role they have played during the pandemic.  I posed this question today because reports indicate that a recent scheduled maritime patrol did not take place because of a lack of personnel.  It is also my understanding that this was not an isolated event.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that key matters dealt with by our Naval Service, like the interception of illegal drugs, are not being compromised.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that the sums involved in the pay restoration under FEMPI are meagre and are unlikely to make much of a difference to the lives of those considering leaving the Naval Service.  In recent years, there have been media reports of serving personnel in our Defence Forces having to sleep in their cars because they could not afford to travel the distances required of them.  What is the position regarding pay restoration for our Defence Forces?  What is the position with regard to improvements in their pay and why are they so underappreciated?  The Minister made a promise in mid-July to deal with this issue because he acknowledged that members of the Defence Forces are among the lowest paid of our public servants.  </p></speech>

We have a fleet of nine ships.  One of them is in service and two are tied up because we do not have sufficient personnel to crew them.  Let us call a spade a spade; we have a serious problem in the Naval Service.  The service is not at full strength and cannot perform the functions expected of it were it at full strength, although it is doing very well to compensate for that in terms of the work it is doing.  The service is highly efficient in the way it operates at sea and on land.</p><p>We have a White Paper and a Government commitment to support a fleet that is below strength and that has consequences in terms of fisheries patrols and many of the other really important roles that the Naval Service plays.  Despite all of that, the Naval Service has still managed to add significantly to national efforts to respond to Covid-19, including testing on the dock and so on.  This shows the flexibility and professionalism of our Defence Forces in general and the Naval Service in particular.  However, the <i>status quo</i>is not acceptable.  We need to be more impactful in a positive way in terms of retention and recruitment in the Naval Service to deal with the shortage of personnel and I am focused on trying to resolve that issue.</p></speech>

Has the Department drawn up any projections regarding the implications if this trend continues?  In particular, has it analysed the impact low personnel numbers will have on the overall size of our Defence Forces and the security implications of same?  What is needed to attract former personnel or new recruits in order to restore the strength of our Defence Forces to an adequate level?  Finally, will additional demands be placed on our Naval Service when Britain leaves the EU, particularly if new arrangements regarding EU fishing waters have to be put in place?</p></speech>

Those three areas will either all be agreed or none will be agreed, frankly.  They come as a package, in parallel.  In the absence of an agreement on fisheries, we will have a very complex problem on our hands at sea in terms of tension between fleets and we will need to manage that as best we can.  That will obviously put pressure on the Naval Service.</p>  <p>  Not for the first time, I am on record as saying that I am focused on trying to address the particular problems in the Naval Service.  We have a whole range of other issues that need to be addressed across the Defence Forces generally but the Naval Service is a particular problem right now.  This time last year, the Air Corps was a particular problem but a solution was found.  We need to get our fleet back up to a more acceptable strength and get our ships back out to sea.  To do that, we need to devise an impactful strategy to retain personnel and stop them leaving, and also to recruit former members of the service as well as new serving personnel.  We are focusing on that and will be launching a specific strategy to do that in the next few days or weeks.  We are also working on a support package to try to achieve our aims.  These things are not easy but they are important.  </p></speech>

The occupational pension scheme terms for post-1 January 2013 new entrants to the public service, including the permanent Defence Force, PDF, are governed by the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012.  All first-time new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after that date are members of the single scheme.</p>  <p>  The single scheme is a key structural fiscal reform introduced to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the long term, while at the same time continuing to provide valuable pension benefits for employees.  In the general context of that policy objective, the terms and rules of the single scheme, which are fundamentally different to previous superannuation public service arrangements, make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group from 1 January 2013 onwards.  Notwithstanding the distinguishing features of the single scheme, members of the PDF in that scheme retain the minimum pension age of 50 to reflect operational needs, as already applies to new entrant military personnel recruited since April 2004.  Importantly, the single scheme also retains "fast accrual" pension terms for groups such as the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the single scheme pension terms and rules rests with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard, the absence from the single scheme of provision for the concept of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group, including the PDF, on or after 1 January 2013, has previously been confirmed by the official side to the Defence Forces representative associations, and the position in that regard has been restated to RACO by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at a recent meeting with that association.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that the Public Service Pay Commission considered certain aspects of military superannuation provisions, which were submitted as an influencing factor on military recruitment and-or retention outcomes.  The commission&rsquo;s report on recruitment and retention in the PDF, which was accepted in full by Government in July 2019, considered the concerns expressed by the military representative associations in relation to various aspects of pension scheme provisions for the Defence Forces.  The commission made no recommendations advocating any improvements to the pension scheme terms of the PDF.  However, the Public Service Pay Commission report recommended a range of measures relating to pay and non-pay aspects that would result in immediate and future benefits for members of the PDF.  These projects are currently under way or completed.  These include a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF and, in particular, the possibility of extending or increasing retirement ages for members of the PDF.  Phase 1 of this project, the review of mandatory retirement ages for commissioned officers, is nearing completion, while phase 2, the review of contracts of service for enlisted personnel, is commencing.  However, while those deliberations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.  This is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I need to be careful what I say in this regard. </p></speech>

He said he assumed I was referring exclusively to the supplementary pension provision but it is not just that.  Obviously, as he said, the age of retirement reflects the duties involved and he also referred to the fast accrual system of pension for military personnel.</p>  <p>  The final part of the reply refers to ongoing work on barriers and measures being considered to benefit members of the PDF.  Does that include continued employment?  The Minister talked about extending the contract but does this include assisting Defence Forces members to seek non-active positions within either the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces?  Given the unique nature of Defence Forces personnel, to which he referred in earlier replies, and the fact they are treated differently in other ways, for example, with regard to union recognition, what creative measures are being considered?  There is a long period remaining after a person ceases work at 50 and while some have particular skills they can take into other professions, and do, this is not always the case.  Will the Minister respond regarding any creative solutions he is considering?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, there is a reason many in the Defence Forces are required to retire at a certain age.  It is a challenging career, so there are age constraints in regard to some of the work that is done.  That said, we are discussing and reviewing this at the moment.  Many people in their 50s and 60s have pursued successful careers in the private sector and, indeed, the public sector after leaving the Defence Forces.  That is with good reason because they are highly sought after, by and large.  It is a problem for us at the moment because they are so sought after by the private sector that we are struggling to hold on to some of them, whether in the Naval Service or the Air Corps, where our pilots were essentially being headhunted by private airlines.  Because we train the Defence Forces very well, there are career options after people leave, particularly for officers but also for others, in particular as that skillset and discipline towards work are highly sought after.  That is a kind of double-edged sword from our perspective.  If the Deputy has any ideas or proposals in that regard, I will try to take them on board.</p></speech>

I am aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the overall current strength figures and those of the establishment and I am committed to restoring the strength of the Defence Forces to 9,500, which is the figure in the White Paper.  The Public Service Pay Commission report and implementation of the high level plan, Strengthening Our Defence Forces - Phase 1, is a key part of the response to address recruitment and retention challenges and my responses to other questions today detail this.</p>  <p>  I accept there are ongoing difficulties in the Defence Forces, and these have been well-documented.  The reduction in the number of operational ships due to personnel shortages is a case in point and is one area where I believe further measures are required.  The inability to induct recruits at previous levels as a result of Covid is also an aggravating factor.  However, there are also positive developments which are restoring capacity in areas which were significantly depleted.  By way of example, overall officer numbers are just 13 off the full establishment figure as at 31 August 2020.  While I appreciate that experience levels have declined at some ranks and that gaps remain gaps in certain areas, the continued attraction of officer cadets in what was a competitive jobs market is indicative of the continued attractiveness of such a career.</p> <p>Further initiatives such as the recommissioning of former Air Corps pilots have also assisted in boosting the number of much -needed specialists.  I understand that further specialist officers will be recommissioned.  The re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel is another initiative that is to be welcomed.  While the numbers being inducted are lower than initially anticipated, all will play an important role in restoring capacity.    </p> <p> The fact is that the restoration of capacity in the Defence Forces will take time.  The programme for Government provides that a commission on the Defence Forces will be tasked with examining a range of issues.  This will provide an opportunity to chart the future direction of the Defence Forces.  There is also a commitment to establish a pay review body specifically for the Defence Forces when the commission has completed its work.   </p> <p> Working closely with the Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and a range of other key stakeholders including the representative bodies, I am confident that the current challenges facing the Defence Forces can be overcome, although it will take some time.  I appreciate colleagues' comments on all of these issues.</p></reply>

It was, and still is, an extremely worrying situation.  Since the weekend, there have been a number of large clusters in nursing homes, including one in Convoy in my own constituency.  The rate of admissions to hospital has been on the rise and the number of Covid-19 cases in ICU has risen, as has the number of patients on ventilators.  This is all reflected in the comments of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, yesterday who said that his level of concern on Sunday was lower than his current level of concern.</p>  <p>  Since then, instead of setting out a plan to deal with the situation in our hospitals, the Government has allowed a narrative to prevail that this it is everybody's fault bar their own.  The T&aacute;naiste said on RT&Eacute; television that NPHET's advice was landed upon him as a surprise.  We now know that is not the case.  The CMO organised an extraordinary meeting of NPHET on Sunday and informed the Minister for Health of this on Saturday.  He spoke to the Minister before and after the NPHET meeting.  He did everything he could have to keep the Government in the loop.  It was only when NPHET's recommendations made their way to Government that they were leaked.  For 24 hours afterwards, the Government said nothing.  When the T&aacute;naiste did say something on national television, it was to engage in distraction and a sideshow.  He played the man instead of the ball.  </p>  <p>  In all of this time the Minister for Health stayed schtum.  He said nothing and allowed the perception to prevail that this had all come out of the blue.  Most significantly, since then he has said nothing about increasing capacity in our hospitals.  That is the real issue here.  </p>  <p>  We are unprepared for a surge in our hospitals due to the lack of capacity.  The winter plan the Government published is insufficient, as everybody knows.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has said that the winter plan will not be enough.  Its president, Dr. Padraig McGarry, said that shutting down elective care to deal with any winter surge is not an option given the impact of delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment and ever-increasing waiting lists for outpatient appointments, inpatient day cases and investigative procedures.  This lack of capacity and lack of beds is the crux of the problem.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste might talk about surge capacity and so on in his reply but we know that the knock-on effects of this approach will be absolutely catastrophic for the health service. He knows that and so do I.  We need to tackle this issue head-on and to tackle it now.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that ICU capacity is a major issue?  Does he also accept that the current plan is completely insufficient to deal with a second surge without having a massive impact on non-Covid care?  Crucially, what is he going to do about it?</p></speech>

Nobody in the Government is engaging in any sort of blame game.  That is the game of others.  This is a virus.  Nobody is to blame for it whether here or north of the Border.  I will not speak for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly; I understand he is to issue a statement later in the day.  I can, however, speak for the Government and for myself.  I can give the facts.  Nobody in Government had any indication that consideration was being given to recommending a move to level 5 until Sunday.  This was confirmed by the CMO at last night's press conference.  It was a shock; it did come out of the blue.  We were not prepared for it nor was the country.</p>  <p>  What do I mean by "out of the blue"?  The recommendation came on Sunday, only three days after NPHET had said in writing that it did not strongly support a move to level 3 nationally at that time.  It was also not in line with the parameters set out in the Government's framework - a leaflet explaining it has gone through every door in the country.  Under this framework, restrictions are to be escalated in steps.  The criteria for reaching level 5 had not been met.  A decision of such gravity needs to be talked through and thought through.  I refer not only to the reasons for such a decision, but its implications for people, the exit strategy and co-ordination with Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  To clarify and to be very clear, the Taoiseach, the leader of the Green Party and I were informed on Saturday that a meeting of NPHET had been called for Sunday.  There was no suggestion, not even an inkling, that level 5 was being contemplated.  Had we known that, we would have sought an urgent briefing that night.  That is what could, and should, have happened.  The first indication I had that level 5 was being considered came on Sunday evening, after the NPHET meeting had taken place.  I received confirmation in writing at 8.30 p.m., setting out the recommendations and the reasons for them.  For some Minister, the first they heard of this on the news.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Deputy may want to make a big deal about which Minister knew what and at what time on Sunday but that is not the point.  The point is that we had no indication that this was even being considered until Sunday.  We need to move on from this.  This should not be NPHET versus the Government or the Government versus the Opposition; this has to be Ireland versus the coronavirus.  </p>  <p>  The Government is acting in response to the escalating situation.  We took the decision to move the entire country to level 3 only the other day and I believe the Deputy's party supports that decision and the decision not to go to level 5.  If that is not the case, the Deputy may wish to say so.  That decision is being implemented.  We know that level 3 was successful in counties Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  We can also see that it might be working in Dublin but it is too early to know for sure.  The R-nought number, however, seems to be down to approximately 1.  It will be the best part of ten days before we know whether it is working in the rest of the country but it is something on which we are acting.</p>  <p>  Capacity is an issue in our health service.  It is very often an issue.  Going into this crisis, we had well above the European average number of nurses and about the average number of doctors at 3.3 per 100,000.  We were a bit below average as regards hospital beds when compared with other countries but had more than countries such as Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand.  I could go on.  Since then we have added 800 acute and subacute beds to the system, approximately 150 of which are currently being used by patients who have Covid.  We have also increased the number of ICU beds, which was 225, by approximately 60.  Approximately 25 or 26 are being used today.  We have increased capacity and will increase it further.</p></speech>

Everybody needs to get on the same page.  It was not me, however, who went on the national broadcaster to take the legs from under our Chief Medical Officer.  It was not me who engaged in that type of dangerous behaviour.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that, if it had been me, he would be the first to stand up and say that it was reckless, that it undermined public confidence and so on.  The question is one of capacity.  The real reason the T&aacute;naiste made his statement is because NPHET called that out.  The reason we are even contemplating these stringent restrictions is the lack of capacity in our health system.  The T&aacute;naiste has been Minister for Health and Taoiseach and he has been in government for the past nine years.  He has left the State extremely vulnerable with regard to our number of ICU beds.  That is the question I have asked, not who knew what, when and where.  It is a question of what the Government is going to do as regards ICU beds because its winter plan will fail.  It is not enough.  The Government is depending on surge capacity and this means closing down other elective care, which means delays in diagnosis and a lack of other crucial treatments.  Where is the Government's plan?  What is it going to do to address this real issue of capacity, which has not only been raised by those of us in Sinn F&eacute;in?</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste should talk to people on the front line, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the managers in our hospitals.  They are all singing the same tune.  We are seriously stressed in terms of capacity in this State and the winter is going to be very difficult as a result.</p></speech>

The number of patients in ICU with Covid-19 is around 25.  We have the ability to go to 360 beds with surge capacity, and there is also the option of using the private hospitals.  That option was available to us in the spring and it can be available again.  Those are the facts of the situation.</p>  <p>  I know what Deputy Doherty is trying to do, namely, play the blame game.  He is trying to set it up so that if the country has to go back into severe lockdown, he can blame the Government and say it is all down to hospital capacity.</p></speech>

The view I formed, and I think many people formed the same view, was that the T&aacute;naiste got his information from a media leak.  We know that was not the case, that there was an unscheduled meeting of NPHET on Sunday, and that the Minister for Health also had telephone calls before and after that meeting.  Telephone conversations are two way.  We would expect the Minister for Health to have asked questions to see what exactly that meeting was about and what measures NPHET was considering.  Was the T&aacute;naiste fully aware of that conversation and will he outline that for us?</p>  <p>  In hindsight, given the escalating numbers, does the T&aacute;naiste regret the interview with Claire Byrne?  Does he accept that it has been a distraction in the fight against the virus?  Does he accept that the primary focus this week has been about mending fences?  Indeed, the T&aacute;naiste has just said that he had a telephone conversation to clear the air.  We really should be focusing on putting our collective efforts into fighting this virus.  A collective approach is needed from the Government, NPHET, the political system and from the public.  The public can only do so much, however.  The State must also play its part and play it comprehensively.  We must reduce the incidence of the virus and take the pressure off the hospitals, and those matters are already being talked about.</p>  <p>  In March, the T&aacute;naiste told us that there was a comprehensive strategy involving restrictions, social distancing, testing, contact tracing and isolation where there was a positive test result.  That was followed in May when he announced the HSE's strategy on testing and contact tracing.  There were going to be key performance indicators for testing and contact tracing.  In recent days, a leading health specialist has warned that regional departments in the public health system can no longer cope and that Covid-19 outbreaks are going to be missed.  Dr. Anne Dee, a consultant in public health medicine, is reported as saying that eight regional departments are now "throwing in the towel" and giving up on "proper" contact tracing.  She spoke about the urgency of getting staff and was fearful that it will be the new year before those staff are in place.  She added that "The regional health system is as close to collapse as it has been at any time before."</p>  <p>  We trusted the Government to ensure that these systems were put in place and that they were resourced and functioning.  The idea that contact tracing is nearing collapse should be a major source of concern.  We cannot contain the virus if we do not know where it is and we do not ensure that people are properly traced.  We need a frank discussion on the shortcomings and how they are going to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that, to clear the air, the Minister for Health should make a full statement in the D&aacute;il so that people can ask questions?  I ask because we must get rid of this distraction.  Were those with responsibility for regional public health systems contacted and asked what is required?  What systems are being put in place to ensure the contact tracing system works?</p></speech>

I cannot answer the Deputy's second question regarding whether public health departments have been contacted, but I am sure they have been.  We all appreciate the amazing work the public health departments are doing in contact tracing.  They have had the assistance of people who would never have known what contact tracing was until recent months but who were trained to do exactly that, including members of the Defence Forces.  It is important that they are properly resourced.</p>  <p>  As the number of cases increases and the number of contacts people have also increases, contact tracing becomes all the more difficult.  That is why we are asking people to minimise the number of social contacts they have, because that will make the job easier for contact tracers.  If most of us have two, three or four social contacts, that makes the job of a contact tracer much easier than if we have 20, 30 or 40 social contacts.  That is part of the rationale behind encouraging people to avoid gatherings and limiting the size of gatherings that people can have.</p>  <p>  In relation to Monday night, I did not say I heard it from a media leak.  I never said that.  If that is the impression the Deputy got, that is the impression she got, but it is not something that I have ever claimed.  I set out the timeline earlier in response to Deputy Doherty.  It is how many of the public heard, though, and that caused fear, anxiety and panic for hundreds of thousands of people who thought they might be out of work the next day and for tens of thousands of businesses that thought they might have to close for the last time.  It should not have happened in that way and that is not the way things were handled in the past.  I totally agree with the Deputy, however, that the events of Sunday and Monday, all of them, are a distraction from what we now need to do, which is to fight the coronavirus together.  The Government, the Opposition, the HSE, NPHET, the Department of Health and everybody must work together against this common enemy.  That is what I want to do.</p></speech>

Let us put this issue to bed.  I presume the Minister for Health will be coming into the D&aacute;il to make that statement.</p>  <p>  The public can only do so much.  We hear senior people in the public health system saying that a system that is vital to dealing with this virus is close to collapse.  What is being done about that?  Can the T&aacute;naiste give an assurance that the resources required will be put in place?  If we do not shut down this virus, we will shut down the economy.  The virus and the economy cannot coexist.  That seems to be self-evident.  The T&aacute;naiste himself made great play of this in March, and rightly so, when he said tracing was to be a central part of the strategy.  It must be meaningful, however.  It is not just down to the public.  I encourage people to reduce the number of their social contacts, but the State has a responsibility in this area as well.</p></speech>

We all appreciate that individual actions are required, with all of us following those public health guidelines, and Government action to ensure we put the infrastructure in place.  Part of that infrastructure involves testing, and we are now testing 100,000 people per week.  There are 12,000, 13,000 or 14,000 tests every day.  This is polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing which is the gold standard in testing.  Many other countries are not using PCR and are using less specific and less sensitive types of testing, such as antigen testing.  There is a role for that type of testing, but we are using PCR testing at the moment.  We are testing more people per head than many other countries that are often cited as models for dealing with the coronavirus, such as New Zealand and Germany.  We are well up there in terms of testing.</p> <p> On tracing, I did see that report, although I do not know exactly where it came from.  I think it was anonymous but I may be wrong.  I cannot speak for the HSE on the details of what resources are being provided for tracing but I totally agree with the Deputy that tracing is a crucial part of our response to the coronavirus.  Those departments need to be resourced and they have been in the past few months.  People from the Defence Forces, teachers and civil servants were trained up.  Huge numbers of people were brought in to supplement the standing public health teams and that needs to be scaled up again, if it has not been done already. </p></speech>

Over 1,000 school secretaries are not being treated equally in their pay and conditions of employment.  Will the Government enter into meaningful discussions in the Labour Court, as agreed by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, in the House last October?  That was 12 months ago.  Over 1,000 school secretaries are being treated unequally as they are not getting paid other than through an annualised grant.  They are working side by side with secretaries in other schools in their towns and villages who are getting their full pay and being treated as public servants with holiday pay and entitlements.  We have relied on school secretaries to make sure that schools and their management have some resources in place.  Many of these school secretaries worked over the summer months without pay to make sure the schools reopened.  I understand that discussions have taken place but they have not been meaningful.  Will the Government ensure fair treatment and parity of esteem for those school secretaries?  They are not very happy that their issue has been kicked down the road and are contemplating industrial action.  It would be an indictment of all of us if school secretaries had to go out on strike after all they have done.  We have talked about front-line workers' bravery.  I believe school secretaries are front-line workers as well.</p></speech>

I know it is close to his heart and I remember us speaking about it months ago when we were in government together.  The Government really values the essential work done by school secretaries and caretakers.  Often, the school secretary is the first person one meets on the way into a school and the caretaker is the last person to leave in the evening.  Schools would not operate without them and the role they play in our education system is as important as that of schoolteachers, SNAs and school principals.  For that reason, it is the Government's objective to regularise their employment, terms and conditions, and pension rights.  That can only be done going forward.  It cannot be done retrospectively, for reasons that I will explain.  Of course, it has to be done by agreement and engagement and I sincerely hope that engagement will take place.</p>  <p>  I am advised that officials from the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform and school management bodies met with the trade union F&oacute;rsa on 1 October in the Workplace Relations Commission.  An offer of a modest multiannual pay increase was made to F&oacute;rsa at that meeting but it was not acceptable to the union.  The Department of Education and Skills, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is considering the union's request to refer the matter to the Labour Court for determination.  A number of technical issues exist as neither the Departments nor the management bodies are the employers of the staff in question.  In these circumstances, F&oacute;rsa's statement that it is considering strike action is regrettable, and as we know, any such action would have a day-to-day impact on the operation of schools at this critical time and would disrupt tuition for students who have only recently returned to school after a six-month gap.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the role played by these vital staff and significant improvements to the pay of secretaries and caretakers have been made since 2015, under a pay arbitration scheme.  This provided for a pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff, with a minimum rate of &euro;13 per hour phased in over that period.  The average hourly rate for a school secretary is now &euro;15.49, which is in line with the hourly rate for a grade 3 clerical officer, taking into account that a clerical officer works through the summer. </p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste talked about engagement and it is important that engagement takes place.  It has been a year since the then Minister for Education and Skills agreed to enter into engagement with school secretaries.  The offer made by the Department was for a pay rise, but what the school secretaries want is equality in their pay, terms and conditions.  This issue has not been addressed by officials from either the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the discussions.  If we are going to bring into force what we say about holding school secretaries in high esteem, we need to engage in the mechanisms that are in place.  I again urge that this issue be taken up as a matter of urgency.  School secretaries are not people who want to go on strike.  They are not threatening it if they do not get somewhere but there is a short window of opportunity for the Departments to engage meaningfully to find a resolution to this matter once and for all.</p></speech>

It is about other issues as well and school secretaries and caretakers understandably want their employment terms and conditions to be regularised.  They want to be public sector employees, like teachers and other secretaries in the public service, working in local authorities or Civil Service departments.  However, we need to work out what equality means.  Secretaries and clerical officers working in Departments and local authorities work year-round and only have a few weeks of annual leave.  Many of those issues have to be worked out because equality must be defined in that context.  As is always the case with industrial relations matters such as this one, anything we do would have to be prospective and not retrospective.  If changes were retrospective, they would kick off claims from up to 100,000 other people who are not directly employed by the State but by bodies that are grant-aided by the State.  The Deputy will be familiar with a similar issue that arises with supervisors on community employment schemes.  The resolution can only be a prospective one but we do want to resolve this.</p></speech>

One of the items on the agenda was the deficit in local authority funding.  I am fearful that there will be cuts in basic day-to-day services, such as taking care of housing stock, work on essential issues like roads and keeping services like libraries and public toilets open.  Our county will not be able to progress with new projects and initiatives.  Rather, it will struggle to provide essential services like those I have outlined already.  All our local authority has got so far is six months of a subvention on rates but it will now have to go after businesses looking for the other six months' worth of rates.  How in heaven's name can we go after cinemas, for example, which barely opened to very small numbers, and ask them to pay rates?  Our excellent county councillors on our local authority had to vote blindly on a property tax last week, not knowing what money they will be getting from central government.</p>  <p>  Now we are faced with a new issue, namely, the climate Bill.  New responsibility will be put on local authorities, which will be required to produce annual climate action plans, dealing with both the mitigation and adaptation sides of climate issues.  Frans Timmermans, the European Commissioner and Vice-President in charge of overseeing the European green deal, says we must plough ahead with this agenda at all costs.  What about the implications of imposing billions of euro of extra taxes on a public that is in dire straits and hurting already?</p>  <p>I will get a bit personal about this, not because she is my daughter as there are many other people's daughters.  Rosie Healy-Rae and Miche&aacute;l O'Shea, a very nice, young, respectable local man were getting married this Saturday.  It has been cancelled.  The implications and the economic bang of that for the hotel, the hairdressers, the car hire company and the people who provide the flowers is enormous.  That is only an example; there are other people.  10-10-20 was going to be their special day, like a bag of fertiliser.</p> <p> While all this is going on, the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet are signing up to &euro;9.5 billion of additional carbon taxes on a public who, like I say, are really hurting.  It will be &euro;1 billion a year of additional taxes.  I am not a climate change denier.  I want to protect all species on this planet, including the human species.  It is suggested that households may have to pay excise duty on their electricity to compensate for the drop in revenue to the State from the people switching from petrol and diesel to electric vehicles.  This is according to a report from the Department of Finance's tax strategy group.  People will be penalised for going green.</p></speech>

I understand from Deputy Griffin that the financial gap for Kerry County Council is estimated at about &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million for 2020, potentially rising to &euro;13 million for 2021.  That would be a grave situation indeed.  The Government understands that local authority income is down for many different reasons, ranging from parking charges not coming in to other charges and income streams being depleted.  It is a matter that is being worked on by my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  As the Deputy knows, we waived commercial rates for quarters two and three for most businesses.  There was a commercial rates holiday for most businesses for six months.  Usually, even in a good year, a local authority might only collect 87% or 88% of that money.  We gave them the full 100% anyway, so they got more than they would have from commercial rates in a normal year.  We are examining what we are going to do about quarter four rates.  An announcement about that will be made in the budget next week.  We are aware that additional funding will be required for local authorities to plug deficits that are arising.  It is very much in the mix for the budget.</p></speech>

Ministers are being told that they will be audited with regard to carbon emission-reducing measures.  What will that mean for our farming community and fishermen who are already in dire straits?  I have discussed this with Irish Farmers' Association leadership over the last 24 hours and I am again coming back to the fact that the Cabinet is saying that our State will have to come up with &euro;1 billion of additional taxes every year for the next ten years.  What are the implications for our tourism industry, including, for example, our airline industry?  This is outside of Covid.  Will we have to reduce the number of people allowed to come into the country?  We are continuously trying to attract people here.  Will we say that planes will not be able to fly?  Will we have to say to people that they will not be able to burn turf or timber in their fires?  We always said the one thing that people had to do was to keep the home fires burning.  Are the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet, and present and future Governments, tying people's hands behind their backs and saying that they cannot do that?  I am not denying that we have issues to deal with with regard to our climate but we have to protect the present and future public from being overburdened with tax.  I appreciate the sincerity of people like Deputy Eamon Ryan but we cannot go blindly into this, signing a blank cheque and putting future generations of people at enormous expense for something that we cannot even discuss.</p></speech>

That will not happen.  That would be totally disproportionate and unnecessary, given the fact that air quality is very high in rural Ireland.  It is a different issue in towns and cities where we have a problem with air quality and that is impacting on people's health, especially those who have chronic conditions such as asthma and COPD, and therefore action needs to be taken.</p>  <p>  Taking climate action is one of the reasons why this Government was formed.  It is why Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party came together, to accelerate Ireland's response to climate change and to up our game when it comes to climate action, to honour the commitment to go from being a laggard to a leader as soon as we can.  The Government has made good progress in that regard.  The July stimulus included a package of investment in everything from bog rewetting and bog restoration to cycling and pedestrian facilities, which will have an impact on the climate in a positive way.  Just yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, published landmark legislation, a climate action Bill, and I congratulate him on that.  It builds on the good work of Deputy Alan Kelly in the Fine Gael-Labour Government with the first climate law.  Now there is a much stronger climate law brought in by Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p>  <p>  The carbon tax will go up in the budget.  That is programmed into it.  Bear in mind that most of the cost of the carbon tax will fall on business and the rest on households.  It will all be ring-fenced for things like dealing with fuel poverty and investment, mainly in rural Ireland, in things such as retrofitting.  It will be a ring-fenced increase with the money being ploughed into poverty reduction and climate action measures.</p></speech>

In response, the Taoiseach said that the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, and wider Government, would continue to examine the situation.  I understand that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has since written to ICTU, declining an invitation to intervene in the dispute.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that these are the very same workers who made sure that essential services were maintained throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  I know that a number of unions involved now plan to ballot their members for industrial action.  F&oacute;rsa's Catherine Keogh said yesterday that union members feel that the Department of Health, the HSE and Government have effectively turned their backs on them.  She continued "They deserve a swift and decisive response that shows their work is valued".  SIPTU is calling on the Government to back up its applause for essential front-line workers and to provide the necessary funding to make sure that all section 39 workers get the pay justice they deserve.  Will the T&aacute;naiste convert his applause into action for these workers?</p></speech>

They are not public servants and they are not Government employees but the work that they do is extraordinarily valuable.  Some are employees of companies, some are employees of NGOs and some are employees of charities.  These companies, NGOs and charities receive grant funding from the Government to fund partially or fully their operations but they are not employees of Government and they are not public servants, which is what makes this a complicated issue to deal with.  Funding for section 39 bodies has been increased and will be increased again.</p></speech>

They fear, like with many youth services around the country, for the viability of their service and the future of their funding.  In line with the call from the National Youth Council of Ireland, what commitments can the T&aacute;naiste give that there will be funding not only for 2021 but in the years ahead, so this vital service which has helped many young people through the ongoing Covid crisis knows that there is a future for the service?</p></speech>

There are families with children in school but the parents have a severe underlying health condition.  They feel they are being failed as there is no remote learning option for students in such cases.  For example, in the case of a family I am dealing with, the mother, who has a severe form of blood cancer, has two teenage children of schoolgoing age who cannot access remote learning options.  How can the State step in to support these people and provide remote learning options and genuine help?  There is a failing in this regard and it is leading to a financial burden and increasing anxiety in an enormously difficult time.</p></speech>

The solution is probably some form of blended learning.  If pupils cannot be in the classroom because they are sick, are isolating or restricting movements or they live in a household with a vulnerable person, the ideal scenario would be some sort of mechanism by which they could use Zoom to participate in the class and at least get some education.  It is a good suggestion and I will certainly discuss it with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, to see if we can make some progress.</p></speech>

I refer to the 22,000 taxi drivers and their families for whom, despite promises from numerous Ministers, the Taoiseach and so on that they would meet taxi drivers again and listen to their requests for assistance, nothing has been forthcoming.  Their PUP is being cut, although there is no work out there for them and the grants they need to cover costs and sustain themselves have not been provided.  Will the T&aacute;naiste listen to and act on the requests of the taxi drivers, who are currently in a dire state?</p></speech>

They are essential people and we want them to be there when we get through this pandemic.  We want the industry and the individuals working in it to survive.  I am not aware of the particular details as to what engagement has taken place between the Government and the group but if I can be of any assistance in meeting them, I am happy to do that and hear out their suggestions.  I cannot promise to deliver all of them but I would be happy to receive a delegation from taxi drivers and to see what are their suggestions.  If we can do something within all the usual reasonable parameters, we will do that.</p></speech>

Many people remember where they were on that day and when they heard that heartbreaking news.  On the second anniversary of her death, newspapers reported that another woman was dragged through the legal system before her case was settled in the High Court.  This is despite the T&aacute;naiste stating that no other terminally ill woman would be dragged through the courts.</p>  <p>  Ms Patricia Carrick is a mother of four who is 51 years old.  She was too ill to attend court this week and I offer my sincere solidarity, praise and prayers to the Carrick family.  The timeline is important.  News of the CervicalCheck scandal had broken and Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na had passed away four months before Patricia took a smear test from which abnormalities were missed.  The fact that there still seemed to be mistakes in assessing smear tests last year is shocking.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify what is happening?</p></speech>

Nobody wants to see women or any patients having to go through the courts to receive compensation where negligence has occurred but we have a real difficulty as sometimes the facts are disputed.  Where facts are disputed, there must be some mechanism by which both sides can be heard, experts can be interviewed and a decision can be made.  At present, that happens in the courts but as the Deputy knows, work is very advanced now on an alternative process, which is to be tribunal-based.</p>  <p>  I am thankful that the vast majority of cases are settled by mediation or negotiation and do not require a full court hearing.  Some cases nonetheless require such hearings.  It is sad that with any test, whether it is a smear test, another lab test or a coronavirus test, there will be false negatives and false positives.  Most of these are not a result of negligence but some are.  It is a difficult truth.</p></speech>

One would think this was a way of promoting the flu vaccine but over the past week, my office has been inundated with questions about the flu vaccine and specifically quotas for doctors.</p>  <p>  Doctors are now only receiving their first quota of vaccine but they are inundated with requests from people who are very nervous about not getting the flu vaccine.  I know there is a flu epidemic on top of a pandemic.  For example, a practice nurse has said she went live with a children's clinic on Monday evening and the vaccines sold out within a couple of hours.  There have been several queries about how the portal is not open for the ordering of extra vaccine.  Could this be addressed as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, either for the first time or the first time in a very long time, children between ages two and 12 will get a vaccination against the flu and there will be a really good uptake this year.  I found it quite alarming that in previous years, less than 50% of healthcare workers, for example, got vaccinated.  I am confident that the lessons from the pandemic will result in that figure going way up to 70%, 80% or 90%.</p>  <p>  I have heard there are some supply issues but I am not sure of the current state of play.  I am confident there will be enough vaccinations to ensure people can be vaccinated before flu season begins.</p></speech>

I am speaking specifically in respect of Cork Airport, with which the T&aacute;naiste is familiar.  The chief executive officer of Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, was in Leinster House yesterday and he stated that Cork has received no direct funding.  I am merely asking now if Cork Airport will be able to access regional airport operating expenditure and capital funding so as to ensure it can survive the storm.  This is so that when people start flying again, it will have a fighting chance.</p>  <p>  Cork Airport went from 2.7 million passengers in 2019 to 650,000 passengers this year.  If we are speaking about regionally balanced economic policies, we must ensure Cork has a fighting chance in order that when the airlines that have left Cork decide to come back, they will be able to do it through a sustainable operation.</p></speech>

I mean our airports, airlines and the related sectors, including aircraft maintenance and repair organisations.  Ten or 12 years ago, during the previous recession, the construction industry collapsed and this was allowed because it was, in part, blamed for the crisis.  We paid a very heavy price for that because two, three or four years later, when we needed a construction sector to build houses and infrastructure, it was not there.  I am determined that will not happen again and that sectors like hospitality and aviation should survive this pandemic.  We are going to need them when the pandemic is over, and it will end.</p>  <p>  It is a matter that the Government is considering.  EU state aid rules allow airports with fewer than 3 million passengers per year to receive state aid.  This was not done, traditionally, for Cork, as the profits from Dublin were used to cross-subsidise Cork.  No profits have been made at Dublin Airport this year, and this will change things.  That is the current Government thinking.</p></speech>

Students and hard-pressed parents have forked out thousands of euro for accommodation that will go unused for a second time this year, in all likelihood until Christmas.  In many cases no refunds are being issued.  This is a national scandal.  These parents are so upset.  They are hard-pressed in trying to pay bills, having paid for accommodation that in many cases they are not using.  Surely the T&aacute;naiste and the Government should be able to call this situation to order.  Right is right - someone who buys a loaf of bread gets a loaf of bread.  If people pay for accommodation, they use it.  If they do not use it, they should not have to pay for it.  In my common-sense view, that is fair and honest dealing.</p></speech>

I hear what he is saying.  Students should not have to pay for accommodation they cannot use, or in some cases have been told not to use.  The Deputy will realise that in some cases, such accommodation is owned by institutes of technology and universities, while in other cases it is not and there is, therefore, a different relationship between the student and the accommodation provider.  I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, about this to see if we can arrive at a solution.</p></speech>

I was a member of a drugs task force in the very early days and for several periods since then, until quite recently.  I remember the exciting days when the community felt its voice was being heard.  That has sadly been lost in the past ten years.  Can the T&aacute;naiste commit to supporting strong community representation on drug and alcohol task forces and to making statutory engagements obligatory for Departments and agencies?  More importantly, can he commit to immediately investing in a new community development initiative to support community participation?  The core issue is that we need community representatives who are supported on drug and alcohol task forces in order they can make a real commitment and bring real energy back to the task forces.</p></speech>

That factor means a task force is not composed of people coming from outside the area and applying a top-down approach.  The Deputy is spot on in that regard.  I am not across this area in detail any more but I will raise the Deputy's query with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  Anything to do with funding is a budgetary matter.</p></speech>

With the restrictions that will be in place because of the virus, there will be no card games or bingo or plays in local halls.  People's mental health and well-being will come under huge pressure.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider extending summer time this year.  This would theoretically bring the spring evenings sooner.  We would have an extra hour of light in the evenings, which I think would help people's mental well-being.  Older people would be able to stay outside in their gardens and on their lawns that bit longer.</p></speech>

I had not expected that question.  This issue is debated from time to time.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister with responsibility for time is the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee.  I will let her know the Deputy has made this suggestion.  There are arguments on both sides of this, and believe it or not there is a European directive on it.  We would have to bear in mind what would happen in Northern Ireland.  I would not like us to be in a different time zone to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  That would be odd.  If we were to do something it would be important to co-ordinate it on a North-South basis.</p></speech>

I know that those who were getting it still get it, but that was a long time ago.  It was said at the time that an alternative scheme was being devised.  The upshot of a recent court case is that we are no longer carrying out examinations for the primary medical certificate.  Will the people affected by this have to wait seven years for the issue to be addressed?  We talk about care for the disabled, but do we act accordingly?  Will provisions to rectify both of these issues be included in two items of legislation?  I refer to including the issue of primary medical certificates in the finance Bill.  Since 2013, we have been told that a replacement for the mobility scheme is being devised.  Will a transport support scheme be included in the Bill to amend the Health Act 1947?</p></speech>

Any person with mobility issues who is not on the public transport network is now effectively marooned in this country.  That particularly applies across rural Ireland.  The mobility allowance, the motorised transport grant and the primary medical certificate have now been suspended.  No financial support is available.  This needs to be dealt with in an expeditious manner and legislation must be brought forward as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I have to confess that I was not aware an issue around the primary medical certificate had arisen in the courts.  That is a matter of real concern.  I will check that out for myself and will speak to the Minister for Finance about it.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has rightly said, that mobility grant scheme has been closed to new entrants for seven or eight years, a very long time.  In the last Government, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Finian McGrath, did a huge amount of work to develop a new scheme.  However it was very difficult to come up with terms and rules on where to draw the line and who would and would not get it.  Cost was also an issue.  However, that is true of every scheme, including health and social welfare schemes.  That is something we need to sort out.  It now falls to the new Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, to take up that work and lead it forward.  I am sure she will.</p></speech>

While I fully support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and appreciate the job it must do, the way in which it was rolled out caused complete chaos throughout the State, including in my own county of Wicklow.  I have received numerous texts and phone calls from people caught in traffic jams for four hours and more.  One lady coming from Crumlin hospital with her son was caught in serious traffic on the M50 and M11 for four hours.  One front-line worker, a nurse, texted me to say that she had been stuck on the M11 for three and a half hours.  These are essential workers who have to go to work on a daily basis.  They do not have the option of working from home.  While I fully support the endeavours of the Garda, this operation has caused major problems throughout the State and compounded the difficulties experienced by many businesses.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the T&aacute;naiste is aware but there have been serious issues in Cork in respect of disabled parking.  Cork city has rolled out an initiative to pedestrianise some streets to get more people to dine outdoors, visit restaurants and utilise the city centre.  This is a very good initiative and I welcome it.  However, it has caused serious issues with disabled parking spaces.  Many have been moved.  There are 100 disabled parking spaces in Cork, some in areas that are not suitable.  People cannot access them.</p> <p>When people get out of their car, they are on a roadway or cannot get onto a footpath.

In general, the Government leaves these matters to local authorities.  It is appropriate for it to do so.  The people who know Cork best are those on Cork City Council.  The same principle applies in Dublin and other parts of the country.  In order to ensure that disabled people are not shut out of these new cities, because that would be a terrible thing, the Department of Transport could work on some form of guidelines.  I will ensure the Deputy's comments are passed on to that Department.</p></speech>

To do so would be disingenuous.  However, we are very concerned about capacity in hospitals.  I have spoken to many hospital managers in recent days.  In my region, the south east, University Hospital Waterford had one spare ICU bed yesterday.  The hospital manager told me there has been a massive increase in hospital admissions, with 176 admissions yesterday.  There was a significant increase in trauma cases and because there was no ICU capacity in hospitals in Wexford or Tipperary there was significant demand for transfers into University Hospital Waterford.  Hospital managers have told me that without additional capacity we are facing a very real problem and that what has been promised in terms of additional ICU and acute beds simply will not be enough.  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell them that if more beds than those committed to in the winter plan are needed, as I believe they are, the Government will make those resources available as soon as possible?</p></speech>

Covid pandemic or no Covid pandemic, we should increase our critical care bed capacity to in the region of 400 or 500 beds.  We should be doing that anyway.  We have made progress in recent years, but it has not been enough.  Efforts in that regard need to continue.  As the Deputy appreciates, it is not as simple as just providing a bed.  An ICU bed is quite a thing and must be very heavily staffed.  It is often the case that staff are not available.  That is not just the case in Ireland; it is a problem in many places around the world.  I was glad to hear the Deputy's initial remarks.  We will monitor what he and other Sinn F&eacute;in spokespeople have to say.  His comments were not made in the tone I have heard from some other Deputies.</p></speech>

Suicide and self-harm are also major factors, with 74% of respondents stating that they or a family member had suffered from self harm.

She told me he had regular appointments when he was under the adolescent services and that the support he got was very good, but since he turned 18 in February he has only had two appointments.  He was supposed to have an appointment on 30 September but it was cancelled at short notice.  He was promised there would be a follow-up phone call but it never came.  When the family rang the clinic they were put through to another doctor who told them they had reached the wrong person and then hung up.  He eventually got a prescription.  Can face-to-face appointments for people with mental health issues be rolled out again?  There have been three suicides in my locality in the past month.  Two 21-year-olds and a 16-year-old took their own lives.  There have also been several attempted suicides by young people.  Mental health supports are vital.</p></speech>

Years of neglect, under-investment and lack of political will have led to systemic failures in the mental health system.  Experts described the mental health services to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response as being out of date and not fit for purpose.  A mental health parity of esteem with physical health approach will provide a holistic, whole-person response to all those who are in need of care and support, with their physical and mental health needs treated equally.  The relationship between physical and mental health is such that poor mental health is linked with a higher risk of physical health problems and poor physical health is linked with poor mental health.</p><p>Ensuring access to appropriate treatment for people with mental health needs is a major policy concern.  Mental health care has suffered from systemic neglect and a lack of appropriate services.  The neglect of people with severe and enduring mental illness has negative outcomes for individuals and their families.  The neglect of mental health is across the spectrum at policy, institutional, organisational and individual levels.  The Bill aims to offer hope for better mental health care by ensuring that vulnerable persons with mental illness are cared for efficiently and have parity of esteem with those treated for physical health difficulties.</p> <p>Access to counselling can often be a barrier to people obtaining the appropriate mental health supports.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government would introduce universal free counselling on GP referral.</p> <p> Our alternative budget also provides an increase in investment in 24-7 crisis intervention services.  If I hurt my head at any hour of the day, I will get the treatment I need.  However, if I have an issue going on inside my head, the chances are I will not receive the appropriate treatment.  These are only two of the changes we would make in mental health provision.  These would go some way to restore the parity of esteem between mental and physical health.</p> <p> This legislation aims to compel a change in attitudes towards mental health at the highest level of policymaking and governance.  If this change in attitude occurs at the highest level, it will filter down to all levels of society and will see the stigma often associated with mental health conditions lessened.  We need to break this stigma once and for all.</p> <p> The effective integration of mental and physical health services is particularly important.  This Bill will place a duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity and ensure all organisations within the health system meet parity obligations in respect of mental health.  For example, no additional resources were allocated to mental health supports in the Government's winter plan.  No funding has been set out for this, which shows clearly the lack of parity of esteem between mental and physical healthcare in Ireland.</p> <p> This, however, is a Bill of hope.  It will give hope to any person suffering from mental health problems that he or she will be receive the right treatment at the right time.  It is easy to lose hope right now.  When restrictions were brought in first, many people, including myself, thought that these would be short-term measures and that we would be back to normality soon.  The longer the pandemic has gone on, the more messages I have received of pain and desperation from people who see no end to this.  I cannot tell people when this will end but I can tell them that it will end and we will come out the other side.</p> <p> People need hope right now.  People need assurances that the increase in mental health issues arising from Covid will be treated in a respectful and appropriate manner.  In the meantime, the most important thing we can do is be kind to each other, and to respect each other.  It is perfectly okay not to be okay right now.  It is normal to feel anxious, frightened, frustrated or worried about things that one has no control of.  Be kind and reach out, if you are not feeling okay.  You are not alone.</p></speech>

If the Ceann Comhairle will recall, the Taoiseach here on Tuesday, disagreed with the way that debates were being shoehorned and crammed into the middle of the week.  The Taoiseach said, "If we want a serious debate ... we should have it on Friday morning and I will take part in [that debate]."  We are not having a serious debate.  It is being crammed in here on Thursday and the Taoiseach is not taking part in it.  We agreed here in the House on Tuesday that he would have a serious debate here on Friday morning to discuss the abject confusion there is across the country regarding level 3 and the chaos that has been caused by regulations.  As I pointed out to him then, everyone in this country knows when and where they can get a pint, but what do I say to my constituent in her 80s who has an adult child with an intellectual disability and who does not know when the training centre for her son will open?  We do not know the details.  We want a proper debate.</p></speech>

There has been much discussion and kerfuffle about the spat between the T&aacute;naiste and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  Certainly, questions have to be asked and answered about all of that but there is a much more important issue, which is, how are we going to respond to what is an escalating crisis with Covid infections rising?  We need a very serious discussion about strategy.  We need to hear the options laid out.  We need to hear what data are available and how we can make a mature decision where political game-playing is left aside.</p>  <p>  We have set out our stall.  We believe the public health advice should be followed because the situation is dire.  Others disagree, but there has not been a proper debate.  To have a debate on the graveyard shift tonight and not have the promised discussion tomorrow is wrong.  There simply is not enough time tonight to consider, question and discuss the very serious situation we have facing us and the need for a mature, serious and urgent response that the public can buy into.  I have a different view from Deputy Naughten about what we need to do but I absolutely agree we need a serious, rounded, full and extensive debate, and that should include sitting tomorrow.</p></speech>

On Tuesday, the matter was raised by a range of Members, including myself, and the Taoiseach stated that we would have statements on Friday and that he would be there.  That is on the D&aacute;il record.</p>  <p>  On what is being offered tonight, I had proposed earlier that we would have statements similar to Thursday last where we would have ten minutes across the board with statements and questions.  I will be fair and acknowledge that the Government has compromised to agree to that.  However, what my colleagues said is also fair.  Friday was originally agreed.  If something is agreed here and we work on that basis, it should not be changed.  If the Deputies wish to push this further, I will support them but here has been compromise.  I acknowledge that there are statements and questions tonight, which is critically important.</p></speech>

If one wants to have a proper debate, I question going late into the night with the debate when everyone is tired.  The previous two sittings have been late.  Members want a proper debate.  The House should sit on Friday where everyone would have a night's sleep and we would have full discussions on this.  Even with the way the structure is set out for debates at present, for the likes of the Rural Independents to get in, the structure is all wrong.</p>  <p>  The Government parties all want to speak first.  They will put people to sleep.  People want us to ask questions of them and they want them to answer to us.  They do not want to have to wait.  Members ran into this Chamber last week and on RT&Eacute; were shown to be winded and unable to speak because of their slots.  This has to change.  We need proper debate, proper dialogue and a proper timetable where everyone can come in and debate properly.</p></speech>

On Tuesday, he made a clear commitment.  He said that he would have no problem in having a full and wholesome debate on Friday.  He stated that he would partake of that debate.  What has happened since?  What has changed?</p> <p>Considering the hundreds of thousands of people who have been impacted in such a devastating way, with their work taken from them and the rug pulled from under them, the courtesy we are showing them in debating their issues is to cram this debate in late on a Thursday night.  Neither I nor my colleagues think that is proper behaviour.  That is not dealing with people's issues and problems in a sincere and meaningful way.  Where is the word the Taoiseach gave on Tuesday?  What changed?  We were to hold a Friday debate and we are cramming it in tonight.</p></speech>

Whatever about tomorrow, next week or whenever else, the specific request for tonight was for questions and answers.

The Minster for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is willing to partake in statements and questions and answers this evening which is why we made the proposal.  We sought to accommodate a discussion in this evening's debate and time was provided at the end of today.  The Opposition requested a debate on Covid.  Last week, all Government time was provided for a debate on Covid.  As the Ceann Comhairle said, there will continue to be regular debates on this issue.  It is unfortunate that much of the debate has involved the politicisation of the public health approach.  Many Opposition Deputies are trying to undermine the bona fide attempts by the Government to suppress the virus and bring it under control.  That is a serious issue in the context of public health messaging that many Opposition Deputies, although not all, are attacking the Government strategy of suppressing the virus and giving clear and concise information to the public on how we need to tackle it.  The framework for that is very clear.</p>  <p>  I accept that Deputy Boyd Barrett has a different view but other Members seem to want to go back to level 1 or 2.  We are clear about what we have set out, how we want to proceed and how to ensure enforcement and compliance at level 3 to suppress the virus.  The Minister for Health will be before the D&aacute;il this evening.  We are accommodating that in the schedule and I am sure there will be debate on this issue next week and the week after that.  Deputies are not being genuine if they seek questions and answers at a private meeting of the Business Committee, which the Government has been willing to facilitate, and then come into the Chamber and try to move the goalposts by looking for something else.  </p></speech>

We are discussing public money and a very serious matter.  The committee only signed off on the Estimates yesterday and they have come to the House today.  As of this morning at least, none of us, apart from the members of the committee, has seen the Estimates and we do not know what the considerations are, yet we are being asked to push a Revised Estimate through on the nod.  I take the point that these are additional expenditures for the arts and no one wants to stop additional expenditure.  Some might want to see much more expenditure.  However, there is a problem with the D&aacute;il pushing through significant additional expenditures of public money on the nod without proper discussion and a report on the considerations from the committee.  I do not want to hold up the business of the D&aacute;il but I see that as a problem.  It is important to underline, as was pointed out at the Business Committee today, that the option that Deputies had to attend meetings of committees of which they are not members has now effectively ceased.  In the past, a Member who was not a member of a committee could still attend, listen and speak.  That is no longer an option.  Therefore, when it comes to Estimates and other matters arising out of committee proceedings, a whole layer of Deputies is simply excluded from the process.  That is not great legislative or financial oversight.</p></speech>

I have been self-employed all my life.  If a business project is before me and I want to see its finances, I will look at its figures and discuss them.  I had nothing in front of me at the Business Committee meeting this morning.  Nothing was handed to me to allow me to make a decision on finances.  I understand the Revised Estimate is for 2020.  To run a business properly, one must have the figures.  Deputies must be allowed to go through the figures to see everything is correct and to ask questions.  To have only one hour's notice that this Revised Estimate will be before the House is not right.  I would like to have time to look through the figures and all the documentation.  I am not happy that this did not happen.</p></speech>

They are procedural issues.  When the Estimates are published and distributed to the members of the select committee, they are also made available to Members of the House.  Some may not be in the habit of studying Estimates documents that are sent to them but they were distributed.  In addition, this morning, after Deputies raised concerns about this, we asked that a briefing note be circulated to Members in advance of this session.</p> <p>I assume they have got that.  It was to set out the issues that arose at the committee meeting and the proposals that had been made.</p> <p> I further accept that Deputy Boyd Barrett makes a reasonable point about process, but it is not something that the Minister can deal with here.  It applies to all committees.  Perhaps a D&aacute;il reform committee or the Business Committee needs to examine the process around how Members have ready access to the maximum relevant information.  In this instance, we are simply being asked to approve retrospectively money that has been vital to this Minister to support her various areas of initiative.</p></speech>

We again propose that their contributions be interspersed.  It is in the public interest to have back and forth.  We propose that the schedule be the Taoiseach at 30 minutes, Sinn F&eacute;in at 30 minutes, the T&aacute;naiste at 30 minutes, the Labour Party at 15 minutes, the Green Party at 20 minutes, the Social Democrats at 15 minutes and so on.

However, there is adequate time for the Opposition parties to respond.  There will also be loads of time next week for the Opposition to go through the budget with a fine-tooth comb and speak about all of the budget's various elements.  The schedule is not unreasonable.  The people watching want to see both sides of the argument; they want to see what the Government is proposing and how the Opposition responds to the budget.  This schedule is the Government's proposal, which is very much in keeping with tradition.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im anseo inniu in &eacute;ineacht leis an Aire St&aacute;it, Teachta Chambers, chun t&aacute;bhacht an Bhille seo a l&eacute;iri&uacute; do phobal na t&iacute;re i gcoitinne agus do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ach go h&aacute;irithe.</p>  <p>  Mar Aire ar a bhfuil freagracht as an turas&oacute;ireacht, an cult&uacute;r, an eala&iacute;n, an Ghaeltacht, an sp&oacute;irt agus na me&aacute;in, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis seo labhairt leis an D&aacute;il inniu faoin mBille.

Mar is eol don Teach, mar Theachta D&aacute;la le ceithre bliana anuas, d&eacute;anaim iarracht i gc&oacute;na&iacute; solas a lasadh ar an nGaeilge leis an m&eacute;id a deirim ar url&aacute;r na D&aacute;la agus leis an m&eacute;id a dh&eacute;anaim sa saol poibl&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach dom, mar sin, agus m&eacute; i mbun cainteanna rialtais go mbeadh gealltanais dhearfacha maidir leis an nGaeilge sa chl&aacute;r Rialtais.  T&aacute; s&eacute; luaite go sonrach go bhfuil s&eacute; mar fh&iacute;s againn mar Rialtas go nd&eacute;anfar an Ghaeilge a choth&uacute; agus a chur chun cinn.  Tuigeann muid an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an teanga mar ch&eacute;ad teanga oifigi&uacute;il an St&aacute;it, mar chuid luachmhar d'oidhreacht an oile&aacute;in seo agus, n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; f&oacute;s, mar theanga bheo i measc pobail ar fud na t&iacute;re agus sa Ghaeltacht ach go h&aacute;irithe.

T&aacute; i gceist againn freisin ionaid Ghaeilge a fhorbairt i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus ar fud na t&iacute;re.

Tuigim go maith an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an obair at&aacute; ar bun ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s ar son na Gaeltachta ar bhonn lean&uacute;nach.  De bharr na hoibre seo, t&aacute; deiseanna fosta&iacute;ochta agus fiontra&iacute;ochta cothaithe agus cruthaithe i gceantair nach bhfaigheadh na deiseanna sin murach gur ann don eagra&iacute;ocht.

T&aacute; an pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga ag teacht faoi bhl&aacute;th sa Ghaeltacht anois agus t&aacute; plean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta c&uacute;ig-bliana don Ghaeilge &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm faoi l&aacute;thair.  Am&aacute;rach, t&aacute; s&uacute;il againn an ch&eacute;ad tuarasc&aacute;il bhliant&uacute;il ar an bplean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta a fhoilsi&uacute;, rud a thabharfaidh l&eacute;argas ar dul chun cinn na strait&eacute;ise.  Feicfidh daoine an m&eacute;id at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh faoi sc&aacute;th na strait&eacute;ise.</p>  <p>  Tugann s&eacute; seo m&eacute; go dt&iacute; an Bille teanga.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil muid anseo ag pl&eacute; an Bhille seo inniu.  C&eacute; gur f&aacute;ilt&iacute;odh roimh fhoilsi&uacute; an Bhille anuraidh, bh&iacute; roinnt mhaith ag ma&iacute;omh gur theastaigh Bille n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre, an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus Conradh na Gaeilge ina measc.  D'aithin an Rialtas &eacute; seo agus gealladh sa chl&aacute;r Rialtais go dtabharfa&iacute; Bille n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre chun cinn agus go mbeadh s&eacute; achtaithe roimh dheireadh na bliana.  T&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht an Rialtais faighte anois roinnt leasuithe a mholadh a l&aacute;idreoidh an Bille agus beidh an tAire St&aacute;it, Teachta Chambers, in ann na leasuithe sin a chur i l&aacute;thair n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, is on&oacute;ir mh&oacute;r domsa a bheith ceaptha mar Aire ar a bhfuil freagracht as an nGaeltacht agus ba mhian liom &aacute;r dteanga dh&uacute;chais a chur chun cinn, a neart&uacute; agus a fh&aacute;s n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht, ach ar fud &aacute;r n-oile&aacute;in.  Chun &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh, n&iacute; m&oacute;r taca&iacute;ocht oifigi&uacute;il an St&aacute;it a bheith taobh thiar di.  Tuigeann muid ar fad go bhfuil st&aacute;das ar leith ag an nGaeilge i mBunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann mar ch&eacute;ad teanga oifigi&uacute;il an St&aacute;it.  Is tr&iacute;d an reachta&iacute;ocht a thugtar feidhm don st&aacute;das sin agus sin &eacute; an f&aacute;th go bhfuil an Bille seo chomh t&aacute;bhachtach sin.  Creidim go mbeidh muid in ann, tr&iacute;d an mBille seo, timpeallacht a chruth&uacute; inar f&eacute;idir feabhas a chur ar shol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, mar is c&oacute;ir, agus freastal mar is ceart ar phobal Gaeilge na t&iacute;re seo.  Mar sin, molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</p></speech>

Ar a l&aacute;n beala&iacute; is l&aacute; cinni&uacute;nach don Ghaeilge at&aacute; ann.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; shl&iacute; chun tabhairt faoi chearta a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Is &eacute; seo sl&iacute; amh&aacute;in chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le fadhbanna &oacute; thaobh an mhaorlathais de.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach bhfuilimid ag coth&uacute; n&oacute; ag cur leis an bureaucracy a bh&iacute;onn timpeall ar ruda&iacute; mar seo agus an fad a bh&iacute; ann le cearta a bhronnadh n&oacute; a thabhairt do lucht na Gaeilge, mar t&aacute; siad acu cheana f&eacute;in, ach n&iacute; raibh siad in ann na cearta sin a fhail d&oacute;ibh f&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  Ba ch&oacute;ir, ar shl&iacute; amh&aacute;in, Operation Fanacht a thabhairt ar an mBille seo mar t&aacute;imid tar &eacute;is a bheith ag fanacht le tamall fada de bhlianta air seo.  Measaim gurbh &eacute; an t-iarAire agus t-iarTheachta Dinny McGinley in 2011 a lorg go mbeadh leas&uacute; ioml&aacute;n d&eacute;anta ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la a th&aacute;inig isteach in 2004.  Is cuimhin liomsa gurbh &eacute; ceann de na ch&eacute;ad ruda&iacute; a bh&iacute; orm tabhairt faoi mar Theachta nua in 2002 n&aacute; an Bille sin agus c&eacute; chomh casta is a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag an am sin. </p> <p>Bh&iacute; c&oacute;ras nua &aacute; mholadh san Acht a bh&iacute; ann ag an am sin agus bh&iacute; the devil and all chun tarl&uacute; de thairbhe an Achta sin.  T&aacute;imid f&oacute;s ag an staid ina rabhamar ar mh&oacute;r&aacute;n beala&iacute; n&oacute; imithe siar &oacute; staid a bh&iacute;omar chomh fada siar le 2002.  Is trua sin mar n&iacute;or tharla an t-athr&uacute; poirt a bh&iacute;omar ag s&uacute;il leis ag an am.  Bh&iacute; muin&iacute;n curtha againn isteach sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras, muin&iacute;n nach raibh tuillte aige ag an am agus nach bhfuil tuillte f&oacute;s ina ioml&aacute;n.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuilim m&iacute;cheart agus go bhfuil athr&uacute; poirt tagtha orthu si&uacute;d at&aacute; i gceannas na Ranna St&aacute;it ar fad at&aacute; tar &eacute;is loiceadh ar an nGaeilge agus ar chearta Gaeilgeoir&iacute; sa t&iacute;r seo.  T&aacute; deireadh le r&eacute; an fhrustrachais at&aacute; orainn agus orthu si&uacute;d a bhfuil c&oacute;na&iacute; orthu sa Ghaeltacht, frustrachas at&aacute; an-soil&eacute;ir agus n&iacute; de mo thuairim amh&aacute;in &eacute; sin m&aacute; l&eacute;ann duine an tuarasc&aacute;il chuile bhliain &oacute;n gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil fadhbanna bun&uacute;sacha nach f&eacute;idir leis an mBille seo tabhairt f&uacute;thu.  </p> <p> I ndeireadh thiar thall n&iacute;l ann ach Bille.  Mura dtarla&iacute;onn athr&uacute; meoin ag na c&eacute;imeanna is airde agus ag gach uile ch&eacute;im den st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras, beimid ar ais anseo i gceann fiche bliain agus beidh an fhadhb &oacute; thaobh na teanga de n&iacute;os measa m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag brath go huile is go hioml&aacute;n ar an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil moladh agus &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas &aacute; ngabh&aacute;il do na heagrais phobail tr&iacute;d s&iacute;os na t&iacute;re at&aacute; ag cuidi&uacute; linn an Ghaeilge a tharrth&aacute;il agus an Ghaeltacht a chosaint.  Seachas iadsan bheimis i s&aacute;inn agus bheadh g&eacute;arch&eacute;im i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os measa againn.</p> <p> T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta go bhfuilim anseo agus ag d&eacute;anamh pl&eacute; ar cheisteanna Gaeilge agus go bhfuilimid ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar roinnt de na fadhbanna a bh&iacute; aitheanta thar na blianta.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta freisin, cos&uacute;il lena l&aacute;n daoine, muin&iacute;n n&oacute; ar a laghad tac&uacute; leis an athr&uacute; at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; agus go bhfuilimid ag bogadh &oacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga agus go bhfuil coiste comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in &aacute; bhun&uacute; agus breis cumhachta&iacute; le bheith bronnta ar an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  Taca&iacute;m leis sin.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir gan tac&uacute; leis sin ach t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach mbeimid ag cur moill ar an infheisti&uacute; ceart &oacute; thaobh foirne de agus ar an taca&iacute;ocht leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; laistigh den st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus a bh&iacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; s&aacute;sta an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</p> <p> Tabharfaidh m&eacute; sampla go gasta don Teach ar fhadhbanna, ceann amh&aacute;in le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute;, agus n&iacute;l m&eacute; ag caitheamh anuas ar an duine a dhein an fhadhb.  Chuir m&eacute; ceisteanna isteach ag an Aire, Teachta Eamon Ryan, ag an am agus th&aacute;inig na freagra&iacute; ar ais i mB&eacute;arla agus n&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta glacadh leis sin agus ghabh an duine a bh&iacute; i gceannas leithsc&eacute;al.  Bh&iacute; gear&aacute;n curtha isteach ag an gCeann Comhairle agus fuair m&eacute; freagra ar ais ar an ngear&aacute;n sin &oacute;n Roinn sin i mB&eacute;arla.  N&iacute; thuigeann an Roinn.  Is &eacute; ceann de na fadhbanna bun&uacute;sacha nach dtuigeann daoine go d&iacute;reach conas mar a ritheann sin liomsa n&oacute; leis an ngn&aacute;thphobal.</p> <p> T&aacute;imse anseo &oacute; 2002.  Measaim go raibh dh&aacute; ph&iacute;osa reachta&iacute;ochta a foils&iacute;odh i nGaeilge a raibh m&eacute; in ann seasamh suas, labhairt as Gaeilge agus go raibh n&oacute;ta n&oacute; meamram m&iacute;ni&uacute;ch&aacute;in i nGaeilge leis an bhfocla&iacute;ocht.  N&iacute; bh&iacute;onn s&eacute; ann de ghnath.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sa Bhille seo mar go bhfuil an Bille seo foilsithe go d&aacute;theangach agus crutha&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Go minic n&iacute;l an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras at&aacute; istigh anseo s&aacute;sta dul sa treo sin.  I dt&iacute;ortha eile foils&iacute;tear agus d&eacute;ile&aacute;iltear leis an reachta&iacute;ocht go d&aacute;theangach.  N&iacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin anseo.  Aistr&iacute;tear iad anseo nuair a bh&iacute;onn siad cr&iacute;ochnaithe.  T&aacute; an job done, hard luck.  T&aacute;imid cr&iacute;ochnaithe leis.</p> <p> Chomh maith leis sin tugadh gealladh domsa, measaim, &oacute;n iarAire, iarTheachta Joan Burton, ag an am in 2011, go mbeadh na meamraim m&iacute;ni&uacute;ch&aacute;in aistrithe agus ar f&aacute;il do gach duine, n&iacute; domsa amh&aacute;in, mar t&aacute; Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa agam, ach t&aacute; daoine eile agus t&aacute; s&eacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n n&iacute;os deacra orthu na point&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh acu ar &aacute;bhair theicni&uacute;la a chur in i&uacute;l i nGaeilge mar n&iacute;l an l&iacute;ofacht ch&eacute;anna acu, an fhocla&iacute;ocht n&oacute; an st&oacute;r focal acu.  Bheadh s&eacute; i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os &eacute;asca d&aacute; mbeadh na meamraim m&iacute;ni&uacute;ch&aacute;in curtha amach.  N&iacute; g&aacute; &eacute; a aistri&uacute; n&oacute; fi&uacute; a bheith foilsithe ar an l&aacute; ceannann c&eacute;anna.  Is &eacute; an t-aon rud is f&eacute;idir a tharl&uacute; agus bheadh s&eacute; &aacute;isi&uacute;il nuair a bheadh dl&uacute;s curtha timpeall deich focal n&oacute; mar sin ann agus go mbeadh s&eacute; sin &uacute;s&aacute;ideach.  </p> <p> Is ruda&iacute; simpl&iacute; iad seo a chuideodh leis an mBille seo a thabharfadh deis d&uacute;inn d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le reachta&iacute;ocht as Gaeilge.  </p> <p> T&aacute; sampla&iacute; eile ann, agus mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; n&iacute;l m&eacute; ag caitheamh anuas ar dhaoine.  Is iad seo ach cleachtadh.  Tabharfaidh m&eacute; na ceannl&iacute;nte don Teach agus roghn&oacute;idh m&eacute; roinnt d&iacute;obh anseo:</p> <p>&ldquo;Ard&uacute; 27% ar l&iacute;on na nd&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute; &oacute;n Gaeilge a bronnadh ar dhalta&iacute; sa s&eacute;&uacute; bliain&rdquo;,  &ldquo;Riachtanas Gaeilge &lsquo;consp&oacute;ideach agus ina &uacute;dar aighnis&rsquo; a deir NUI&rdquo;, &ldquo;Teip na Roinne Oideachais maidir le Gaeilge ar shu&iacute;omh Ardteiste &aacute; scr&uacute;d&uacute; &ndash; i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in gur f&eacute;idir le dalta&iacute; Ardteiste cl&aacute;r&uacute; d&aacute; scr&uacute;duithe ar shu&iacute;omh na Roinne Oideachais.&rdquo;  </p> <p> N&iacute;or th&aacute;inig leagan Gaeilge den su&iacute;omh sin ach tamaill&iacute;n ina dhiaidh sin, is &eacute; sin an su&iacute;omh Ranna.  T&aacute; roinnt de shu&iacute;omhanna tubaisteach f&oacute;s &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  N&iacute;or th&aacute;inig leagan Gaeilge den aip Covid-19 ach i ndiaidh an leagain B&eacute;arla.  T&aacute; ruda&iacute; mar sin ag tarl&uacute;.  N&iacute;l an t&uacute;s &aacute;ite ag an nGaeilge.  Mura bhfuil an leagan Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il n&iacute;or cheart an leagan B&eacute;arla a fhoilsi&uacute; go dt&iacute; go bhfuil an leagan Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il.  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh aon su&iacute;omh St&aacute;it ag dul beo, mar a deireann siad, sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann go dt&iacute; go mbeidh an leagan Gaeilge ann ag an am c&eacute;anna.  Is ruda&iacute; simpl&iacute; iad sin.</p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist ag an mBille seo go mbeadh an St&aacute;t ag tabhairt seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; as Gaeilge do lucht na Gaeltachta.  Treis&iacute;m leis sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin &aacute; lorg againn sin le blianta.  Is &iacute; an fhadhb at&aacute; ann n&aacute; nach bhfuil an oiread sin oifigeach St&aacute;it ann anois mar t&aacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n acu ar l&iacute;ne anois.  M&aacute; t&aacute; duine ag tabhairt seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge do lucht na Gaeltachta, beidh ar na daoine a bheidh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sin &aacute; lorg acu a bheith ar l&iacute;ne freisin.  M&aacute; t&aacute; siad ar l&iacute;ne beidh siad ag gach duine.  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go mbeimid ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach go d&iacute;reach ar shu&iacute;omhanna fisici&uacute;la sa Ghaeltacht ina bhfuil duine ina sheasamh ag deasc agus ag tabhairt seirbh&iacute;se.  Nuair a l&iacute;onann duine foirm anois is ar l&iacute;ne den chuid is m&oacute; at&aacute; neart daoine &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh sin.  M&aacute; ghlaonn duine ar an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Fosta&iacute;ochta agus Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute; gheofar duine ar an bhf&oacute;n agus d'fh&eacute;adfadh an duine sin a bheith in Timbuktu agus go mbeidh an tseirbh&iacute;s ar f&aacute;il d&oacute; n&oacute; di agus an duine in ann cnaipe a bhr&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os &eacute;asca d&uacute;inn mar St&aacute;t &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; 20 n&oacute; 30 bliain &oacute; shin nuair a bh&iacute; ar an duine a bheith ann go fisici&uacute;il.  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; deacair ar an St&aacute;t athr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  </p> <p> &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute; fadhb bhun&uacute;sach aitheanta faoi l&aacute;thair leis an gc&oacute;ras ceapach&aacute;in, mar shampla, agus is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid ag caint faoi earc&uacute; 20% de na daoine nua a bheidh sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s faoi 2030 a bheith l&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge.  Faoi l&aacute;thair d&eacute;antar pain&eacute;al a chumadh d&rsquo;oifigigh feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in Gaeilge.  Rinneadh ceann le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus leanfaidh s&eacute; go ceann 18 m&iacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin go maith ach lu&iacute;onn s&eacute; le r&eacute;as&uacute;n go roghn&oacute;far duine &oacute;n bpain&eacute;al do gach c&uacute;igear fol&uacute;ntas at&aacute; ann agus is &eacute; ann pointe sin at&aacute; i gceist againn.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; chomh simpl&iacute; sin mar go bhfuil s&eacute; ar bhonn iarratais &oacute; Roinn &eacute;igin a roghna&iacute;tear duine &oacute;n bpain&eacute;al sin.  M&aacute; t&aacute; dh&aacute; fhol&uacute;ntas ag Roinn, n&iacute; bheidh an chuid is m&oacute; de na Ranna ag lorg duine le Gaeilge, n&iacute;l siad ach ag lorg duine agus t&aacute; an chuid d&iacute;obh ar phain&eacute;al eile.  T&aacute; fadhbanna bun&uacute;sacha ann agus beidh ar an gcoiste comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in, ar an Aire agus ar an tSeirbh&iacute;s un Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute; d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na ruda&iacute; sin. Tuigim go bhfuil am ag teast&aacute;il chun an c&oacute;ras a athr&uacute; go hinmhe&aacute;nach agus gur fadhbanna bun&uacute;sacha iad.</p> <p> &Oacute; thaobh an spriocdh&aacute;ta de, cad a tharla&iacute;onn tar &eacute;is 2030?</p> <p>Ceapann daoine go mbeidh 20% den St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s in ann Gaeilge a labhairt n&oacute; go mbeidh siad l&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge faoi 2030.  N&iacute; sin at&aacute; ann.  N&iacute;l ann ach go mbeidh 20% d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bheidh earcaithe as sin amach in ann Gaeilge a labhairt.  I gceann 30 n&oacute; 40 bliain, beidh 20% den St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s in ann Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa a labhairt.  Sin at&aacute; ann mar go minic b&iacute;onn daoine ann fad saoil.</p> <p> Cad faoi 2035, 2040 n&oacute; 2050?  Nach f&eacute;idir linn sprioc eile a leagan amach go mbeidh 30% n&oacute; 40% ann agus sa deireadh go mbeidh 50% d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; istigh sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s l&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge, seachas a bheith ag caint f&uacute;thu si&uacute;d a bheidh earcaithe.  Sin athr&uacute; eile agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh muid ag pl&eacute; sin &oacute; thaobh na leasuithe ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste.</p> <p> Tagra&iacute;m don choiste comhairleach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il agus n&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil s&eacute; curtha sa sl&iacute; at&aacute; s&eacute;.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n leasuithe le dul air sin.  N&iacute;l ach duine amh&aacute;in &oacute;n nGaeltacht ann agus n&iacute;l na heagrais Gaeilge n&oacute; fi&uacute; na heagrais St&aacute;it Gaeilge luaite le bheith ar an gcoiste gcomhairleach sin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn roinnt acu a lua go sonrach agus b'fh&eacute;idir cathaoirleach neamhsple&aacute;ch &oacute;n St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras a cheapadh ar n&oacute;s an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga n&oacute; duine cos&uacute;il leis an bpr&iacute;omhfheidhmeannach i bhFhoras na Gaeilge.

N&iacute; haon caitheamh anuas ar dhaoine &eacute; sin.  Seo at&aacute; ann ach t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh s&eacute; i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os fearr agus go mbeidh muid in ann brath air chun cuidi&uacute; leis an obair chun an Ghaeilge a tharrth&aacute;il agus chun cur leis an nGaeltacht, seachas &iacute; a bheith ag meath an t-am ar fad.</p></speech>

Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil muid anseo inniu chun Bille nua ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la a phl&eacute;.   T&aacute; 17 bliana caite &oacute; tugadh an tAcht f&eacute;in isteach agus gealladh an Bille leasaithe seo s&eacute; bliana &oacute; shin, nach m&oacute;r.  Ar a laghad, t&aacute; s&eacute; de sheans againn anois an Bille a scr&uacute;d&uacute; mar is cu&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Ba l&eacute;ir nach raibh an Bille teanga a cuireadh os comhair Teachta&iacute; i ndeireadh na bliana seo caite feili&uacute;nach.  Ar chuid de na laig&iacute; a tugadh aird orthu ag an am, bh&iacute; easpa spriocdh&aacute;ta don chusp&oacute;ir go mbeadh l&iacute;ofacht sa Ghaeilge ag 20% d'oibrithe nua sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;; spriocdh&aacute;ta ar bith maidir le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; i nGaeilge a chinnti&uacute; do mhuintir na Gaeltachta; ionada&iacute;ocht ar bith ag saineolaithe n&aacute; ag pobal na Gaeilge ar an gcoiste comhairleach a bh&iacute; molta; agus gan dr&eacute;achtchaighde&aacute;in a bheith ar f&aacute;il mar eiseaml&aacute;ir do ch&oacute;ras na gcaighde&aacute;n teanga a thiocfadh isteach in &aacute;it na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach gur ch&uacute;is &aacute;thais domsa a bh&iacute; ann nuair a gealladh i gcl&aacute;r an Rialtais seo go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; l&aacute;idri&uacute; ar a raibh molta sa Bhille deireanach.  Ar an &aacute;bhar sin, cuirim f&aacute;ilte chro&iacute;&uacute;il roimh an leas&uacute; chun cumhachta&iacute; breise a thabhairt don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga sa chaoi is gur f&eacute;idir leis faireach&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh ar aon Acht a bhfuil baint aige le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge n&oacute; lena st&aacute;das mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh s&eacute; de chead ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir tr&aacute;chtaireacht a dh&eacute;anamh ar dl&iacute;the eile, seachas Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la amh&aacute;in.  Easpa mh&oacute;r sa Bhille a bh&iacute; ann nach raibh cead ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir ach ini&uacute;chadh a dh&eacute;anamh ar sheachaint dualgais nuair at&aacute; gear&aacute;n d&eacute;anta agus t&aacute;im an-s&aacute;sta go bhfuil s&eacute; sin curtha ina cheart ag an Rialtas.  Ina theannta sin, is c&eacute;im eile chun cinn &eacute; go gcuirfidh na leasuithe spriocdh&aacute;ta den 31 Nollaig 2030 leis an gcusp&oacute;ir sa Bhille go mbeadh 20% d'oibrithe nua sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; ina gcainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge.  Is cur chuige tomhaiste ciallmhar &eacute; seo ach t&aacute; fadbhanna ann, mar a luaigh mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh.</p>  <p>  N&iacute; thuigim beag n&aacute; m&oacute;r tuige a bhfuiltear ag moladh go mbeadh s&eacute; de chumhacht ag an Aire ord&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh in 2028 go gcuirf&iacute; siar an spriocdh&aacute;ta sin.  Mugadh magadh at&aacute; ann spriocdh&aacute;ta a leagan amach agus ag an am c&eacute;anna a r&aacute; gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; a sh&iacute;neadh amach mura n-&eacute;ireoidh leis.  Ni lu&iacute;onn s&eacute; le r&eacute;as&uacute;n agus creidim go l&aacute;idir gur cheart an leas&uacute; sin a bhaint &oacute;n mBille.  Ba ch&oacute;ir freisin go mbeadh s&eacute; ina dhualgas reacht&uacute;il ag duine n&oacute; dream ar leith maidir leis an bplean n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta earca&iacute;ochta a chur i bhfeidhm.  &Uacute;dar m&oacute;r d&iacute;om&aacute; eile at&aacute; sa Bhille seo nach bhfuil for&aacute;il l&aacute;idir ann a leagfadh dualgas reacht&uacute;il ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina dteanga dh&uacute;chais.</p>  <p>  Is minic &eacute; r&aacute;ite ach is tobar luachmhar teangeola&iacute;och iad na ceantair Ghaeltachta is l&aacute;idre sa t&iacute;r agus t&aacute; br&uacute; aisteach ar na pobail seo ar go leor beala&iacute;.  N&iacute;l na jabanna le f&aacute;il agus n&iacute;l an infreastrucht&uacute;r gr&eacute;as&aacute;in s&aacute;s&uacute;il ar chor ar bith idir leathanbhanda, b&oacute;ithre agus cuanta.  Cuireann s&eacute; seo ar fad iallach ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta an baile a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il ar th&oacute;ir oibre agus is iond&uacute;il gur i mB&eacute;arla a bh&iacute;onn an obair sin ar f&aacute;il.

Is &eacute; an cheist a bheadh agamsa don Rialtas n&aacute; c&eacute;n toradh at&aacute; s&eacute; ag iarraidh &oacute;n mBille seo?

It has been ten months since it was published and it has been a very peculiar legislative period.  The Minister has brought this forward as soon as feasibly possible and this is appreciated.  The Labour Party will look to bring some amendments to the Bill to strengthen it, but overall it is a move in the right direction and we broadly support it.</p>  <p>  I will, however, flag some of the issues here that we will be raising.  An Post should not be able to avoid obligations of section 9 of the current Act with regard to marketing materials made available to the public because their duties under the Official Languages Act 2003 were not made sufficiently clear.  If a public body or a Government Department contacts the public in any way that contact should be made bilingually or in Irish only, and current exceptions should not be allowed.  There should be a requirement for a specific level of advertising to be included in the Bill.  It has been made abundantly clear that during the Covid crisis there was very little, almost zero, Irish or bilingual advertising from the HSE and the Government.  I spent a few days in the Gaeltacht during the summer and the vast majority of HSE signs were in English.  It was very visible. </p> <p>Warnings on alcoholic drinks should be bilingual as well, as they are in other bilingual countries.  That could be included in this Bill.</p> <p> There is a broader issue involved with the promotion of the Irish language, which this Bill falls under.  I will use this opportunity to speak about what the Minister of State and the Government can do before next week's budget, and then beyond, to promote the Irish language, in particular to young people.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;, which is an Irish-language music station aimed at 12 to 30-year olds.  It broadcasts online and via its app and has studios in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  It is seeking an FM licence.  There is no concern regarding the frequency; it just wants the opportunity to be able to broadcast to the 32 counties.  Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; is a unique offering.  It is a vibrant radio station operated by young people for young people.  It plays exactly the same music and content as any radio station broadcasting in English, whether that is FM104, Spin 103 in Dublin, or stations anywhere else around the country.  The one defining and distinct selling point of Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;, however, is that it broadcasts in Irish.  The costs associated with the request are not insignificant but, that said, they are not too high.  I am sure a briefing has been sent to the Minister of State's office on this issue.  This could have benefits for the language, and particularly for promoting it to young people.  Those benefits would be manifest compared with the money required to support it.  </p> <p> I am someone who is constantly trying to relearn Irish.  At the moment, I have CDs in my car, which I bought about six months ago to try to bone up on my Irish.  It is not working for me, but I am trying all the time. A station like Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; would benefit people like me, who went through our education system for 14 years and still does not have the confidence or competence to speak as Gaeilge in our national Parliament.  We need to look at other ways of promoting the language outside the education system.</p> <p> We look forward to engaging with the Minister and Minister of State on this Bill as it goes through Committee Stage and into the Seanad.  We welcome this debate and thank the Minister and Minister of State.</p></speech>

I m&iacute; an Mh&aacute;rta na bliana seo, rinne bord bainist&iacute;ochta an chol&aacute;iste iarracht airgead a fh&aacute;il &oacute;n gciste um athghini&uacute;int agus forbairt tuaithe, ach theip orthu.  D&eacute;anfaidh baill an bhoird iarracht nua an mh&iacute; seo chugainn, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go nd&eacute;anfaidh an tAire a d&iacute;cheall chun an taca&iacute;ocht f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar phlean acu, agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh, an col&aacute;iste a &uacute;s&aacute;id le haghaidh ranganna Gaeilge mar is gn&aacute;ch i rith an tsamhraidh agus mar shu&iacute;omh fiontra&iacute;ochta agus turas&oacute;ireachta i rith na m&iacute;onna eile.  N&iacute;or dh&uacute;n Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe ach uair amh&aacute;in thar na blianta, agus b'shin nuair a dh&oacute;igh na D&uacute;chr&oacute;naigh an foirgneamh.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go l&aacute;idir go gcabhr&oacute;idh an tAire leis an gcol&aacute;iste seo.</p>  <p>  I speak about Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe in Carrigaholt in County Clare.  It was founded as an Irish college by Conradh na Gaeilge way back in 1908, and during its many years of existence it only had to close once.  That was in 1920, when the building was partially burnt by the Black and Tans.  To the immense dismay of local people in west Clare and the Irish language movement across the county, Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe had to close its doors once again in 2018.  This time, it closed due to a lack of funding, which has been the enemy of so many organisations.  </p>  <p>  In March this year, Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe applied for rural regeneration and redevelopment funding, but its application was unsuccessful.  It is planned to make a second application for funding next month and I hope the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht will make the effort possible to support that case.  The plan for the future of the col&aacute;iste is a realistic and sensible one.  Management envisages the col&aacute;iste operating as an Irish college, as normal, in June, July and August.  For the remainder of the year, it would operate as a centre in west Clare to be used interchangeably for enterprise and tourism activities.  It even has the potential to be a three-star hostel providing accommodation in the extremities of west Clare.  </p>  <p>  There are, therefore, many new uses for the col&aacute;iste beyond what was initially conceived in 1908.  Funding for the Irish college in Carrigaholt is not just about protecting our native language.  It is also about jobs and the rural economy in west Clare.  I ask that the Minister of State do his very best for Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe. </p></speech>

It is an issue of which I am conscious, and I have committed to improving my Irish language ability.  It will be a great honour to be able to stand up in this House and address Ministers with more confidence.  I will be doing that in the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  I am going to speak about the Bill and comment on some potential issues, topics and concerns that have been raised by members of the Irish language community, with whom I have engaged, and the Social Democrats' WhatsApp group as Gaeilge, which has welcomed me into its forum in recent days.  I also hope to raise various issues when we discuss amendments on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  It is great that 2030 has been set as the target date for increasing to 20% the proportion of recruits who are competent in Irish.  The provision for a review in 2028 and the power being given to the Minister to extend the deadline beyond 2030 will have to be examined and it is likely these provisions will need to be amended.</p> <p>The Minister with direct responsibility should not be able to give him or herself an extension.  It should absolutely be the D&aacute;il or an independent person or body that takes the decision.</p> <p> As with the Welsh Language Commissioner and the Ombudsman for Children in Ireland, the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga should examine all proposed legislation relating to the Irish language and any public strategy relating to the promotion of the official language, that is, the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  Further duties for the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga need to be included in the Bill such as, for example, giving the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga a role in examining Government Bills and policies and in making observations regarding the Irish language and Gaeltacht matters, which may head off any problems arising after the enactment of legislation or Government policy.  This proposed role for the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga reflects a similar duty to that of the Welsh Language Commissioner in Wales.</p> <p> All functions delegated by public bodies in contracts to other bodies should automatically come within the ambit of the legislation, including the Dublinbikes scheme, the Go-Ahead bus services etc.  The comparison that was made to me when I spoke to the Irish language community was with Irish Water.  I do not know anybody who refers to it as Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The idea of having a sole body's name be in the Irish language is important.  Bodies such as An Post should not be able to avoid the obligations of section 9 of the current Act regarding marketing materials made available to the public because their duties under the Official Languages Act 2003 were not sufficiently clear.  If a public body or Department contacts the public in any way, that contact should be made bilingually or in Irish only and current exceptions should not be allowed.</p> <p> A requirement for a specific level of advertising should be included in the Bill.  Deputy Duncan Smith has already raised the issue of the Covid restrictions, guidelines and warnings only appearing in the English language.  It is a particular source of annoyance to the Irish language community and is something that we need to address, possibly as a matter of urgency as the pandemic continues.  Anyone working in the Civil Service should have the same right to do their business with the State through Irish.  For example, the promotions process, the staff assessment process, internal correspondence for staff and so on should be made available in Irish for the Civil Service.  Employees should not be prohibited from using Irish in the workplace for no good reason.  This is an example of effective language planning in the wrong direction which needs to be banned if we are to increase the use of Irish in society.  Some issues have been raised with me about people in the hospitality industry who were reprimanded for use of the Irish language when engaging with customers, back when we had a hospitality industry.  That needs to be protected and enhanced, and anybody who engages with the language in their place of work should be protected.</p> <p> The commissioner and the public should be given a role relating to the enactment of the legislation, in line with the injunction mechanism under the planning Acts, given the strong public dimension relating to language legislation.  In the event that a public body refuses to comply with any provision of this Bill in accordance with any provision or regulations made pursuant to this Bill, the High Court may, at the request of the commissioner or any other person, whether or not that person has a particular interest in such default or refusal, require any public body, by order, to do anything in accordance with any provision of this legislation or in accordance with any provision in regulations made pursuant to the legislation, which is not, in the opinion of the court, necessary and specified in the order.</p> <p> As was already raised, the warning on alcoholic drinks should be given bilingually, as it is in other bilingual countries.  When this issue was raised in the past, it was noted that this may be in contravention to a European directive.  This would not actually be the case.  If one looks at cigarette packaging where the warnings are bilingual, those act as a template of how we could move this forward.</p> <p> As it is ensured that women and men are well-represented on State boards, there should certainly also be representation for Irish speakers on such boards.</p> <p> Irish should have equal status with English on Ireland's road signs.  This is done in Wales, Scotland and in other countries with more than one official language.  The current T&aacute;naiste, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, supported the recommendation.  No one is talking about changing the signs overnight, only as they need to be renewed or as new ones need to be supplied.  It should be taken into account that research conducted by Conradh na Gaeilge, with a report prepared by the expert, Garrett Reil, shows that the current road signage system is defective and dangerous, especially as drivers get older.  This presents an opportunity to change it and make it bilingual.</p> <p> Section 18B, which is inserted to the principal Act by section 6, on the Irish language services advisory committee, advises that only member is to be nominated by the Minister as a representative of a Gaeltacht area, yet the rest will represent Departments.  In my opinion and the opinion of those with whom I have engaged in this regard, this proposal acts as tokenism, even by typical Irish language community expectations, and to have it at the bottom of the list shows the communities that this consideration and planning is as if it is a task that needs to be done for its own sake and not for the benefit of any community or people.  Instead, there should be clear representation from at least three of the main Gaeltacht areas, including Donegal, Galway and Kerry, for example, and at least one of the four urban Gaeltacht and emerging communities.  I specifically refer to Clondalkin, which has done incredible work to promote its Gaeltacht in recent years.</p> <p> With regard to Gaeltacht service towns and Irish language networks, this Bill, despite its amendments, is too passive.  It places little or no obligation or incentive on public bodies to improve their capacity for bilingual services unless they happen to be in already vulnerable Gaeltacht zones.  To boost the language, these service towns must be encouraged further to become bilingual for the nearby Gaeltacht communities and local second language communities.</p> <p> The proposed new section 19C is a derogation from language standards.  It is open to abuse from bodies which may not wish to engage with any new language standards and seek instead to opt out through whichever excuse they may find.  There is an equal suspicion being shared with regard to the amendment of section 12 of the Juries Act 1976, which removes references to both languages and court summonses.  A question was asked about why that is being done but Deputy Chambers addressed that in his contribution.  I look forward to seeing that be catered for.</p> <p> I will leave my contribution there and look forward to engaging with the process as it continues.</p></speech>

T&aacute; imn&iacute; orm go f&oacute;ill toisc go bhfuil saghas get out clause f&aacute;gtha sa t&eacute;acs a thugann cumhacht athbhreithnithe don Aire sa bhliain 2028, ach is t&uacute;s maith &eacute; seo agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh uaillmhian ag an Roinn an sprioc seo a bhaint amach.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte freisin roimh an leas&uacute; a thugann n&iacute;os m&oacute; cumhachta don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ini&uacute;chadh a dh&eacute;anamh ar a thoil f&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  Is de&aacute; an rud &eacute; go gcuirfear seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it ar f&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht i nGaeilge, gan cheist agus gan choinne.  Ba ch&oacute;ir an coiste comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in a chuir le ch&eacute;ile chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir chun plean a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il maidir le conas a bhainfear &eacute; sin amach tr&iacute; sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge a fheabhs&uacute; agus a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom freisin go nd&eacute;anfar infheist&iacute;ocht sna bailte seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge, mar Dh&uacute;n Garbh&aacute;n, a fhreastala&iacute;onn ar Ghaeltacht na nD&eacute;ise i bPort L&aacute;irge.  T&aacute; iarratas amh&aacute;in agam maidir le d&eacute;ant&uacute;s an chomhchoiste.  Iarraim ar an Aire cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh ionada&iacute;ocht ag pobal na Gaeilge ar an gcoiste sin.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; gach baol ann agus muid ag caint faoin nGaeilge go dtitfimid isteach sa ghaiste d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta sin ina dtriailimid &iacute; a thuiscint tr&iacute; phriosma &aacute;r gc&oacute;ras eacnama&iacute;ochta.  Aithn&iacute;onn an c&oacute;ras sin praghas, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, agus brab&uacute;s cinnte, ach an aithn&iacute;onn s&eacute; luach rud?  T&aacute; s&eacute; sinn neamhchinnte.  T&aacute; a fhios againn mar Ghlasaigh go bhfuil difr&iacute;ocht idir praghas agus luach.  T&aacute; fi&uacute;ntas faoi leith ag baint, mar shampla, leis an mbith&eacute;ags&uacute;lacht thar aon mheas&uacute;n&uacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin mar an gc&eacute;anna le teangacha, agus an Ghaeilge ina measc.  Is lionsa &iacute; gach teanga, cruthaithe ag cult&uacute;r daoine na h&aacute;ite sin, a bh&iacute;onn m&oacute;r-thionchar aici ar &aacute;r radharc ar an domhan at&aacute; m&oacute;rthimpeall orainn.  Is linne an Ghaolainn agus is &iacute; &aacute;r bhfuinneog ar an saol.</p>  <p>  Labhair m&eacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute; anseo sa D&aacute;il faoin moladh a rinne an tUachtar&aacute;n Miche&aacute;l D. &Oacute; hUig&iacute;n agus &eacute; ag tabhairt &oacute;r&aacute;id don Tom Johnson Summer School leath sc&oacute;r bliain &oacute; shin.  An chomhairle a bh&iacute; aige n&aacute; go gcaithfimid f&iacute;s &uacute;t&oacute;ipeach a chur romhainn mar sprioc agus oibri&uacute; ansin ar a son.  Chomh maith le haon tuiscint eacnama&iacute;ochta a bhaineann leis an moladh sin, d&eacute;arfainn f&eacute;in mar Ghlasaigh go gcaithfidh aon mhachnamh ar an &aacute;bhar seo sl&aacute;inte na timpeallachta a thabhairt isteach.  D&eacute;arfainn freisin mar Ghael go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar chuid l&aacute;rnach d&rsquo;aon fh&iacute;s &uacute;t&oacute;ipeach a bheadh agam don t&iacute;r seo.  M&aacute;s sin an sprioc at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair amach, n&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn oibri&uacute; go tr&eacute;an chun an sprioc sin a bhaint amach.</p>  <p>  Is iad an gr&uacute;pa is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; do thodhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge na daoine a bhfuil stair na teanga iontu freisin, sin iad, muintir na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; br&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach ar &aacute;r gceantair Ghaeltachta faoi l&aacute;thair &oacute; thaobh fosta&iacute;ochta, tith&iacute;ochta agus cinnte &oacute; thaobh na teanga &iacute; f&eacute;in.  Aithn&iacute;tear go bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im teanga sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  T&aacute; obair den scoth &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag Foras na Gaeilge agus ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta go h&aacute;irithe chun infheist&iacute;ocht agus fhosta&iacute;ocht a mhealladh go dt&iacute; na d&uacute;ich&iacute;, ach t&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; taca&iacute;ochta ag teast&aacute;il &oacute;n Rialtas.  L&aacute;rnach san obair sin n&aacute; na coinn&iacute;ollacha teanga cearta a chur i bhfeidhm sna ceantair Ghaeltachta le bheith cinnte, agus tith&iacute;ocht &aacute; fhorbairt againn, go bhfuilimid ag freastal ar na riachtanais sa phobal, ach gan an Ghaeilge a scriosadh n&oacute; a chaol&uacute; mar theanga i mb&eacute;al na ndaoine ann. </p>  <p>  Is iad an dara gr&uacute;pa is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; dream na Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, daoine a bhfuil caighde&aacute;n ard Gaeilge acu agus gur mhaith leo maireacht&aacute;il tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, n&iacute; amh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach ar fud na t&iacute;re.  T&aacute; s&aacute;robair d&eacute;anta ag &aacute;r n-urlabhra&iacute; Gaeilge Peter Kavanagh agus a chairde leis an bhfeachtas Pop-up Gaeltacht, ach caithfear seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; an St&aacute;it a chur ar f&aacute;il go forleathan as Gaeilge chun freastal ar an bpobal sin.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh l&iacute;on na ndaoine at&aacute; ag &uacute;s&aacute;id an Ghaeilge mar a ngn&aacute;th teanga laeth&uacute;il a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;, is as an gcoh&oacute;rt seo a thiocfaidh siad.</p>  <p>  Deirtear gur t&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre.  Bhuel, caithfidh m&eacute; an obair at&aacute; sa Bhille seo a mholadh, agus an tAire, an tAire St&aacute;it agus an Roinn, a mholadh as ucht an obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta anseo.  N&iacute;l ann ach t&uacute;s ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh chun an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im teanga a leigheas, ach tugann s&eacute; leid agus misneach do lucht na Gaeilge go bhfuil f&iacute;s agus uaillmhian ag an Roinn dul chun cinn fi&uacute;ntach a dh&eacute;anamh sa tr&eacute;imhse Rialtais at&aacute; romhainn.  N&iacute; ach t&uacute;s &eacute;, ach t&uacute;s maith.  Molaim an Bille seo.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an mBille seo 17 bliain ar aghaidh &oacute;n Acht agus an sc&eacute;im a bh&iacute; ann &oacute; thaobh na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; i gceist go mbeadh a sc&eacute;im f&eacute;in ag gach eagra&iacute;ocht pobal.  Go minic, cuireadh sc&eacute;im amh&aacute;in ar f&aacute;il, d&rsquo;&eacute;ag s&eacute;, bh&iacute; s&eacute; imithe agus ansin n&iacute;or th&aacute;inig aon rud ina dhiaidh.  C&eacute; go raibh an feals&uacute;nacht dhearfach agus bheadh sol&uacute;bthacht ann do na heagrais faoi leith, is l&eacute;ir n&aacute;r oibrigh s&eacute; in ainneoin go raibh an dearcadh agus na haidhmeanna ceart ann.  T&aacute; an cur chuige anseo an-difri&uacute;il.  T&aacute;imid ag caint faoi chur chuige m&oacute;rthimpeall an St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s agus na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; pobal go l&eacute;ir.  C&eacute; go bhfuil gn&eacute;ithe dearfacha sa Bhille, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach agus is fadhb &eacute;, mar at&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite ag daoine cheana f&eacute;in, nach bhfuil d&aacute;ta&iacute; againn do na spriocanna seo.  Caithfear nach bhfuil siad mar aspiration, gur f&eacute;idir iad a bhaint amach agus go mbeidh cur chuige agus tiom&aacute;int ann i dtreo iad a bhaint amach.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; ann &oacute; thaobh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-t&aacute;bhachtach.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l sampla&iacute; againn de na dr&eacute;acht-chaighde&aacute;in a bheidh ag teast&aacute;il do ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach freisin.  I gcoitinne, nuair a labhra&iacute;mid faoin nGaeilge deir daoine go bhfuil &aacute;bhar imn&iacute; agus &aacute;bhar d&oacute;chais ann.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; chomh simpl&iacute; le r&aacute; go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is ach n&iacute;l s&iacute; ag borradh ach an oiread.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge in&aacute;r gcathracha agus t&aacute; an-&aacute;bhar d&oacute;chais ansin.  Feicimid na deiseanna at&aacute; &aacute; cruth&uacute; tr&iacute;d eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; ar n&oacute;s na Gaeil &Oacute;ga agus Laochra Loch Lao, na Pop-up Gaeltachta&iacute; agus mar sin de.  Caithfidh an Roinn tac&uacute; leo sin agus t&aacute; r&oacute;l ag an mBille seo tac&uacute; leis na deiseanna cainte do dhaoine a thagann amach as na Gaelscoileanna nach cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais iad.  Caithfear na deiseanna sin a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach mar i go leor slite n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn na deiseanna acu c&eacute; go mb&iacute;onn an fonn orthu an teanga a labhairt.  T&aacute; an fonn acu ach n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn an deis acu ina ngn&aacute;th saoil.</p>  <p>  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil an-fhadhb againn sa Ghaeltacht agus n&iacute; rud beag &eacute; sin ar chor ar bith.  Is &iacute; an Ghaeltacht an &aacute;it at&aacute; ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar an teanga labhartha.  T&aacute; saibhreas na teanga ansin agus is saghas tobar &iacute; don teanga ar fud an St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go dtuigimid d&iacute;reach conas tac&uacute; leis na pobail sin agus d&eacute;anadh cinnte go bhfuil Gaeilge ag na daoine at&aacute; ag lonn&uacute; ann n&oacute; go bhfuil siad chun &iacute; a fhoghlaim agus a labhairt agus gur f&eacute;idir leo seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it a bhaint amach.</p>  <p>  Teasta&iacute;onn spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; sonra&iacute; &oacute; thaobh conas go gcuirtear for&aacute;lacha na reachta&iacute;ochta i bhfeidhm.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach chun feabhas a chur ar an mBille seo.  C&eacute; go raibh aidhm mhaith ag an mBille 2003, is l&eacute;ir n&aacute;r oibrigh s&eacute; mar a bh&iacute; &aacute; s&uacute;il leis.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ir&iacute;onn n&iacute;os fearr leis an mBille seo ach caithfidh s&eacute; a bheith n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre agus n&iacute;os daingne.  </p></speech>

As I have the opportunity, I wish to raise an issue unrelated to this Bill with the Minister and the Minister of State.  I refer to the lack of a Gaelscoil in the postal districts of Dublin 10 and 12.  I acknowledge that this is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills but support from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would help progress the achievement of some educational facilities in these very big postal districts which include areas like Ballyfermot, Cherry Orchard, Walkinstown, Drimnagh, Crumlin.  T&aacute; siad gan aon Ghaelscoil &ndash; not a me&aacute;nscoil or a bunscoil in any of those areas.  We managed to get a na&iacute;onra in Ballyfermot with the help of our local councillor Hazel De Nort&uacute;in over the last few years but there is a need for a Gaelscoil in these big working class areas, and there is a very deep desire among parents and young people to learn and become prolific in their own language.  There is a gr&aacute; for it and an absolute need for it.  We will be leaning on the Minister for her support in campaigning for a Gaelscoil in both Dublin 10 and Dublin 12.</p>  <p>  Maidir leis an mBille, mar a d&uacute;irt Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la eile, molaim go leagtar amach spriocdh&aacute;ta cinnte le go mbeadh 20% de dhaoine nua a thagann isteach sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras in ann a ngn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  M&aacute; mholann an Rialtas an bhliain 2030 mar spriocdh&aacute;ta, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh spriocanna gearrth&eacute;armach socraithe freisin agus go nd&eacute;antar athbhreithni&uacute; gach dara bliain chun cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil na spriocanna &aacute; baint amach.  Is g&aacute; go dt&eacute;ann gr&uacute;pa neamhsple&aacute;ch i mbun na hathbhreithnithe seo.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an gcoiste comhairleach at&aacute; molta chun faire ar earca&iacute;ocht don St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  T&aacute; locht m&oacute;r ag baint leis an leagan amach at&aacute; molta ag an Rialtas, &aacute;fach.  N&iacute;l aon r&oacute;l luaite ann d&rsquo;ionadaithe &oacute; phobal na Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus n&iacute; bheidh guth acu ar an gcoiste seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin m&iacute;cheart agus n&iacute;l an de&aacute;-chleachtas c&eacute;anna i gceist anseo a bhaineann le r&eacute;ims&iacute; eile sa saol.  Mar shampla, n&iacute; bheadh an Teach seo s&aacute;sta f&oacute;ram a bhun&uacute; do dhaoine faoi mh&iacute;chumas gan ionada&iacute; a bheith ann &oacute;n earn&aacute;il sin.  Molaim ionada&iacute; a bheith ar an gcoiste seo &oacute; ghr&uacute;pa stocaireachta Gaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh gach seirbh&iacute;s a chuireann an St&aacute;t ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeltachta ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Is g&aacute; spriocdh&aacute;ta cinnte a luaigh d&oacute; sin mar chuid den Bhille seo freisin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it curtha ar f&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht f&eacute;in agus mura bhfuil f&oacute;s, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; f&eacute;in curtha ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge. </p> <p>Mura dtarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo, cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; go bhfuil D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann ag r&aacute; le pobal na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil t&aacute;bhacht leis an teanga.<br/><br/>Molaim go mbeadh sa Bhille breis cumhachta&iacute; tugtha don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ionas go mbeadh s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; in ann r&eacute;amh-scr&uacute;d&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar aon reachta&iacute;ocht nua chun a chinnti&uacute; nach nd&eacute;anann s&eacute; dochar don Ghaeilge n&oacute; don Ghaeltacht.  Bheidh an m&eacute;id seo ag teacht leis an dea-chleachtas idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.<br/><br/>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt do gach &eacute;inne a dhein obair chrua ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil siad d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoina gcuid polait&iacute;ocht.  T&aacute; seans ollmh&oacute;r acu anois difear ollmh&oacute;r a dh&eacute;anamh ar &aacute;bhar at&aacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach don t&iacute;r seo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag smaoineamh ar an teach a bh&iacute; ag an Rathailleach, a leagadh c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin.  Cos&uacute;il leis an nGaeilge, bh&iacute; an teach ina sheasamh.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge f&oacute;s ag seasamh sa t&iacute;r seo.  Leagadh an teach sin.  Mar a deireann an f&oacute;gra a bh&iacute;onn ar an teilif&iacute;s, nuair at&aacute; s&eacute; leagtha t&aacute; s&eacute; imithe.  I gc&aacute;s na Gaeilge, nuair a bheidh s&iacute; imithe mar theanga phobail sa Ghaeltacht, beidh s&iacute; imithe i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  T&aacute; s&eacute; go hiontach ar fad go bhfuil nascanna f&oacute;s ann timpeall na t&iacute;re mar gheall ar an nGaeilge - labhra&iacute;onn daoine ar fud na t&iacute;re an Ghaeilge l&aacute; i ndiaidh lae - ach is &eacute; bun agus barr an sc&eacute;il n&aacute; nach mbeidh todhcha&iacute; dhomhain shaibhir ag an teanga as seo amach muna bhfuil s&iacute; mar theanga labhartha phobail sa Ghaeltacht.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge t&aacute;bhachtach agus luachmhar do mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann toisc gur chuid bhun&uacute;sach d&iacute;nn &iacute;.  Ceangla&iacute;onn s&iacute; len&aacute;r dtimpeallacht muid.

Strucht&uacute;r smaointe at&aacute; sa teanga, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, freisin.  Ag an tr&aacute;th seo, nuair a chailltear &eacute;ags&uacute;lacht teanga ar bhonn bliant&uacute;il, is uath&uacute;il an teanga &iacute;.  Tuigim go mb&iacute;onn na Glasaigh ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar bhith&eacute;ags&uacute;lacht ar fud na cruinne, ach meabhra&iacute;m d&oacute;ibh go bhfuil teangacha ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is l&aacute; i ndiaidh lae ar fud an domhain freisin.  Is saghas st&oacute;r iontach de chult&uacute;r na h&Eacute;ireann &iacute; an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; an teanga cos&uacute;il le doras - nuair a oscla&iacute;tear &eacute;, b&iacute;onn an seomra l&aacute;n de ruda&iacute; iontacha cult&uacute;rtha.  Is f&eacute;idir le daoine le Gaeilge an doras sin a oscailt.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge uaf&aacute;sach t&aacute;bhachtach mar theanga theaghlaigh, mar theanga ghn&oacute;, mar theanga chairdis agus mar theanga oideachais.  Is f&iacute;ortheanga &iacute; an Ghaeilge.</p>  <p>  Is am cinni&uacute;nach &eacute; an t-am seo, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil s&eacute; sin r&aacute;ite le fada an l&aacute;.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt sa t&iacute;r seo le beagnach 2,000 bliain.  T&aacute; seans d&iacute;reach ann gur muidne an ghl&uacute;in dheireanach ina mbeidh an Ghaeilge againn mar theanga phobail.  Nuair a dh&eacute;antar compar&aacute;id idir l&iacute;on na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; dt&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge i measc na teaghlaigh ar fud na t&iacute;re agus l&iacute;on na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; ag freastal ar bhunscoileanna sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil go bhfuil an c&oacute;imheas sin an-&iacute;seal anois, go h&aacute;irithe i gcompar&aacute;id leis na blianta roimhe seo.</p>  <p>  Caithfimid ruda&iacute; l&aacute;idre agus cr&oacute;ga a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ghaeilge a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il agus a fh&aacute;s sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; m&eacute; l&aacute;ncinnte gur f&eacute;idir linn &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh, agus go dtiocfaidh borradh ar an nGaeilge m&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoi.  Caithfimid bheith d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin teanga.  Muna bhfuilimid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re, d&eacute;anfaimid an praiseach ch&eacute;anna is a rinne an Rialtas deireanach agus na Rialtais roimhe sin le fada an l&aacute;.  N&iacute;or thug go leor Rialtais n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; lip service don Ghaeilge.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil ruda&iacute; imithe chun donais.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh fianaise a fheice&aacute;il sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin, is f&eacute;idir linn breathn&uacute; isteach ar an mh&eacute;id airgid at&aacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il don Roinn thar na blianta.  Ceapaim gurb &eacute; Roinn na Gaeltachta an t-aon Roinn sa Rialtas nach bhfuil tar &eacute;is an leibh&eacute;al a bh&iacute; acu in 2009 n&oacute; 2010 a bhaint amach ar&iacute;s.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go raibh titim n&iacute;os m&oacute; i Roinn na Gaeltachta n&aacute; aon Roinn ar bith eile.  Mar is eol d&uacute;inn, t&aacute; s&eacute; mar dhualgas ar &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta mar eagra&iacute;ocht fiontra&iacute;ocht a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht.  Th&aacute;inig titim uaf&aacute;sach ar an mh&eacute;id airgid a fhaigheann an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  N&iacute;l maoini&uacute; an &Uacute;dar&aacute;is ar ais go dt&iacute; leibh&eacute;al 2009 n&oacute; 2010 go f&oacute;ill.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; g&aacute; ann c&uacute;pla rud a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ghaeilge a neart&uacute; sa t&iacute;r seo.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil c&uacute;ig ruda&iacute; th&aacute;bhachtacha i gceist.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba cheart don Rialtas cabhair a thabhairt do theaghlaigh a gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge.  Is &iacute; sin an tsl&iacute; is furasta chun an Ghaeilge a thabhairt don ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile.  N&iacute;l aon sl&iacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca n&aacute; an bealach a r&eacute;iteach do theaghlaigh a gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  Ar an dara dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute; rochtain Ghaelscola&iacute;ochta uaf&aacute;sach t&aacute;bhachtach freisin.  Bliain i ndiaidh bliana, l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn pobalbhreitheanna go bhfuil 25% de dhaoine na t&iacute;re seo ag iarraidh go rachaidh a gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; isteach sna Gaelscoileanna.  C&eacute;n c&eacute;atad&aacute;n de ph&aacute;ist&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo a fhreastala&iacute;onn ar Ghaelscoileanna, &aacute;fach?  N&iacute; fhreastala&iacute;onn ach 5% de ph&aacute;ist&iacute; ar Ghaelscoileanna - is &iacute; sin an mh&eacute;id - c&eacute; go bhfuil 25% de thuismitheoir&iacute; ag iarraidh Gaelscola&iacute;ocht d&aacute; bp&aacute;ist&iacute;.  Deirtear uaireanta ar na me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide go bhfuil an Rialtas ag br&uacute; na Gaeilge s&iacute;os scornacha na ndaoine, ach caithfear a r&aacute; go bhfuil a mhalairt f&iacute;or.  T&aacute; tuismitheoir&iacute; agus p&aacute;ist&iacute; ag iarraidh freastal ar Ghaelscoileanna.  T&aacute; daoine ag iarraidh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &oacute;n St&aacute;t tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, ach n&iacute;l na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sin le f&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Ar an tr&iacute;&uacute; dul s&iacute;os, ba cheart go mbeadh daoine in ann dul i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an St&aacute;t ina theanga f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; an Rialtas seo ag r&aacute; le p&aacute;ist&iacute; go gcaithfidh siad an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim le haghaidh dosaen bhliain nuair at&aacute; siad &oacute;g.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna, t&aacute; lucht an Rialtais ag r&aacute; leo gan bheith ag teacht isteach agus bagairt a chur orthu mar gheall ar an nGaeilge - gan bheith ag labhairt leo mar gheall ar an nGaeilge - nuair at&aacute; a gcuid scola&iacute;ochta cr&iacute;ochnaithe acu.  Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; gur dhein m&eacute; iarracht ar feadh c&uacute;ig n&oacute; s&eacute; bliana an Ghaeilge a roghn&uacute; mar theanga seirbh&iacute;se nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an St&aacute;t.  Nuair a bh&iacute;odh m&eacute; i dteagmh&aacute;il leis na Coimisin&eacute;ir&iacute; Ioncaim, an Roinn Sl&aacute;inte n&oacute; aon Roinn n&oacute; rann&oacute;g St&aacute;it eile, bhr&uacute;fainn an cnaipe le haghaidh na seirbh&iacute;se Gaeilge ach n&iacute; bheadh &eacute;inne ar f&aacute;il.  Saghas doras dra&iacute;ochta at&aacute; i gceist, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Is f&eacute;idir linn br&uacute; ar an doras, c&eacute; go bhfuil an seomra folamh, agus t&aacute; seans ann go dtiocfaidh duine &eacute;igin ar ais i gceann tr&iacute; l&aacute;.  M&aacute; thagann an glaoch ar an tr&iacute;&uacute; l&aacute; agus m&aacute; iarrtar orainn c&eacute;ard at&aacute; &aacute; lorg againn, is f&eacute;idir linn a r&aacute; go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh seirbh&iacute;s X, seirbh&iacute;s Y n&oacute; seirbh&iacute;s Z ach go hiond&uacute;il deirtear linn ag an bpointe sin go gcaithfimid fanacht dh&aacute; n&oacute; tr&iacute; l&aacute; eile, agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeifear in ann seirbh&iacute;s tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a shol&aacute;thar ag an bpointe sin.  Nuair a tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin ar&iacute;s is ar&iacute;s eile, stopann daoine ag roghn&uacute; an rogha Gaeilge.  Muna bhfuil an St&aacute;t s&aacute;sta &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh go huileghabh&aacute;lach, n&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;idfidh daoine an tseirbh&iacute;s teoranta seo.</p>  <p>  Is &iacute; an tsl&iacute; is &eacute;asca chun an fadhb seo a r&eacute;iteach n&aacute; daoine le Gaeilge a earc&uacute; ionas go mbeid&iacute;s in ann seirbh&iacute;s a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; Ghaeilge n&oacute; tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla.  T&aacute; muidne ag troid le haghaidh deich mbliana, b'fh&eacute;idir, agus muid ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas c&oacute;ras earca&iacute;ochta den chine&aacute;l seo a chur ar bun.  Nuair a earca&iacute;tear comhr&eacute;ir le Gaeilge, n&iacute;l aon chostas sa bhreis ag baint leis an tseirbh&iacute;s a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Dia go bhfuil a leith&eacute;id d'fhor&aacute;il sa Bhille seo i ndeireadh thiar thall.  C&eacute; go molaim an seasamh n&iacute;os tr&eacute;ine at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha ag an Aire agus a comhghleacaithe chun &eacute; sin a chur sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo, caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil get-out clause f&oacute;s ann.  Beidh cib&eacute; Aire a bheidh ann i gceann ocht mbliana in ann a r&aacute; nach bhfuil an St&aacute;t r&eacute;idh chun an ch&eacute;im seo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.  Ar an mbonn sin, beidh Aire na linne sin in ann teacht siar &oacute;n ngeall&uacute;int sin go mbeidh an chomhr&eacute;ir bainte amach.  I mo thuairim, beag beann ar p&eacute; Aire a bheidh ann sa bhliain 2028, n&iacute; bheidh s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; an duine is fearr chun an cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ba cheart go mbeidh daoine eile at&aacute; bainteach leis an earn&aacute;il seo ar f&aacute;il leis an r&oacute;l sin a chomhl&iacute;onadh.</p>  <p>  Ar an gceathr&uacute; dul s&iacute;os, ba cheart d&uacute;inn b&eacute;im a chur ar fhosta&iacute;ocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Muna bhfuil daoine in ann obair a fh&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht, imeoidh siad.  Is &eacute; sin sc&eacute;al na Gaeltachta le fada an l&aacute;.  Caithfidh go mbeidh s&eacute; ar chumas muintir na Gaeltachta obair mhaith a fh&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht, ach n&iacute; mar sin at&aacute; s&eacute; i go leor Gaeltachta&iacute; ag an bomaite.</p>  <p>  Ar an gc&uacute;igi&uacute; dul s&iacute;os, is rud simpl&iacute; &eacute; st&aacute;das na Gaeilge.  Mar Dh&aacute;il agus mar St&aacute;t, caithfimid tosa&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  N&iacute; chosna&iacute;onn s&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n airgid, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Nuair a fhoghlaim&iacute;onn daoine sa bhaile gur &uacute;s&aacute;ideadh Google Translate chun Gaeilge a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id na ndaoine i gcomhth&eacute;acs f&iacute;se&aacute;n &oacute;n Rialtas n&oacute; tvu&iacute;t &oacute;n Aire, tuigeann siad nach bhfuil meas ar an nGaeilge n&oacute; st&aacute;das ag an nGaeilge.  Tuigeann siad gur rud imeallach at&aacute; sa teanga, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil titim ag teacht ar st&aacute;das na Gaeilge anseo i dTeach Laighean agus ar fud an St&aacute;it.  Nuair a labhair m&eacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute; le daoine a bh&iacute; ag iarraidh teacht os comhair an Chomhchoiste um na Me&aacute;in, Turas&oacute;ireacht, Eala&iacute;ona, Cult&uacute;r, Sp&oacute;rt agus Gaeltacht, d&uacute;irt siad liom n&aacute;r fh&eacute;idir leo a gcuid gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh leis an gCathaoirleach nua ar an gcoiste sin os rud &eacute; nach bhfuil Gaeilge aici.  Is sampla eile &eacute; sin den easpa measa at&aacute; i gceist anseo.</p>  <p>  Tuigim go bhfuil an t-am ag sleamhn&uacute; uaim, ach ba mhaith liom rud n&oacute; dh&oacute; eile a r&aacute;.  Cathain a bheidh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeltachta i nGaeilge?  An bhfuil spriocdh&aacute;ta daingean ag an Rialtas mar gheall ar an tseirbh&iacute;s sin?  Cathain a bheidh duine sa Ghaeltacht at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh iarracht a chlann a th&oacute;g&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge cinnte go bhfuil s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; in ann gach seirbh&iacute;s a bhaineann leis an St&aacute;t a fh&aacute;il i nGaeilge?  Sa Bhreatain Bheag, t&eacute;ann gach Bille os comhair coimisin&eacute;ir teanga na t&iacute;re sin sula th&eacute;ann s&eacute; tr&iacute; Chomhthion&oacute;l na Breataine Bige.  Ba cheart go mbeadh a leith&eacute;id d'fhor&aacute;il sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  D&aacute; mbeadh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in ann f&eacute;achaint ar na fadhbanna reachta&iacute;ochta roimh r&eacute;, n&iacute; tharl&oacute;dh na deacrachta&iacute; seo i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire.</p></speech>

I recently shared a post on social media not because this debate was coming up but, rather, because it struck a chord with me.  The post in question was probably not written with Ireland in mind but it speaks to a hard truth and the responsibility on present and future Irish generations to act.  The post I circulated states:</p> <blockquote> 	Speak your native language to your children or watch it die within the next 20 years!  Looking down on your relatives or friends who speak your native tongue because you speak perfect English is stupid - it is like being proud of borrowed clothes! </blockquote>  <p>As we contemplate Brexit and the need for our exporters to look to new market opportunities on the European mainland and beyond, we rarely consider language to be a significant barrier.  We have come to expect that customers in those countries will have a reasonable proficiency in speaking English.  It rarely impacts on our thought processes that English is not their mother tongue but, rather, was taught to them as part of their early school learning.  How is it that so many people from Finland, Germany, Holland and Sweden to name but a few can engage in conversation in English, often flawlessly, despite it being a second language for them?  Many of them also speak a third language with equal ability.  How is it that even though our children begin learning Irish from national school age and on into secondary school, so many pupils graduate without the ability to carry on even an informal conversation in Irish after 14 years of education?  Many students who decide to opt for another language in secondary school, such as French, German or Spanish, leave school with far greater proficiency in that language after five or six years of study than they have in Irish, which they have been taught for 14 years.  As part of new technology sector developments, Irish students are being encouraged to learn Chinese.  It is a sad fact that many of those who do so will develop greater ability to communicate in that language than in their cultural mother tongue.</p><p>I accept that the aspiration of the Bill is to increase access for those who wish to engage with public sector services through the medium of Irish.  I acknowledge that implementation of the steps contained in the Bill may be a positive development in improving frequency and some fluency in Irish-language usage in public service communications, but those steps alone will not be enough to secure Gaeilge as a contemporary used language in Ireland into the future.  In our current battle with Covid, there may be consideration of a circuit breaker announcement, that being a deliberate step-change initiated by the Government and designed to completely reset the parameters of dealing with Covid transmission in this country.  If we are serious about preserving this mother tongue, such an action is now required to reset and redefine our national attitude and the value we place on our national language.</p><p>As Irish people, we often take pride in the international recognition of our venerated names, our culture and our traditions, yet we often fail to associate that cultural development with the Irish language or acknowledge that it was largely communicated and facilitated through the medium of our Gaelic language.  Our inability to secure Irish as a working requisite language in this country is because of its deliberate downgrading within the outlines of what constitutes national identity and its modern dissociation with brand Ireland.  In the Ireland of 2020, a large proportion of citizens speak English as their mother tongue.  We consider ourselves intrinsically different from the rest of Europe even though many of us cannot carry on a conversation in the language of our forebears.  Such a situation would be laughed at in France, Germany, Finland, Sweden and many other countries I could mention.  Our country requires an Irish language circuit breaker moment.  Although the Bill is welcome, it will not provide such a moment.</p><p>To preserve Irish as a working language, we need a new national debate on how we value the language, the way in which it is taught in our schools and how we can integrate it into daily use so as to defend our Gaelic culture and traditions and so that we can message widely that we continue to retain a unique history, perspective and identity.  In truth, to achieve such a goal, the Government might need to announce legislation outlawing and custodial sentences penalising the teaching or speaking of Irish, in light of the fact that throughout our long history it has often been the case that we only value something when there is a threat that others may take it away.</p><p>As an interim step in securing the use of our native language, I welcome the Bill.  I see it as a bulwark to the erosion and loss of our ability to converse in our mother tongue.  The Bill provides for an objective of 20% of recruits to the public service being competent in Irish, which I welcome.  It also provides for the introduction of language standards in place of language schemes, a national plan for the provision of Irish language services and the adaption of public bodies' ICT systems to accommodate the representation of a person's name as Gaeilge.  I welcome the proposed establishment of an Irish language services advisory committee to oversee the drafting of a national plan for the provision of public services through Irish, which will set strategies for public bodies to increase the provision of services through Irish and increase the number of staff who are competent in Irish.  However, I question the fact that there is to be only one member nominated by the Minister as a representative of the Gaeltacht area.  That is hardly the level of representation our Irish language speakers need and it does not convey to me the appropriate level of engagement or commitment by the Government to the issue of Irish people being able to communicate effectively as Gaeilge with public institutions and with one another.</p><p>As Ireland moves to being a more multicultural society, we must embrace the challenges that brings, but also capitalise on the opportunities. We have a unique and proud history, unparalleled impact on world affairs given our small size and a diaspora that spans the globe and is counted in millions.  Our Irish language is a natural resource unique in the world, a resource that we have cultivated like our landscape.  We must honour and protect it but in order to do so, we must use it.  In using it, we must emphasise that it is the unique characteristic that an Irish person can carry abroad as a beacon of nationality and use at home as an anchor to a proud and cultured tradition.  T&iacute;r gan teanga, t&iacute;r gan anam.</p></speech>

I am not one of those who has any fluency in our native tongue and I regret that.  Like many others, I am a product of an education system which did not help me to get a grasp of Gaeilge.  I would love to be speaking as Gaeilge and am committed to learning and using the c&uacute;pla focal inside and outside the House.</p>  <p>  In my county, there are two small Gaeltacht areas, namely, R&aacute;th Chairn and Baile Ghib.  People were relocated to those areas from the western seaboard between 1935 and 1937, leaving their humble abodes to head to county Meath under a resettlement scheme undertaken by the Irish Land Commission.  Like every other Gaeltacht, the very survival of those areas is threatened because of a lack of investment in local jobs, education and the protections that would have allowed them to thrive and be a beacon of the revival of Gaeilge and living as Gaeilge from cradle to grave.</p>  <p>  There is a need for additional funding for Foras na Gaeilge, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, TG4 and Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;.  I have met those groups and they have asked that they be adequately resourced such that they can properly implement, assist and plan in conjunction with the 80 Irish-language and Gaeltacht groups that currently exist.  Children from disadvantaged areas do not have the option to attend a summer college in the Gaeltacht as the fees are so high.  Will the Minister consider bringing in a scholarship scheme such as that recommended in the investment plan by the 80 Irish-language and Gaeltacht groups in order that such students have the option of attending summer college in the Gaeltacht?</p>  <p>  It is good that the Bill is before the House because it is an acknowledgement of the failure of the State to deliver its services bilingually nationwide and as Gaeilge in Gaeltachta&iacute; such as Baile Ghib and R&aacute;th Chairn.  There are wonderful people there who are tireless warriors for their community.  I invite the Minister to visit the area.  The Comharchumann R&aacute;th Chairn would be more than willing to give her a tour if she has not been there previously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-08a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100800032#GG00300"><p>The Irish language has been spoken on this island since some time in the first millennium BC.  It was the primary vernacular until the late 18th century but then experienced a collapse in its population of native speakers, particularly in the second half of the 19th century.  Support for the use of the Irish language has consistently been a stated aim of the State since its establishment.</p> <p>However, the most recent research makes it clear that on current trends, use of the Irish language as the primary community language, that is, the normal language of discourse in the range of everyday interaction settings in the Gaeltacht, will not continue beyond 2025.  By contrast, there has been a consistent growth in the number of Irish speakers in the State overall.  However, despite this growth, the population of active speakers, daily and weekly speakers outside the education system and outside the Gaeltacht, has not reached what might be regarded as a relatively significant population density, being less than 5% in all but a small number of electoral districts.</p> <p> Based on a range of surveys conducted over recent years, support for the Irish language retains broad public support.  It also enjoys significant constitutional protection as the national and first official language, as well as having become a working language in the European Union in 2007.  The United Nations has recognised language rights as a component of human rights.  Finally, evidence of the potential benefits of bilingualism have been growing since the 1960s.  An increasing body of research suggests that bilingual populations may enjoy significant cognitive and health advantages over monolingual ones.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that this Bill is finally coming before the D&aacute;il.  It is long overdue.  The Official Languages (Amendment) Bill is an important element of development and sustaining a stronger and more fit-for-purpose language Act.</p> <p> Three areas must be delivered as part of this Bill.  The fragile state of Irish in Gaeltacht areas is evident in the census results and in various pieces of research in recent years.  It is, therefore, vital that the provisions of public services through Irish in the Gaeltacht is placed on a statutory footing and that the language rights of the Gaeltacht community should be underpinned by the legislation.  Unfortunately, at this stage, the Bill appears to contain no firm provisions placing a duty upon the State to ensure that the Gaeltacht community is served in its native language.  This is a point which has been highlighted repeatedly by the Irish Language Commissioner.</p> <p> I support the recommendation that a national statutory plan for the provision of public services through Irish be prepared and that new recruitment policies and practices should be an integral part of this plan.  However, I am concerned that external experts and the public are not adequately represented on the advisory committee to be established under the amended Act to prepare the implementation plan.  I am also concerned that there is no stated deadline for the publication of the plan and that there is no statutory obligation to implement any agreed plan.</p> <p> One of the main provisions of the Bill is the proposal to replace the language schemes system with a system of language standards.  This is a worthwhile proposal, but it is difficult to judge the possible impact of this change without sight of the draft standards.  I believe that the timely production of these draft standards would greatly benefit the process of assessing the Bill.  Can the Minister of State clarify today whether these draft standards have, in fact, been published, as I have been unable to obtain them to date?</p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to mention Cape Clear Island, one of the eight islands in my constituency in west Cork.  They have been speaking fluent Irish and promoting the Irish language on the island for many years.  I commend each and every person on Cape Clear who, I suppose, has gone against the trend.  It has been a massive promotion for tourism in the area, with people attending courses and whatever there.  In fairness to the people of Cape Clear, they have made such a Trojan effort to keep the Irish language alive.  It is an eye-opener for the rest of the constituency in Cork South-West and something that I commend greatly.  I commend each and every person on that island for doing so.</p></speech>

In fact, my grandmother did not have any English.  Caisle&aacute;n Nua was a breac-Ghaeltacht area up until 1957.  For the record, I happened to be born in 1958.  I did not have the privilege of knowing my grandmother.</p>  <p>  That was the spirit in the foothills of the Knockmealdowns and, indeed, the Comeraghs.  It was an &aacute;it &aacute;lainn.  It is still an &aacute;it an-&aacute;lainn ar fad for people to come and visit and see.  Many activities are carried out there tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</p>  <p>  I salute Helen Nic Craith, Catherine McCarra and c&uacute;pla duine eile.  Thosa&iacute;omar Na&iacute;onra Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Si&uacute;ire 20 bliain &oacute; shin and it is a wonderful success.  It is wonderful to see na dalta&iacute;.  They are preschool.  Barely out of the cot, they go into that school.  It caters for after-school and before school and indeed, the bigger children at&aacute; ag dul ar an scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta tar &eacute;is an na&iacute;onra freisin.  I note the way that they can pick up the Irish and their grasp of it, and the fun-loving way that the m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; sa na&iacute;onra sin are running it and the love that they have, above all, for the children, but also for the language, the heritage or d&uacute;chas.  It is tremendous.  There are many na&iacute;onra&iacute; throughout the country.  It is a great way of re-energising our teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  It is very important.  We can have all the strategies in the world but if we do not use it, we will lose it.  We have to adopt some kind of a strategy of use it or lose it.</p>  <p>  Thosa&iacute;omar col&aacute;iste samhraidh Caisle&aacute;n Nua 20 bliain &oacute; shin freisin and that went very well for 12 years.  It was through the medium of Irish again, and fun.  One would not be sent home from the Gaeltacht.  There were many counts of dalta&iacute;, maybe dalta&iacute; m&oacute;r agus dalta&iacute; d&aacute;na perhaps, sent home from the Gaeltachta&iacute; that we knew of in different parts of the country, such as Corca Dhuibhne.  We did this through the medium of fun and it was very successful.  I salute the late Delia Egan, who was a founder member - bh&iacute; m&eacute; ann freisin - Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Slatara and George de Barra, Catherine McCarra agus daoine mar sin as ucht an obair stairi&uacute;il a rinneadar.  It was very successful.  Th&aacute;inig na dalta&iacute; &oacute; Thiobraid &Aacute;rann, Port L&aacute;irge agus a l&aacute;n &aacute;iteanna eile, agus chuid acu &oacute; Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus &aacute;iteanna mar sin.  When we had the breac-Ghaeltacht up until 1957, it was an industry as well and it supplemented the incomes of the ordinary people who took in the dalta&iacute; or students.</p>  <p>  I salute former Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, agus a bhean ch&eacute;ile.  D&uacute;irt Labhr&aacute;s ar "The Late Late Show" o&iacute;che amh&aacute;in gur fhoghlaim s&eacute; a chuid Gaeilge i gCaisle&aacute;n Nua.  He always says that he is proud he learned it in Caisle&aacute;n Nua.</p>  <p>  Is m&oacute;r an trua nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go fl&uacute;irseach agam anois ach t&aacute; m&eacute; chun &eacute; a thos&uacute; ar&iacute;s.</p>  <p>  I salute the families who took in the students in those days.  I remember meeting some of them in later years and hearing the fond memories they had.  They stayed in lodgings or "digs", and they got a fine country dinner.  Often they went out and gave a hand picking the spuds at this time of year with the farmers.  They got a feeling for the culture, our cluich&iacute; freisin, ar n&oacute;s peile agus iom&aacute;na&iacute;ochta, and, above all, our d&uacute;chas.  They loved that.  That friendship has held up with those people.  T&aacute; siad i Sasana agus a l&aacute;n &aacute;iteanna ar fud an domhain.  That relationship or connectivity is still there.</p>  <p>  Now we have a community policing unit in Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh anois, in Cahir Garda station, under the guidance of Sergeant Ray Moloney and Superintendent Denis Whelan and the team there.  Not only are they involved in the community and doing a wonderful job at this time of difficulties with Covid, and visiting the people, re-energising in this new level 3 and ready for whatever else might come, but Sergeant Moloney gives comhr&aacute; cois tine in Cahir House Hotel, Tigh &Oacute;st&aacute;n Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh, gach o&iacute;che Luain.  There are a number of people there, such as Gavin Berry, an m&uacute;inteoir.  As the people are coming in, they are finding it an tsl&iacute; ceart chun an Gaeilge a fhoghlaim.  It is a nice, soft, simple way of learning and picking up the Irish, transgressing it with English and, indeed, linking it to the logainmneacha.  These placenames are very important.  All those old placenames are oozing with our culture.  They are oozing with our heritage.  Fr. Christy O'Dwyer from Cashel, a renowned hurler for Tipperary fad&oacute;, gave me a valuable masterpiece including all the old seanfhocail as Gaeilge agus as B&eacute;arla.  It is a wonderful historical reservoir and I must learn much more from it.</p> <p>However, I thank Fr. Christy and wish him well in his retirement from Cashel.  Christy O'Dwyer was a renowned hurler for Tipperary fad&oacute; fad&oacute;.</p> <p> Sergeant Ray Moloney and the team there, and my own in&iacute;on, M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath, get a lot of fun from this engagement every Monday night and they look forward to going back as soon as the cloud that hangs over our communities is gone.  That is the way to do it.  There should be more of that strategy in that area.  N&iacute; neart go cur le daoine.  Na daoine &oacute;ga sa na&iacute;onra.</p> <p> People might not realise but the m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; in the national schools have a huge part to play.  There have been many famous m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; thar na blianta and many people learned it from them.  When I went to school, bh&iacute; m&eacute; i mo bhuachaill d&aacute;na i gc&oacute;na&iacute; agus n&iacute;or fhoghlaim m&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge.  Deputy Shanahan mentioned that if Irish was banned we would all be speaking it, I have often said so myself.  We are a wonderful country for resisting rules and regulations.  We must pay more attention to it.  </p> <p> While I welcome this strategy, there are a lot of gaps in it.  We have Foras na Gaeilge, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, CCE, agus Gl&oacute;r na nGael freisin.  CCE is a wonderful organisation facilitating song and dance, amhr&aacute;na&iacute;ocht, seanfhocail, rince sean-n&oacute;s and all the wonderful parts of our heritage and culture.  The sessions are often completely through Irish and they are wonderful.  We were involved in our own par&oacute;iste in Gl&oacute;r na nGael competitions and enjoyed some success when we had the Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire ar si&uacute;l.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire ann ar&iacute;s an bhliain seo chugainn, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.  T&uacute;s nua ar&iacute;s.  Many people cannot afford the full-on Gaeltacht experience for a month or tr&iacute; seachtaine.  It costs a lot of money.  Our project was simple.  Buses collected people from a 30-mile radius, or beyond.  People came for the day and went home full of fun.  They would be there on their buses picking up their tin whistles and singing sean-n&oacute;s.  They were not ag rince on the bus although some of them were trying.  It was a wonderful way of doing it through fun.  All these organisations are doing hard work but we need more of a meitheal approach, and less of top bodies but a sense of learning up from the s&iacute;olta, &oacute;n talamh suas.  Let us plant the seeds and it will grow.  Then there are the GAA clubs.  Caisle&aacute;n Nua GAA club also helped us, and we used its facilities.  We used the Muintir na T&iacute;re community hall.  I salute them.  They all got an income from that.  It was a very good model for a summer college, col&aacute;iste samhraidh, and people made a few pounds out of it too.  That was not their motive but it was a spin-off.  There were concerts and aifrinn faoin speir.  There was an open air mass on the final night with the buachaill&iacute; and cail&iacute;n&iacute; chol&aacute;iste and there was fierce passion, energy and enthusiasm.  I had the privilege of presenting prizes.  There was much interest in it.  Na daoine &oacute;ga made friends and they are still friends today.  The main age group was ocht mbliana d&rsquo;aois go dt&iacute; 13 bliana.  Then they went on to secondary school and made friends, and some are still friends in university.  Some are in dancing classes and have been to the world championships.  I am not saying they learned it all there but they had wonderful dancing teachers such as Kathy McGrath and Monnie Hallahan in different places around Tipperary.  They developed the skill but they got the love and taste in the scoil samhraidh.  That is vital to like it.  I have often seen the bata scoir in school when the Irish was beaten into people but it did not achieve the desired effect and it never will; it will be resisted.  There should be more groups like Sergeant Moloney's.  It is simple and soft while people have their cup of tea or coffee.  In Newcastle we also had comhr&aacute; cois tine in people's houses, which is especially lovely in the winter months.  I do not know if we can do it this year.  It would be too cold to sing in the wind or le bheith ag caint but we can do our best.  We will look at the strategy and see.  </p> <p> Under the legislation, 20% of entrants to the Civil Service are expected to be proficient in Irish.  That idea has been there for a long time but has it happened?  People complain about the huge cost of translating all the European diktats into Irish but we will see.  I was in a lovely hostelry in Bray last night where I am staying where I met a Chinese man who had better English than myself.  He is in Ireland 18 or 20 years.  It is amazing what we can learn when we have to. He is highly proficient in English.  I meet many people from different lands who pick up Irish quite easily.  Some say it is an easier language to learn than their own.  With the multicultural cities and country that we have and that we all embrace, why not have pride in our own Gaeilge?  A nation is not a nation without its language, as P&aacute;draig Pearse said.  If we do not have that what do we have?  I have often known people who have gone abroad, if they get into trouble and are questioned in a police station, they use Irish and they often have to make phone calls home in Irish to see if there is any chance of a c&uacute;pla quid sa phost.  We have cards now and can transfer money but before that it went in the post.  They would be embarrassed but they could speak in their own language.  It is amazing the ingenuity we have to use it when it suits us.  I say: use it or lose it.  That is what we should do under this strategy.</p> <p> The strategy mentions of language rights and that the UN has recognised our rights but the UN has recognised lots of rights, and what good is it?  I met people outside the gates here protesting about what is going on in Azerbaijan.  The UN has enough to do without expecting it to support Irish.  Certainly, Irish should be protected and preserved.  We should do it ourselves from the ground up.  </p> <p> T&aacute; siad go l&eacute;ir b&aacute;saithe anois, but there were a l&aacute;n daoine in Caisle&aacute;n Nua ag caint tr&iacute; Ghaeilge up to deich mbliana &oacute; shin, such as Mattie O'Leary, Padraig O'Keeffe, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Donnag&aacute;in, agus mo thuismitheoir&iacute; freisin.  It is amazing that people did not have English as a language at all in my village, Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Si&uacute;ire, up to the late 1950s.  It is a pity we ever lost the breac-Ghaeltacht status.  I will knock on the Minister's door to see if we can look at the model a bh&iacute; ann fad&oacute; and restart it.  We talk about clusters and counties and boundaries now.  Maybe we should start small and try to support a pilot in areas where there is a residue.  We are only 20 m&iacute;le &oacute; Dh&uacute;n Garbh&aacute;n agus 25 m&iacute;le &oacute;n Rinn.  We are all part of the D&eacute;ise and proud of our history and the historic kings in Cashel.  It is a very rich cultural area.  We must do better having more bilingual signage.  I thank the county council in Tipperary and the roads engineer for putting up some lovely artistic signs recently in both languages.  We can learn a lot.  We must try to engage the daoine &oacute;ga i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  We have the right model with the re-emergence of our Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire.  It is an easier way to learn and it enlivens the spirit and interest of the whole community.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We need to bring the community with us because we cannot do anything otherwise.  The African saying is that it takes a village to raise a child.  It takes a community to regain and rekindle the spirit of our seantuismitheoir&iacute; and the people going back so that we can remember them proudly, through the medium of Irish, with the heritage they left for us to mind.  </p> <p> I look forward to working with the Minister.  She might pay Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire a visit l&aacute; amh&aacute;in.</p></speech>

My one regret is that I am unable to use our first language.  I envy those who can.  Nonetheless, it does not in any way diminish my firm belief that strong measures need to be taken to facilitate greater use of and familiarity with our language and to guarantee our citizens that they can use the medium of Irish when availing of State services.  For too long, we as a country - I include myself in this - paid a certain amount of lip service to promoting the use of our language.  Legislation guaranteeing citizens a certain level of service through Irish is a positive move.</p>  <p>  Among those who have walked the walk and not just paid lip service are the people who have established the more than 250 Gaelscoileanna throughout the country.  Establishing any school is a major undertaking.  The commitment and determination of those who have driven the establishment of our Gaelscoileanna is admirable.  I refer to Aonad Loch Gile, which is in Mercy College, Sligo where I had the privilege of teaching for 20 years.  Aonad Loch Gile was established after I left, although do not take that to mean anything.  It has been a successful undertaking and contributed much to the language's use in an everyday way.  It makes the language accessible to all who want to access it and normalises its use.</p>  <p>  An increase number of people either speak the language or want to speak it.  That is why we need a comprehensive policy for the teaching of Irish from preschool to third level and beyond.  The language must form part of our lifelong learning.  People like me who have a basic knowledge of it would then have an opportunity to improve our usage.  Sc&eacute;im na Pobal Gaeilge, which is run by Foras na Gaeilge, is an example of lifelong learning.  It is an Irish-in-the-community scheme that involves community development through the Irish language.  It reaches people whose formal educational opportunities have probably passed and puts the language at the centre of people's everyday lives.  The programme needs extra supports.  We also need to develop Irish language centres.  They normalise the language's use in our everyday activities.</p>  <p>  In the above context, the Bill is relevant.  It is about the State providing services to its citizens inside and outside Gaeltachta&iacute; through the medium of Irish.  The Bill will help to underpin many of the voluntary and community actions that have been taken to promote the language.  It will also recognise the rights of Irish speakers in Gaeltachta&iacute; and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  One of the Bill's most important aspects is the need to include timescales for the proposed actions.  There will be a 20% recruitment target of Irish speakers in the public service and all public offices that provide public services in Gaeltachta&iacute; will operate through the medium of Irish.  The timescale for these measures is 2030.  That must be our target delivery date.  The Minister will appreciate that the date should be fixed at 2030 just as it is fixed for a reduction in CO2 emissions and that we are determined to reach that point.  It should be the date on which all State services from public bodies will be available in Irish to Gaeltacht communities.</p>  <p>  It is important that we include the s&iacute;neadh fada.  I spent many years working in Brussels.  No self-respecting French speaker would tolerate the idea of the grave, circumflex or any other French accent not being part of French written words.  We must ensure that the same is the case in Ireland.  It is how it should be.  Anything else would simply be inappropriate.</p>  <p>  All public forms, be they applications for driver licences, passports, carer's allowance or old age pensions, should be bilingual.</p>  <p>  A study conducted by the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in 2018 illustrated that only 551 out of 21,000 staff working in Departments had sufficient competence in Irish to conduct business through it.  The numbers may have changed slightly since, but even if that is the case, they represented only 3% of departmental staff in 2018.</p> <p>That highlights the need for the provisions in this Bill.</p> <p> It is proposed that an Irish language statutory advisory committee will be set up to support the work we are discussing.  That work will include the publication of a national plan for an increase in the provision of public services through the medium of Irish.  This plan is hugely important because it will ensure a systemic, planned and co-ordinated approach.  The process must not be open-ended and should include a timeframe for the drafting of the plan.</p> <p> The Bill provides for a duty on prescribed public bodies to facilitate the use of a person's name, address or title in the Irish language.  This includes the patronymic and metronymic forms of a person's name, which are of cultural significance, especially in Gaeltacht areas.  The rest of us could learn something from that.</p> <p> As I said, official forms are required to be published bilingually or in Irish.  It is also proposed that when renewing or altering logos, public bodies should ensure that text which forms part of the new or altered logo is in the Irish language or in both Irish and English.  The introduction of language standards is essential.</p> <p> Once the plan that will be produced by the Irish language statutory advisory committee is in place, it should be subject to a yearly review process in this House.  It is important that we, as politicians, are able to monitor its progress and implementation.  I understand the Minister has proposed to introduce such a review mechanism.</p> <p> I look forward to a reversal in the budget next week of some of the cuts in funding to Irish language bodies such as Foras na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge, Gl&oacute;r na nGael,  Gael Linn and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Those organisations were seen as low-hanging fruit during the most recent crisis and the cuts imposed on them must be reversed.  They have severely impacted job creation efforts in Gaeltacht areas.  We know that if there are no employment opportunities in an area, people will not stay there.  Increased numbers of people are working from home since the start of the Covid crisis.  We do not know whether they will continue to do so or if it will be the case for most of partly working from home and partly in the office.  The latter is the more likely outcome.  Either way, we have a real opportunity to ensure better employment prospects in Gaeltacht areas.  That in itself will have the knock-on effect of promoting the language.</p> <p> This Bill is a good start in seeking to address the issues, but the most important requirement is that its provisions are actually implemented.  I know from speaking to several Irish speakers in recent days that the Bill is welcomed by the Irish-speaking community.  However, it must be supplemented by budgetary measures that support the language.</p> <p> Before I conclude, it is important to mention the important role of TG4, not just in its promotion of the language but also the fact that much of its content is produced in Gaeltacht communities.  The same applies to Raid&iacute;o R&iacute;-R&aacute;.  It is not just about using the language but also providing an opportunity for participation and involvement by different communities.  It has a hugely powerful effect when people have a sense of the language belonging to them.  The Bill is welcome as an indication that the State will play its part in giving legislative support to Irish speakers.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  We have waited far too long for these proposals to come to the House.  The Bill amends the 2003 Act, which has not been fit for purpose for a long time, and attempts to ensure that the Irish-speaking population can engage with the State through Irish.</p>  <p>  It is useful to consider how we got here.  In 2011, the programme for Government set out the intention of the then Government to review the 2003 Act with a view to ensuring that expenditure in this area was best targeted towards the development of the language and that obligations would be imposed appropriately in response to demands from citizens.  In 2014, a public consultation took place on the review of the Act.  It identified a significant demand for services through the medium of the Irish language on a par with services provided through the medium of the English language.  There was an attempt in 2014 to amend the legislation but it did not come to anything.  We recognised then that the existing Act was no good.  More than nine years later, in 2020, we are finally amending that outdated legislation.  As well as taking a long time to get here, it has been a hard battle to do so.  It is welcome that legislative action is being taken at last but it must be implemented with urgency.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Bill does not go far enough.  I am happy that the Government intends to introduce amendments, but we have not had sight of them.  Based on what the Minister said, they still do not go far enough because they do not reflect the emergency that exists in Gaeltacht areas.  Once again, the Government is not listening to the people who are directly affected by the legislation in question.  The Government has not even listened to the Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n.  The members of that committee, during the previous D&aacute;il, travelled around the country to every Gaeltacht area and listened to the people living there, who have a deep understanding of the emergency facing their population.  The committee also heard from the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and all interested stakeholders.  On foot of these consultations, it published a unanimous cross-party report in May 2018 that contained 20 practical recommendations.  In the report, the Chairman of the committee expressed concerns in regard to the lack of recognition of the emergency in the Gaeltacht and among the Irish-speaking community.  That concern is not addressed at all in the Bill and it is clear that the Government did not take account of what the committee had to say.  People in Gaeltacht areas relayed to the committee that, unless supported, the Irish-speaking population will be wiped out.  We know that the numbers of native Irish speakers are at a critical level.  We must start with the recognition that there is an emergency.  There should be a strong statement in the Bill that we are in an emergency, just as the climate change and biodiversity emergency is acknowledged in the climate change legislation.  An urgent action plan to address this emergency is needed.</p>  <p>  Native Irish speakers or people who choose to speak Irish cannot engage or interact with the State in Irish, notwithstanding the recognition in the Constitution that Irish is our first official language.  The provision in the Bill of a requirement that, by 2030, 20% of public service employees must be bilingual is to be welcomed as partly addressing that issue.  However, it is a cause for alarm that the provision also states that whichever Minister is in charge in 2030 may extend the timeframe for meeting that target.  The deadline of 2030 is already too far out but the Minister of the day is to be given the option to push it out further.  It seems this Government is going to act on climate change but not on the Irish language emergency.  The reality is that people cannot access services through Irish, whether online, by telephone or in person.  This was laid bare in the summer during the public consultation process on the mess that is the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020.  In that case, legislative proposals that will have an impact on great swathes of the Irish-speaking population were not available through Irish.</p>  <p>  Another section of the Bill that needs to be addressed is that dealing with the powers of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  As it stands, he or she is permitted to act only within the confines of the Official Languages Act.  The powers of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga must be extended beyond that Act to enable him or her to examine other legislation.  It is vitally important in this day and age that the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga would be able to examine other legislation enacted by the Oireachtas to see whether it is benefiting the Irish language.  After all, Irish is the official language of the State.  One would not see a similar situation in any other country.  Similar to the way in which we poverty-proof and gender-proof legislation, the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga must have the power to ensure legislation recognises the Irish language emergency that exists and either helps to address it or at least does no further harm.  That is the least that is required.</p>  <p>  I welcome the introduction of this Bill but the reality is that it simply does not go far enough.  I look forward to further discussions on Committee Stage when we will put forward amendments to make the Bill work effectively.</p></speech>

Bu&iacute;ochas le Dia, ar a laghad ar bith, t&aacute; na polaiteoir&iacute; tagtha ar mhalairt intinne faoi sin agus is dul chun cinn &eacute; sin.</p><p>Ar nd&oacute;igh, in 2003 th&aacute;inig Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la ann don ch&eacute;ad uair.  Is aisteach a r&aacute;, tar &eacute;is tagairt sonrach sa Bhunreacht in 1937 go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; for&aacute;lacha a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir dl&iacute; maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga, nach ndearnadh &eacute; sin riamh go dt&iacute; 2003.  An bliain d&aacute;r gcionn, buna&iacute;odh Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.  An bun&uacute;s a bh&iacute; leis an oifig sin n&aacute; go mbeadh dream n&oacute; duine ann a bhf&eacute;adfadh cearta a chosaint le nach mbeadh ar shaor&aacute;naigh dul chun c&uacute;irte le cearta Gaeilge a bhaint amach.

N&iacute; h&eacute; gur theip ar an strait&eacute;is, n&iacute;or trialladh an strait&eacute;is, n&iacute;or cuireadh &eacute; i bhfeidhm.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; i gceist gur strait&eacute;is Rialtais a bh&iacute; ann a mbeadh baint ag an bpobal leis ach a mbeadh tiomanta ag an Rialtas tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile, n&iacute; d&iacute;reach ag an Aire amh&aacute;in.</p><p>Cinnte, n&iacute;or baineadh an oiread leas as Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute;.

Chomh maith leis sin, mar shampla, tugadh isteach na hionstraim&iacute; reacht&uacute;la maidir le comhartha&iacute;ocht.  Bh&iacute;omar ag r&eacute;iteach ionstraim reacht&uacute;la maidir le f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht.  An t-aon cheist a bh&iacute; &aacute; phl&eacute; ag an am n&aacute; an &eacute; go mbeadh rogha ag an bhf&oacute;gr&oacute;ir St&aacute;it, mar shampla, f&oacute;gra a chur in <i>The Irish Times</i>agus ceann eile a chur i bp&aacute;ip&eacute;ar Gaeilge comhionann leis chun na rialacha a chomhl&iacute;onadh n&oacute; d&aacute; mbeadh f&oacute;gra i mB&eacute;arla an leor ceann i nGaeilge a chur ar TG4.

Is rud &oacute; na Gaill &eacute; sin a th&aacute;inig isteach, le daoine ag ceapadh go raibh siad t&aacute;bhachtach agus ag cur teidil orthu f&eacute;in.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an rogha ag an bpobal nuair at&aacute; siad ag l&iacute;onadh isteach foirmeacha agus an ceart dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il a bheith acu gan teideal a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  T&aacute; cuid acu n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; cuid eile.  &Aacute;ine U&iacute; Chu&iacute;v at&aacute; ar mo bhean agus is giorr&uacute;ch&aacute;n &eacute; &ldquo;U&iacute; Chu&iacute;v&rdquo; de &ldquo;&Aacute;ine, Bean U&iacute; Chu&iacute;v&rdquo;, s&eacute; sin, l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; gurb &iacute; mo bheansa &iacute;, mar is N&iacute; Choincheannain a bh&iacute; uirthi sular ph&oacute;s s&iacute;.  Ansin, ar an bhfoirm, cuireann s&iacute; &ldquo;Mrs. &Aacute;ine U&iacute; Chu&iacute;v&rdquo; agus t&aacute; an rud r&aacute;ite faoi dh&oacute;.  Is seaf&oacute;id &eacute;.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nuair a thagann muid ag an mBille seo, go mbeidh s&eacute; de cheart reacht&uacute;il ag daoine gan teideal a chur s&iacute;os ar aon fhoirm mura bhfuil teideal acu.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil teidil ann, dubh, b&aacute;n n&oacute; riabhach.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur rud Eorpach &eacute; n&oacute; rud &eacute;igin ach n&iacute; rud &Eacute;ireannach &eacute;.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; seans go dtabharfa&iacute; Micil Thomas Sh&eacute;amuis ort sa Ghaeltacht n&aacute; go dtabharfaid&iacute;s teideal ort.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go nd&eacute;arfaidh daoine gur rud beag &eacute; ach breathna&iacute;onn s&eacute; seaf&oacute;ideach m&aacute; chuireann duine a n-ainm s&iacute;os i nGaeilge.  Maidir leis an rud a th&aacute;inig isteach de dhaoine ag &uacute;s&aacute;id &ldquo;an tUasal &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rdquo;, is muintir Chonradh na Gaeilge a chumadh &eacute; sin ag t&uacute;s an ch&eacute;ad, ag d&eacute;anamh aithris ar n&oacute;sanna na nGall.  N&iacute;l aon chiall leis ar chor ar bith.</p> <p> T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an Rialtas ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar cheist Coimisi&uacute;n na Logainmneacha.  N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; riamh in ann a thuiscint c&eacute;n f&aacute;th gur cuireadh deireadh le Coimisi&uacute;n na Logainmneacha nuair nach raibh aon s&aacute;bh&aacute;il ann agus n&iacute; raibh an choimisi&uacute;in ag f&aacute;il aon &iacute;oca&iacute;ocht.  Bh&iacute; daoine le saineolas den scoth ag cur comhairle ar f&aacute;il don St&aacute;t saor in aisce.  D&rsquo;oibrigh s&eacute; go hiontach thar na blianta.  T&aacute; a fhios agam ar a laghad go bhfuiltear ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an laincis dl&iacute; a cotha&iacute;odh ar mhaithe le dada.</p> <p> Luaigh m&eacute; na beala&iacute; at&aacute; ag lucht riarach&aacute;in clo&iacute; leis an dl&iacute; ach gan &eacute; a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  Ceann de na sampla&iacute; is fearr n&aacute; plean&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht.  San Acht Plean&aacute;la, caithfear suntas a thabhairt do ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga le linn plean&aacute;la sa Ghaeltacht.  Mura nd&eacute;antar &eacute; sin, b&aacute;far na Gaeltachta&iacute;, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; gar do chathracha m&oacute;ra, ar n&oacute;s na Forbacha, an Spid&eacute;al agus Indreabh&aacute;n, le sc&eacute;imeanna tith&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; an-dochar d&eacute;anta i mBearna agus Maigh Cuilinn.  T&aacute; cleas ag na comhairl&iacute; contae.  T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna ar bun i gContae na M&iacute;.  Bhreathnaigh mise ar chead plean&aacute;la a tugadh i R&aacute;th Chairn agus ar ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ar breathna&iacute;onn s&eacute; thar cionn, le 80% de na tithe coinnithe do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.  M&aacute; &eacute;ir&iacute;onn leo 80% Gaeilgeoir&iacute; a chur isteach ann beidh s&eacute; thar cionn, le daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge gach chuile l&aacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios ag chuile dhuine sa Ghaeltacht go n-&eacute;ireoidh le duine i dteist na Gaeilge sna comhairl&iacute; contae m&aacute; t&aacute; an tr&iacute; fhocal Gaeilge f&eacute;in aige n&oacute; aici.  N&iacute;l ann ach mugadh magadh.  Ar an mbealach sin, t&aacute; an Ghaeltacht &aacute; scrios ag comhairl&iacute; contae agus na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is phlean&aacute;la ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an gceist seo agus cinnti&uacute; sa Bhille seo n&oacute; i mBille &oacute;n Aire Tith&iacute;ochta, Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;il agus Oidhreachta.  M&aacute; t&aacute; coinn&iacute;oll Gaeilge ag baint le cead plean&aacute;la, caithfidh daoine at&aacute; ag cur isteach ar chead plean&aacute;la n&oacute; ag comhl&iacute;onadh an coinn&iacute;oll, in east&aacute;t tith&iacute;ochta mar shampla, caighde&aacute;n Gaeilge neamhsple&aacute;ch a bheith cruite acu, at&aacute; s&aacute;ch ard go bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s a ngn&oacute; laeth&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</p> <p> Is &iacute; an Ghaeltacht at&aacute;imid ag iarraidh a choth&uacute; agus bh&iacute; go leor cainte anseo inniu faoin Ghaeltacht, taca&iacute;ocht don Ghaeltacht agus &eacute; seo agus &iacute; si&uacute;d a dh&eacute;anamh don Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; an Ghaeltacht bheag agus leochaileach.  Caithfimid an rud is bun&uacute;sa&iacute; a chosaint, s&eacute; sin, gan an pobal a bh&aacute;igh, mar a tharlaigh i R&aacute;th Chairn, an Spid&eacute;al agus mar sin de.  N&iacute;l an oiread sin br&uacute; sa bhealach seo ar na Gaeltachta&iacute; at&aacute; i bhfad amach, ach mura gcosn&oacute;imid iad &oacute; bheith b&aacute;ite le slua m&oacute;r daoine gan Gaeilge ar bith ag teacht isteach, agus iad in ainm is a bheith ag clo&iacute; le riail plean&aacute;la, beidh deireadh len&aacute;r n-iarrachta&iacute; ar fad an Ghaeltacht a chosaint agus beifear ag caoineadh faoi c&eacute;ard a tharlaigh don Ghaeltacht.</p> <p> T&aacute; br&uacute; ar an nGaeltacht ach ar bheala&iacute; eile, n&iacute; raibh st&aacute;das n&oacute; c&eacute;im n&iacute;os airde riamh ag an teanga i measc an phobail. </p> <p>M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;mid siar 120 bliain, b'iad an mionlach a bh&iacute; ag tac&uacute; leis an nGaeilge ach t&aacute; go leor le d&eacute;anamh agus n&iacute; cheart misneach a chailleadh.  Caithfimid &iacute; a fheice&aacute;il mar theanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, n&iacute; teanga pobal amh&aacute;in tar &eacute;is comh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; an Ghaeltacht.  Is mar thobar na Gaeilge at&aacute; s&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtach.  Chomh maith leis sin, is d&iacute;ol suntais gur fh&aacute;s l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge taobh amuigh agus taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht idir an bhliain 2006 agus 2011.  Ba i ndiaidh 2011, nuair a d'athraigh polasa&iacute; an Rialtais, a thit s&eacute; ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam faoin Rialtas seo go bhfeicfimid f&aacute;s uair amh&aacute;in eile ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p> <p> Fuair m&eacute; f&iacute;se&aacute;n de bheirt gas&uacute;ir at&aacute; s&eacute; bliain as an Astr&aacute;il inniu.  Dr&aacute;ma beag a bh&iacute; ann a bh&iacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il do thuismitheoir&iacute; i nGaeilge.  Mar labhairt an Ghaeilge le gas&uacute;r, is cuma c&eacute;n &aacute;it ar domhan a labhra&iacute;onn duine &iacute; leo, tabharfaidh siad &iacute; leo gan str&oacute;.  An rud go gcaithfear a dh&eacute;anamh le gas&uacute;ir n&aacute; an Ghaeilge a chur ina mbealach.  S&uacute;faidh siad suas &iacute; agus ansin beidh s&iacute; acu.</p></speech>

Chuala m&eacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; acu n&iacute; ba luaithe.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla rud le r&aacute; agam le cur leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt mo chomhghleacaithe, go h&aacute;irithe an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh.  Ceann de na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; iontach deas n&aacute; go bhfuil Aire anseo agus muid ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  Ceann de na ruda&iacute; a bh&iacute; de dh&iacute;th i c&oacute;na&iacute; n&aacute; go mbeadh Aire ag an leibh&eacute;al Rialtais a bheadh ag pl&eacute; leis na ceisteanna seo.  Le blianta anuas n&iacute; raibh ann ach Aire St&aacute;it, agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Chambers.</p>  <p>  Ceann de na ruda&iacute; nach bhfuil a fhios agamsa go f&oacute;ill n&aacute; c&eacute; aige n&oacute; aici at&aacute; an chumhacht.  T&aacute; a fhios againn go n-aistr&iacute;tear cumhachta&iacute; &oacute; Aire go Aire St&aacute;it.  An bhfuil sin d&eacute;anta anseo?  An bhfuil an chumhacht ag an Aire St&aacute;it n&oacute; ag an Aire?  An bhfuil an aistri&uacute; sin d&eacute;anta, an bhfuil r&uacute;n ann &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh n&oacute; an bhfuil na cumhachta&iacute; uilig ag an Aire?  Is maith go mbeadh eolas againn air sin.  Is maith an rud &eacute; freisin go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ann le cuidi&uacute; leis sin agus ag cur b&eacute;im ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; go leor r&aacute;ite nach bhfuil m&eacute; ag iarraidh dul siar air ar&iacute;s ach caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go gcuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht at&aacute; anseo &oacute; thaobh an Bille de.  T&aacute; s&eacute; go deas go bhfuil go leor Gaeilge le cloiste&aacute;il againn san Seomra inniu agus caithfimid cur leis sin amach anseo gan dabht.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo go bhfuil go leor Teachta&iacute; in achan ph&aacute;irt&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute;balta a gcuid gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i nGaeilge.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh ag iarraidh le blianta fada a chur chun tosaigh go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; anseo i nGaeilge, go h&aacute;irithe le linn Seachtain na Gaeilge.  Ar an drochuair, rinneadh iarracht maith ar sin ag an t&uacute;s ach ansin le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas t&aacute; s&eacute; &eacute;ir&iacute; n&iacute;os measa.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh mar D&aacute;il agus ceann de na coimitmint&iacute; a thug m&eacute; f&eacute;in do dhaoine i nGaeltacht Th&iacute;r Chonaill n&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfainn iarracht n&iacute;os m&oacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as an nGaeilge agus m&eacute; i mbun mo chuid oibre anseo sa Teach seo.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l dabht ar bith ann ach go bhfuil an Bille seo f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach.  Chuala m&eacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ag caint ar an am nuair a foils&iacute;odh an Bille go raibh caint ann go raibh s&eacute; r&oacute;-l&aacute;idir go raibh iarrachta&iacute; ar bun c&uacute;l&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an Bhille.  T&aacute; a fhios agam, &oacute; thaobh Sinn F&eacute;in de, nach sin an dearcadh a bh&iacute; againne.  &Oacute;n ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, bh&iacute; muid ag iarraidh i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; cearta agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; iarracht a bheith ann sa Bhille oifigi&uacute;il.  Bh&iacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh ag pl&eacute; na ceisteanna sin go luath agus ag r&aacute; go gcaithfear an Bille seo a l&aacute;idri&uacute;.</p>  <p>  T&aacute;imid ag fanacht i bhfad r&oacute;-fhada leis an Bhille seo.  Is deas an rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; againn ach l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an moill sin an easpa t&aacute;bhachta a bh&iacute; ag baint leis an Bhille seo &oacute; thaobh leibh&eacute;al Rialtas de le tamall maith anuas.  T&aacute; s&eacute; luaite &oacute; a bh&iacute; 2011 ann go raibh leasuithe de dh&iacute;th.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tr&iacute; bliana anois &oacute; a bh&iacute; na ceannteidil againn.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam an bhfuil Bille ar bith eile thart ar an D&aacute;il a bhfuil muid ag fanacht an oiread ama sin f&aacute;choinne.  T&aacute; s&eacute; againn agus is &eacute; sin an jab at&aacute; againn n&aacute; an Bille chomh l&aacute;idir agus is f&eacute;idir a bheith againn.</p>  <p>  Mar duine a t&oacute;gadh agus at&aacute; i mo ch&oacute;na&iacute; i nGaoth Dobhair, tuigim an t&aacute;bhacht at&aacute; ag baint le taca&iacute;ocht reacht&uacute;il a bheith ansin &oacute; thaobh cearta na Gaeilge a l&aacute;idri&uacute; agus an teanga labhartha a neart&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil cinneadh le d&eacute;anamh ag achan duine agus ag an phobal an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  T&aacute; cinneadh le d&eacute;anamh fosta ag leibh&eacute;al reacht&uacute;il &oacute; thaobh na taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus na cosaint&iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm &oacute; thaobh na teanga de.  Sin an obair a t&aacute;imid i mbun inniu.</p>  <p>  Tuigimid uilig na deacrachta&iacute; at&aacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; an easpa infheist&iacute;ochta, an imirce agus an laghd&uacute; at&aacute; tagtha ar deiseanna i gceantair Ghaeltachta le blianta anuas pl&eacute;ite anseo ar&iacute;s inniu agus le blianta fada.  T&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in ag d&eacute;anamh r&eacute;idh don ch&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is D&eacute; M&aacute;irt agus t&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil pac&aacute;iste de &euro;12 billi&uacute;n le caitheamh ag an Rialtas.  Sin &euro;12 billi&uacute;n sa bhreis le caitheamh ag an Rialtas.  Sin an pac&aacute;iste at&aacute; s&eacute; ag caint air f&aacute;choinne 2021.  Sin &euro;12 billi&uacute;n agus beidh le feice&aacute;il c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad milli&uacute;n de sin a rachaidh isteach &oacute; thaobh an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht de.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re &oacute; thaobh achan rud at&aacute; le cloiste&aacute;il againn sa Teach seo agus m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta a labhra&iacute;tear n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, caithfidh muid an infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh fosta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ceart agus c&oacute;ir go bhfuil cosaint&iacute; reacht&uacute;la agus spriocanna agus a leith&eacute;id ann ach caithfear an infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh i gceantair Ghaeltachta agus sa Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; Conradh na Gaeilge ag tarraingt le ch&eacute;ile na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; Gaeltachta agus Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re le blianta fada anuas agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh &eacute;ileamh ar an Rialtas bliain i ndiaidh bliana &oacute; thaobh an infheist&iacute;ocht at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th.  Ar an drochuair, nuair a thagann an c&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is, n&iacute; fheicimid an infheist&iacute;ocht sin.  Le cuidi&uacute; D&eacute;, b'fh&eacute;idir gur seo an bhliain inar f&eacute;idir linn sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; faoi leith &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta de agus t&aacute;imid ag feice&aacute;il sin.  T&aacute; staid&eacute;ar i ndiaidh staid&eacute;ar foilsithe agus l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn siad c&eacute; chomh dona agus c&eacute; chomh deacair agus at&aacute; na fadhbanna.  T&aacute; d&oacute;chas agam agus ag Sinn F&eacute;in nach bhfuil deireadh tagtha le saol na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil athbheochan agus r&eacute; &uacute;r i nd&aacute;n don Ghaeltacht.  Caithfear an r&eacute; &uacute;r seo an taca&iacute;ocht ceart a bheith aici &oacute;n St&aacute;t.  Caithfear cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; soil&eacute;ire a bheith leagtha amach sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  Caithfear plean dearfach a bheith curtha i gcr&iacute;ch leis na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; sin a bhaint amach.  Sin an pr&iacute;omhrud.  Caithfear plean a bheith ann fosta agus caithfear an plean sin a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.</p>  <p>  C&iacute;m i mo cheantar go bhfuil teaghlaigh ag bogadh ar ais, giota ar ghiota isteach san &aacute;it ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; siad ag iarraidh a gclanna a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge ach n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it &aacute;balta tac&uacute; leo chomh maith agus go mba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute;ibh.  N&iacute;l sin maith go leor agus caithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt ar an fhadhb sin.  Chonaic m&eacute; i mbliana go raibh turas&oacute;ir&iacute; ag teacht chuig Ghaeltacht Th&iacute;r Chonaill, chuig na D&uacute;naibh agus chuig cheantair ar n&oacute;s Gleann Cholm Cille agus a leith&eacute;id.  Caithfidh an St&aacute;t maoini&uacute; agus pleananna cinnte a chur i bhfeidhm le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na teanga a chur chun cinn sna ceantair sin.  Bh&iacute; na turas&oacute;ir&iacute; seo ag teacht ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeilge agus ar mhaithe leis an chult&uacute;r, chomh maith leis an &aacute;illeacht at&aacute; againn sa cheantar sin.  Mar shampla, caid&eacute; an plean at&aacute; ann chun d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil na heagrais phobail sna Gaeltachta&iacute; uilig ag cumars&aacute;id agus ag obair le ch&eacute;ile?  Sin ceann de na ruda&iacute; go gcaithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt air.  Caid&eacute; an plean at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh sin?  T&aacute; go leor eagrais ag d&eacute;anamh obair ar nd&oacute;igh.  N&iacute;l dabht ar bith fad&uacute;da sin.</p> <p>Rinneadh s&aacute;robair leis na hoifigigh phlean&aacute;la teanga ach an bhfuil plean ann?  An bhfuil c&oacute;ras ceart ann le d&eacute;anamh cinnte go bhfuil siad ag obair le ch&eacute;ile agus ag iarraidh na spriocanna c&eacute;anna a bhaint amach &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta?  Taca&iacute;m le reachta&iacute;ocht l&aacute;idir agus soil&eacute;ir a bhfuil f&iacute;s aici chun saol na Gaeilge agus todhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta a chinnti&uacute;.  Sin an f&aacute;th a bhfuilim ag tac&uacute; leis na leasuithe at&aacute; luaite ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh, agus an chuid eile.  </p> <p> T&aacute; fadhbanna ansin agus t&aacute; siad luaite.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil spriocdh&aacute;ta ann ach t&aacute; s&eacute; gan maith ar bith spriocdh&aacute;ta a chur i reachta&iacute;ocht agus ansin cumhacht a thabhairt don Aire &eacute; sin a chur siar.  Is ionann &eacute; sin agus a r&aacute; ag t&uacute;s an phlean nach s&iacute;ltear go n-oibreoidh &eacute;.  Caithfidh an sprioc a bheith i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 20% a bhaint amach.  Caithfimid f&eacute;achaint ar cad a tharl&oacute;idh ina dhiaidh sin.  Cad &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile - 30%, 40% n&oacute; 50%?  Caithfimid dul i bhfad n&iacute;os faide.</p> <p> Labhair an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ar chosaint na Gaeltachta agus aonta&iacute;m leis ach, ag deireadh an lae, m&aacute;s sin an t-aon rud at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh, tiocfaidh creimeadh ar an nGaeltacht.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir a bheith ag cosaint an t-am ar fad; caithfimid dul amach ag ionsa&iacute; agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; taca&iacute;ochta a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  Ag caint le daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus le daoine at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; ar son na Gaeilge, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil &iacute;omh&aacute; n&oacute; smaoineamh acu go bhfuil siad i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag iarraidh cosaint a dh&eacute;anamh ar ionsaithe at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht.  T&aacute;im ag caint ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la agus ar d&eacute;anamh cinnte go mbeidh coinn&iacute;ollacha plean&aacute;la i bhfeidhm.  Is t&aacute;bhachtach go mb&iacute;onn a leith&eacute;id de sin i bhfeidhm ach ar&iacute;s is cosaint &eacute; nuair a dh&eacute;antar cinnte go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag 80% de lucht c&oacute;naithe east&aacute;t tith&iacute;ochta agus go bhfuil siad in ann a n-obair a dh&eacute;anamh agus a teaghlaigh a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i nGaeilge.  </p> <p> Caithfimid amharc ar an taobh eile de.  C&eacute;n cine&aacute;l taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; breise a bhfuil muid chun tabhairt do dhaoine at&aacute; ag iarraidh c&oacute;na&iacute; a bheith orthu sa Ghaeltacht &iacute; f&eacute;in?  N&iacute;lim ag caint faoi chosaint a dh&eacute;anamh ar dhaoine le B&eacute;arla at&aacute; ag teacht isteach.  Ceann de na deacrachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra at&aacute; ag daoine at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha le Gaeilge sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, toisc gur ceantair iarg&uacute;lta iad den chuid is m&oacute;, n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon rud i bpleananna forbartha n&aacute; infheist&iacute;ochta na gcontaetha &oacute; thaobh t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt do dhaoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu chun iad a bheith &aacute;balta c&oacute;na&iacute; a bheith orthu ina gceantair f&eacute;in agus cur le tobar na Gaeilge.</p> <p> Luaigh m&eacute; rud sa dh&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht dheiridh.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go raibh muid ag pl&eacute; leis an Aire St&aacute;it agus feidhmeannaigh na Roinne.  Bhain s&eacute; leis na taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; do ghr&uacute;pa&iacute; agus, go h&aacute;irithe, don aos &oacute;g.  Caithfimid cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil an teanga ag an aos &oacute;g agus go dt&oacute;gann siad a gcuid clanna le Gaeilge nuair at&aacute; siad n&iacute;os sine.

Bh&iacute; t&eacute;arma&iacute; tagartha ann do thuarasc&aacute;il agus bh&iacute;omar p&aacute;irteach leis sin.  Rinne an Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta iad.  Bh&iacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta i l&aacute;thair.  Ceapadh comhairleoir agus bh&iacute; molt&oacute;ir ann.  Bh&iacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; eolais de dh&iacute;th agus a leith&eacute;id de sin.

T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mb&iacute;onn teagmh&aacute;il, comhr&aacute;ite agus meas eatarthu.  T&aacute; an t-am caite anois.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go n-inseodh an St&aacute;t d&uacute;inn cad at&aacute; sa tuairisc sin.  An bhfuil plean ann anois le hionad &oacute;ige nua a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair?  Moladh &eacute; sin sa staid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach a rinneadh i nGaoth Dobhair n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; deich mbliana &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite ag an aos &oacute;g f&eacute;in gur sin an rud at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th orthu.  Moladh &eacute; sa phlean a rinne coiste oireachtais.  T&aacute; s&eacute; molta i bplean &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus ag &oacute;ige na Gaeltachta go mbeadh ionad buail-isteach ansin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar ph&aacute;irt den phlean 20-bliain don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh ionad &oacute;ige sa cheantar sin.  T&aacute; an staid&eacute;ar d&eacute;anta, t&aacute; an t-airgead caite, t&aacute; comhairleoir ceaptha, t&aacute; an tuairisc scr&iacute;ofa agus os comhair an Aire St&aacute;it, ach n&iacute;or inis &eacute;inne cad at&aacute; istigh ann n&aacute; an bhfuil fadhbanna ann.

Cuideoidh s&eacute; sin leis an nGaeilge agus leis an aos &oacute;g.  Ba mhaith liom &eacute; sin a r&aacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil teagmh&aacute;il &aacute; d&eacute;anamh leis an Roinn.  Molaim sin ach caithfimid a fheice&aacute;il cad iad na molta&iacute; at&aacute; ann sa phlean sin.</p> <p> Is &eacute; an rud deireanach a luafaidh m&eacute; n&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; na n-oile&aacute;n, go h&aacute;irithe c&uacute;rsa&iacute; ar Thoraigh.  T&aacute; fadhb mh&oacute;r maidir le Toraigh.  Bh&iacute; seo pl&eacute;ite sa D&aacute;il c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin.

Mar ph&aacute;irt den r&eacute;iteach, moladh go mbeidh b&aacute;d gasta ansin.  Rinne an Roinn &eacute; sin a chur amach chuig tender ach, ar an drochuair, t&aacute; c&aacute;s c&uacute;irte ag dul ar aghaidh mar gheall air sin agus t&aacute; fadhb anois ag an Roinn an conradh sin a bhronnadh.  Mar gheall air sin, n&iacute;l b&aacute;d gasta anois ag dul isteach agus amach go Toraigh.  T&aacute; fadhbanna millteanacha ansin agus muid ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an ngeimhreadh.

D&eacute;anfaidh na breithi&uacute;na cinneadh ar an gceist sin amach anseo.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an t-airgead ann agus go bhfuil an Roinn s&aacute;sta an conradh sin a bhronnadh ar cib&eacute; duine a bhainfidh an tender amach ach t&aacute; fadhb f&oacute;s ann.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag dul ar aghaidh leis na blianta.  T&aacute;im ag dul isteach ag an ngeimhreadh agus n&iacute;l b&aacute;d gasta ann.

This matter is of great concern to tens of thousands of people.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Noonan, is here.  He will recall that we discussed this proposed EU regulation in a Topical Issue debate on 16 July.  During that debate, I requested that the Minister of State consult those who would be affected by the regulation, which proposes to ban the use of lead of gunshot bullets.  On that occasion, Teachta Clarke also raised the issue of the presumption of guilt, which would be introduced by the regulation.  She also referred to the definition of wetlands in the Ramsar Convention being intended for use at a global level, and not locally, regionally or nationally.  The Minister of State acknowledged the challenge that the regulation would pose to farmers and gun owners.  He also acknowledged the challenges presented by the Ramsar Convention definition, as well as the proposed buffer zones.  People were reassured when the Minister of State acknowledged and accepted those concerns.  On that occasion, the Minister of State stated: "While the Commission has proposed to progress this measure, I believe it is time we received some support on this matter."  He also told us he was "more than happy to meet with the lobby on this issue".</p>  <p>  After that exchange, I emailed the Minister of State to formally invite him to meet groups, such as the National Association of Regional Game Councils, NARGC, but I did not receive a response.  On 3 September, Ireland voted in the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, REACH, committee to support this regulation.  Despite several attempts to get clarification from the office of the Minister of State, it was only on 15 September, via a response to a parliamentary question that I had submitted, that we received confirmation that Ireland had voted to support this regulation.  All the evidence suggests that the Irish position was changed at the direction of the Minister of State.  If that is the case, I would consider it to be an act of bad faith, as would the thousands of farmers and gun owners who will be impacted.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt we will now hear that all will be well and any issues arising will be handled during the transitional phase.  I do not believe that will be the case.  I fear that it is the intention of the Government to overcome the challenges posed by the Ramsar Convention definition of buffer zones by banning the sale and use of lead gunshot entirely.  If that is not the intention, I invite the Minister of State to outline how it could possibly be workable to implement this regulation in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I have a letter from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as it was known, dating from June, stating that "the various issues raised by Ireland relating to a longer lead-in time for Member States without restrictions and issues surrounding buffer zones around wetlands do not appear to have been addressed by the Commission in the current draft of the regulation.  Accordingly, Ireland is unable to support the current regulation in its current form, unless changes are made to address these concerns".  Will the Minister of State tell me what changes were made in the time since that letter was written?  Was it simply the case that the position of the Minister of State changed and then the Government's changed?  People will be interested in hearing his response regarding this issue, especially since I have emails from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, from just days before the September vote, indicating that Ireland would reiterate its concerns at the meeting on 3 September.  How did this current draft differ from the previous version?  On what date did Ireland formally change and reverse its position?  Did the Minister of State intervene to sign us up to a position that will create substantial difficulties and costs for Irish farmers and game club members without any consultation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-08a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100800042#SS00400"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for bringing this matter up today.</p>  <p>  He is correct in saying that this issue was discussed as a Topical Issue matter on 16 July, when Deputies Carthy and Clarke raised this subject.  It is good for us to be able to discuss it again today.  I will update the House on the background to this issue.  As I indicated in July, the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, AEWA, was developed under the UN Convention on Migratory Species.  Ireland signed up to the agreement in 2003 and it includes a commitment that "Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables."  I am happy that Ireland's position is to support the AEWA commitment to phase out the use of lead shot over wetlands.</p>  <p>  Separately, and directly related to our discussion here this evening, the European Commission published a set of draft regulations in early 2019 for consideration by member states on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands.  The draft regulation was discussed by member states at some meetings of the European committee on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, more commonly referred to as the REACH committee, as Deputy Carthy has said.  Following discussions at a meeting of the REACH committee last June, the European Commission submitted a draft set of regulations for a vote by member states by written procedure.</p>  <p>  The main proposals in the regulation involve a transitional period of 24 months for those member states banning the use of lead shot in guns in or around wetlands; for those member states with wetlands which exceed 20% of their territory, the transition time is extended to 36 months, provided member states also ban the purchase and use of lead shot in all their territory, not just on wetlands; fixed buffer zones of 100 m around wetlands where lead shot possession and shooting would be prohibited; and a definition of wetlands that is used in the Ramsar Convention.</p>  <p>  As I indicated to the House in July, I support fully the underlying thrust of the regulation and I am committed to phasing out lead shot in wetlands, given that lead is clearly undesirable and can cause harm to the environment and water birds.  Many member states have had restrictions on the use of lead gunshot in place for many years.  Ireland, on the other hand, has had no restrictions at all.  I know that we are not completely alone in that regard and that a small number of other member states also do not have restrictions, but we are in a minority.  It is true that for those member states which have some national regulation already in place, many gun owners would have guns with non-lead shot ammunition and any transitional challenges to meet the requirements of the proposed regulations would thus be mitigated.</p> <p>In the case of Ireland, as we currently have no restriction, statutory or otherwise, on the use of lead in gunshot, the regulations would pose a challenge to us in implementing and properly enforcing a new regulation in 24 months in a situation where member states are more advanced than us with regard to national regulation.  I understand that in Ireland, some farmers' and hunters' guns may not be capable of using lead shot substitutes and they may need to purchase new guns.  In addition, the definition proposed to be used for wetlands is that defined under the Ramsar convention, that is, wetlands of international importance, which includes peatlands, and this would cover relatively large areas around the country.  These Ramsar areas are not currently all mapped and given the scale of wetlands in Ireland, this would take some time and, therefore, enforcement would present us with challenges.</p> <p> My Department held consultations with interested parties including hunting and farming interests on this matter.  While the Department has always supported the underlying thrust of the regulations and is committed to phasing out the use of lead shot in and around wetlands, it made a case for a longer lead-in time to deal with the transitional challenges which I have outlined and, in that regard, submitted documentation to the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, REACH, committee.</p> <p> As the Deputy may recall from when we discussed this on 16 July, the Commission has proposed that a vote on the draft regulations was to be taken by written procedure on the day before our discussion but then decided to terminate that voting procedure.  At the time of our previous discussion, we were awaiting further clarification from the Commission on how it intends to progress with this matter.  Since then, the issue was discussed at a REACH meeting held on 3 September.  Notwithstanding Ireland's reservations about the lead-in time, since we are committed to phasing out lead shot in and around wetlands, Ireland indicated at the meeting that we would support the draft regulation.  A vote was taken at the meeting on the draft regulation and it was passed by the necessary majority of member states with Ireland voting to support the measure.  The draft regulation will now be sent to the Council and European Parliament for scrutiny for a period of three months.</p> <p> While we recognise that there will be some challenges to us relating to implementation if this proposed regulation becomes law, Ireland, like all member states, will have to rise to the challenge and we will do this in consultation with stakeholders.  I am satisfied that the long-term implications of the regulation would be of benefit to Ireland, its citizens and the environment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State spent the bulk of his contribution reiterating the exact comments that he made during our previous debate, which outlined the concerns and challenges involved, then said that we will face down those challenges at a different stage.  He mentioned the consultation with some of the organisations that have an interest in this.  He did not state that the conversation took place after the vote, which is incredibly disappointing.  The Green Party spent some time at its online conference asking why people in rural Ireland do not like it.  Notwithstanding the suggestion from a Green Party Senator that it should just use smaller words, I can tell the Minister of State that it is actions, such as the one he has taken, that lead people in rural communities to think that his party is out of touch and deaf to their concerns.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State was presented with a regulation.  He was told that the regulation would create significant difficulties for farmers and game clubs, the very people who are needed to champion conservation measures and protect biodiversity.  He was simply asked to ensure that the full consultation process would happen and take place with them before he supported the regulation, and he could not do it.  I do not understand why that is the case.</p>  <p>  He has made a decision that will put a significant burden on a number of gun holders.  Will he commit to ensure that people who are out of pocket because they have to change or modify their guns will be compensated in full?  Will he commit to consult with those people who will be affected by the implementation of the regulation?  If he is, will he outline the process and nature of that consultation?  People will take a commitment to consult with a grain of salt.  In recognition of where we have been up until this point, will the Minister of State outline the form of that consultation?  Whatever needs to be done to protect our environment has to be done.  All I am asking is that the people who are on the front line in protecting biodiversity and the environment are consulted before decisions that affect them are made.  That is not too much to ask.</p></speech>

It was after the vote on 3 September.  I had a constructive meeting with them.  There were difficulties but it was constructive.  I recognise the conservation efforts and work that council members do around the country, including on grey partridge and other projects.  They do fantastic work in that regard.</p>  <p>  As a general principle, I am fully supportive of the proposals that led to the ban on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands, given the threats posed by lead in the environment.  At the same time, I fully appreciate that there will be challenges for hunters and other gun users to overcome to meet the requirements of this draft regulation should it eventually be passed by the European Parliament.  My Department has liaised directly with farming and hunting stakeholders over the past year or so and we are aware of the challenges involved.  There will be challenges for Government in this as well.  For example, the Commission's proposal for buffer zones of 100 m around wetlands is an added difficulty when trying to enforce any new restrictions.</p>  <p>  In following up on a commitment that I gave to Deputies when we discussed the matter in July, I met members of NARGC which represents the interests of the hunters, and we had a useful and frank discussion on the issue.  I will meet the Irish Farmers' Association separately, specifically about this.</p>  <p>  My Department has argued at the REACH committee for a transition period of more than the two years proposed by the Commission, especially for member states that do not currently have any restrictions.  My Department submitted written documentation to the REACH committee in that regard.  As I indicated earlier, notwithstanding our reservations on the transition arrangement in the draft regulation, the Commission put the proposal to a vote without a revised transition period.  Since we are committed to phasing out the use of lead shot in and around wetlands, which I strongly believe is the correct approach, Ireland voted in support of the draft regulation, which was passed by the necessary majority of member states, and would have been the case anyway.  We were aware that the proposal would have been carried irrespective of how Ireland voted, given the level of support.  In the circumstances, I believe Ireland took the correct decision to vote in favour to signal our support for protection of the environment and of health, not just for wild birds but for humans too.</p>  <p>  I outlined my commitment to the Deputy again and I will continue to hold consultations with the relevant stakeholders to try to address those concerns.  They are valid concerns and I want to try to address them in collaboration with the various stakeholders.</p></speech>

It is a local issue, especially in the parish of Ballyroan, where Sancta Maria College is located.  I thank the Minister of State for her attendance to take the question.  It is a serious issue.</p>  <p>  As background, Sancta Maria College has a brand new building.  It is barely open.  It cost the taxpayer a lot of money.  It is proud educational infrastructure in the heart of the community.  It is an all girls school, serving the local community of Ballyroan, Ballyboden, Knocklyon, Firhouse and beyond.  It was with great shock, given the efforts made by the Minister for Education and Skills, departmental officials, teachers on the ground, school staff, including caretaking staff, secretarial staff and ancillary staff, parents and children to get back to school and to ensure that the school community was up and running even with the severe restrictions and challenges posed by Covid, that the school found itself in a situation this week when the heating system broke down.  Obviously these things happen but the school was then told it would be closed until next week.  A consequence of this is that pupils returned home.  It is of particular consequence and anxiety to students and their parents who are studying for the leaving certificate to be sent home and to lose time, having already lost three to four months of the school curriculum in the lead-up to the leaving certificate in 2021.  They were then told that learning has to move online, which has proven satisfactory in some subject areas and unsatisfactory in others.</p>  <p>  I raise this issue today as a matter of priority on their behalf.</p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will have news on funding to be provided, if necessary, to repair the heating system in a brand new school.  She may also be able to give the community some information on how a system like this can break down so soon into its operation and lifespan.  Will she give some kind of reassurance to the school community, and the students and parents in particular, on when normal operations will resume at Sancta Maria College?</p></speech>

On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Foley, this provides me with the opportunity to outline the current position on the problems experienced by Sancta Maria College in Rathfarnham, which the Deputy alluded to earlier this week.  A major building project has been under way at the Sancta Maria College since 2015, which is delivering major refurbishment works and an extension to the college.</p>  <p>  As part of this project, the heating in the system was upgraded to bring it to a modern standard and some further works were also done to ensure any outstanding snags in the heating system would be done in the summer break of 2020.  The main contractor for the contract, L&amp;M Keating, returned to the site after the national Covid-19 shutdown of construction sites but progress has been extremely slow since the resumption.  The main contractor ceased work in early July and has not returned to the site since.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if the Deputy is aware but in recent days, the main contractor has applied for examinership, which has been granted on an interim basis.  I understand it will be confirmed at a hearing in the High Court on 12 October 2020.  My Department's building unit is aware of the problem with the heating system in the school and was told at lunchtime on Tuesday, 6 October, when the school emailed, seeking approval to appoint an engineering contractor to resolve the issues.  That afternoon, the board of management at the school was authorised to have all necessary works carried out by the engineering contractor.  This work has, therefore, been authorised outside the existing main construction contract in order that we can ensure, as the Deputy stated, that the heating systems can be brought back to full working order as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  He will be glad to hear that the school principal has informed my Department that the work to the heating system is scheduled to commence tomorrow, which is Friday, 9 October.  It is anticipated the work will be completed in time for the school to reopen on Monday, 12 October.  I hope that is seen as good news by the Deputy.  If he has further questions, we can liaise on them.</p></speech>

There is no point in labouring the issue.  I am grateful for the comprehensive reply given by the Minister of State.  It is very bad news to hear about the contractor, and that this was a cause for the school closing.</p>  <p>  There is another matter, as blended learning has had to be used and there was an understandable lack of preparation because the school could not anticipate that it would have to move to online learning so quickly after resuming normal schooling.  I am grateful to the Minister of State and her officials for supplying the information so quickly.  I am also thankful that the funding was authorised for Sancta Maria College to proceed with the appointment of an engineering firm to address the problem as quickly as possible.  Next Monday is as early as possible a date for this to be done in the circumstances.  I ask the Minister of State to thank the officials in her Department for that.</p></speech>

The Department will continue to work with Sancta Maria College on all the other matters as well.  I note the Deputy's comments on blended learning, and with Covid-19, the Department and the Minister are acutely aware of such matters.  We must support schools where they find themselves in a position where the pupils cannot attend or buildings must close for whatever reason.  It is something we are looking at on a daily basis.</p></speech>
