The aim of the incentive is to support increased economic activity by tax compliant building contractors and also to move activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy.  The incentive was introduced in October 2013 and extended to landlords from October 2014.  It provides for tax relief for home owners or landlords by way of an income tax credit of 13.5% of qualifying expenditure.  The home renovation incentive was extended for a further two years in the budget and section 7 of the Bill, as published, provides solely for that extension.  Amendment No. 7 proposes to extend access to the home renovation incentive to tenants of local authorities.  There was general support among Opposition parties for such an amendment as proposed by Deputy Joan Burton on Committee Stage and I undertook to consider it.  Discussions have been held with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in relation to the proposed amendment and, in principle, that Department has no objection to the proposal provided the permission of the relevant local authority is given for any works.  Accordingly, I am happy to bring forward the change.  The legislative changes contained in amendment No. 7 are slightly more complex than those put forward by Deputy Burton, but they achieve the effect proposed by Deputy Burton on Committee Stage and in amendment No. 8 on Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300003#A00500"><p>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment.  I also thank other Deputies for supporting it.  This is a potentially important amendment and innovation in the Finance Bill for people who are tenants in local authority houses throughout the country.  As Members are aware, local authorities have ceased to do a huge amount of maintenance in local authority properties and it does not look as if they will return any day soon to carrying out routine large-scale maintenance in properties other than, for example, to change windows from time to time.  I am strongly of the view that the amendment should be made as people have come to me who want to do up their houses.</p><p>They may have wanted to install a new kitchen, extra bathroom facilities or other facilities like heating and windows, if there was no window refurbishment programme in their estate.  They found that, having seen all the builders providers, merchants and so on advertising the home improvement scheme, they were barred from it.  The Minister's amendment means that those people will now be able to avail of the scheme.  As people are aware, the scheme has been enormously popular among home owners as a way of getting some VAT back on the spend on significant home improvements and repairs.</p> <p> I thank the Minister.  I hope he will write to local authorities to advertise the change so they are fully advised of the situation.  The permission of local authorities, as the owners of properties, will be required when any structural work is done to ensure it is carried out to a proper standard and, in particular, in accordance with fire safety regulations.  I ask the Minister to talk to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, about this matter.</p> <p> A number of local authorities, in particular Dublin City Council and Cork City Council, need to change their approach when a tenancy is given up or the council buys old local authority houses from tenants or families who wish to sell them on.  It is shocking to see that the first thing local authorities do is park large skips in the gardens of local authority houses, to the intense annoyance of neighbours.  They proceed to board up the windows and doors with steel shutters so that the houses are safe if left vacant for a period of time.  This has gone on for years in some local authorities.  Nobody has been able to influence them until recently.  The local authorities then rip everything out of the houses.</p> <p> I and other Deputies, I am sure, have had people telling us they are moving to another house, perhaps as a tenant in the case of a retired persons' unit.  They tell us they would like nice families to get their houses which they have left perfectly clean and in good order.  People are heartbroken because we cannot tell them that the councils will respect the homes they have lived in and created over 30 years.  Instead, one sometimes has to break it to people gently that the councils may choose to strip a house back to its original condition and then months, or even years, later bring in a team of builders to refurbish the house from top to bottom.  As everybody knows, the new occupants of the house can be seen not long afterwards visiting large DIY shops on the outskirts of all our large towns and cities, fitting new kitchens, fireplaces and anything else they can afford.  The whole thing is an exercise in wasting money.</p> <p> The Minister is aware that when I was T&aacute;naiste there was a special programme for, and resources allocated to, councils to end the scandal of boarded-up houses.  Over the past two years or so, we brought 5,500 houses, which had been voids, back into use for letting or allocation.  Some local authorities are taking their foot off the pedal again in regard to this.  As I said, they are also buying other properties, in particular older local authority houses.  It is a good policy and they are in areas where many people want to live.  Those houses, having been purchased, then end up being boarded-up.  It is scandalous.</p> <p> The Minister needs to put the boot in in regard to any local authority which is carrying out that practice. We are all aware that in large local authority estates there are many risks around anti-social behaviour.  A house that is boarded-up and shuttered for protection as it is being left vacant over a long period of time is a magnet for anti-social behaviour, as are front gardens and skips.  A measure to deal with this would be popular with people.</p> <p> I introduced small loan schemes via credit unions which the Department of Social Protection guarantees.  The Minister and I co-operated to develop the scheme.  It has proven to be very popular and is keeping people away from moneylenders by using local credit unions.  People are repaying loans via social welfare payments through the post office payment scheme.  It is good for business all around.</p> <p> In the context of the Minister's amendment, I propose to withdraw my amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300004#B00200"><p>I welcome the amendment, which is a result of an amendment tabled by Deputy Burton on Committee Stage and will expand the scheme to local government properties.  It is probably regrettable that we are in a situation whereby an amendment like this has to be proposed.  I will support the amendment, but it should not be the norm.  The normal practice is that if houses are owned by local authorities, the work should be carried out by them.  As a result of inadequate funding across local authorities, essential works are not being carried out.</p>  <p>  I am sure we have all visited houses where windows have to be replaced, cornflake boxes are used to try to fill gaps and stop drafts coming in, doors are leaking or chimneys are cracked.  Local authorities, because of a lack of resources, cannot carry out work.  Individuals are forced to turn to credit unions, moneylenders or other financial institutions to take out loans in order to carry out work.</p>  <p>  This amendment would allow them to have the VAT returned or a tax rebate, but only in certain circumstances.  We all know some rent for local authority housing is based on people's level of income.  This scheme is very much based on one's taxable income.  Some people do not have a taxable income.  Despite the amendment, they would carry out work on State properties but because of their level of taxable income they would not be able to avail of the scheme.  That goes to the heart of one of the problems with the scheme.  I mentioned this problem on Committee Stage and I am disappointed the Government has not come forward with an amendment to deal with the matter.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to give us some indication that his Department will examine the facts I put on the record on Committee Stage in terms of the very low uptake of the scheme over the past three years in many counties outside of large urban areas.  I cited the examples of Monaghan, my county of Donegal and many other counties -  the Minister provided me with a list of relevant counties in response to a parliamentary question.  Over a three-year period, 200 or 300 properties have availed of the scheme.  The issue is the threshold.  Another issue is something the Minister pointed out, namely, the fact it relies on taxable income.  Counties where people earn very low wages mean that the taxable income may not be worthy of eligibility for the scheme.</p>  <p>  There is need for a review of the scheme in light of the statistics, rather than whether it should be extended for another two years or so.  We need to examine why there has not been sufficient uptake in many counties compared to other areas.  A commitment from the Government to deal with that issue in terms of the threshold and the fact that it is based on taxable income is required.</p><p>For instance, although two people could get the same contractor and carry out the same work, if one does not pay tax because his income is so low and his tax credits cover his liability, he will not get a benefit from the State, but his neighbour, who has a larger income, will.  There is an unfairness in that.  The Minister can argue that it is a tax rebate but the reality is that the person on the low income would be paying tax through VAT on the products, which is what this scheme is supposed to be about.  There is an issue here, particularly in terms of the thresholds.  While people may know that they can roll this up, when carrying out work, they will think about the immediate work to be carried out, whether it is the replacing of windows at a cost of &euro;2,000 or &euro;1,500, and they will not think that next year they might be doing something else and that it will all add up and so they may decide to go with a contractor that may not be registered for VAT.  As the Minister stated in his opening remarks, one of the reasons for the scheme is to try to bring those on the black market into a registered system where everyone is paying the appropriate taxation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300005#C00200"><p>We are supportive of the amendment tabled by the Minister.  We spoke in support of Deputy Joan Burton's amendment on Committee Stage.  Those living in local authority homes that are most likely to avail of the home renovation scheme are those who intend to avail of the tenant purchase scheme and buy their home.  This raises an issue because my reading of the new tenant purchase scheme, which is in place since the beginning of this year, is that the discount that applies to the market value, which is between 40% and 60%, appears to be purely based on income.  If the household income is more than &euro;30,000, the purchaser will get a discount of 40%.  However, there does not appear to be recognition for work done by the tenant to the house.  Under previous schemes, this would have happened.  I ask the Minister or his officials to raise that issue with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The reality is that local authority tenants are unlikely to be willing to invest a lot of money to upgrade their homes if, ultimately, they will not be in a position to own it.  That issue needs to be teased out.</p>  <p>  To pick up on Deputy Pearse Doherty's points, we have a good grants system in place for private homeowners, namely, the housing adaptation grant schemes for older persons and those with disabilities and the mobility grant scheme.  For tenants of local authority houses who are unable to afford to upgrade their homes themselves, the amount of funding local authorities have to carry out adaptations to their own stock is disgraceful.  We all know of so many cases of people with very serious and, in some cases, profound disabilities whose local authority homes need to be adapted, but the council simply does not have the funding to do it, whereas we are, quite rightly, providing grant support for private homeowners to carry out the same works.  This is a real issue.  It is not an issue for the Minister, but one that needs to be raised with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  However, I ask the Minister to comment on the interface between the tenant purchase scheme and the improvement works that people may carry out now under this scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300005#C00300"><p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  It was a good proposal on the part of Deputy Joan Burton and I am glad to be able to respond to it.  We had further consultations with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, which had some observations on the extending of eligibility to local authority tenants as against private tenants.  It said local authority tenants may be more inclined than private tenants to carry out home improvements because they hold a lifetime tenancy.  Also, the local authority tenants might be inclined to carry out home improvements as they generally have an option to purchase the home at a reduced price at some point in the future.  It is interesting that the life tenancy would be an incentive to tenants to carry out works.  It is obvious, but worth remarking on.</p>  <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty made the point about some people not having a taxable income.  This tax relief can be carried forward as a credit.  If the person has a taxable income at some point in the future, it can be used as a credit against that taxable income.  If a person were to go back to work after a period of unemployment, it might be helpful.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty is correct about the uptake being different from county to county.  The large urban areas around Dublin and Cork have the highest levels of uptake, followed by counties such as Wicklow and Kildare.  The national average is one per 118 people availing of the home renovation incentive.  The Deputy's county of Donegal has the lowest uptake, with one in 573 availing of the scheme.  However, if we look at the amount of money spent under the scheme, Donegal has the highest average of &euro;27,000 per valid application, which is close to the maximum allowable qualifying expenditure of &euro;30,000.</p>  <p>  A number of issues have been raised which are really matters for local authorities and so on.  Members can take those up with the relevant Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300005#C00400"><p>I accept the comments by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  One of the problems is lack of information.  Since the development of the Department of Social Protection's arrangements with the credit unions to provide for small scale loans, the credit unions have advertised them, but I am not aware of the local authorities having done so.  There has been a strong and solid uptake of that scheme, which is a great opportunity for those who need to borrow smallish sums of money for various family purposes.  In particular, coming up to Christmas, it helps to keep people out of the clutches of money lenders.  The Minister for Finance might speak to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Social Protection about the need for information that is easily accessible in county offices such as the banners and information leaflets on the loan scheme in the credit unions using the scheme.  This would encourage people to avail of it.  Many people borrow to make refurbishments to their homes, but do not get any support when doing it.  If they get the home in the condition they want, given that they have long-stay tenancies, it is also very nice that, as noted by Deputy Michael McGrath, they may, particularly if they are working, opt to purchase the house.  If they continue to rent, they may stay long-term in the estate, thus adding to the stability of the estate and to the success of social housing.</p></speech>

The amendment, when judged against the provisions of the Bill, is restricting a proposed relief and would involve a potential charge and, accordingly, must be ruled out of order.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, and 14 to 17, inclusive, in the name of Deputy Stephen Donnelly, propose to extend the help-to-buy scheme to those in negative equity as well as those who are currently defined as a first-time purchaser.  The effect of this would be an extension of a proposed relief which, consequently, has the potential to impose an additional charge on the Exchequer, as more people would qualify for the proposed tax relief.  These amendments would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer and accordingly must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 13, in the name of Deputy Joan Burton, proposes to restrict the relief available under the help-to-buy scheme by reducing the qualifying period.  It would involve a potential charge and accordingly must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).</p><p> Amendment No. 18, in the name of Deputy Michael McGrath, would require the Minister to prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of delivering a new home and the options available for reducing that cost.  The amendment is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill, as read a Second Time, and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 154(1).  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 19, also in the name of Deputy Michael McGrath, would require the Minister to prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the effectiveness of the activate capital development finance for residential redevelopment schemes under the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and set out the options for a sustainable finance model for the construction of new residential homes.  This matter was not discussed in the Committee Stage debate and, consequently, the amendment does not arise from Committee Stage proceedings and must be ruled out of order.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300006#D00300"><p>I move amendment No. 20:</p><blockquote>In page 21, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:<b>&quot;9. </b>The Minister shall, within one year of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the impact of section 477C &quot;Help to Buy&quot; on prices for new houses in the property market inclusive of an econometric analysis of the scheme.&quot;.</blockquote><p>The purpose of the amendment is to enable the Oireachtas to properly scrutinise the help-to-buy scheme.  When discussing amendment No. 13 I suggested the scheme be introduced for a trial period of one year.  The Minister chose to have it in place until December 2019.  As he acknowledged in earlier discussions and in the run-up to the budget and as we know from the information made available by the Central Bank of Ireland, the scheme was not given detailed consideration but arose from a strong feeling it would help to stimulate the housing market.  While I accept that the Minister proposed it in good faith and that he is optimistic it will stimulate the market without affecting it negatively by driving up house prices, his optimism remains to be vindicated.</p><p>In their commentary on the help-to-buy scheme many people who are extremely well informed about the housing market have expressed strong fears that the effect of the scheme will be to increase land and housing prices and that the increases will be quickly absorbed by builders and developers.  The modest proposal made in the amendment is to require the Department to prepare a report which the Minister would lay before the D&aacute;il on the impact of the section 477C help-to-buy scheme.  The report would examine the property market and include an econometric analysis of the impact of the scheme.  People often use hunches when making policy.  If we are to believe their commentary, the current British Foreign Secretary, in the case of Brexit, and Mr. Donald Trump, the President-elect of the United States, appear to go on hunches more than anything else. </p><p>An analysis of the help-to-buy scheme is necessary because the collapse of the property and housing market in 2008 was a bruising experience for many individuals and families who lost their money and homes or ended up in significant mortgage debt.  Until recently, the Minister has made something of a mantra of the refrain that he does not want Ireland to be in a boom and bust cycle.  There is a considered view, one which the Minister clearly does not share, that all of the money made available to first-time buyers under the proposed scheme may end up being absorbed by canny builders and developers in rising prices.  In my constituency, where a significant amount of housing is being built for the private market at mid-range prices, it is obvious that the announcement of the scheme almost immediately enabled builders and developers to raise prices by an amount roughly equal to the amount first-time buyers were expected to gain from the scheme.  This was not the intention of the Minister who intended to provide help and support to enable people to build up a deposit.  Later today we will be given some detail on the Governor of the Central Bank's proposals on deposits.  If people have paid significant rent from their own resources for an extended period, this should be taken into account in calculating what deposit should be necessary. </p><p>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment as it would support his stated position that he wants to make policy decisions based on evidence.  From the information available, I do not know why he has abandoned that approach in the case of the help-to-rent scheme.</p></speech>

I expressed the view on Committee Stage that an impact assessment should have been carried out in advance of the roll-out of the scheme.  In view of the failure to do so, an impact assessment should be carried out now.  We proposed that an independent impact assessment be completed by the end of next September and should be carried out at arm's length from the Department and the Government in general.  It should examine the impact of the scheme on house prices, the supply of new homes and the property market generally.  I am sure the commitment the Minister gave in this regard will be honoured and look forward to seeing the outcome of the impact assessment in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300006#D00500"><p>While I support the amendment, the proposal is much different from that which I advocated on Committee Stage.  To produce a report on the impact of a scheme on house prices one year after it has been introduced is to do things arseways.  The Government should have made the analysis of the impact of the measure on property prices before its introduction.  The Minister informed us that he had liaised and that his officials had engaged with all of the banks in which the State had a stakeholding.  I asked the chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland, Mr. Richie Boucher, about this matter when he and his colleagues appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Mr. Boucher indicated that he knew nothing about such engagement, although he also stated he would ascertain after the meeting if departmental officials had spoken to other individuals in the bank and revert to the committee on the matter.  It was interesting to have the Government inform us that it had consulted the Governor of the Central Bank on this flagship scheme when the Central Bank stated it had been consulted on only one aspect of it.  Mr. Boucher and his officials knew nothing about Government consultations with Bank of Ireland when they appeared before the joint committee, despite assertions to the contrary by the Government.  We will see what the other banks have to state on the matter.</p>  <p>  That, however, is background noise as the real issue is the evidence which shows that the measure will push up house prices.  Developers are not building because they claim they cannot achieve the expected profit margins of between 10% and 15%.  Builders need to have a profit margin and would clearly not be in business if they were operating at a loss.  The Government has introduced a scheme knowing fine well that its effect will be to push up property prices, resulting in developers achieving the profit margins they seek.  It has presented the scheme as some form of support for homeowners and others who want to get onto the property ladder.  That is the lie at the heart of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  As I stated, if it is the case that the purpose of the help-to-rent scheme is to ensure it is profitable for developers to build houses, there are two other ways of achieving this objective, the first of which is to increase house prices which would cause profit margins to increase, while the second is to reduce building costs, which is what we must do.</p><p> Everybody knows this is a supply side issue.  The Government's attitude is that by bringing in this measure, demand will increase and, therefore, supply will follow.  When we put this to Bank of Ireland, it was interesting Richie Boucher responded that not only does the bank deal with mortgage borrowers, it is the financier of the developers as well.  It gets to see it from both sides.  Bank of Ireland made it clear there is demand.  The issue is supply and the profitability of the developers.</p> <p> The Minister's scheme should not go ahead and there is enough evidence to suggest that it should not.  It should be frozen.  Fianna F&aacute;il has criticised the scheme.  For the record, the only amendment it put forward which directly affected the scheme was to expand it.  Like the universal social charge and water charges, the party wants to have it both ways.  There is no evidence that the scheme will work.  Instead, the evidence is pointing in the other direction, namely that it will drive up house prices.  Already in the past year, house prices have increased at a rapid rate.</p> <p> Today, it is expected the Governor of the Central Bank will come out with new changes to the macro prudential rules for mortgage lending.  Again, the Government claims one of the reasons behind this scheme is to help first-time buyers gather in the deposit required.  There is no awareness in the public discourse about the limits, however.  People are of the view that 20% of the deposit to buy a house is required but there is no scenario where one would need 20%.  It goes to 20% after &euro;220,000.  The overall rate would actually never hit 20% as it is always less than that.</p> <p> The Government instead should focus on the exceptions to this.  Up to 15% of all lending is outside or can be outside the hard loan-to-value limits.  On top of that, 20% of all lending can be outside of the loan-to-income limits.  Accordingly, 35% of the value of all new mortgage lending in this State does not have to comply with the hard loan-to-value or loan-to-income limits.  We are focused on the loan-to-value end which is 15%.  The Government claims it wants to create demand for first-time buyers.  We had evidence from Bank of Ireland, which was before the finance committee last week, and Permanent TSB this week, that of the 15% exemptions in mortgage lending, only one third of them are going to first-time buyers.  If the Government wants to support first-time buyers getting into the property market and to get mortgages - there are questions as to whether it is as widespread as the Government believes - we should be encouraging the Central Bank to introduce tweaks which would mean that the 15% exemptions would not be for people buying their second, third or fourth home.  Instead, it should be focused on those who want to get on to the property ladder.  At the moment, the rules are that it is 15%.  We do not care how the banks decide to divvy it up.  What we have, however, is evidence from the two institutions which have been before the finance committee - I expect the same from AIB - that one third of exemptions are going to first-time buyers while two thirds are going to non-first-time buyers.</p> <p> This scheme is wrong.  It is reported the Central Bank will introduce tweaks to the macro prudential rules by increasing the exemptions from 15% to 20%.  We will have to wait until this evening to see if that is the case.  The rights and wrongs of this measure are for another debate.  However, it has already been speculated that such a move in itself will push up house prices.  When the Minister introduces this measure, it will exaggerate the issue.  From March of this year, we have seen a steady increase in the number of mortgage approvals from our financial institutions.  Mortgage approvals are running at a rate of twice mortgage drawdowns.  The point is that access to credit generally is not the problem but that there is not enough supply.  Twice as many people who have been granted mortgages from financial institutions are actually deciding to draw the mortgage down to buy a property.  That is the question we need to be asking.  We do not need to increase that number by three times or four times but to make sure that those who have been approved are drawing down their loans and buying properties.  The way one deals with that is through supply.</p> <p> How does one address the core of this issue?  In our view it is done through reducing the cost and incentivising the vacant site tax.  There is no reason why that tax is not brought forward to 2017.  There are other areas which need to be examined.  Deputy Michael McGrath touched on this with his amendment, which was ruled out of order.  It appropriately proposed to take on board the housing committee's unanimous agreement across the political divide to have an assessment done as to the cost of building a house in this State.  There are different figures from different agencies and groups which give different breakdowns.  This is a matter with which the Housing Agency should be tasked.  For some reason, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has turned his nose up at this recommendation, a recommendation which was supported by Members of his own political party on the committee.</p> <p> If it were introduced, data would then become available as to where the real problems lie.  Then the challenge to the State and Members would be to see if we can reduce the cost of building houses.  Reducing the cost would have a twofold effect, namely profit margins for developers would be in the realms where they would start to build and the cost of purchasing a home for the average individual would be brought down to a reasonable level.  In turn, this would mean the amount of credit they would have to take out from a financial institution would be less.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1230" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300007#E00200"><p>I support this amendment because we need to know what effect this scheme will have on house prices.  I would like included in any such report, the impact not just on first-time buyers, which the Minister hopes will be positive, but on the negative equity generation.  On Committee Stage, the Minister said he would look at help for the negative equity generation.  His office sent me on the current rules.  It is true the 10% and 20% rule does not apply if one is in negative equity from the Central Bank's perspective.  That is a minimum guideline put down by the Central Bank.  The banks, however, still apply it.  Nearly ten years on from the collapse, people who bought apartments between 2004 and 2008 are still trapped.  On Committee Stage, the Minister identified that this help-to-buy scheme was a targeted intervention to help first-time buyers deal with the fact they could not save 10% to 20% deposits.  While I do not agree with the Minister, it is a coherent rationale for helping that group of people.  At the same time he said we have to help those who are trapped and cannot buy homes in which to raise their kids, he has completely excluded the negative equity generation.  Accordingly, we are forced to table amendments on Report Stage because Parliament is not allowed suggest tax changes to the tax Bill.</p>  <p>  Take the case of someone stuck in negative equity trying to buy a new house.  The argument the Minister is using for not including them in his help-to-buy scheme is that they do not have to meet the Central Bank's deposit rule.  The banks say one has to hit a deposit rule for their own potential lending, however.  One cannot sell and buy or keep the negative equity apartment and buy because the rules applied to stress testing mean that one does not get a mortgage whatsoever.  They are trapped.  One way I am looking to alleviate this, which seems reasonable, is to end the double taxation of accidental landlords.</p><p>It was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and, I believe, Sinn F&eacute;in.  I do not know whether Deputy Burton was in the Chamber at the time but there was broad agreement that parents who bought apartments during the bubble are stuck and trapped by double taxation.  We had a debate on this and the Minister raised the concern that if we stopped the double taxation, it might help the people it is intended to help but that there are others who might be able to game the system.  Therefore, I tabled an amendment that was very restrictive.  It proposed that if one has but one property, in which one lives and which is in negative equity having been bought during the bubble, and one is seeking to sell it and buy another that is a bit bigger and has an extra bedroom, one should not be double taxed.  In other words, if one is trying to move from a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom apartment to a two-bedroom or a three-bedroom semi-detached house, one should not be double taxed.</p> <p> I was very disappointed the Minister did not accept the amendment.  He has not helped people in negative equity, who are completely trapped by the taxation system.  We hear from him time and again that high taxation is a disincentive to work.  Couples in their 30s and 40s with children and stuck in tiny apartments are being hit with a &euro;5,000 tax bill because they say they cannot raise their children in them.  They wish to move out of the two-bedroom apartment and rent a three-bedroom semi-detached house in which to raise their children but the tax system is such that if they do so, they will be hit with a tax bill of an extra &euro;5,000.  Therefore, one will either stay where one is, which is not suitable for the children, or try to proceed without paying tax, which should not be done under any circumstances.  Alternatively, one will do so and resign oneself to never having the money to save for a deposit or pay down the negative equity.</p> <p> In the Minister's response to Deputy Burton's amendment on a report, why has he chosen to abandon these people in negative equity?  He has not tabled any amendment.  There was broad support across the House for something to be done, particularly on the double taxation of accidental landlords.  Will the Minister please tell us why he has chosen not to do anything?  He has not chosen to table his own version of my amendment.  Why is he choosing to allow a taxation system to bury these people in an unanticipated tax and leave them trapped in negative equity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300008#F00200"><p>As I outlined in detail on Committee Stage, the help-to-buy incentive is an important element of Government policy on housing.  It is one part of the many actions to develop a fully functioning housing market that responds adequately to the needs of our citizens included in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which was launched last July.  It is in this context that the help-to-buy scheme should be considered.  Its role would be to complement the other measures in the action plan.  The extent to which the market responds will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Considering the importance of the scheme, however, I agree it would be prudent to undertake an additional analysis to examine aspects of the scheme, including those raised by the Deputies on Committee Stage.  That was why, during that debate, I committed to commission an independent impact assessment of the help-to-buy incentive with a view to examining its general impact.</p>  <p>  This report will be completed by September 2017, in time for next year's budget.  It will involve a general assessment of the entire scheme, including of issues the Deputy has raised, to ensure that the incentive can achieve the socio-economic objectives at which it is targeted.  It could be argued that by accepting this amendment and enshrining specific methods of analysis of the scheme into legislation, the potential scope of the proposed review could be narrowed.  At the moment, the scope of the proposed review remains quite broad, as befits such a wide-ranging incentive.  Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment but I hope that the Deputy will accept my previous commitment to commission this independent impact assessment.</p>  <p>  A number of other items were raised, principally by Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  As I explained on Committee Stage, the amendment he tabled was unworkable in practice.  It was not targeted in a way that would be efficient and it left open the possibility of its being used for tax avoidance purposes.  I could not come up with a construct that targeted efficiently people in negative equity who are renting out a small apartment and renting larger accommodation for themselves.  I am open to advice, however, on how such amendments could be constructed or on how such a measure could be included in tax law in the future.  Thus far, however, the approach that has been taken was to work with and take the advice of the Central Bank.  As rightly mentioned, the Central Bank has modified its prudential rules in respect of persons in negative equity to make it easier for them to raise a loan.  It is true that some banks may vary the prudential rules on a case-by-case basis.  Recent data published by the Central Bank indicate that negative equity mortgage loans amounted to &euro;121 million, or 660 loans, from the introduction of the micro-prudential rules until the end of quarter two of this year.  The modifications made by the Central Bank are working to the extent of &euro;120 million worth of mortgages to help persons in negative equity to move out of it.  I am open to other suggestions.  As I stated, I have not come up with anything to meet the need identified by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  A number of other items were raised in the discussion.  Many are matters for the Minister responsible for housing.  I am dealing only with the tax side.  The help-to-buy scheme is a targeted scheme for first-time buyers of new homes.  It is quite limited.  I expect that it will work efficiently for the particular category for which it is designed.  I am not advancing it as some kind of overall cure for the housing crisis, of which we are all aware.  We know it is multifaceted in its causes and effects.  The plans published by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in the summer comprise a range of initiatives to deal with the problem.  I am sure the Deputies opposite are aware of the scope of the proposals.  This is one specific tax proposal targeted at helping first-time buyers of new homes to put a deposit together to enable them to get a mortgage.  I hope the announcements by the Governor in the afternoon will reinforce this.  This is not connected to the help-to-buy scheme but I hope the modifications to the prudential rules will be of further assistance to persons who want to acquire a home.</p></speech>

We have similar constituencies in the sense that they have tens of thousands of new homes, many of which were purchased in the period 2000 to 2008.  Many of the purchasers are in good jobs and some of the families have two people with jobs.  They purchased when prices were at their highest.  Where a couple had an apartment, or where each partner had an apartment, as was sometimes the case, they found it impossible to sell.</p><p>Many of them have let their apartments and rented.  Due to the lack of rent controls, they are renting at increasingly exorbitant rents.  The Central Bank should include in its assessment their complex situation and advise the banks to do likewise.</p> <p> As values rise, negative equity decreases, which is helpful, but we are discussing people who have two or three children and who are the heart and the soul of the community, committed to local schools, doing everything that society expects of them and trying to make successful lives for themselves and their children, and they are in a bind.  They are caught between having to rent out an apartment because they cannot sell it yet.  I call on the Minister to do something for this group and to advise the Governor of the Central Bank, as I have done in my submission.  Otherwise, what will we have learned from the crash?  Mr. Chopra, the head of the IMF team, stated repeatedly that it wanted evidence-based policy from Ireland.</p> <p> I am glad that the Minister is accepting that we need to reassess the help to buy scheme.  As such, I will not press the amendment and will instead accept the Minister's proposal, if that is acceptable to other Deputies.</p></speech>

I expect it to examine issues such as the impact on house prices, the supply of new homes and the property market generally.  If the independent impact assessment finds that this intervention in the market is directly contributing to house price inflation, the Minister will have to end the scheme.  We all should be clear that there will be no other option but to discontinue the scheme.</p>  <p>  My amendment on the cost of delivering new homes was ruled out of order.  I raised this issue on Committee Stage, when the Minister committed to speaking with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  I am aware of comments that the latter has made in the past week or so to the effect that the Housing Agency is undertaking an audit of the cost of delivering new homes.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, might inform us of whether he had that discussion with his colleague and whether it led to the audit.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge and support the sentiments expressed by Deputy Donnelly regarding those who are in negative equity, no longer live in the sole property that they own and are renting elsewhere.  There is justification for a targeted measure.  Previously, we made proposals whereby the rent that people were paying could be offset against the rental incomes that they were receiving.  I accept that it is difficult to construct such a scheme and there is always the capacity for abuse, but it would be possible to do this in a targeted way in order to assist the people in question.</p></speech>

There is at least a two-year lead-in period comprising planning permission, site development, construction and sale.  No property will have come on board as a result of this scheme by the time that the review is undertaken.</p>  <p>  I hope that I am wrong, but the independent report will show that the scheme has led to house price increases.  We do not need an independent report.  Politicians need something so that they can say that there is a review and so on.  There is already enough evidence to suggest that it is pushing up house prices.  Deputy Michael McGrath's party and its spokesperson have been on the record as saying that the scheme is doing that, yet it will allow this scheme to become law.  There will be the fig leaf of a review in ten months' time and the assertion that the scheme must end if it is pushing up house prices, but there is no chance that the Government will end it in ten months' time when the evidence comes through.  Instead, there will be talk of legitimate expectations, people saving and entering into contracts, etc.  I will table a parliamentary question on when was the last time that the Government introduced a time-limited tax relief that was cut early.  The trend has always been to extend, extend, extend.</p>  <p>  If the report shows that the scheme is pushing up house prices, what would be the legal implications of turning it off, given that the expectations created by the Finance Bill will lead to people purchasing within these dates, only for it then to be denied to them?  The appropriate action would be to stop this now.  Carry out the analysis that is required.  Have proper, meaningful and thorough consultation with the Central Bank.  Discuss the issue with the banks' heads from the developer and mortgage points of view.  Let us wait to hear what the Central Bank will do to ease lending restrictions.  Let the Department conduct a proper economic analysis.  If the evidence stacks up, introduce such a measure in next year's Finance Bill, but doing so at this time is madness.  It is back-of-the-envelope stuff.  This is a hunch.  In fairness, this is the Government trying to do something about housing, but it is doing it at the wrong end of the spectrum.  The scheme should be cancelled.  A report after the fact is no good.  We are clear on this.  At this late stage, I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il to stand up and be counted.  It has the power to stop this scheme being introduced and increased property prices inflicting damage on many future house buyers.</p></speech>

Imagine if the tax law was to the effect that, if someone got his or her first job between 2002 and 2008, that person would have to pay an extra &euro;5,000 in tax per year even though that would not be the case for anyone else.</p>  <p>  I hope that not too many people will be affected, but for those in this situation, it is not a marginal issue.  Their futures have been destroyed by this.  Due to getting hit with a &euro;5,000 tax bill every year, they will be stuck in a two-bedroom apartment, stuck renting or stuck avoiding tax and hoping that they never get caught, and they will never be able to sell and buy.  This affects their entire future financial security.</p>  <p>  The Minister's response referred to an amendment that I tabled on Committee Stage, which I accept was broad, but I listened to the Minister's comments and I have now tabled a very targeted measure.  It only applies if a person bought an apartment or house between 2002 and 2008.  The apartment or house would have to be smaller than 113 sq. m, which is the average size of a three-bedroom semi-detached house, and it only applies to first-time buyers who bought one property.</p>  <p>  On the basis that the Minister's refusal to act is destroying people's lives ten years after a crash, what is wrong with the amendment that has been proposed?  Why is it not targeted enough and why is it not sufficient to release people from the trap of a tax policy that is destroying their futures?</p></speech>

Many sites have been opened and builders pace their developments to correspond to demand.  They will build three houses between now and the summer or they will build 23 houses between now and the summer.  On sites that are already open, builders can expand supply when they believe that there is a demand that they can meet profitably.  There will be additional houses between now and the review.</p><p> In response to the point made by Deputy Joan Burton, the prudential rules already take into account the capacity of people to pay.  According to the bank, it works as follows.  While it is not specifically referenced in the prudential rules, on the issue of people paying rent in excess of what it would cost to service a mortgage, when banks are assessing ability to pay, they take this into account.  Therefore, when they are adjudicating on a mortgage application, one of the things at which they look is the ability of the applicant to service the mortgage subsequently.  A major consideration is if they are already paying rent which exceeds the repayment on a mortgage.  They are then seen as being in position to so do.  It is taken into account on the bank side but not-----</p></speech>

The objective should be self-evident and is straightforward, namely, to promote the use of public transport.  There would be many benefits, not least tackling climate change, addressing gridlock in cities, improved quality of life for commuters and general support for a public policy that is already well established.</p><p>The amendment seeks to include parking costs associated with commuting on public transport as part of the taxsaver scheme.  I come at this issue from a direct personal perspective because I have been a commuter for 15 years at this stage from Sallins, near Naas, to the city centre.  I also represent Kildare North which is in the commuter belt and probably one of the main areas from which people commute.  It includes towns such as Leixlip, Confey, Maynooth, Sallins, Naas, Clane, Kilcock and Celbridge.  According to the CSO, more than 50% of the working population of County Kildare commute to Dublin city centre.  I have seen the difficulties they experience.  There have been welcome improvements to public transport in recent times, but there is still a long way to go.</p><p>My focus is on parking at train stations.  Until a couple of years ago there was no charge for parking, certainly at Irish Rail stations, while there was a small charge at Luas stations when light rail services were introduced.  There are different systems in place for different travel options.  The introduction of paid parking at stations was resisted at the time as it was seen as a retrograde move.  However, the system is now in place at railway stations and the cost has increased again recently.  The cumulative effect is another reason for commuters not to park at a station and use public transport.  It is sometimes easier to stay in one's car and keep on driving to one's place of work, particularly if the traffic is moving.  The alternative is to pull into the station and pay the fee.  </p><p>The benefits of including parking costs in the taxsaver scheme would be many, including convenience for the individual commuter, affordability in the sense that there would be a small rebate and the routine and simplicity associated with the system.  By routine I mean that instead of having to fumble for change each morning when someone is running into the station or trying to get his or her bearings, if he or she could purchase an annual parking ticket as an add-on to the commuter ticket, which is already a well established scheme; it would be a one-off annual payment and he or she could rely on using the train, bus or Luas every day.  If someone does not do it in that way, one is likely to take an <i>ad hoc</i>approach.  He or she might pay for parking today and tomorrow, park somewhere else the following day, or drive to work on other days and so on.  The convenience of being able to pay upfront would be a major factor.</p><p>Irish Rail did introduce a pilot scheme about three years ago under which one was able to buy a parking ticket as part of the annual rail ticket.  It was so popular that lt had to discontinue the offer temporarily while it upgraded its administration system because it did not have the resources to cope with the demand.  It did not anticipate how popular the scheme would prove to be.  There would be many benefits for the individual commuter who tries to figure out his or her path to work each morning.  Many commuters already buy an annual ticket and there would be a benefit in buying an integrated ticket which means that it would be one less thing to worry about in the morning.  Convenience is a big consideration on a daily basis, as is advance purchase.</p><p>There would also be benefits to communities.  All public representatives in this House and certainly those of us who were members of local authorities are aware of the problems for residents who live adjacent to railway, bus and Luas stations as commuters often park in neighbouring estates and on neighbouring streets.  Encouraging commuters to use the parking options provided for, including the integrated taxsaver scheme, would partly address that problem.  I hope the benefits to society are obvious at this stage.  I set them out at the start of my contribution, but they are well established in some areas.  I refer to action on climate change, avoiding gridlock and promoting the use of public transport, including sustainable transport.  Encouraging commuters to do so using an integrated scheme seems to be very reasonable, sensible and progressive.  The amendment calls for a report to be prepared to examine the feasibility of this option.  It is reasonable to ask for this to be done.  I, therefodre, urge the Minister to consider the amendment.</p></speech>

The exemption also includes passes for travel on commuter ferry services which operate within the State on journeys which begin and end in the State.  The exemption does not extend to car parking charges which are incurred as part of a combined travel pass which includes car parking charges, nor does it include <i>ad hoc</i>parking charges such as daily charges.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that we discussed this issue on Committee Stage.  While in theory I could agree to prepare a report, as he suggests, as I said at the time, I am not at all convinced of the merits of the underlying proposal.  If we were to allow individuals with a taxsaver travel pass to gain further tax relief on car parking fees, this would be an additional benefit for someone already gaining significant tax relief on his or her commuting costs.  Again, as I said on Committee Stage, it would be very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to administer such a scheme: The existing travel pass or taxsaver scheme is transparent in that the providers are listed in the legislation and the cost of the pass at the start of the year is known.  On the other hand, parking facilities are provided by a multitude of  providers, from multi-storey car parks to waste ground, and at various rates.</p><p>I know where the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency is located and while I accept that many people may need to drive to a station or a bus stop, nonetheless I am still concerned that such a change might perhaps have the unintended effect of increasing the distance driven by commuters before they make their switch to public transport.  In addition, while it is not a matter for my Department, I note the recent NTA decision to reclassify certain stations in the short hop zone and the savings this will produce for some commuters.  I am sure that must be a source of great satisfaction for the Deputy and some of his constituents.</p><p>I note that there could also be difficulties in minimising any opportunity for misuse of such an extension.  For example, if an annual parking fee was paid, how would the Revenue Commissioners know who was using the pass?  For all of these reasons, I would be reluctant to contemplate an extension on the lines proposed by the Deputy.  The existing taxsaver scheme works well and provides people with a generous incentive to use public transport.  I do not think it would be practical to extend it to car parking charges for the reasons I have outlined.  Therefore, I am not inclined to ask my officials to prepare a report on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300010#H01000"><p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I anticipated some of the arguments he would advance and will try to address his concerns.</p><p>One of the concerns articulated by the Minister is that it may give rise to a double benefit and that people who are already using the taxsaver scheme may benefit again.  However, it seems to be permissible and perhaps even encouraged for a cyclist to avail of a double benefit but somebody driving to a station cannot avail of it.  I would not put it as a double benefit, rather, I would put it as an integrated ticket.  Somebody buys an annual ticket that allows them to include their car parking space, which has recently been charged for in the past couple of years, along with their travel pass so it is really one ticket.  I do not see it as two separate things.  Doing it that way encourages consistency and usage of that ticket and makes it a more attractive option for people overall as a package.  <br/><br/>Although I fully support cycling and have seen it done very well in cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam and would like to see Dublin reach that stage, the reality is that my constituency is not a city constituency, as the Minister has acknowledged.  It is a commuter belt constituency.  The idea of a mother in Naas, which is between 4 km and 6 km from Sallins rail station, cycling to the station with three children who need to be drooped off at a cr&egrave;che or a school along the way is not practical.  While cycling should be encouraged, we must be cognisant of the real needs of people.  These are people who are going to work - taxpayers commuting to work who are already coping with multiple demands.  The mother I referred to needs to drive the 6 km to the station and possibly stop two or three times along the way if she has children.  <br/><br/>In terms of managing the scheme, I understand the concern about the unregulated spaces and <i>ad hoc</i>spaces.  That is not suggested.  In the same way as the taxsaver scheme currently operates, it is suggested that it involve approved parking providers, typically Irish Rail and Luas stations and other stations the Department may see fit to designate.  The taxsaver scheme already operates this very well so I do not see why there should be a difficulty identifying that.  <br/><br/>Concern was raised about how one would know whether somebody was abusing the scheme.  The same could be said for a ticket.  How do we know that a person is using the ticket?  Typically in car parks, and I have direct practical experience because I do this every day, the vehicle registration number is recorded and if a different vehicle parks in that space, it is clamped so there is a pretty straightforward and immediate way to detect that.  <br/><br/>I ask the Minister to keep an open mind on this.  It is worthy, there are practical arguments for it and it is part of a packaged approach to public transport.  It is an add-on, not a separate benefit, so I ask the Minister to consider it again this year.  If not, I ask him to keep an open mind.  It is worthy of further consideration.</p></speech>

The issue of a report is something we should never turn our faces against.  It allows us to reach a more informed decision.</p>  <p>  As we are dealing with drivers in this regard, I take this opportunity to highlight a concern relating to one of the best pieces of technology I have seen in a long time from any Department, namely, the Revenue On-Line Service, ROS.  Somebody wishing to register with ROS who wants their pass code issued immediately has to provide two forms of identification.  One of them is a driving licence while the other is details from the person's P60 or a notice of self assessment.  Many people do not drive and do not have driving licences so there should be another form of identification.  For example, a passport number should suffice as well.  The idea of the taxsaver scheme is to encourage people to use public transport.  If we in Donegal had the opportunity to jump on a train, it would be great but I think it was 1963 when the last train rolled into or out of Donegal.  The point stands.  There is a barrier in terms of registering for and instant access to ROS.  I ask Department officials to take this up with Revenue.</p></speech>

It concerns what I and, more importantly, many working in the construction sector believe to be rampant abuse of the category of self employment, particularly in the construction sector, to wrongly categorise workers as self-employed when they are in fact being employed by the main building contractors.  These contractors are wrongly categorising workers they take on as self-employed in order to avoid paying tax, proper wages, sick pay and holiday pay and to get employees on the cheap.  That allegation would be backed up by the sort of advertising made by recruitment agencies.  I may have quoted from one I have with me previously but it gives a flavour of the sort of thing that is going on where recruitment agencies recruiting people in construction are setting out in clear and black-and-white terms how people who work through them can avoid paying proper tax for their employees.  An advertisement from one recruitment agency advertises the fact that if a company works through the agency, the company will not have to pay PRSI, holiday pay, pensions, sick leave, redundancy payments or administration costs of payroll, PAYE or PRSI.  In addition, the advertisement states that the company will not have to pay recruitment or advertising costs, there will be no dispute with employees or unfair dismissal actions and the company will have the ability to hire and fire staff at one hour's notice throughout the country.  The agency says that it can provide labour and staff during busy periods of the year when companies have shortfalls and the company can then get rid of them at an hour's notice.  The advertisement goes on to explain how the biggest advantage is cash flow and that paying staff on a weekly basis and PAYE and PRSI on a monthly basis can put a strain on a company's cash flow.  With this agency, companies do not have to worry about any of these aspects.  </p><p>This happening on a huge scale.  There is flagrant abuse of the tax system in order to avoid paying tax for the benefit of employers, particularly big employers in the construction industry.  We had to do a bit of work to get the figures out of the Department because we got different figures on how many people are categorised in the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system.  When I asked about how many there were, I was told the number was 35,000.  We subsequently discovered that it was 75,000.  When it is considered that there are approximately 130,000 or 135,000 people working in construction - the number is increasing - that means more than half of the people working in construction are apparently self-employed.  That is nonsense.  It is clear evidence of abuse.  </p><p>If the amount of revenue that is not coming in from this tax head is considered, the figures are extraordinary.  In 2008, the revenue coming in from RCT was minus &euro;67 million.  I do not know how many people were employed in construction at that stage.</p><p>I think it was about 90,000 or 100,000 and we got minus &euro;67 million.  In 2009 we got minus &euro;53 million.  It was a bit better in 2010 and 2011, but it was still minus &euro;9 million and minus &euro;6 million.  The latest figures available to me are for 2014 where there is a positive figure, but it is derisory at &euro;27 million even though at that point we were up to 110,000 or 120,000 working in construction - the figure is even higher now - with 60,000 or 70,000 people categorised as self-employed and we only get &euro;27 million back in tax.  The tax for the Exchequer from 75,000 PAYE workers would be multiples of that, but we are getting derisory figures and even, incredibly, minus figures for Revenue because whatever tax they pay they get back in offsets and repayments.<br/><br/>We know from the dispute involving JJ Rhatigan which caught the headlines - it was one of many disputes - that this sort of abuse was going on with one of the biggest contractors in the country, which was building a school for the State.  That company was wrongly classifying bricklayers as being self-employed when they were nothing of the sort.  They were not self-employed entrepreneurs, but people who had been taken on by the contractor as bricklayers only to discover five or six weeks into their employment that they were not getting paid anything.  Then one of them got paid and when the money was divided up among the five employees, it worked out at about &euro;5 an hour.  They were forced to engage in a very long and bitter dispute to highlight the injustice being perpetrated against them.  This was fraudulent behaviour by a major contractor, which is still getting contracts to build schools and other things for the State, in wrongly classifying these workers as self-employed when they were not, in order to avoid paying tax and proper wages.  This stuff is rampant.<br/><br/>Anytime I raise this all I get back from the Minister is a request to report to the Department any individual instances of this of which I am aware.  I actually did so on a few occasions.  About a year ago I mentioned a particular construction site where, I had been informed, this was going on.  When it was raided nine months later, I am informed they found precisely what we said they would find, which was people being wrongly classified as self-employed.  That is just one workplace.<br/><br/>The evidence from the lack of tax revenue coming back and the fantastic and unbelievable numbers of people who are supposedly self-employed in the construction sector would suggest this is rampant.  Yet the Government is unwilling to close down this abuse and ensure that workers who should be employed as PAYE workers are employed as PAYE workers, thus requiring their employers to pay all the proper pay and entitlements that an employer should pay for an employee.<br/><br/>Is the unwillingness by this and previous governments to go after this because it means being able to get State contracts done on the cheap?  Of course, if contractors can abuse workers and abuse the tax system in this way, they can put in bids that undercut contractors who actually pay their employees properly and employ them on proper terms and conditions.  I think the State is deliberately turning a blind eye to this because it is a way of getting contracts done cheaply.  Therefore the authorities do not really want to go after it; they might do the odd raid if prodded by a Member of this House.  If ICTU or construction workers cry foul about it as they do on a regular basis, we might get some tokenistic action from Revenue, but then we just go back to ignoring it again and we let it happen.<br/><br/>The number of people working in construction is shooting up again.  An article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>a few weeks ago noted that almost in direct proportion to the very significant increase in the numbers in construction, the number of people being classified as self-employed has shot up as well.  As the construction sector expands, this abuse expands again, just as it had done during the Celtic tiger period when the construction sector was at its height and abuse was rampant.<br/><br/>That is my contention and more importantly it is the contention of building workers who have been campaigning, protesting and forced to take industrial action about this for many years.  While Government Members often say, &quot;You guys and people out there don't want to pay any tax&quot;, incredibly, we have a cohort of construction workers who go on strike and protest for the right to pay tax, but the State is not interested in vindicating their right to pay proper taxes.  The workers want it because they know it means they are employed on proper pay and conditions and have the entitlements that employees should have.<br/><br/>The amendment seeks to insert into the Finance Bill a requirement to look at this area seriously and address the problem.  It is in the interests of the State, the Exchequer and the wider public not to mention in the interests of tens of thousands of construction workers who want the Minister to address this.  It is a very reasonable amendment and if the Government cares about getting tax revenue in, cares about tax compliance and cares about the conditions of workers in the construction sector, it should agree to the amendment and go after the issue in a serious way to close down this wholesale abuse.</p></speech>

Anyone familiar with working the eRCT system for principal contractors will know that for any contract that is undertaken he has to specify the value, the location and whether the contractor has insurance.  All these details are available for the Revenue Commissioners to do aspect queries and audits.  Essentially, anyone who is abusing this is in clear breach of the law and it is the job of the Revenue Commissioners to enforce the law.  We know that there has been a huge increase in the budget for compliance and audits.</p>  <p>  There is genuine self-employment and we should not tarnish everything with the one brush.  As construction increases, it is only natural that the number of subcontractors will increase because there are genuine subcontractors.  The principles in terms of the cornerstone for self-employment are very clearly set out.  They are very clear in terms of the principles to which a person must adhere to be termed self-employed.  The employer bears a huge responsibility if he is paying subcontractors or contractors who are not genuinely self-employed and he is accountable for that to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  Obviously RCT is a preliminary tax involving all tax heads; it is a security tax.  Contractors who are zero-rated must now have significant history of tax returns with the Revenue Commissioners.  I bet there is nobody in here who actually operated an RCT system and who actually sees the significant level of compliance of contractors at the moment.</p></speech>

This issue is only going to be solved by looking at the definition of "self-employment" and recognising that there are many people who are genuinely self-employed but that there is also an increasing number of people who are not genuinely self-employed.  I do not believe Deputy Boyd Barrett acknowledges the number of people in various trades in the building industry who are genuinely self-employed.  It would be foolish to suggest that they are not self-employed.  We should move from the fantasy that nobody in the building industry is self-employed.  Many members of my family work in the building trade and it is really hard to tell a young man in his late teens or early 20s that he ought to be properly and fully insured.  At that age people prefer to see more money in their hand and they do not think there will ever be a day when they might be unemployed or, God forbid, that they could have an accident in which they would end up being laid off work.  The real problem arises if they are self-employed in a bogus way when they ought to be employees.  The building trade in a boom and bust situation, or even outside a boom and bust situation, can be capricious and uncertain and weather can intervene in projects.  People then have no fall back.  The social consequences for society is that we have a group of people who fail to build up pension entitlements and other social insurance entitlements and they are left with nothing.  Equally, other people end up paying.  If they are doing well in self-employment they can end up paying an awful lot of money for private income continuance plans when, in fact, if they were included in a proper pay related social insurance structure, they would be entitled to a retirement pension.</p> <p> The third aspect is the impact on the general taxpayer where we have a large grey area around taxation compliance.  The Revenue Commissioners have done a big job of improving the RCT system but there are too many people in it.  While this measure relates to employment in the construction industry, there are issues around, for example, those who do deliveries, such as the Deliveroo people, and other trades.  The issues may also be moving in to the taxi area.  Thankfully, Ireland has stronger laws than the UK with regard to employment structures, hours of work, etc., but as that scope study and review was initiated some time ago, I would appreciate if the Minister would advise Members as to when the report might become available.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners have worked on it, and if there is more work that needs to be done by the Department of Social Protection, I am sure the Minister could pass on that message to his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar.</p> <p> I acknowledge Deputy Peter Burke's contribution.  Another situation also arises because of the way the building industry operates.  While many contractors go out of their way to comply with regulations and are very careful about that, there are also situations where large numbers of people are effectively bogus self-employed by particular contractors and those kinds of jobs lay the ground for risk-taking in health and safety matters.  There are many negative, knock-on consequences, including the potential for fraud on the taxpayer and a loss of taxation.  We spoke in the House earlier about how much it costs to build a house, but if a large proportion of the money currently being invested in buying houses, by young couples or by older people buying homes for retirement, ends up in the grey economy, it is not going to do the rest of us any good.  While this is a very difficult area to regulate, I believe it is worth doing.  I welcome any detailed review.  As there is a review under way, it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate when it might be available.</p></speech>

The design and development of the relevant contracts tax system was an anti-tax evasion measure to counteract tax evasion in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.  Principal contractors are required to deduct tax from the payments made to sub-contractors and pay it over to Revenue.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant sub-contractors, provision is made for these compliant sub-contractors to receive payments without deduction of tax.  The electronic relevant contracts tax, eRCT, system was introduced with effect from 1 January 2012 and it has reduced substantially the opportunities for fraud, mainly from bogus documentation, which attached to the previous paper-based relevant contracts tax system.  As I have said, the eRCT system does not determine the employment status of any individual engaged in the construction industry.  Where the parties have entered into a contract for employment, where there is a principal and sub-contractor relationship, the eRCT system operates to determine the tax obligations on all parties.  Having regard to the start your business relief provisions, introduced by Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, there is a tax incentive for individuals to operate as self-employed where these individuals have been unemployed for more than 12 months.  These individuals may earn up to &euro;40,000 tax free in the first two years of trading.  This is likely to be a factor in explaining the growth of self-employment within the construction sector.</p>  <p>  Where the parties have entered into a contract of employment, such as where there is an employer-employee relationship, then PAYE operates on all payments made.  The Revenue Commissioners have undertaken to examine any cases brought to their attention of bogus self-employment.  In 2015, a sector specific compliance programme was initiated for the construction industry which included a focus on the misclassification of employees by employers.  Interventions by Revenue into the construction industry in 2015, which have included audits, resulted in additional yield for the Exchequer of &euro;51 million.</p>  <p>  The code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals was created to assist both parties to an engagement, including an engagement in the construction sector, in determining if a contract of engagement is, by its nature, either a contract of service - an employer and employee arrangement - or a contract for service - not an employer and employee relationship.  The code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals is not a Revenue code but was compiled with the assistance of a variety of Government and representative organisations.  For the reasons I have just outlined, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>  <p>  In 2103 the gross yield of relevant contracts tax, RTC, to the Exchequer was &euro;132 million, in 2014, it was &euro;172 million and in 2015, it was &euro;174 million.  The working group has been examining the issue of the use of intermediary type employment structures and self-employment arrangements, their impact on tax and PRSI and, as Deputy Burton referred to, a report on the submissions is being prepared by the working group which will be finalised in the very near future.  It will identify possible options for addressing the loss to the Exchequer and will also look at the broader issues of disguised employment.  Officials are at an advanced stage of drafting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.62" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300014#M00100"><p>I will still press this.  Primarily because of the actions of workers themselves protesting, backed up by some of the trade union movement, there have been some moves in this direction.  What the Minister seems to have said, if I heard him correctly, is that when audits are done and when there is a bit of an increased focus on this we end up getting more money in, and the Minister mentioned the figure of &euro;51 million as a result of a bit of serious focus being put on this.  This suggests if we really close down this abuse there would be a hell of a lot more revenue coming in.</p>  <p>  It is quite extraordinary that between 2008 and 2014, &euro;2.3 billion was collected under RCT but &euro;2.4 billion was paid back in refunds and offsets.  Over a six or seven year period we had a minus figure for this tax head in which 70,000 or 80,000 people are employed.  There is something seriously amiss.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Burton, I did not for one moment suggest there is not legitimate self-employment in the sector.  What I did suggest is that it is not credible in the construction sector where 135,000 people are employed that 70,000 or 75,000 of them are self-employed.  This is not credible.  This suggests wholesale abuse of the classification of self-employment.  We have lots of evidence this abuse is happening.  We need to take this much more seriously and we need to move to close it down.  Any contractor found guilty of this should be banned from ever getting State contracts.</p></speech>

Every year for the past number of years I have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill similar to that tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I mentioned on Committee Stage the ongoing work announced earlier in the year.  This has been dragging out.  I agree with Deputy Burton there are legitimate self-employed people and nobody is suggesting there are not.  There are many of them, including friends of mine and family members.  This is not the issue here.  The issue is if the Minister knows what is happening on the street and if he speaks to individuals who are chippies or bricklayers or doing a bit of plastering, they will tell him they know they must present themselves as self-employed.  This is just the way it is.  It has become the accepted norm.  This is because it has been going on not for the past number of weeks or months but the past decade.  This was here during the boom times.</p>  <p>  We have all the consequences in terms of entitlements, and the serious consequences if someone was seriously injured on a building site, or lost his or her life, given the difference between being self-employed and being an employee.  Where I agree with Deputy Burton is some people, particularly younger people, do not see the value of being insured.  They do not see themselves falling ill, getting injured or being made unemployed.  Some of them go from day to day or week to week.  Others just know this is the only way they will get employment and this is now the accepted norm.  What is lacking is an urgency from the Government and a very strong statement to say this clampdown is happening.  There are two sides to this.  There is workers' rights and lost revenue or revenue foregone to the State.  For this reason, it needs to be dealt with in far more urgency than the Government has shown heretofore.</p>  <p>  I am not sure for how many years I have tabled this type of amendment, but it has been going on for a number of years.  I hope that next year we will not have to table an amendment looking for a report into bogus self-employment and the work will have been done by Revenue to ensure it has clamped down.  What Deputy Boyd Barrett is asking for is something that is worthy of acceptance.  It is similar to what I have argued for in previous years.  It would begin to send a very clear signal.  What is required is a very strong statement from the Minister and the Government to individuals, businesses, companies and developers who support and promote this that it is over, their days are numbered regarding the scheme and we are giving them notice they need to move away from this type of facilitation and encouragement of this type of bogus self-employment, and ample time to do so and, if they do not, we are willing to come in as a Parliament with very stiff penalties.  What we should not see in next year's finance Bill is that we are giving them 12 months or two years to get their house in order.  The statements need to be made now that there is a clampdown on this and we will not tolerate it in terms of workers' rights or lost tax to the Exchequer, and that notice is being issued on the floor of the D&aacute;il today.</p></speech>

The figures Deputy Boyd Barrett has put on the record are startling.  To his credit, this is an issue he has raised consistently.  There is undoubtedly an issue here and Revenue and the Department need to have a very hard to look at it.  Not only are there consequences for the Exchequer by way of taxation receipts, but there are very serious consequences for the workers themselves in terms of the absence of job security and the lack of any benefits they may need in the event of ill-health.  They suffer the same deficits as other self-employed people encounter in this regard in the social protection system.</p>  <p>  The reality must be that where all of the characteristics of employment are in place, it should be regarded as employment and not self-employment.  While this has been evolving for a number of years in the construction sector, we are beginning to see it in a number of other sectors also.  It is a real issue of concern that bogus self-employment is creeping its way across various sectors of the economy.  It is very evident in construction, and all of the issues around this have been highlighted, but it is increasingly going to become an issue in many other sectors of the economy.  There must be a very clear dividing line between what constitutes employment and what constitutes self-employment.  Where all the characteristics of employment are in place, the law and all of the agencies in the State need to be very strong in insisting they are reinforced by contracts of employment and all of the rights and obligations for the employer and employee that come with these.</p></speech>

It is a preliminary collecting tax for all other tax heads, such as VAT and income tax.  By its very nature we cannot judge how much it takes in a year.  There will be offsets from year to year because it must go to another position in the tax system.  It is not a tax on income.  It can misrepresent the facts when minus figures are quoted because from tax year to year there can be overlaps.</p></speech>

He has been supplied with the information previously which shows they are incorrect.  In an exchange with me in the House it was pointed out to him the discrepancy between 34,000 and approximately 75,000 arises from the fact 34,000 subcontractors are active in the RCT system but they employ 75,386.  It is the difference between the numbers employed and the numbers of subcontractors.  The Deputy was given this information.  Revenue wrote to him on 17 July 2015 and practically all of the information he is still putting on the record was corrected in a very lengthy letter by the Revenue Commissioners personally to him.</p><p>The Deputy's assertion is not correct, unless he is challenging the figures given to him by Revenue and which Revenue has said are not correct.  There is a general issue and I will ensure Revenue is made aware of our exchange of views today but the Revenue Commissioners feel they are on top of the issue and are not closing their eyes to it.  They are pursuing it actively and are making serious progress.  I will ensure they are made aware of the views expressed in the debate today.</p></speech>

It is causing enormous grief, devastation, fear, anxiety and worry.  In the past two weeks in Cork, it is believed that up to 16 people have died by suicide.  A multi-agency response has been organised and a task force is to meet next month to respond to the situation.  The rate of suicides in the city and county of Cork is almost twice the national average and Ireland is fourth highest in the table of suicides among those aged between 15 and 19.  Mental health campaigner Conor Cusack has called for the establishment of 24-7 emotional well-being centres in response to the carnage caused by this particular crisis.  He correctly makes the point that it is not just a Government or health service issue but a whole-of-society issue and that we all share a responsibility to make a change.  It is in that spirit that I raise the issue today.  We in this House also have a responsibility and we should put party political differences to one side and think outside the box so that we can not just send the right signals on this issue, but respond effectively and with some degree of substance.</p>  <p>  Last week Deputy James Browne tabled a Private Members' motion and in all the contributions there was a common consensus on what was needed.  Initially, people thought an additional &euro;35 million was to be allocated to the mental health budget.  It turns out that it is &euro;15 million and will become &euro;35 million in a full year in 2018 and 2019 but the wrong signal was sent by that message.  Collectively, we should resolve to find the other &euro;20 million and spend it on the problem.  I do not believe the health service can only absorb &euro;15 million extra for mental health.  There are issues with the filling of posts but even if that is the case we can resource non-governmental organisations more, such as Pieta House, Aware and others who provide vital counselling services.  The primary care counselling service could be expanded and the income threshold could be raised because, at the moment, it is only applicable to medical card holders and not available to children or teens to the degree that it should be.  The Jigsaw programme could be expanded and staffing levels in child and adolescent services are 48% below recommended levels.</p>  <p>  This is an enormous issue within the community and I question whether we are sending the right signals to the public.  With a bit of a will we could do more.  We need a national dialogue but, in the interim, we should find the additional resources for the community-based interventions and non-governmental organisations so they have the help and resources to deal with this crisis.</p></speech>

It is hard to disagree with anybody who says we have to do more in terms of a national conversation to deal with the many problems people have.  I talked to people involved in third level and many of the services they offer are unable to cope with the fragility of many young people.  Our young people display a remarkable confidence yet they are also very fragile and talk about mental health issues in a way that previous generations never did.  The appointment of a Minister dealing specifically with mental health opens the opportunity to have these discussions and the budget of the national suicide prevention office has been doubled since 2011.  The total allocation for mental health will be &euro;851.3 million in 2017.  That will not bring anybody back but it is an increase of &euro;140 million on what was there before.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin is right to speak of his own area, which he knows better than most.  I offer my sympathy and condolences to families affected by this spate of suicides.  Over the past few weeks, concerns have been raised by HSE staff and communities about the number of deaths in the Togher and Ballyphehane area of the south side of Cork city.  A co-ordinated approach, led by the HSE head of mental health services for Cork and Kerry and involving HSE suicide prevention officers, community workers and HSE psychologists and linking with the voluntary sector, has been initiated and a community meeting took place on 14 November.  That group is working very closely with the two schools that are affected and close friends, relatives and school and work colleagues of the deceased have been identified and offered support and counselling, while two individuals have been identified as requiring immediate support and their families have been contacted by the child and adolescent mental health services.  The HSE suicide prevention officer has made direct contact with the staff in both schools and established links between schools with community-based services such as Pieta House and the National Educational Psychological Service.  The schools have offered immediate one-on-one sessions with any vulnerable student and the suicide crisis assessment nurse in the area has been briefed by the local suicide prevention officer, which means that local GPs will also have the relevant information.  A new Jigsaw hub is to be opened in Cork and the national task force on youth mental health has been established, one of whose main aims is to increase awareness, not only of mental health but of the assistance that is also available for young people throughout the country.  I have some more information about Cork which I can provide in response to the Deputy's supplementary question.</p></speech>

There are huge shortages, though I understand that the service cannot fill those posts.  However, there is a lot that can be done in 2017 and we should move to identify those priorities.  One of those is counselling.  There is a lack of counselling and we could move faster on the ex-quota guidance counsellors on which there has been a start this year.</p><p>The primary care counselling service is another and a change could be made to give more access to people on low incomes but who might be above the medical card threshold.  I use those merely as illustrations.  The Taoiseach could support the non-governmental organisations more which also are intervening with young people.  We could do that in 2017.  Where there is a will there is a way and I believe every Member of the Oireachtas would support that.  It would not have to go to a vote or by way of a motion because we can all do that, but action is needed.  People, particularly young people who often can be disconnected from politics or the political system, need positive real signals from us that we can make a difference and intervene with effect, purpose and substance.  I put that to the Taoiseach and he might reflect on that.  I would like to discuss it again with him and follow through with other party leaders to see what in the short term could be done in 2017 to show people that mental health is the priority above and beyond other issues, and that it is not waiting its place in the queue.  There is a real fear and anxiety.  The Taoiseach mentioned Ballyphehane and other such areas but it is happening across the country.  It is a national issue and we must respond to that fear and anxiety as the country's political leaders.  I thank the Taoiseach for his response.</p></speech>

That has been expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on many occasions, but it is also a fact that for 2017 the amount being allocated to the general mental health area is &euro;140 million more than last year, at &euro;851.3 million.  The Deputy is right that this in itself does not deal with the matter but what does deal with it is the extent of assistance and help that is available and it is on that we should concentrate.  That is why that community meeting, to which I referred, took place on 14 November.  It was agreed at that meeting that safeTALK workshops will take place in the area to explain to young people about their value and worth as persons, of the assistance that is available for them, that if any person has a little problem or needs to talk to somebody that they do not need to be afraid to do that and that young people talk about this on a very regular basis.  The work department of the HSE and the community are completing the local needs analysis.  It is appropriate to say that the task force on mental health set up by the Minister of State is working through the communities to explain to young people that if they have an issue, a concern or an anxiety there is a lot of help available, and that is being channelled through the allocation for 2017.  It is a case of having the resources we did not have there before, although perhaps they are not enough but a lot of help is available for a lot of communities.  While it will not bring anybody back, it may well prevent somebody from taking that ultimate tragic step.</p></speech>

There is not a lot of help available.  This morning we have an article the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on 16 suicides that have happened in Cork in the past fortnight.  Today it is Cork, another day it will be Kerry or Louth or Belfast.  All sections and generations are affected by this issue from the very young to the very old in urban and in rural areas.  I know the Taoiseach has had personal experience of this.  It is at a human cost beyond comprehension.  One in seven adults experience mental health challenges in any given year.  In 2015, there were 451 recorded suicides in this State and there were 318 in the North.  We all know that under-reporting is widespread, so the real figure across the island may be as high as 1,000.  It is also recorded that at least 8,790 citizens presented with self-harm at hospitals in this State.</p><p>I will cite a local example.  The Ladywell mental health service in Dundalk provides services for most of north Louth.  Its staff are extremely dedicated but the rooms they operate from were originally hospital staff quarters and date back to when the Louth Hospital was built 70 years ago.  Some of the rooms are closed because of dampness.  The maintenance bill alone is a huge drain on the service's resources.  Staff numbers have increased but there is no room for them at the Ladywell facility so they are based in Ardee.  This means that people in Carlingford who need to access the service have to travel to Ardee, which is entirely unacceptable.  That is an example of the service available in that area.</p><p>The State's mental health policy, A Vision for Change, is ten years old and ten years on there is still an absence of 27-7 crisis care.  Staffing levels are 75% of the recommended number in A Vision for Change and in some cases they are well behind that figure.  Staffing in child and adolescent teams is half that which is recommended.  A Vision for Change commits the Government to providing 8.24% of the health budget to mental health services.  That target has never been met and that pattern is repeated in this year's budget.  An allocation of &euro;35 million was announced but the Minister then said that only &euro;15 million in additional funds would be provided for next year.  That is an increase of less than 2%.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is doing her best and we wish her well.  All parties and all Independents should work with her but the Taoiseach needs to give her the required resources.</p><p>The fact is that this Government has failed like the previous Government to implement the A Vision for Change strategy.  Will the Government commit to publishing a time-lined implementation plan - it does not need to do it today but it could do it next week - for the outstanding elements of A Vision for Change? </p></speech>

A Vision for Change was published with the intent of implementing it in full.  That is a challenge but I do not disagree with it.  It was not published for the sake of just having another publication.</p>  <p>  The Headstrong organisation developed the Jigsaw model and it is now delivered throughout quite a number of counties including Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, Kerry, Meath, north Fingal, Dublin 15, Tallaght and Clondalkin and it is to be extended to other areas.  The Jigsaw unit in Cork will be operational in 2017 and the HSE provides over &euro;9 million there.  I have experience of some of these having visited them.  They are organised, run and structured by young people and it is amazing the way they connect with each other as young people to help those who have particular challenges or little concerns.</p>  <p>  The national task force on mental health, which people had sought for a long time, was set up by the Minister of State in the first 100 days of Government and it deals not only with young people but also with older people.  It is made up of a diverse group of 18 leading national figures who are very competent to speak on these matters.  They represent a number of different sectors, including the public, private, community and voluntary sectors, and look at the areas of improving emotional literacy in the population; awareness of the services and the supports that are available; accessibility to those services and the supports at different times and in different areas; and the alignment of the services and the supports, which is important, across different providers in terms of public, private, community and voluntary organisations.  That task force has held three very productive meetings.  It agreed key factors for its work.  It has visited front-line services, including a number of the units around the country, where it met the service users, parents and front-line staff.  One of the elements of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee's, commitment is to ensure the voice of young people and children are at the centre of that task force's work.  The first in a series of consultations was held with young people aged between 19 and 25 on 17 November.  The young people discussed what help and assistance would be useful, what hurts their mental health, what impacts on them, the changes they would like to see the task force deliver, and a report on this will be brought to the task force's December meeting.  Each task force member has identified a number of individuals or organisations in their sector that have a depth of expertise and experience of youth mental health issues, services and solutions to form a small community of practice that will be available to those who need it and that will also offer views, ideas and perspectives from their sector to the task force being charged by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  That helps to ensure that the work of the task force is informed in the best way possible because it is coming from young people.</p>  <p>  I also add that the Government has made money available to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for a major development at Portrane at a cost of &euro;40 million plus, which has been awaited for nearly 100 years.</p></speech>

Headstrong; Jigsaw which is a great programme; the personal independence payment, PIP; Save Our Sons and Daughters, SOSAD; and Circle of Hope are all great initiatives.  Advocates such as Conor Cusack, the Rubberbandits and Bressie have engaged in a lot of consciousness-raising, particularly of stigma.  However, it is not enough because they cannot do it alone.  A vital part of dealing with the risk of suicide is having adequate services in place throughout the day, seven days a week.  A 24/7 intervention service is possible, but the Government needs to make it a priority.  If it does not do so, it will not happen.  I have been working on this issue for about 25 years, North and South.  Many of those who will take their own lives will never be in touch with the mental health service.  Given the absence of services, that is hardly surprising.  There is almost - I use the term advisedly - a copycat element to suicides in some parishes and communities.  My point to the Taoiseach and everybody else is that we must recognise this as a national emergency and put in place measures to tackle it.  We need action and an emergency task force to be set up across the State which would work in co-operation with colleagues in the North and local communities.  I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach to commit to dealing with this as an emergency and act on it as he would in any other emergency.</p></speech>

However, within our first 100 days in government, the national task force on youth mental health was established.  It comprises 18 leading national figures.  Its intent is to draw on the concerns and anxieties and the conversation of young people to address what they believe impacts on their mental health and the extent to which they have access to the supports and assistance available.  People should understand that if they know somebody with mental health difficulties through their digital connections - Facebook or the other ways in which young people connect with each other - help and assistance are available in a way that they were never available before.  The structure being put in place by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will be built on in the time ahead.  More than &euro;800 million has been allocated for general mental health services in 2017, up &euro;120 million on the previous allocation.  While it is never enough, this shows that mental health service provision is a priority for the Government.  I accept the remarks made by Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Gerry Adams.  Nobody in this House, of any party and none, disagrees with the concept of a national response to what, sadly, is a tragic phenomenon.  The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is working exceptionally hard to spread the message throughout the congregations of young people, and older people, that if they have mental health difficulties and are challenged in whatever way, there is a lot of assistance and support available.  I hope this will prevent, in whatever numbers, those who might be inclined to take the ultimate tragic step from doing so.</p></speech>

As I think it is the first Private Members' Bill that will pass all Stages in either House since the general election, I am naturally pleased that the Government has accepted the legislation and tabled useful amendments to improve it.  The Bill only deals with the one aspect of bogus self-employment.  There are pernicious and unacceptable arrangements simply to save bogus employers the cost of social insurance.  Employees are coerced into falsely describing themselves as self-employed or independent contractors and, in so doing, are required to exclude themselves from the protection of employment law and the welfare system.  The European Court has ruled that one is falsely self-employed if one does the same work as an employee, if one is in a relationship of subordination and required to follow instructions about the time, place and content of one's work and if one is integrated into the employer's undertaking.  The Bill the Labour Party presented to the Seanad directs regulators to see through this sham and address the reality rather than the pretence.  In truth, the people affected are employees and must be treated as such, with access to the rights granted in and the procedures of the employment system.  The Bill is a first step and deals with just the one aspect: the right to join a trade union and bargain collectively.  Does acceptance of the Bill in the other House signal a new approach to the issue, namely, a determination to tackle bogus self-employment?  With a statutory definition now available, as agreed by the other House, will the Government ask the tax and welfare authorities to fully engage on the issue?  Each has its own investigative unit.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection to address and identify the issue of bogus self-employment?  Is the Government determined to use all of its powers to stamp out a practice that is destructive of employees' security and rights and bring employers and employees back into the correct and proper environment regulated by law?</p></speech>

I am glad that the Bill brought forward by the Deputy's party in the Seanad was accepted, with amendments.  I assume that the Deputy will bring the Bill before this House in Private Members' time.  If it has been accepted by the Government in the Seanad, I do not see what objections will arise in the meantime.  We will need to study the implications of the Bill fully, but its intent is correct.  It is right that there be proper legal coverage for employees and no bogus employers.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are engaged on the issue and that a joint working group has been set up.  Enforcement is being stepped up, especially in the construction sector in which elements of bogus self-employment were clearly evident.  I suggest the Deputy bring the Bill before this House.  In the meantime, the working group set up by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection will continue to focus on the issues in hand.</p></speech>

Bogus self-employment costs the Exchequer millions of euro in lost tax  social security contributions, but, more importantly, it deprives workers of a vital social safety net.  As the Taoiseach referenced, a consultative process on bogus self-employment was initiated by my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, when she was Minister for Social Protection, and ran up to 31 March this year.  What was the outcome of that consultation?  Will the working group publish a report and, if so, when?  Will it publish recommendations and, if so, when will we see them?  Private Members' time is very scarce for all of us on the Opposition benches.  May we have agreement to take a Bill such as this outside the time allocated for both Government and Opposition business if it is an issue of such importance?</p></speech>

The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, welcomed the cross-party agreement in the Seanad on 10 November.  The Competition (Amendment) Bill was introduced, as Deputy Brendan Howlin knows, by Senators Ivana Bacik and Gerald Nash.  When enacted, three categories of workers, namely, voice-over actors, session musicians and freelance journalists, will be exempt from section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 and allowed to engage in collective bargaining.</p><p>Additionally, a formal response is set out allowing trade unions to apply for similar exemptions for certain categories of self-employed workers.  The Minister was happy to work with Senators Ivana Bacik and Gerald Nash in that regard and they were complimented on the collaborative way in which they had worked with the Government.  As the working group established by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection decide on the issues to be dealt with, the Minister will make a response when it has finalised its work.  I am sure enforcement is being stepped up.</p></speech>

Also a new Schedule 4 is to be inserted into the Competition Act to give effect to a previous Government commitment, given in the programme of Government, Towards 2016, on review and transitional arrangements.  The exemptions will take effect when the Bill comes into force and an application for an exemption will not be required for the three categories listed in the Schedule.  The amendments allow the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to bring the legislation into operation by order, with different days being appointed for different purposes, as the Deputy is well aware.  It also provides that the entire legislation shall come into operation no later than three months after its enactment.  If the Business Committee decides to take the Bill early, I do not see why it cannot have the support of the House and be passed into law.</p></speech>

This Friday women around the world are, for the first time, being asked to go on strike or wear black as part of an international day of action against violence perpetrated against women.  One in three women in the world will in her lifetime have experienced being beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused.  Safe Ireland estimates that one in four Irish women has experienced physical and sexual violence by a male partner or non-partner since the age of 15 years.  One in three has experienced psychological violence which can also be extremely difficult.  At what is meant to be a special time in a woman's life, the Rotunda Hospital estimates that one in eight pregnant women experiences violence.  Imagine if 25% of all violent crimes involved a man assaulting his wife or a partner or if this was gangland crime, it would be shouted from the rooftops and there would be screaming headlines, but this issue is barely spoken about in schools or workplaces.  How much of a priority is it for the Government?  How much does it care about the issue of domestic violence and violence against women?  Based on the evidence, it does not rate very highly.</p>  <p>  The question is often asked, "Why does she stay?"  What can a woman expect if she tries to escape a violent relationship in Enda Kenny's Ireland?  First, she may not be lucky enough to even get through on the telephone to one of the helplines because the Government has systematically cut funding for organisations such as Women's Aid.  If she seeks refuge, she will probably become one of 6,000, the number of women who were turned away from refuges last year, amounting to 16 every day.  Does the Taoiseach know what happens to them?  That is a jump of 1,000 on the figure for the previous year, but the Minister responsible for housing is only promising to provide eight refuge spaces next year.  If a woman needs to move on from a refuge, there is no housing available because of the housing crisis that has been allowed to fester.  The domestic violence charity Sonas told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing and Homelessness that many women were staying in the home to be abused rather than risk homelessness.  If a woman tries to obtain a safety order, she will hit a wall as the waiting time for a hearing at Dolphin House is 20 weeks and there are no emergency barring orders granted when a court is not in session.  The Government has increased free legal aid fees from &euro;50 to &euro;130 since 2013 alone.</p>  <p>  In a "Prime Time" special last night we saw the level of violence against women.  Male violence is a product of centuries of patriarchal culture and I am not asking the Taoiseach to solve it in one day.  Will he specifically agree to increase the number of refuge spaces to the European norm of one per 10,000 people?  Will he agree to provide rent allowance for any woman fleeing domestic violence?  Will he stop the cuts for the rape crisis centres, Women's Aid and other services and instead invest properly in them?  Will he also agree to the legislative changes we need?  Will he drop the fees for any woman who is seeking a protection order?</p></speech>

Those who beat women shame manhood.  It is a crime to beat a woman and those who profess, in their manhood and machismo, that they are doing good by beating women do down themselves, their families and the nation.  I am appalled by it.  The two words "domestic" and "violence" should never go together.  Only last week the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality launched the "What Would You Do?" campaign on domestic violence which is part of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence campaign, 2016 to 2021.  It is about prevention, empowerment and support.  It offers hope and help to victims of violence and empowers us as witnesses of such violence to find out what we can do to help stop domestic violence and support those caught up in it.</p>  <p>  I recently had the privilege to present certificate awards to members of the Traveller community and had a long conversation with some of the women present.  They had never spoken about domestic violence, although many of them experienced it.  We are now trying in that category to train a number of a counsellors to draw out these women to speak about their experiences and do something about it.  We signed the Istanbul Convention on 5 November 2015 and the Government is following a multi-annual action plan to deal with the remaining legislative and administrative issues raised by the Deputy.  When implemented, the measures will allow us to ratify the convention.  The domestic violence Bill will represent a major step forward on Ireland's path towards ratification.  It is at an advanced stage of drafting.  It is intended that it will be submitted for Government approval and publication before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Provisions on domestic violence will be brought together in one piece of legislation to make it easier to use.  Other improvements made in the Bill include extension of access to an interim barring order for eight working days in an emergency or crisis; a provision that a person will no longer have to have a greater or equal property interest in the property from which a perpetrator is barred; while a victim will be able to bring a friend, family member or support worker into court during proceedings.  Additionally, it will be possible for a victim to give evidence by video link to avoid the risk of intimidation or being beaten up by a perpetrator or an associate.  The anonymity of a victim, dependants and the perpetrator will be protected in criminal proceedings for breaches of orders, other than where the victim chooses not to be anonymous.  This is intended to protect the privacy of a victim.  the media will be able to report on proceedings, provided they respect the obligations concerning anonymity.  It will also be possible to bar a perpetrator from communicating electronically with a victim.</p>  <p>  This is a priority matter for the Minister and the Government and we will follow through on these and other issues.</p></speech>

Women are now in more danger since he came to power than they were before because of the housing crisis, in particular.</p><p>There are more women who cannot get into refuges and have nowhere to go.  Following the recent horrific murder-suicide of an entire family, a woman's memory was completely obliterated by the media.  That is the position on male violence against women.  One of the features of the "Prime Time" programme was that young women were in severe danger in relationships also.  Approximately 60% of abuse starts before the age of 25 years.  We are in the ha'penny place when it comes to things like stalking legislation.  New revenge porn weapons and tools are being used by men to control or abuse women.  The macho culture that objectifies and abuses women is continuing unabated.  This Friday women will gather on the Rosie Hackett Bridge in Dublin at 1 p.m. and St. Patrick's Bridge in Cork at 5 p.m. to protest against violence against women and the ongoing eighth amendment.  Women in 30 countries will take part in similar protests.  Women are becoming politicised and radicalised and will not put up with this like they might have had to do in the past.</p></speech>

Tusla is being granted an increase of &euro;37 million in 2017.  It will result in increased expenditure on the work it does in various areas throughout the country such as the provision of funding for 147 family units of emergency refuge space and eight family units of emergency non-refuge space.  In the course of this year eight additional family units of accommodation, six additional units of emergency refuge accommodation in Dublin and Kildare and two emergency safe housing units in Sligo were funded by Tusla.

We are all aware of the extraordinary cost of car insurance for many, particularly young people.  There have been increases of over 40% in some cases.  I think it demands urgent intervention by the Government.  It has been reported that an Oireachtas committee could recommend that drivers be able to access car insurance elsewhere in Europe, or that there be a European dimension to this issue.  Obviously, strong regulatory provisions would be required in the interests of protection, etc.  I put it to the Taoiseach that when this happened in the mid-2000s, there were dramatic reductions through the introduction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the acceptance of the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  Will the Government introduce legislation to implement its commitments in the programme for Government?  Will it take action to reduce car insurance costs dramatically?</p></speech>

The working group that the Government set up during the summer under the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, published its emerging recommendations earlier this week and will publish a report next month setting out the 40 or so actions it intends to implement to reform the motor insurance sector.  Legislative changes will be made as a result in areas such as the Injuries Board, the Road Traffic Acts and the Civil Liability and Courts Act.  The action taken in 2003 was a response to the particular issue of the impact of road accidents on the cost of insurance generally.  We are seeing different factors contributing to the spike in premiums that we have seen in the past 12 months, in particular.  We will not be able to go back to the cheap premiums we enjoyed in previous years, but we can make legislative changes and bring additional transparency to how the insurance industry works with the aim of stabilising the current volatility in prices and, as the recommendations work their way through, bringing prices down over time.</p></speech>

Just last week, we learned that the review had not commenced.  The Minister for Health has admitted that he has not moved beyond the preliminary work to determine the terms of reference for the review.  It is taking so long to agree to the terms of reference that it is no wonder the health service is in the crisis it is in.  Will the Taoiseach bring some clarity to the matter?  Will he tell us when we will finally see the terms of reference for the bed capacity review?  Will the review be completed by next year, in time inclusion in the 2016-21 capital plan?</p></speech>

I noted this morning that the number of patients on trolleys in special delivery units had decreased since yesterday.  Norovirus - the winter vomiting bug - is causing a problem in St. Vincent's University Hospital and the hospitals in Wexford, Letterkenny, Waterford and Cork.  Some of these hospitals have had particularly high attendances.  Tallaght Hospital continues to have 20 beds closed owing to the CRE bug.  There has been a surge in the number of orthopaedic patients and medical admissions because of the adverse weather.  Norovirus is having a serious impact on hospitals.  I will have the Deputy apprised of the work the Minister is doing on the beds issue.</p></speech>

As a result of that decision, such vacancies are now advertised - it is open to every member of the general public to apply - and the Public Appointments Service shortlists people it independently deems to be appropriate.  Has the previous Government's decision on appointments to State boards been changed?  Has any member of the Government indicated to the Taoiseach that he or she has a difficulty with the transparent process now in place?</p></speech>

Their aim was to mobilise landless tenants to improve their lot and two of their key demands were for fair rents and fixity of tenure.  Renters continue to experience difficulties with these issues 140 years on.  We know that 750,000 people across the State live in the private rented sector and that one in four households here in Dublin rents.  A huge number of those families are dealing with short tenancies, easy evictions and the spiralling cost of rent which is causing huge financial hardship and, in growing numbers of cases, homelessness.  The Secure Rents and Tenancies Bill, which I seek leave to introduce today, seeks to address the two issues of rent certainty and security of tenure.  The introduction of the Bill coincides with the secure rents campaign being run currently by Uplift, the Communications Workers' Union, IMPACT, Mandate, SIPTU and Unite, as well as the Dublin Tenants Association.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is going to publish his strategy for the rental sector in a number of weeks but with people listening carefully to what he has been saying, there is growing concern that the strategy will not contain some of the key policy interventions required to deal with these two crucial issues.  On that basis, I seek leave to introduce the Bill and I note that Sinn F&eacute;in intends to use Private Members' time next week to debate and vote on the Bill.</p></speech>

The programme has one simple objective at its core, which is to make people's lives better in every part of the country.  The Government is working to build society with recovery is felt by every individual and family around Ireland.</p>  <p>  I met Ministers and Ministers of State to agree the priorities for the first year, taking into account the actions and ambitions in the programme for Government.  All Departments are finalising new three-year statements of strategy as required under the Public Services Management Act 1997, which will set out the key objectives and priorities reflecting the programme for Government commitments for which they are responsible.  The implementation of A Programme for a Partnership Government requires a new relationship between the Government and Oireachtas, and this is reflected in significant new D&aacute;il reforms which are being implemented, providing a significantly greater role for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  Ireland is facing many challenges ahead internationally and domestically.  It is important that the Government maintains a focus on managing the challenges of Brexit and ensures our continuing economic recovery is not compromised.  Equally, at home much work remains to be done in areas such as housing, homelessness, education, health and rural development, and reference was made to mental health today.  We are committed to tackling these challenges in order to build a society where the recovery is felt by every individual.</p>  <p>  We have made good headway in the first six months.  Some of the key issues progressed include: a new action plan for housing and homelessness; the establishment of a &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund; an increase in rent limits under the rent supplement and housing assistant payment; the establishment of a task force on the implementation of personalised budgets for persons with disabilities; the establishment of the Citizen's Assembly; a new dedicated Cabinet committee working on a new rural action plan; the establishment of a mobile phone and broadband task force; the introduction of two weeks' paternity leave in September 2016; and the implementation of reforms to give the Oireachtas a stronger role in planning and budgets.</p>  <p>  As well as publishing an annual report, the Government will shortly publish one of the many regular short updates on the implementation of A Programme for a Partnership Government which will be laid before the Oireachtas.  As set out in the programme for Government, only a strong economy supporting people at work can pay for the services needed to create a fair society.  On that note, I welcome yesterday's announcement from the CSO that unemployment has dropped to 7.5%.  Continuing to focus on job creation and getting people back to work remains a top priority within the programme for Government.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300021#T02200"><p>The executive summary of the programme for Government states: "Our approach to governing will be clearly seen in how we address the issues of housing and homelessness".  On that basis, would the Taoiseach agree that the approach of the Government to governing has been a disaster?  One can compare the circumstances facing people dealing with the housing and homelessness crisis now to the situation in May.  There are now 249 more homeless children than in May, and the total is now almost 2,500.  In total, there 539 more homeless people and 119 more homeless families living in emergency accommodation now than when the Government promised to end homelessness.  The 6,700 homeless adults and children in emergency accommodation at the end of September is the equivalent of the population of a medium-sized town, slightly bigger than Ballinasloe or Bandon.  </p>  <p>  It has become normal during the term of office of the Government for families in Dublin city to spend up to two years in emergency accommodation and 12 to 15 months in South Dublin County Council.  My constituency is included in South Dublin County Council, and in January 274 people were registered as homeless with the council compared to a figure of 439 in October, a 60% increase.</p>  <p>  Would the Taoiseach agree that by that standard, the approach to governing of the Government is a disaster?  The stock response from the Government over the past couple of weeks to questions like this is to herald the record levels of exits from homelessness, as the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, did in a reply to a question from me last week.  The only reason there is a record number of exits from homelessness is because of the record number of entries, and the number of homeless people continues to increase.  It seems that the reason no progress is being made on this issue is that the Government refuses to deal with what it knows are the two main causes of homelessness, namely, rising rents and the eviction of tenants because landlords want to sell. </p>  <p>  It is clear that the Government is not going to introduce rent controls.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, was reported as saying he will not introduce them because they would discourage developers from building new homes and that he does not want to put the dead hand of regulation on the construction sector and therefore stop any momentum that is starting in the building of more rental accommodation.  If we do not break with that free-market mantra, the housing crisis will continue to deteriorate.  We need State action to resolve the housing crisis, otherwise the programme for Government will be a complete failure.</p></speech>

The responsibility for all of the lack of delivery rests in the confidence and supply agreement.  It is revealing to watch the play-acting that is going on day in and day out.  The fact is that the Taoiseach is in Government as a gift from Fianna F&aacute;il, and the electorate who are dependent on the Government doing the right thing is being failed.  That is most obvious in the lack of capacity in the health system.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Government plans to use prefabs, as reported in the media, to relieve the pressure on our emergency services?  Is the HSE about to evaluate a series of bids it received?  The Taoiseach is very conscience of his constituency and as a result of his long career here of the number of schools which were given prefabs as temporary accommodation.  Decades later, children are still being taught in unsuitable classrooms.  Is this the future for our emergency services?</p>  <p>  It has been reported that 34 patients over the age of 75 were left on hospital trolleys for more than 24 hours on every day of every week in the first seven months of this year.  A total of 7,161 patients were left on trolleys for more than 24 hours.  The Taoiseach said the figures were down today. There are 464 people on trolleys today, but what were the figures for yesterday?  They were 493 yesterday and on Monday they were 400.  The crisis is ongoing and the figures for trolley and overcrowding are deteriorating.  There is chaos as the winter kicks in.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government also commits that persons with disabilities shall be supported to maximise their potential by removing barriers which impact on access to services, education, work and health care.  The budget announced funding of &euro;2 million for projects that provide pre-activation supports for people with disabilities in 2017.  I have been in contact with the Minister responsible every week, but so far there has been no announcement on where the &euro;2 million is going.</p>  <p>  I refer in particular to WALK PEER, an organisation in my constituency.  Its funding will run out at Christmas.  Could we get some clarification from the Taoiseach on how the &euro;2 million will be spent and whether projects like WALK PEER will be given the appropriate level of funding to which they are entitled?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said he would contact the Egyptian President following the postponement of the trial of Ibrahim Halawa for the 16th time. </p><p>We now know that 859 prisoners have been pardoned by the Egyptian Government under Article 155 of the Egyptian constitution.  Will the Taoiseach tell us if he spoke to the Egyptian President?  If he has not done so, will he raise the possibility of Ibrahim being released under this article?</p></speech>

Among other things, I assume this refers to the importance of home care and the need to address its provision because the service has been savaged since 2008.  There was an increase in funding in the recent budget, but I put it to the Taoiseach that it is not even close to what is required to deliver on what is claimed in the programme for Government to be a priority.</p>  <p>  I will give the House an example.  Mark O'Brien is 48 years of age and has a rare disease, CADASIL, which causes him to have multiple strokes.  He is almost totally non-verbal, has severe problems walking and cannot do basic manual tasks.  He is categorised as disabled, in receipt of disability allowance and lives in an adapted home.  He cannot cook, clean or wash himself because of his condition.  His father who is 72 years of age has the same disease.  He lives in Shankill and has to travel to D&uacute;n Laoghaire on the DART every day, for which he is not really able, to look after his son because Mark has no one to look after him.  I have inquired on three occasions since the summer about a home care package for Mark.  The HSE has acknowledged that he needs such a package but states the home care hours budget is "at capacity" and that Mark's home care hours will be reviewed on receipt of additional funding.  This is the Taoiseach's health policy.  Our most recent response to our inquiry was received on 11 October.  Mark is not being given by the Government the home care pacakge that he so desperately needs.  How many Mark O'Briens are there?  Even with the additional funding for home care packages, there are still approximately 1.5 million fewer hours than in 2008, while the elderly population has increased by 17%.  We are, therefore, well short of delivering what was called "safe, timely care, as close to patients' homes as possible".  That is the priority that has been given to the issue.  When will Mark be given the home care package he needs?  When will others like him get the packages they need?</p></speech>

For the first time ever, we have a comprehensive programme, comprising five strategies, backed up by &euro;5 billion in funding.  The Deputy states rising rents and evictions by landlords are the cause, but the problem has been one of supply because of the collapse of the economy a number of years ago whidch brought ruin for so many.</p>  <p>  The action plan on housing was published.  Eight sites were located in Cork, Galway, Waterford, Clare, Kildare and Roscommon for the development of social housing, for which there was an allocation of &euro;100 million.  Tax relief for landlords who provide accommodation for tenants in receipt of social housing support has been maintained.  From 1 July, the rent limits under the rent supplement and the housing assistance payment schemes were increased in both urban and rural areas to reflect local rent levels.  The capacity to make discretionary enhanced payments was extended to all local authorities operating the housing assistance payment scheme.  An allocation of &euro;1.2 billion was announced in the budget for social housing programmes, a 50% increase on the figure for 2016.  This funding will meet the needs of 21,000 families in 2017.  Measures include the delivery of 4,450 units and supporting an additional 15,000 households through the housing assistance payment.  In September details of the progress made in the homelessness pillar of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan were published.  It included acceleration of the rapid build programme, expansion of the housing assistance payment to tenancies for those who were homeless and measures to increase social housing.  In the budget an extra &euro;28 million was announced for homeless services, a 40% increase on the figure for 2016.  It included provision for 3,000 exits from emergency accommodation through a range of funding mechanisms.</p>  <p>  Other things have also been happening; therefore, it has not been a disaster.</p></speech>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has spoken to the ambassador and I intend to follow up on the matter.  We are supportive of the use of Egyptian Law 140 for the deportation of Ibrahim Halawa.  We will pursue both lines - we will pursue the matter with the President by letter and support the use of Law 140.</p>  <p>  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett raised an interesting question.  Some &euro;14.5 billion is being put into the health service.  More more is also available for home care packages than ever before.  I do not make the decisions, but there is a simplified process in place to devise an appropriate programme to deal with the complexities of an illness such as Mark's.  I will ask the Minister for Health to look into the matter and advise the Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300022#U01000"><p>The reason I have asked the Taoiseach if he chairs the Cabinet Committee on Health is straightforward.  It is increasingly clear that one area of Government policy that is in a shambles is health.  After holding the health portfolio for six straight years, Fine Gael has no discernible health policy.  The compulsory health insurance model of the James Reilly era was abandoned prior to the last general election, having been told for five years that it would happen and there were all sorts of report on the issue.  Furthermore, the last Government significantly disrupted the health service through initiating the compulsory health insurance model by creating a structural and organisational crisis, but then nothing happened and the policy was abandoned.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, spoke about privatising some elements of the service, but he got out of the Department as fast as he had got into it.  Now we have a new set of circumstances.  The programme for Government states health is a priority, but waiting times are going through the roof.  Elective operations are being cancelled and outpatient and inpatient waiting lists and times are at record levels.  That is how they are being described.  Emergency departments are at a critical point.  Yesterday on the "Six One News" hospital spokespeople stated the figures had reached an all time record.  Cork University Hospital had a record number of patients on trolleys.  Some 80 patients had been admitted in one day to its emergency department, which the chief executive officer equated to the numbers that would attend a small hospital.  The programme for Government states health is a priority, that emergency department waiting times will be dramatically reduced and that change will be driven forward, but none of this is happening.  I genuinely thought the Taoiseach was no longer chairing the committee because things were getting worse.</p><p>The Cabinet committee is clearly not playing the central role we expected of it.  If it is playing that role, where is the evidence to support that contention?</p> <p> We do not have any sense of long-term funding structures.  Is the Government committed to a public health service model in terms of funding? </p> <p> In the past, particularly last year and the year before that, the Health Service Executive's national service plan was amended by Ministers in Cabinet to cover up the funding gap for promised services.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the service plan for next year will be published without any ministerial interference or interventions?  Will he commit to having a debate in the House on the health service plan when it is published and to full transparency in committee and plenary session in terms of the plan?</p> <p> Rome is burning, with issues appearing across the full spectrum of the health service, from recruitment to service provision and delivery.  This morning we discussed mental health.  I ask the Taoiseach to change tack on this year's allocation for mental health.  Reasonable and quick interventions could be made on the counselling front by providing more resources to those who offer counselling, particularly in the non-governmental organisations.  The Government should consider using the private sector to provide mental health services.  Could some hospitals contract in professionals in the interim given that the public service states it cannot recruit staff and fill vacancies?  Community intervention teams could be improved and the primary care counselling service extended.  To follow up on this morning's discussion, I ask the Taoiseach to think about these suggestions, on which an immediate response is not required.</p> <p> In the context of an overall health budget of &euro;50 billion, surely it is possible to provide more than &euro;15 million in additional mental health funding.  This would send a positive signal that we are serious about mental health.  As the chair of the Cabinet committee on health, it is within the Taoiseach's capacity to ask his Ministers to do something concrete on mental health in 2017 to show the Government is with the people on this issue, particularly the younger generation who are very concerned about it.</p></speech>

In one hospital alone in Cork city, Cork University Hospital, 26,000 people are on waiting lists.  Incredibly, the number of people on hospital waiting lists has increased by 27,000 since the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, took the reigns in the Department six months ago.</p><p>The<i>Irish Examiner</i>reports this morning that 16 people have died from suspected suicides in the Cork region in the past two weeks.  Conor Cusack has called for the establishment of well-being centres operating on a 24-7 basis.  As the previous speaker noted, we are falling well short of meeting the targets set in A Vision for Change, the ten-year strategy for mental health which runs until the end of 2016.  An additional allocation of a mere &euro;15 million has been provided for mental health this year when much more is needed. </p><p>According to trolley watch, which is operated by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, 25 people are on trolleys in Cork University Hospital today and the number of people on trolleys at the hospital earlier this week was the highest in the country.  Contrary to the figures provided by the Taoiseach, trolley watch's figures show there are 464 persons on trolleys or in overflow wards in hospitals today.  This is caused in significant measure by the understaffing crisis in the health service, which is unable to retain nurses.</p><p>All this points towards the need for a national health service which would provide health care free at the point of use in a single tier, universal system.  What proposal does the Cabinet committee have for dealing with the multiple crises in the health service?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is limited in terms of what he can divulge to the House for some reason beyond my comprehension.  The health service is in a worsening crisis, despite the great zeal, care and compassion that health service workers bring to their vocation.  We dealt in some detail earlier with mental health issues.  I remind the Taoiseach that there are no 24-7 crisis care services in the State.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin made a passionate plea for all this to be dealt with in an appropriate manner.  However, when Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a Private Members' motion seeking a timeline for 24-7 crisis intervention services in mental health, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party amended the motion to remove the timeline. </p></speech>

One such crisis that springs to mind is the report that up to 30 patients have died in University Hospital Limerick after being infected with so-called superbugs.  Can the Taoiseach provide any information on the number of confirmed deaths as a result of infection by drug-resistant superbugs?  Will he also state how many such cases have been identified in the past six months?  Furthermore, will he ask the Minister for Health to release any information he has on this matter and indicate what action he will take to address it?</p>  <p>  On the terms of reference for the commission of investigation into the case of Grace, a young intellectually disabled woman who remained in a foster home at the centre of abuse allegations, the report by Mr. Conor Dignam, SC, makes very disturbing reading.  Will the Taoiseach give a clear commitment that the many specific issues raised by the Dignam report will be addressed?  Will he also indicate what is the current status of the two HSE reports into allegations of serious sexual and physical abuse at a partially State funded foster home?  Will he outline when the two reports will be published and what is the current status of the terms of reference of the commission of investigation?</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach explain the astonishing decision not to provide additional funding for health?  Will a further Supplementary Estimate be introduced for health?  If not, how will the &euro;35 million promised for mental health be provided?  In the context of our earlier discussion of mental health services, how will it be possible to address the suicide crisis in Cork disclosed in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>this morning without additional funding?</p><p>We have a ridiculous situation in the Department of Health with one senior Minister and four Ministers of State.</p></speech>

I say that with no disrespect to the individuals involved who I am aware are trying.</p>  <p>  In the previous Government, the Taoiseach took the role of chairing each Cabinet committee.  He told us recently his mojo was found somewhere and he had it back in his pocket or wherever.  However, the problems in the health services are getting worse.  The crisis for those who work hard in the health services is that the lack of leadership in those services is making a difficult and challenging situation much worse because, basically, morale is hitting the decks.  The worse thing that can happen in a public service organisation is that those working in it feel morale is seeping away.</p>  <p>  A second issue which I want to raise, one on which I have had conversations with the Taoiseach on previous occasions, is the situation in Crumlin hospital for children with scoliosis.  I have encountered a case of a nine year old girl with severe scoliosis, who is wheelchair bound and has intellectual and other serious physical disabilities.  She is waiting three years to begin treatment for scoliosis.  While we have been debating this question, I got a text message from the child's mom stating they have been told the beginning of the treatment and operation will not be before Christmas.  The Taoiseach is a person of compassion.  I have been on personally to the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who has equally reacted with compassion to the case.  What is the problem?  Last year and the year before, much extra money was put into scoliosis treatment services in Crumlin hospital.  Will the Taoiseach tell us what is going on?  Has he a clue himself?  Will he have the Cabinet sub-committee responsible meet at 8.30 a.m. next Monday or Tuesday and ask the five Ministers, who have advisers and assistants, to deal with this?  Morale is being destroyed in the health services due to the lack of answers.</p>  <p>  Where is health in the list of Supplementary Estimates?  Will we have an Estimate for it by the end of the year?</p></speech>

Brexit will undoubtedly be a significant element of those discussions.  I will attend the next meeting of the European Council on 15 December and 16 December.  While I do not have any formal bilateral meetings scheduled in the margins of that meeting, I expect there will be a discussion among the 27 remaining member states on that occasion.  I will also take the opportunity to discuss the situation informally with colleagues.  I do not have other firm plans to meet foreign leaders before Christmas 2016.</p>  <p>  An assistant secretary has recently been assigned to the international, EU and Northern Ireland division of my Department.  It has responsibility for Brexit matters and the resources of the division are being kept under review.  The Cabinet committee on Brexit has met three times to date, on 8 September, on 19 October and on 7 November, for in-depth discussion of the issues arising from the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The Cabinet committee is scheduled to meet again on 24 November.</p>  <p>  The committee will oversee the overall Government response, including both the economic impact and the negotiations at EU level, and with the Administrations in London and Belfast.  The Cabinet committee will continue to meet on a regular basis to deal with Brexit-related issues.  Brexit has also been a matter of regular and detailed consideration by the Government at Cabinet level for some time, both in advance of the UK EU referendum and since.</p></reply>

From all the reports coming out of Westminster, the British Government is struggling to manage the scale of work generated by the Brexit process.  There is also a huge amount of work to be undertaken by the Irish Government.</p><p>This includes engaging with other EU governments and the Executive and people in the North on the dialogue that is required.  Very specifically, does the Government anticipate putting together a strategy and hiring additional staff to deal with these responsibilities?  There is a very important element to this.  Does the Government accept that the priority has to be actively promoting and defending the rights of those citizens in the North who voted to remain?  This cannot just be set to one side.  I acknowledge there are diplomatic issues.  The North remains part of the British State but our responsibility is to the people of our own island .  As I have said many times, we need to have an all-island vision and view</p> <p> Why do I raise this?  I raise it to ask what the arrangement is for based on the Government's outreach initiatives and any diplomatic offensives.  Is it to be specific to the Twenty-six Counties?  Alternatively, is the objective to obtain some special status for the North outside the European Union?  That is a totally different animal than looking for specific, designated special status for the North inside the European Union.  Has the Government examined other models that have accommodated this kind of thinking?  All of us have said Brexit is the greatest challenge facing the island of Ireland for many decades.</p> <p> Let me come back to the point that the people of the North voted to remain.  That is their position and it should be ours, notwithstanding the diplomatic niceties in this regard.</p> <p> We will give the Government a paper.  I have just signed off on a paper.  Our national officer board dealt with it.  It outlines some strategic objectives regarding where we engage on this issue.  It also points a way towards getting special designated status for the North within the European Union.  I will send the document in due course to Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.</p> <p> That is the import of my question.  As we face this big challenge, do we have the proper resources?  Has the Government clearly made up its mind on whether we are seeking special status outside or inside the Union as part of our all-island vision?</p></speech>

I was very surprised to read the Taoiseach's tweet at the weekend in which he said he had a really great conversation on the night in question with US Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  He stated Mr. Pence certainly knows Ireland and the issues that matter to our people.  To be honest, that is a pretty shocking statement.  Does the Taoiseach know what Mr. Mike Pence thinks of LGBT people?  Has he any idea?  He knows what the Irish people think about LGBT rights.  They believe in those rights and in equality.</p><p>Let me give the Taoiseach a flavour of what Mr. Mike Pence said:</p><blockquote>Homosexuals are not as a group able bodied.  They are known to carry extremely high rates of disease brought on because of the nature of their sexual practices and the promiscuity which is a hallmark of their lifestyle.</blockquote><p>That is disgusting bigotry.  He said gay journalists cannot remain unbiased because of the pathological nature of their &quot;gaydom&quot;.  This is unbelievable stuff.  In 2006, he supported a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex weddings and suggested that if same-sex weddings were allowed, societal collapse would occur.  In 2013, as Governor of Indiana, he signed a Bill that would jail same-sex couples who applied for a marriage license.  The Bill also suggested that clerks or clergy who supplied a licence or performed a wedding for LGBT couples should be jailed.  I have not got time to list the remaining instances of disgusting bigotry on the part of this man.  I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks we have in common with an outright bigot and anti-gay, anti-lesbian and anti-trans person such as Mr. Mike Pence.  It seems we have nothing in common with him and that he knows nothing about the values of people in this country.</p></speech>

Deputy Gerry Adams already referred to this.  By now, all things being equal in a D&aacute;il that functions as a democracy, we should have had a cross-party delegation visiting Cairo, of which the Taoiseach would probably have been part.  We passed a motion in July to have a cross-party delegation to visit Cairo and to have the Egyptian ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Gendi, visit our Parliament to talk to the foreign affairs committee.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, present because I believe he owes me 50 bucks.  The last time I spoke on the floor here, Ibrahim Halawa was facing his 16th trial.  That has now been postponed.  He will face his 17th trial on 13 December unless we intervene.  Intervention means direct intervention from the Taoiseach, not just support for the Rule 140 position, as indicated to Deputy Gerry Adams.  What he needs to do is apply in his own name for Rule 140 to apply to Ibrahim Halawa.  There is a window of opportunity over the next two days.  The Egyptian Government has set up a special commission to which the Taoiseach can apply to have Ibrahim Halawa released on the basis that he is a young person who has not been convicted.  He has been in Egyptian prisons for over three years and this is affecting his university education.  That is the basis on which the Taoiseach can apply for his release.  He has got two days to do so.  The expiry date is 25 November.  I plead with the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Halawa family, to make the application and see Mr. Halawa released shortly.  As Deputy Adams stated, hundreds of prisoners have been released.  In the past few days, over 80 have been released.  The Egyptian Government has set up a commission and is inviting the Irish Government to call for the release of prisoners on the basis that they are young and that their continuing internment without trial would affect their university education.  Can the Taoiseach please submit the application in his own name?</p></speech>

A political solution is required to address comprehensively the humanitarian, human rights and refugee crises that are the consequences of the conflict.  Ireland and the European Union remain committed to supporting the United Nations' efforts to achieve an end to violence, the formation of an inclusive administrative structure with full executive powers and a constitutional reform process, as set out in the 2012 Geneva communiqu&eacute;.  This framework has been endorsed by the United Nations under Security Council Resolution 2254.</p>  <p>  I discussed the Syrian conflict with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 October.  We were joined by the UN special envoy, Mr. Staffan de Mistura.  The Council adopted conclusions condemning atrocities in Syria, particularly in Aleppo; calling for an immediate end to the bombardment of Aleppo and the protection of civilian populations across Syria; calling for an end to restrictions on the provision of humanitarian assistance and the lifting of all sieges; reaffirming the European Union's support for a political resolution to the conflict in Syria; condemning the illegal use of chemical weapons by the regime and Daesh; calling for accountability through referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court; and condemning in the clearest possible terms the unacceptable actions of Daesh.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, participated in the November meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council which discussed the Syrian crisis and strengthening the European Union's diplomatic engagement with the regional states, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to creating the conditions for a renewal of political negotiations.  The Council was briefed by the EU High Representative on the implementation of the European Union's humanitarian response to the crisis in Aleppo.</p>  <p>  Last Monday I met the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Dr. Peter Maurer, in Dublin.

We cannot separate the conflict in Syria from the refugee crisis.  My party and I have consistently raised concerns about the EU-Turkey migration deal, about which we have major reservations and which has been widely criticised as undermining refugee and migrant rights.  As part of the Turkish Government's crackdown post the failed coup, more than 90 journalists have been arrested, 2,500 civil servants have been sacked, while opposition MPs have been imprisoned.  In the light of this, can Ireland, as an EU member state, really designate Turkey as a safe country to which to send people who are fleeing the conflict in Syria and beyond?  Does the Minister not see the paradox in supporting the EU-Turkey migration deal while calling for countries to abide by humanitarian laws and ensure refugees' rights are upheld?</p></speech>

The European Union and its member states, including Ireland, are keeping the situation in Turkey under close review in the light of negative trends in that country.  As a candidate country for membership of the European Union, I expect, as do my international colleagues, Turkey to adhere to essential democratic norms and respect what we might describe as the core values of the Union.  A regression from these norms and values would cause me great concern.  I have raised this issue a number of times at international fora.  With our European colleagues, Ireland is considering how best to influence Turkey and encourage a commitment to return to respecting fundamental freedoms and core human rights.</p></speech>

He has stated there are negative trends in Turkey.  They have been evident for some time if one considers the actions of the Turkish army in northern Syria and the crackdown on the opposition and the free press.  Representatives of the National Union of Journalists have appeared before the foreign affairs committee, on which Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe and I sit.  This is a serious matter.  The idea of Turkey even aspiring at this time to accede to membership of the European Union is ridiculous.  The best message the Government can send is that it should extricate itself from the EU-Turkey migration deal.  These third country arrangements are not good because they undermine the rights of refugees and migrants.  Turkey is not providing a safe haven for people in need.</p></speech>

The deal is far from perfect, but since it was agreed to, there has been an alleviation of the plight of the many hundreds of thousands of migrants in the region.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to play an important role in the debate on Turkey, its relationship with the European Union and its possible status as an accession state.  It is important that we send a clear and united signal to it on our concerns which I had the opportunity to make on behalf of the Government and the people and those of the European Union.  However, I invite the Deputy to agree with me on the importance of keeping open channels of communication with Turkey in order to establish a framework so as to ensure the best interests of the and those of the European Union and migrants are kept to the fore.</p></speech>

Will the Council be the vehicle used to discuss Brexit issues between the Executive and the Government and are there plans to have more regular meetings?</p></reply>

We met the deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA; the Sinn F&eacute;in President, Deputy Gerry Adams, the SDLP leader, Mr. Colum Eastwood, MLA, and colleagues; the UUP leader, Mr. Mike Nesbitt, MLA, and colleagues, and Alliance Party MLAs, Mr. David Ford and Dr. Stephen Farry.  The Taoiseach also met the First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, MLA, in Dublin on 15 November.</p>  <p>  Each of these meetings was an important opportunity to speak directly with political leaders in Northern Ireland as part of the Government's continuing engagement with the Executive and other parties, with a view to working together to prepare for and manage the shared, all-island impacts of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the and those of the European Union.  We emphasised the Government's commitment to playing its full role, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, in support of continued peace, prosperity and deeper reconciliation in Northern Ireland.</p><p>We also discussed what special arrangements might be required to take account of the unique situation of Northern Ireland in the upcoming negotiations within the European Union on the departure of the United Kingdom from the Union.</p> <p> As the Deputy outlined, the UK departure from the Union was also a major focus of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, plenary meeting last Friday.  The Government and Northern Ireland Executive agreed to continue to work closely together to optimise North-South planning in the phases preceding and following the UK withdrawal from the European Union.  In terms of taking forward the necessary work, the NSMC agreed that the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive will be guided by some common principles.  It also agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectoral level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive office.</p> <p> In addition to our discussions on Brexit, we also reviewed progress on the implementation of the Fresh Start agreement, commitments on cross-Border infrastructure projects and on the cross-Border partnership arrangements, developed by Derry city and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council.  I am pleased that my Department has played a leading role in that regard by contributing &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund.</p></speech>

Has the Government done an impact assessment on what Brexit could mean for the Good Friday Agreement?  We all agree the Good Friday political institutions, human rights guarantees and all-Ireland bodies, the constitutional and legal rights of the people to exercise their right to self-determination and a united Ireland through consent by referendum North and South must be protected.</p>  <p>  We also agree that the peace process is still very fragile.  There are many unresolved legacy issues.  Acht na Teanga has not been implemented.  There are outstanding human rights concerns and there are problems with prisons.  Sectarianism is rife.  Issues also arise on parades, flags and emblems.  A considerable amount of work remains to be done and the problem is Brexit brings uncertainty, division and doubt.  Has the Government undertaken an assessment of the potential impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that it is essential in the context of Brexit that we ensure the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement as a legally binding international document.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that while at last week&rsquo;s North-South Ministerial Council the dominant agenda item was Brexit, other issues were also discussed.  In the context of the other issues I adverted to progress in the Fresh Start agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and at last week&rsquo;s meeting, the council received an update on the progress being made on the implementation of the various commitments under those agreements, and some issues that remain unimplemented from the Good Friday Agreement itself from 1998.  The plenary meeting also reviewed the major economic and social developments which had occurred in both parts of the island since our last meeting in July 2016.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that this is something of a challenging agenda.  I intend to be in Belfast on a couple of occasions between now and the Christmas recess.</p></speech>

That is an issue on which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, has been particularly anxious to ensure is a priority focus of his engagement.</p>  <p>  I described our meeting last week of the North-South Ministerial Council as being a Brexit impact assessment where we had Ministers from Dublin responsible for a wider range of Departments meeting with their counterparts and engaging fully on the consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union, with particular reference to agriculture, fisheries, food, energy and jobs.  I do not believe any Department will not be impacted on in some way by the challenge.  As well as that we have the issues of the Good Friday Agreement.  The status of the Good Friday Agreement is an overriding principle for any negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union that refer specifically to the matter of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

With that in mind I ask the Minister to outline his Department&rsquo;s plans in preparation for the Article 50 being submitted and triggered, and to comment on his view of the level of preparedness within the Government.</p></reply>

The British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, has said that she intends to trigger Article 50 not later than the end of March next year.  An agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom on British withdrawal has to be concluded within two years.  Further negotiations on a future UK-EU relationship are going to be particularly complex and multifaceted and may well last considerably longer.  I should be clear that in preparing for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in future negotiations, the Government&rsquo;s priorities remain the same, namely, to protect the interests of our citizens, with particular regard to Northern Ireland and the peace process, the common travel area, North-South and British-Irish trade and co-operation and our economy.  It is also essential that we contribute positively to the debate on the future of the European Union itself.</p>  <p>  Given the cross-cutting nature of the EU-UK dossier, a number of divisions within my Department are devoting a considerable share of their resources to the key issues involved.  They include the EU division, the Ireland, United Kingdom and Americas division, the legal division and the trade division.  The overall departmental effort is led and co-ordinated by the Secretary General and by the Department&rsquo;s management board, a sub-committee of which meets on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  With respect to the Article 50 negotiations, the EU division of the Department, which was re-established further to a Government decision in July, is leading on preparations, within the framework of the whole-of-government approach to Brexit, which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach and to which I referred in response to a previous question from Deputy Crowe.</p>  <p>  Now that we have the beginnings of a concrete timeline for Article 50, our work on analysing the implications of a UK exit from the European Union, which began over two years ago, and on preparing for the Article 50 negotiations has intensified.  There is daily contact with the Department of the Taoiseach and there is also close engagement with other Departments, many of which have established Brexit teams.  In addition, there is also daily contact with our permanent representation in Brussels.</p></speech>

I tabled a series of parliamentary questions that deal with the facts, the answer which I got.  The Minister mentioned the Department of the Taoiseach is leading the approach on Brexit.  In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled I was pretty stunned to hear the Cabinet committee on Brexit established under the Taoiseach has only met three times on 8 September, 19 October and 7 November and is due to meet again tomorrow.</p><p>Does the Minister believe the fact that it took the committee three months after the referendum result to actually meet shows any degree of urgency or priority?  I am reminded of the phrase "fail to prepare, prepare to fail" because that is where we are right now.  This is why we in Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believe in the need for a Minister for Brexit to co-ordinate what is happening across Departments.  For this committee to have met only three times since the referendum result does not give me any great confidence that this Government is prepared for the potential risks and, in some cases, the potential opportunities that Brexit may bring about for this country.</p></speech>

It is natural that the Taoiseach, who leads the overall Government response, should be the lead figure.  He has chaired all three meetings of the new Cabinet Committee on Brexit, which will meet again at 9 a.m. tomorrow.  I have a particular role with particular reference to Northern Ireland and relations with our EU partners which is also complemented by the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.  There have been actions on our part also, such as reinforcing our embassies in London, Paris and Berlin as well as our permanent representation to the EU in Brussels.</p>  <p>  We discussed the matter of a Minister for Brexit previously.  Not only would a separate Minister for Brexit be completely unnecessary, the creation of such a post would, as we see from the UK experience, cause significant administrative disruption at a time when we need to be focused on substance.  I welcome the support from Deputy Darragh O'Brien and his party on this issue.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister that three meetings of the Cabinet committee on Brexit, which is the all-powerful Brexit committee, since the referendum result is outrageous.  It does not show any degree of priority or urgency.  I found the all-Ireland meeting in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham most beneficial.  It involved hearing views from across all sectors of our society, North and South, but I would like to see a plan emanating from that.  Could the Minister outline what the next steps are because I thought the forum was a most useful event and I welcomed it on the day?  I commend the Minister for that.  However, I still have genuine concerns.  I look forward to continuing to engage with the Minister and his Department.  I tabled a series of questions across all Departments.  The average number of meetings held by Brexit committees within the Departments is about two per Department.  That is not sufficient.</p></speech>

Many Departments have already established dedicated Brexit teams to deal with this issue.  I am happy to brief the Deputy at any stage on our progress and engagement.  I welcome his comments about the all-island civic dialogue.  It was a most successful day.  I also welcome the contribution of his party and his party leader in particular.  It is one of a series of engagements.  Having evaluated many of the issues raised, we are now into sectoral mode and there will be a number of sectoral meetings, particularly in Border areas.  I hope we will have a level of engagement with civil society up and down the country, a listening exercise but also demonstrating the type of leadership we have seen from the Taoiseach on this issue since the vote on 23 June.</p></speech>

The increasing tensions in the south east of the country are deeply troubling and I am also gravely concerned at the mounting threat to civil society by breaches of human rights and democratic norms.  On 4 November, I issued a statement in which I explicitly expressed my concern at the arrest of the co-chairs and other democratically elected members of the pro-Kurdish HDP party in the early hours of 4 November.  The arrest of these parliamentarians was made possible by the lifting of parliamentary immunity from some 130 members of the Turkish Assembly in May of this year.  Ireland shares the view of the EU that parliamentary immunity must be applied equally to all members of the Turkish parliament.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the specific case to which the Deputy refers.  Officials of my Department met with members of the HDP last week and I know that several members of the House also met with the delegation.  The HDP representatives presented a very stark case, in particular on the circumstances surrounding the detention of democratically elected representatives from Kurdish areas and the restrictions on the Kurdish media as well as the deteriorating security situation in the south east of Turkey in particular.  They also detailed the circumstances of the individual in question and highlighted his concerns about the very negative trends that we are seeing in Turkey.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for a return to dialogue to allow the political process to resolve the Kurdish issue to resume.  In a strong statement issued on 8 November, the EU was critical of Turkey&rsquo;s recent actions and the direction of recent developments and called again on Turkey to resume political dialogue to resolve the Kurdish situation.</p></speech>

I was to meet Mr. Faysal Sarıyıldız last week.  He was travelling around different European capitals.  I think he was to meet Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  He did not arrive because his passport was revoked.  The worrying thing about this case is the fact that he was travelling around European capitals detailing the mass killings of Kurdish civilians by the Turkish military in his home city of Cizre.  Revoking his passport seems to be a crude attempt to silence that work.  The Turkish security forces sealed off Cizre and denied access to food and water and 120 people were killed.  People compared it to Koban&igrave; after the attack by Daesh.  What can the Irish Government do about this?  I heard what the Minister said about what has been happening in Europe but what can we do as an independent country?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, also emphasised this issue during the extensive debate on Turkey which took place at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 14 November.  I have also clearly stated Ireland&rsquo;s position at the Foreign Affairs Council and the Council of Europe where I engaged directly with the Turkish Foreign Minister.  The European Commission&rsquo;s annual report on Turkey, which was published on 9 November, is critical of Turkey on the core issues of rule of law and fundamental rights, including minority rights.  I share that concern.  Ministers will discuss the report at the December meeting of the EU General Affairs Council.</p>  <p>  The EU is currently considering how best to influence Turkey and to encourage a commitment to the return to democratic norms and respect for fundamental freedoms.</p></speech>

He was travelling around telling people what was happening.  I ask the Minister to raise the issue of the warrant for his arrest and the revoking of his passport with the Turkish foreign Minister.  He is not the only one who has been put in this position.  I referred to the 11 MPs.  Will the Minister call for their release?  These were people doing the work they were elected to do.</p>  <p>  Another worrying development is that trustees of the AKP the governing party are being appointed to run the municipality and all powers are being transferred to them.  In the wider community we are getting reports of a build-up of aggressive rhetoric against the Kurdish population representatives.  I am concerned that the next step could be a civil war in Turkey if this repression continues.  I ask the Minister to raise wherever he can the arrests of these parliamentarians and particularly the revoking of Faysal Sarıyıldız's passport.</p></speech>

The HDP is a victim of its own success in that having reached a certain threshold in the Turkish parliamentary system and its members have since been targeted.  That is the reality.

Up to June 2016, the Israeli military has demolished up to $74 million worth of EU-funded structures.  Is Ireland's policy and by extension that of the European Union sustainable?  Do we have the means to influence an outcome to stop this deliberate Israeli policy?</p></reply>

I have consistently called for the Israeli Government to cease demolishing Palestinian structures, including houses and infrastructure such as water and power structures and animal housing, in the West Bank and elsewhere.  We have also made known our opposition to forced relocations of Palestinians.  This practice is growing in intensity at a time when international opinion has repeatedly called for an end to provocative actions on the ground.  Already this year, demolitions reached their highest level since the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs began detailed recording in 2009.</p>  <p>  In deliberations on the Middle East peace process earlier this year, the EU's Foreign Affairs Council reiterated its "strong opposition" to actions taken in the context of Israel's settlement policy, including demolitions and confiscations, and forced transfers of people.  The EU delegations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have raised the issue of demolitions with COGAT, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, and have issued statements locally condemning demolitions on behalf of all EU member states.</p>  <p>  EU missions, including the Irish mission, are active on the ground in trying to protect vulnerable communities, including through numerous diplomatic visits to sites and communities threatened with demolition or forced relocation.  Such visits serve to highlight the threats faced by these people, to ensure visibility of their position and to demonstrate solidarity with them.  In this regard Ireland participated in a visit this month to the Bedouin villages of Khan Al Ahmar and Abu Nuwar, and in another visit in August to the South Hebron Hills.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to physically prevent demolitions or for us to be present everywhere at all times.  I assure the Deputy of Ireland's engagement in this regard, bilaterally and also at EU level.</p></speech>

There is an area called Area C - 60% of the West Bank is considered to be Area C.  The Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, which is co-ordinated by the World Council of Churches, claims that Israel retains near-exclusive control, including over law enforcement, planning and construction.  An important part of Area C has been allocated for the benefit of Israeli settlements or the Israeli military at the expense of Palestinian communities.  Just this month 35 people, one third of them children, were displaced following these forcible transfer actions.</p>  <p>  At what stage does the European Union or the United Nations stop expressing its concerns?  What logical action can we take?  If we have invested so much time, money and resources in assisting these people, at what stage do we shout "Stop"?</p></speech>

It is important that we acknowledge the situation there in terms of confiscations and demolitions.  I would be anxious that Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, would play a lead role in requesting compensation in respect of Area C issues.  While I know the European Union has not reached a final decision on that, from our perspective it is not inappropriate for a measure of compensation to be paid to those people who have faced serious consequences.  We are stronger when we act in tandem with our EU partners.  From time to time the approach of some of our partners will differ from ours.  Agreement has not yet been reached on some of the specifics, but Ireland has continually argued for a strong response to these practices and I assure the House that I will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Israeli civil administration data reveal that only 1.5% of requests for building permits submitted by Palestinians in Area C between 2010 and 2014 were approved, and none were approved in 2015.  Perhaps the European Union and by extension Ireland through the good offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can continue to press that issue with the Israeli authorities.</p></speech>

The EU emergency trust fund for Africa was launched in November 2015 at the EU-Africa summit on migration in Valletta, as a response to the development challenges in migrants' home countries.  These challenges are mainly in the Lake Chad - Sahel region, the Horn of Africa and North Africa.  The fund is an important element of a wider EU approach to tackling the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration in these regions of Africa.  This also includes a new partnership framework between the EU and Africa which to date is focusing on finalising migration compacts with a number of countries and a new ambitious external investment plan.  The trust fund is implemented through establishing economic programmes that create employment opportunities, supports resilience in terms of food security, livelihoods and basic services for local populations, improves migration management, including by combatting human trafficking and smuggling and supports improvements in overall governance.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment of &euro;3 million to the trust fund over the period 2016-20 is earmarked for the Horn of Africa region, which includes Irish Aid partner countries Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda.  It also includes Eritrea.  To date no proposals specific to Eritrea have been approved under the trust fund.  There are serious concerns about human rights violations in Eritrea, which the Deputy referred to, and which are highlighted in the latest report of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Eritrea.  Ireland has consistently condemned these violations at the UN Human Rights Council and in EU discussions.  A policy of non-engagement, however, can often inhibit progress and lead to more suffering for the vulnerable groups that could benefit most from development assistance.  In line with this, any EU development funding to Eritrea is based on key principles of engagement, notably on improvements in human rights.</p></reply>

I am 100% behind our overseas development aid programme and would like to see it moving back towards the 0.7%, but there are concerns from NGOs and civil society organisations that instead of the funding going towards looking at, and tackling the root causes of, migration, the funding is actually going towards migration management and border security.  There are concerns around some of the quite heavy, persuasive methods being used on some African countries to get them to buy into this, such as sanctions being imposed on them if they do not, or the suggestions of sanctions.  We know that when the European partnership agreements were being negotiated there was sanctioning of countries that would not collaborate.  Where is the active engagement with African parliamentarians, with civil society and with NGOs on designing the trust fund in the first place and then on where the funds would be allocated?  There are concerns that these funds are diverting funding from aid programmes.</p></speech>

Yesterday I met with a number of NGO chief executives, including Peter Maurer from the International Committee of the Red Cross, and everyone is having the debate on what is the best way forward.  Critical to that debate are the people on the ground, especially the NGOs, but they also feed in to a multi-lateral platform which includes the engagement of the EU and the compact countries.  I will illustrate one statistic specific to Eritrea.  Some 5,000 people per month leave Eritrea with the majority going to Sudan and Somalia under refugee status.  It is a massive challenge.  For example, 25% of all migrants into Italy are from Eritrea.  The way to go to the core of that challenge is economic stability and looking at the root causes and reasons behind the displacement.  The overarching focus when ensuring finance is being delivered is that human rights must be to the forefront.</p></speech>

In Sudan there are gross violations of human rights.  The Sudanese Government is involved in repression, it has used cluster bombs and it has attacked hospitals and schools.  Sudan itself is also generating huge numbers of refugees and displaced people.  The Sudanese Government is not honouring the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and it is forcibly returning Eritrean people to Eritrea.  How can we see Sudan as a reliable partner?  Equally, the Sudanese President is wanted by the International Criminal Court for human rights abuses and yet we are funding Sudan with some &euro;100 million through the EU.  What is the EU voice on this matter?  Can we see that country as a reliable partner in looking after migration and refugees?</p></speech>

In these particular countries, we are talking about going to the NGOs or collaboration with the UN and NGOs, such as the Red Cross.  We also must ensure that money does not go through government, so transparency must also be to the fore.  We have to build the capacity at local level.  The NGOs are at the forefront there with their ideas and I am very conscious that one cannot separate humanitarian work from development work as they are interlinked.  It is about keeping a focus on the development also.  </p>  <p>  I will cite as an example one NGO in Eritrea called Vita, which works in partnership with the Irish State agency Teagasc, and I have met the Eritrean Minister for Agriculture.  It is working on irrigation schemes and on dairy and potato issues.  This is an example of capacity building at local level where we can work directly with communities under the directorship of NGOs on the ground.  It is important that we still focus on the important elements, including capacity building at a local level, irrespective of the major challenges inherent at a human rights level.  If development funding is going into an area, then we must stay focused on the human rights which has to be an overall objective.</p></speech>

The dispersal policy was designed with the aim to uproot the prisoners from their social, emotional and family environments, in addition to denying their right to take part in the political life of their country.  There are 354 Basque political prisoners imprisoned in 76 prisons in the Spanish and French states.  An example of the distances of travel required by visiting families includes 51 prisoners incarcerated more than 1,000 km from their families and 105 prisoners incarcerated between 800 km and 990 km from their families.  The Minister has said he cannot comment on this practice but the same argument could have been made about political prisoners in Belfast in the 1970s and 1980s, that another state could not make a comment because it was an internal matter for the UK.  There are human rights abuses going on in this situation and we need a real statement.</p></speech>

On a more general issue, the Government continues to support and encourage all efforts aimed at securing peace and stability in the Basque region.  As Deputy Barry is aware, we welcomed the declaration by ETA in October 2011 that the organisation had decided on what it described as a definitive cessation of its armed activity.

The most recent case is that of Joseba Borde who was diagnosed with colon cancer.  I state my support for the right of self-determination for the Basque people, which is a cause linked with a political and economic struggle against the right-wing Basque and Spanish Governments.  I support such a struggle being waged and common cause been made by ordinary Basques and the other peoples who live in the Spanish state for a voluntary socialist federation of the peoples of the peninsula.</p>  <p>  I invite the Minister to make a comment on this.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 14 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, as the Deputy correctly pointed out.  More than 4.4 million people are in urgent need of food assistance and up to 400,000 children could suffer from severe acute malnutrition over the next 12 months if adequate assistance is not received.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, our ambassador to Nigeria, Sean Hoy, visited Borno State to assess the security and humanitarian situation.  He met in Maiduguri with representatives from various UN agencies and NGOs.  The ambassador visited a number of camps for displaced people.  Following the visit, on behalf of the EU, the ambassador briefed the United Nations special representative for west Africa and the Sahel.  Our embassy in Abuja continues to consult with the Nigerian Government, at senior political and official levels, on the humanitarian emergency.</p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners are providing significant humanitarian assistance.  In 2016, Ireland has provided &euro;3 million in direct response to the crisis in the region.  This includes &euro;325,000 for Irish Aid's NGO partners, &euro;1 million for the work of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN and &euro;1 million for the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>  <p>  Under Ireland&rsquo;s rapid response initiative, six rapid responders were deployed this year to work with UN partners.  We also airlifted 110 tonnes of emergency relief supplies into north-eastern Nigeria and to Niger to help displaced Nigerian families.  We are continuing to monitor the situation closely and to assess what further humanitarian assistance Ireland might provide.</p></speech>

It is about the scale of the problem.  I welcome the fact the Irish Government and the Department are involved in our response to it.  Reports are coming in from Doctors without Borders on mortality rates in the camps being five times what is considered an emergency.  There are reports of mothers failing to lactate and their children are starving.  Institutional failures have exacerbated the situation.  It is a manmade famine and is down to Boko Haram, but the government there has not exactly covered itself in glory in its response.  It is about whatever the international community can do.  Progress is too slow in recognising the enormity of the situation.  Will the Minister of State accept we need to act urgently?  I recognise what he said with regard to monitoring the situation, but we need to take further action on this matter.</p></speech>

In recent days along the Lake Chad border there has been an eruption of violence.  When we consider that in Chad alone, 9 million of the global displaced population of 65 million, are displaced it gives an indication.  The efforts at EU level and whatever collaborative approaches need to be carried out in this region need to be done.  I will have an opportunity next week, along with our colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, to go to Kenya.  We will be very focused on looking at root cause, mediation and conflict resolution.  We must have a renewed focus across all levels, at European level and UN level, looking at how we address the underlying causes of a lot of these difficulties that are emerging, be they in eastern Africa, sub-Saharan Africa or the Horn of Africa for that matter, where there are enormous challenges.</p></speech>

We have the money and it is about how best we use it, given the nuances around culture, what is needed and what is best for specific regions.  We must work very much in tandem with local leaders in these countries.  This goes back to the issue of trying to address root cause and getting to the bottom of the conflict situation the first place.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.</p></speech>

We had a discussion of the outstanding issues for prisoners in Maghaberry Prison.  The question is to ask, once again, the extent of the engagement with the authorities in the North, the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice and the Secretary of State for an immediate and just resolution of these issues, which we have been talking about a number of years.</p></reply>

In addition to hearing from a prominent solicitor, the committee was briefed by two members of the independent assessment team set up to monitor implementation of the 2010 agreement between separated prisoners in Maghaberry and the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  It was very useful that they were able to share insights based on their involvement with the prison over a number of years.  As the Deputy will recall, a stock take report of the 2010 agreement was published in November 2014.  It made a number of recommendations to be implemented within a period of six months.  At the time, my strong view was that the full implementation of the stock take report offered an opportunity to create a conflict-free environment in the prison.  I conveyed this view in my regular meetings with the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, and with the then Minister of Justice in the Executive, David Ford MLA, and with their successors.</p><p>In addition, my officials continue to engage on a regular and ongoing basis with a range of interlocutors across the devolved and non-devolved authorities, members of the stock take group, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and others to discuss, explore and encourage progress.</p><p>As the Oireachtas committee heard during its recent deliberations, the 2010 agreement has not been fully implemented and this contributes to the ongoing tensions at the prison.  In this context, I highlight the failure to establish the prison forum, which is disappointing.  This is something which I have raised in my discussions with the NIO and the Minister for Justice.  I continue to encourage all those with good offices to move on the forum but at this stage it is clear that momentum has been lost.</p><p>Also heightening tension has been the sense of threat which prison officers and their families perceive.  The murders of two prison officers, Adrian Ismay last March and David Black in 2012, have set back relations between prison officers and prisoners, in addition to being a tragedy for the families and friends of the murdered officers.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Northern Ireland Executive this summer agreed to implement the recommendation of the fresh start paramilitary panel that a review of the separated regime in Maghaberry be established.  I look forward to the review panel being appointed and to seeing their work completed.  I believe that the review opens up an opportunity to address genuine concerns regarding separation, including such issues as association on the landings and access to education.  My Department engaged fully in the paramilitary panel's consultation process.</p><p>As the Oireachtas committee also heard, Maghaberry Prison was identified by the criminal justice inspector, Brendan McGuigan, in a report last year as needing work to make the prison safer and to improve conditions for staff.  Since publication of that report, the criminal justice inspectorate has continued with a programme of announced, low-impact visits to the prison which find that the situation has stabilised and that some progress has been achieved.  More work remains to be done.  In this regard, I acknowledge the additional report on Maghaberry published by the inspectorate today.</p><p>In making the desired progress in Maghaberry, the co-operation of both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and the prisoners themselves is required.  I would encourage all with influence to move forward in the right spirit.</p></reply>

Since then the International Red Cross have been in the prison but the issues persist.  The issues are full-body searching, controlled movement and access to education.  Everybody agrees that the 2010 agreement is the only way forward for a conflict-free environment and I have to draw a contrast with Portlaoise Prison, which also houses so-called dissidents in a particular wing and none of these issues exist in that prison, where there is a much better relationship between the staff and prisoners.  Generally, there is a fair and respectful relationship between staff and prisoners which is missing in Maghaberry.</p><p>Everybody should be able to carry out their work without fear or threat but we cannot leave the <i>status quo</i>as it is at the moment.  There is a need to encourage a renewal of the dialogue between prisoners and authorities, to which both had signed up.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with the situation in Portlaoise Prison, the high security prison being in my constituency.  The Deputy will be aware that the reasons for the forum not progressing are complex.  We need to see how best we can move matters forward and I continue to encourage all the stakeholders to implement the report of the independent assessment team.  I attach importance to the implementation of the recommendation of the paramilitary panel that a review of the separated regime be established, and this recommendation has been accepted by the Northern Ireland Executive in its action plan on tackling paramilitary activity.  It is important we continue to engage.  Progress in implementing the action plan will be monitored by the independent reporting commission being established by both the British and Irish Governments.</p></speech>

There has been a recent revocation of the licence of Tony Taylor, based on the signature of the Secretary of State.  He was arrested in appalling circumstances with his son who has mental health issues.  Second, a case is going through the courts at the moment in which video recordings of strip searching have been allowed and these can be retained for six years.  Finally, there is a denial of access to education in Maghaberry and there is more access in areas outside of Roe House, where the republican prisoners are, than inside it.</p>  <p>  Some of these issues undermine the dignity of prisoners.  The prisoners assure us that they want a conflict-free environment but they believe it is all process and no progress in what they signed up to.</p></speech>

The programme of the trade mission also included a visit to the United Arab Emirates on 14 and 15 November.  Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia are priority markets under the Government's trade, tourism and investment strategy.  I was accompanied by a diverse range of Irish companies, some of which are seeking to enter the Gulf markets for the first time and some of which are seeking to strengthen their position in those markets.  I undertook a large number of engagements in support of these companies.  In addition to the trade-specific events, I also held meetings at political level addressing a broader range of issues.  In Saudi Arabia, I held meetings with the Minister for Commerce and Investment, Majid Al Qassabi, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Nizar Madani, and the Deputy Minister for Education, Dr. Nasser Fawzan.</p>  <p>  In the course of my visit, I gave an interview to a number of local media outlets in Riyadh.  Among the issues raised in those interviews was the role of Iran across the region.  It is clear to all observers that the increased tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran are an important factor in the complex challenges facing the region at the moment.  Both countries have leadership roles within the region and with that leadership comes responsibility.  I urge both Governments to use their influence to move towards diplomatic and political solutions in both Syria and in Yemen.  This is the message that I gave in the interview referred to by the Deputy.  Saudi Arabia is already an important regional partner for some Irish companies in areas such as food and ICT, and that was the context of the comments on partnership referred to in the article. </p>  <p>  The detail of my meetings with the Ministers is confidential.  However, I can confirm that I did raise human rights issues, including the use of the death penalty and the position of women in society, and issues related to terrorism in the broader region.</p></reply>

The comments of the Minister may have been taken out of context but there is something rotten at the heart of the Saudi Government and in its policies in regard to the conflicts in the region.  There is no doubt that it is funding, training and supporting many salafist and jihadist groups and Saudi coalition air strikes are responsible for the majority of the roughly 4,000 deaths in Yemen.</p><p>Hospital, schools, marketplaces, weddings and factories have been targeted and remain viable coalition airstrike targets.  The coalition carried out an airstrike, on what was possibly the single biggest target in a conflict, on a funeral ceremony in Sana'a which killed more than 140 people and injured 500.  I did not read any criticism of that during the Minister's visit.  Perhaps it was not the right time to do so.  Now the Minister is back in Ireland I would like to think he will clearly separate this visit, from an international view, in terms of what this country is doing in that region.  I do not view the coalition to be an important regional supporter for Ireland in that region.</p></speech>

The country is a designated priority market for Ireland under our trade, tourism and investment strategy.  Saudi Arabia represents a significant market for Ireland.  Total bilateral trade in 2014 was worth over &euro;1.4 billion, with &euro;1.3 billion of this in Ireland's favour.  The economic relationship therefore has considerable benefits for the Irish economy in terms of Irish jobs.  Last week, I saw at first hand the interests which Irish companies have in the Saudi market but the economic partnership we have with Saudi Arabia does not prevent us from raising issues of human rights concern in the appropriate channels.  We will continue to maintain relations with Saudi Arabia, economic relations for the benefit of our economy and trade and diplomatic relations to facilitate our continued engagement with the kingdom on human rights and also on other matters as they may arise from time to time.</p></speech>

Last month Saudi Arabia was re-elected to the UN Human Rights Council for the fourth time after another non-competitive election at the UN General Assembly.  While serving its third term on the UN Human Rights Council Saudi Arabia blocked international inquiries into human rights abuses, punished Saudi citizens who worked in collaboration with the UN Human Rights Council and threatened to cut critical UN funding after being called out for violating children's rights.

It was unopposed but I had the opportunity to raise a number of the issues mentioned by the Deputy, in particular the role of Saudi Arabia in Yemen.  This is a matter of great concern.  This conflict was raised by me at a number of meetings both in the Emirates and in Saudi Arabia.  I wish to unreservedly condemn all the deliberate targeting of civilians, as I did in Saudi Arabia and in the Emirates.  I urged all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law.  As far as humanitarian issues are concerned, I am pleased that the Government has provided &euro;2 million to the United Nations humanitarian pooled fund for Yemen and &euro;100,000 for emergency items for vulnerable and conflict affected households.

I have clearly stated Ireland&rsquo;s position at the Foreign Affairs Council and the Council of Europe where I engaged directly with the Turkish Foreign Minister, and my officials have drawn my statement to the attention of the Turkish Embassy in Dublin.</p>  <p>  I have highlighted the need for a proportionate and measured response by the Turkish authorities, and the importance of upholding the core European values of democracy, respect for rule of law and freedom of expression, including media freedom, the rights of minorities and other fundamental freedoms.  Ireland fully agrees with the statements by the European Union that there is no place for a country which reintroduces the death penalty within the European Union.</p>  <p>  In a strong statement issued on 8 November, the European Union was critical of Turkey&rsquo;s recent actions and the direction of recent developments and called once again for a resumption of the political dialogue with the Kurds.  I have also repeatedly called for a return to dialogue to allow the political process to resolve the Kurdish issue to resume, as did my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy during the extensive debate which took place on Turkey at the most recent meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 14 November.  My officials met last week with members of the pro-Kurdish opposition HDP, as did a number of Deputies across the House.  The HDP representatives presented a very stark case, in particular on the circumstances surrounding the detention of democratically elected representatives from Kurdish areas, the restrictions on the Kurdish media, as stated by Deputy Broughan, and the very negative impact on the daily lives of large numbers of the Kurdish population. </p>  <p>  The European Commission published its annual report on Turkey on 9 November.  The report is critical of Turkey on the core issues of rule of law and fundamental rights and outlines backsliding in these areas.  The report will be discussed at the December meeting of the EU General Affairs Council. </p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, are keeping the situation in Turkey under close review in light of the recent very negative trends.  The EU is considering how best to influence Turkey, and to encourage a commitment to the return of democratic norms and respect in Turkey for basic freedoms.  At the same time, Ireland believes that it is important to keep the lines of communication open with Turkey, and that we must try to hold open the long-term European perspective for all the people of Turkey. </p>  <p>  I am scheduled to meet with the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Nils Mui&zcaron;nieks, later this week and will discuss with him his views on the path to take in terms of the commitments of Turkey as a members of the Council of Europe. </p>  <p>  The EU-Turkey deal agreed between EU Heads of State and Government and Turkey in March 2016 is not affected by recent events.  Turkey continues to play a key role in addressing the migration crisis.  The core intention of the agreement between Turkey and EU Heads of State and Government was to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of vulnerable migrants.   It is particularly aimed to discourage the victims of people smugglers from risking their lives crossing the Aegean Sea.  The very significant decline in the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the Greek Islands since this agreement entered into force, suggests that in many respects it is achieving its aims.</p></speech>

I hope the conflict resolution unit, which the Minister told me about previously, is interested in this, and that those contacts will continue.</p>  <p>  I understand the European Parliament is voting today on the suspension of all talks with Turkey on chapters of accession.  Does the Minister agree with that?  Will he say that we should suspend talks with the Turkish Government?  As I outlined briefly, the savage oppression of the people of the Kurdish area of Turkey continues.  The Minister mentioned the return of the death penalty and the absolute refusal of the AKP party to allow the expression of the rights of the HDP, which represents the Kurdish people. </p><p>What steps can the Minister take to ensure the peace process which was well under way in 2013 and which Abdullah &Ouml;calan, the leader of the Kurdish people, was anxious to progress will be restored?</p></speech>

I will continue to call on all parties to engage in constructive dialogue.  Ireland shares concerns about the situation in Turkey.  I note the Deputy's comment on Members of the European Parliament and the resolution which calls on the European Union to suspend accession talks with Turkey in response to the ongoing crackdown on fundamental freedoms.  The prospect of a European perspective will ultimately benefit the people of Turkey, offering them a democratic future and a rule of law of a type everyone in House agrees is important and of advantage to the people of Turkey.  However, I also believe it is important to keep all channels of communication open at what is a most sensitive time.  The cessation of relations is not in the best interests of the Turkish people.  It is important, therefore, that we continue to engage and retain open channels of communication at this very difficult and challenging time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300034#GG00300"><p>Like others, I met the Turkish delegation and had hoped to meet the Kurdish Members of Parliament; however it was not to be.  It is very disconcerting that what we are seeing is the imprisonment of democratically elected Members of Parliament.  We have also seen the removal of democratically elected mayors in Kurdish areas, as was pointed out to us by the group.  They also showed us pictures of a number of Kurdish villages which had been destroyed by the Turkish military and it was actually like looking at scenes from Aleppo.  This is an issue which is not receiving the media coverage and attention it should.  The Minister mentioned something about engagement with the embassy in Dublin.  I wonder if he has had a response from the Turkish ambassador.  While we can say the European Union is of critical importance, it does not translate into action.  I agree with the Minister about keeping lines of communication open, but question whether we are being strong enough about the attack on democracy in Turkey.</p></speech>

I have repeatedly called for a resumption of dialogue to allow the political process on the Kurdish issue to resume.  The escalation of violence as referred to by the Deputy since the breakdown of the ceasefire between the Turkish Government and the PKK in the summer of last year continues to be a cause of serious concern.  The breakdown was all the more regrettable, given the positive signs that progress had been made in the course of the talks.  Ireland continues to be a strong advocate of peace talks between the Turkish Government and the PKK.  I note the work of the conflict resolution unit of my Department and the financial assistance provided for an international NGO which has facilitated study visits to Ireland by Turkish and Kurdish MPs.  There was a dialogue only last week, as Deputies have said.  We will continue to advocate and work for a lasting peace in the region.</p></speech>

It is time for Ireland to extricate itself from the EU-Turkey arrangement.  The Turkish Government has used the coup as an opportunity to shore up and consolidate its power.  The attacks on the Kurds, the free press and opposition Members of Parliament are things we should not countenance as a free and open society.  Our part in the EU-Turkey migration deal is something I have raised regularly with the Minister.  We do not have oversight of how the &euro;20.9 million is being spent.  The reason the European Union will not suspend the accession talks with Turkey is it needs Turkey to deal with the migration crisis.  We need to speak with a louder voice on this issue.  I understand, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned, the need to keep channels of communication open, but Ireland is an independent state and can state its position and that of the D&aacute;il.  We do not have to take the EU lead on everything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300034#GG00600"><p>Ireland continues to support the eventual accession of Turkey to the European Union.  We have been clear that all of the benchmarks, conditions and criteria in the process must be met fully and that there must be no shortfalls as far as accession is concerned.  The rule of law, fundamental rights, in particular freedom of expression and the media, minority rights and democracy are core elements of the process of accession.  On 9 November the European Commission published its report on the state of play regarding all candidate and potential candidate countries.  The report on Turkey is clear and critical and highlights the deterioration of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It also acknowledges Turkey's positive contribution in dealing with the migration crisis.  Ireland's view, as I said, is that it is important, if we are to make progress, that channels of communication remain open at all levels within the established framework.  That includes the accession process which provides the hope of a long-term European perspective for the people of Turkey which, in the circumstances, is very important.</p></speech>

Almost 200 children have been killed, while cities and towns have been razed to the ground.  It beggars belief.  It is also a problem for us that Germany has a conflicted interest having made the refugee deal and paid large sums of money to Turkey while at the same time, above all, refusing time and again to allow Turkey to proceed to join the European Union.  There is total hypocrisy at the heart of this issue.  I again call on the Minister to say clearly that what is happening s anathema to us.  The peace process must resume and the rights of the Kurdish nation must be upheld.  I hope all of Kurdistan will some day have a parliament like this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300034#GG00800"><p>Progress was made in 2013 in building peace, but it says something about a regime that one of its targets is teachers.  The regime has arrested thousands of teachers and so denied Turkish and Kurdish children the right to an education.  Oxfam has stated the European Union needs to reconsider very carefully exactly how much it is willing to sacrifice on the altar of migration.  While we are trusting Turkey to deal with refugees in a respectful and humane way, the Turkish military is bombing Kurdish villages, causing so much death and destruction.</p></speech>

On the one hand, we are saying to Turkey that there are critical reports within the European Union on human rights abuses, attacks on minorities and the closing down of the free press, while, on the other , we are saying it is okay to send refugees and migrants to what is supposedly a safe haven.  It does not stack up.  There is an absolute contradiction in that approach.</p></speech>

As Deputy Darragh O'Brien will be aware, Turkey is hosting in excess of 2.7 million migrants, an enormous number for any country.  Ireland, like our EU colleagues, is committed to finding a solution to this most serious problem.</p><p>From listening to some Deputies, one might be excused for forming the view that an imminent accession conclusion to the current issue is likely.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no question of Turkey gaining admission to the European Union until such time as all of the strict criteria, conditions and obligations are met.</p> <p> It is essential, in the context of what has happened in Turkey over the summer months, that the core principles of democracy, including human rights, must be protected in Turkey.  I once again urge the Turkish authorities to revert to ordinary procedures and safeguards as early as possible.  I will have an opportunity to engage with the European Commission on this issue before the end of this week.</p></speech>

She lived with her mother Audrey, stepfather David Mahon and her brother Dean.  She was 15 years of age at the time.</p>  <p>  The Spanish authorities put in a credible effort to locate her, sadly to no avail.  Subsequent to that, tragedy struck again when Amy's brother Dean, then aged 23, was stabbed to death by his stepfather, David Mahon, in Northern Cross in Dublin in May 2013.  David Mahon was tried and this year found guilty of the killing and is serving a seven-year sentence.  All of this has been an unimaginable ordeal for Amy and Dean's biological father, Christopher Fitzpatrick. </p>  <p>  Christopher and his sister Christine have never given up on trying to establish what became of Amy.  In light of events, Christopher and Christine reasonably feel that there is an obvious fresh line of inquiry that the Guardia Civil in Spain could pursue and that the help of the Government is needed to respectfully prompt the Spanish authorities to pursue this.  I am obviously constrained in what more I can say, but the Minister will understand.</p>  <p>  Christopher and Christine, who have supporters in the Gallery, submitted a letter to the Minister for Justice and Equality requesting that this be done.  My office was asked to submit a question to the Minister alluding to the letter and to seek a positive response.  My question was forwarded to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I ask him if he will take the necessary steps to talk to the Spanish authorities and, as necessary, liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality and-or garda&iacute; to ensure they share whatever information they think may be of use to the Guardia Civil in this matter.  It would be beneficial if the Department of Foreign and Trade and-or representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality could meet Christopher and Christine.</p></speech>

A clear commitment was given in the programme for Government for the school transport system to be reviewed in advance of budget 2017.  A press release was issued by the Department of Education and Skills on 29 July 2016 which stated the review process was underway and that the result of the review would be considered the context of budget 2017.  The statement is still available on the Department website.  However, it is now the end of November and we are still awaiting the results of the review.</p>  <p>  The Government has not honoured its commitment to carry out this review.  A cross-party group tasked with examining the many issues within the school transport scheme did not meet until late September, which was too late given that schools had reopened.  There was no realistic chance afforded to Opposition Deputies to effect meaningful change in advance of the budget as we held preliminary meetings a couple of weeks in advance.</p>  <p>  These meetings should have taken place in the early summer so that some work could be have been done before the D&aacute;il recess.  I was not surprised in the least to hear no mention of additional funding for the school transport scheme in budget 2017.  It was the clearest indication yet that the Government has no real interest in fixing the problems in the scheme, and it seems that it wants to continue a system that causes stress and anxiety for tens of thousands of families every September.</p>  <p>  I submitted a three page letter to the Minister's office in advance of budget 2017, containing a number of recommendations in respect of areas which must be addressed in advance of the next academic year.  More credence must be given to parents in respect of safety concerns.  I can cite one such example in south Kilkenny.  There is a pick-up and drop-off point at Butler's Cross for children attending Thomastown post-primary school.  Serious safety concerns were raised in respect of this location by a delegation comprising garda&iacute;, local authority, school authorities, public representatives and parents. </p>  <p>  One parent even produced an e-mail from the Road Safety Authority which recommended that the practice needed to be brought to the attention of the bus company or that the school involved needed to contact the bus company.  I raised safety concerns surrounding this location, which has a t-junction, a bad bend, a humpback bridge and cars travelling at 80 km/h, with the local school transport office and the head of school transport at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I was told that because the local inspector was happy that the location was safe, Bus &Eacute;ireann remained satisfied that the current pick-up point was suitable for purpose.  That is one such example - I have several others.</p>  <p>  How can one inspector's opinion overrule a delegation comprising garda&iacute;, the local authority, the school authorities, public representatives and parents?  This is just one example of a practice which the current school transport legislation and terms and conditions facilitate.  We must act urgently in advance of next year.</p>  <p>  Over a month ago the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, stood in the Chamber and stated the result of the review would be published within two weeks.  How long more we have to wait?  I held a meeting with the Minister of State and we were supposed to have follow-up meetings which never happened.  We were too late because the system was up and running in September.  We should have met in April or May, prior to the new school term.  The entire system needs to be examined.  I know of cases where families have been told that older siblings must attend one school and younger ones must attend others because the bus rules state they must attend the nearest school.</p>  <p>  As the Government knows, in rural Ireland we are all very parochial and in 1965 when schools were amalgamated a guarantee was given that transport agreements would be honoured.  Inspectors are telling some families that their children must attend schools in neighbouring parishes, which is not on.  We all have sporting, religious and other ties to our parishes.  That must be recognised and facilitated.</p></speech>

Before I address the issue of the review, I would like to give Members of the House an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  It is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department.  It covers over 100 million km annually and in the region of 114,000 children, including some 10,000 children with special educational needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.</p><p>In general, children are eligible under the school transport scheme if they are attending their nearest school and satisfy the requisite distance criteria - 3.2 km at primary level and 4.8 km at post-primary level.</p> <p> Before I go any further, the Deputy may not be aware that a value for money review was initiated in 2011 by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I work on the criteria introduced following the review.  That is not a criticism, but I am making the point that the criteria had been set when I entered the Department.  </p> <p> Transport on a concessionary basis is available to children who, because they are not attending their nearest school or reside less than the requisite distance from the school, are not eligible under the school transport scheme.  Transport on a concessionary basis is subject to a number of conditions which are detailed in the school transport scheme such as the availability of spare seats on the bus after all eligible children have been catered for and payment of the school transport charge.  The difficulty is that the number of children availing of school transport on a concessionary basis has increased significantly, from almost 4,000 children in 2010 to 25,000 children last year.</p> <p> The programme for Government committed to reviewing the concessionary charges and rules element of the school transport scheme and the review has been completed.  There were some difficulties because the review was complex and I had asked for all elements arising from the 2011 review to be dealt with.  We were to release the report on the review last week, but as there was a bereavement in the family of one of the authors of the review, we had to put it off.</p> <p> Furthermore, we have had some difficulties with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I know that the Deputy is aware of these, as he has brought some of the difficulties in his constituency to my attention, for which I commend him.  The chief executive officer will meet representatives of all parties tomorrow.  Following the meeting, the review will be put up on the website next week and a copy of it will be sent to every party in the House.  A follow-up meeting with all Members, including Deputy Bobby Aylward who made telling statements and recommendations, will also take place.  We will examine the report to see how we can change the scheme. </p> <p> The problem is that there are financial restrictions on us.  I have made the point before and will make it again, but if I had my way, every child would be able to avail of the scheme.  However, that is not within my remit.  It will require further legislation to make more money available if all parties want every child to be bussed to school.  I would be delighted to ensure every child would be able to avail of the scheme.</p> <p> After the meeting with Bus &Eacute;ireann tomorrow which should be fruitful, the report will be put on the website and a copy will be sent to everyone who wishes to have one.  It will certainly be sent to a representative of each party represented in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I accept that the last one was carried out under Fianna F&aacute;il and that the criteria were set down at that time.  However, we need to review the scheme.  I, therefore, look forward to the meeting with Bus &Eacute;ireann tomorrow.</p>  <p>  The problem I highlighted is just one example of a vast array of fundamental problems with the school transport scheme.  When I approach the Department, the head of school transport in Bus &Eacute;ireann or the local office with any problem on behalf of a constituent, the standard, robotic response blindly quotes the legislation.  No matter what I do, that is what I get back.  Then I am told that we are the legislators and that it is for us to change the scheme.  That is why I welcome the review.  We in this House must change the legislation if that is what is necessary because Bus &Eacute;ireann only implements the legislation handed down by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  These problems will not go away until legislative action is taken.</p>  <p>  The School Transport Appeals Board is absolutely not fit for purpose.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, I was informed that not one appeal had been successful in 2015 or 2016.  Is it for show that we have the appeals board?  The total payments to the members of the board in 2015 amounted to &euro;14,403.  This year to date, the payments made amount to &euro;10,844.  The board needs to be scrapped with immediate effect before another penny is wasted.  The fact that no appeal has been successful in two years tells a story.  </p>  <p>  When a Deputy or any public representative wants to make an appeal, in Waterford in our case, we just get the robotic answer: "We can do nothing."  An inspector has all the power and no one can overrule him or her.  What he or she says stands and we have no say.  I need to see an appeals system or some concessionary system in place in order that we would be able to go to someone to make our case and be heard.  There are genuine cases, in which perhaps 100 m is the difference between a child getting on or not getting on a bus and families being split.  I want an appeals board that listens to the concerns of Deputies, Senators and other political representatives.  I ask the Minister of State to take this on board and ensure there will be an appeals system in place that will work for the people.  That is what we stood up in 1965 when schools were amalgamated and it is the principle to which we should return.</p></speech>

I know this from being in opposition and will not say otherwise.  I make the point that many appeals involve the requisite distance.  The difficulty is that the criteria are a distance of 3.2 km from a primary school and 4.8 km from a post-primary school.  Where do we stop?  Do we reduce the distance to 2.1 km or 1.2 km?  I am sure the Deputy can understand from where I am coming.</p>  <p>  I understand some of the appeals are difficult.  The Department tells me that we either set criteria - they were set by Fianna F&aacute;il when in government - or we do not.  By the way, it was not a criticism of the Deputy's party when I stated it had put the appeals mechanism in place.  It was the right thing to do, but we do face a difficulty.  I will take on board what the Deputy said about the appeals mechanism.  After the meeting with the chief executive officer of Bus &Eacute;ireann tomorrow, we will meet again.  The Deputy might examine the new plan for concessionary travel.  If we disagree or there is a problem with it, we can sit down to see if we can work through it.</p>  <p>  Again, the big difficulty is the finance needed to include every child in the scheme.  If someone tells me in the morning that another &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million is available to me, we can do it and we will have no problem with travel to school on a concessionary basis for children and few problems with eligibility.  However, we should wait until we meet Bus &Eacute;ireann tomorrow.  The Deputy has made very good recommendations at our meetings.   Let us go through the review process and then sit down to see where we go from there.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300036#JJ01300"><p>I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  On Monday morning 400 farmers in County Kerry received a letter from the Revenue Commissioners requesting a payment for under-declaration of income based on patronage shares they had received from Kerry Co-op.  To say this was a shock to the system is an understatement.  We have spent the past six months in this Chamber fighting the cause of the agriculture sector.  We have had extremely bad weather and poor milk, grain and beef prices.  To receive a letter of this nature, unannounced and without warning, was to say the least a shock to the system for every farmer who received it.</p><p>My understanding of the tax code as it pertains to shares is that a share is only a piece of paper until such time as the shareholder cashes it in and realises its value, at which point capital gains tax or other taxes due are paid.  I am not sure from where Revenue is coming on this issue because it has been long-standing practice to issue patronage shares.  During the years many farmers have declared patronage shares in the accounts they or their accountants have submitted to Revenue and no issues have arisen.  On Monday morning, however, an issue suddenly arose with them. <br/><br/>Yesterday I spoke to a farmer who had received one of these letters, despite being given a clean bill of health following a full Revenue audit.  There is something systemically wrong when someone in the Revenue Commissioners can issue letters requesting the payment of outstanding tax on the basis that he or she has determined there has been an under-declaration of income.  The nature and tone of the letter are even more worrying.  I will read an excerpt: </p><blockquote>This intervention is being conducted as an Aspect Query.  This affords you the opportunity of making an Unprompted Voluntary Disclosure under the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions thereby minimising potential penalties together with avoiding publication and prosecution if all conditions attaching to making such a disclosure are met. </blockquote><p>In other words, if the farmer does not pay up, Revenue will perform an audit, impose tax and penalties and put his or her name in the newspaper.  This is, to say the least, heavy-handed.  To add insult to injury, the letter states Revenue looks forward to hearing from the farmer in question within 21 days.  Farmers are hard pressed to find money and most have been forced to sell animals to pay their income tax bills for the year.  They now face bills of between &euro;25,000 and &euro;50,000 and have only three weeks in which to pay.  Where is the fairness and justice in that?  It is beyond comprehension that something like this can happen, particularly in farming which is under great pressure.<br/><br/>This is only the start of the process because the issue affects all co-operatives, including Glanbia and Dairygold, and may even extend to shares issued outside agriculture.  The matter must be tackled.  I ask that the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to explain the position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300037#KK00200"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion.  This is an important issue for me and the farming community I represent in County Limerick.  My colleagues and I fully respect the work and independence of the Revenue Commissioners who have a difficult job which they do professionally.  Equally, however, we are fully within our rights in raising this issue and querying the actions of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The issue we are discussing must be viewed against the backdrop of what farm families have been experiencing in recent years.  I am sure the Minister of State in the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is aware of the background.  Milk and beef prices have been substantially suppressed in recent years.  This has impacted directly on the margins and incomes of many farm families, thousands of whom rely on the family income supplement and survive from hand to mouth.  The Common Agricultural Policy has been reformed, milk quotas have been eliminated and the prospect of Brexit has created considerable uncertainty which is impacting on the agriculture sector and caused great worry for farmers and their families.  In addition, the farming community has expressed fear and concern about proposed international trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, both of which are causing uncertainty in terms of increased competition and price suppression.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, it was also revealed recently to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, that only 50% of the funding allocated under the rural development programme had been paid out to farm families this year.  Of the &euro;494 million provided across the various schemes, including the agri-environmental options scheme, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the rural environmental protection and early retirement schemes for farmers, only &euro;256 million has been paid out thus far this year.  </p>  <p>  This is the context in which farm families are operating.  In recent days Revenue dropped a bombshell in seeking to change the treatment of patronage shares which suppliers and members of Kerry Co-op have received during the years.  Farmers are not trying to evade or avoid tax.  They are happy to pay tax, but they need to be given a degree of certainty.  Patronage shares have always been treated under the capital gains tax code.  Revenue has changed tack and appears to be seeking to treat these shares under the income tax code and, moreover, to do so retrospectively.  This has caused immense upset among people who have been asked to find significant sums to pay Revenue and meet their obligations.  Farmers have already made their cashflow management plans for the coming years and will have made commitments to purchase machinery, make repayments on investments in buildings and engaged in general business planning.  As with all other businesses, farms must be managed on the basis of plans.  Has Revenue changed its interpretation of the tax code in respect of patronage shares?  If so, people need to know the reason it has done so.  As Deputy John Brassil stated, people have been given tax clearance following Revenue audits.</p>  <p>  It has also been noted that the Kerry Group had an obligation to inform its members of this issue.  Where does the company stand on the matter?  I ask the Minister of State to provide some clarity on these matters because Deputies need to be able to reassure their constituents that they will be dealt with in a fair and proportionate manner, rather than being subjected to the threatening language used in recent correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1283" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300037#KK00300"><p>I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputies to raise this matter.  Approximately 400 farmers received a letter from the Revenue Commissioners yesterday on shares issued by Kerry Co-op.  I understand Revenue has been through the mill on co-op shares which it refused to accept as income, determining instead that they were subject to capital gains rather than income tax when they were sold.  Some people questioned this determination and I understand Revenue made clear at the time that the 33.3% capital gains tax rate applied to these shares.  Why has the position changed on this type of share?  As my colleagues stated, clarification is required on the issue.</p>  <p>  If an issue arose with these shares, it should have been flagged to avoid farmers reading the letters which Deputy John Brassil cited at their kitchen tables.  The language used is unacceptable.  The farmers involved submit income tax returns and some of them have paid capital gains tax on income received from the sale of Kerry Co-op shares.  They did so with the approval of the Revenue Commissioners, including in years for which the Revenue Commissioners have stated an income tax liability arises.  They traded shares and paid capital gains tax on the income from such sales and the Revenue Commissioners subsequently issued them with tax clearance certificates.  Why has this change been made without first warning farmers?</p><p>Everyone understands and accepts it has been a ferociously difficult year for farming, particularly for the dairy industry.  The price of milk has been at its lowest in a generation and yet the Revenue wrote willy-nilly to the farmers in question and has indicated more letters will be going to other farmers involved.  There should have been some indication as to what Revenue was thinking.</p> <p> How come Revenue changed its mind?  It is not as if these shares were not declared by farmers to the Revenue Commissioners.  In some instances, they have traded the shares, paid the 33% capital gains tax on them and were given the okay by the Revenue Commissioners.  Given this development, a farmer with 70 cows producing 70,000 gallons of milk could be landed with a bill of &euro;10,000.  Anyone who knows the farming community knows that after one of the most difficult trading years in living memory, such a farmer would not even have 10,000 cent to pay the Revenue Commissioners, let alone &euro;10,000.  This is high-handed and needs to be explained.  As my colleagues said, the Revenue Commissioners need to give us an explanation.  The whole issue has to be revisited because it has put fear into the farming community in the Kerry Group region, as well as other farmers in milk processing.  Will the Minister of State clarify the situation?  The Revenue Commissioners owe us a detailed explanation so we can inform our constituents of their thinking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300038#LL00200"><p>With regard to Deputy John Brassil's proposal that I request the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, it is a matter for the committee to set its own work agenda and to issue invitations accordingly.  I am sure the Deputy will request the committee to do that himself.</p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Revenue Commissioners in 1923, successive Governments and the Oireachtas have reaffirmed the principle of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in their dealings with the tax affairs of any individual under tax and customs legislation.  This independence is seen as critical to maintaining the integrity of the taxation system and forms a key pillar of Revenue's governance framework.</p>  <p>  I can, however, address the issue of the taxation of the shares received by Kerry Co-op suppliers.  It is my understanding these shares were received by milk suppliers, as a consequence of and in proportion to, the quantity of milk supplied.  The shares are, therefore, a payment received by the farmer for their milk supply and form part of the farmer's trading income for the relevant year.  This is similar to the general tax treatment applying in respect of share-based remuneration for employees other than certain restrictive Revenue-approved share schemes.  Employees are liable to income tax, USC and PRSI on their share awards for similar reasons, namely, the share award is linked to their work and is, therefore, treated as taxable employment income.  To apply a different treatment to farmers who receive valuable shares as a result of their ongoing trading relationship with the co-operative would call into question the taxation of all forms of share-based remuneration received by employees or self-employed contractors in other sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  It must be accepted the patronage shares received by the co-op members are valuable assets.  The shares can be sold for cash, they can be gifted or transferred to a new owner, and they convey voting and dividend rights on the shareholder.  In many cases, the values received by farmers were considerable.  For example, in 2013, the value received by farmers ranged from zero up to &euro;39,330, with the average value received being approximately &euro;4,860.  The receipt of shares to this value would have been disclosed by many farmers to their accountants.  The letters issued by Revenue this month have in the first instance been inquiries as to whether the values received have been included in their accounts.  Farmers who were tax compliant and disclosed the value received will, therefore, not be facing any additional income tax.  It would be inequitable for those farmers who did correctly declare this income if Revenue did not follow up on those who did not.</p>  <p>  In regard to the questions raised by Deputies Niall Collins and Michael Moynihan, there has been no change in policy on the imposition of income tax or capital gains tax to such awards.  Capital gains tax applies to the growth in value of a capital asset.  For example, where an individual sells a share that has grown in value since the time it was acquired, capital gains tax would apply on the increase in value.  The matter at issue in this case is the original market value of the shares received by the farmers as a result of their trading relationship with the co-op.  The shares were a form of payment received for the milk supplied by the farmers.  Accordingly, the value of the shares forms part of the trading income of the farmers for the relevant years.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the difficulties facing dairy farmers this year as a result of falls in milk prices.  Several measures have been taken to assist such farmers, particularly in unusually poor trading years.  Farmers may already elect for income averaging, which allows them to average their income over a five-year period for the purposes of calculating taxable profits to smooth the volatility which can occur in farm incomes.  In budget 2017, the Minister for Finance introduced an opt-out from the scheme so as to allow farmers experiencing a particularly difficult year to opt out of the scheme in that year, pay the tax liability for that year's profits alone, and then return to income averaging in the subsequent year.</p>  <p>  I would advise any farmers who have received this letter from Revenue to discuss it with their agents to ascertain if any additional liabilities are due, and, if so, to make contact with the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State clarify if Revenue will pursue all the individuals in question for penalties and extra payments and subsequently publish their names in the newspapers?  That is what is written down in the letter I read out to the Minister of State earlier.</p>  <p>  A share price is only realised on the day it is sold.  These happen to be Kerry Group shares.  What if these were shares of less value or if the share price had completely collapsed?  Where would one be then, having paid income tax on a share which is worthless?  I am struggling to come to terms with Revenue's analysis.  If it is to be taxed at the income tax rate, then it should be when the shares are sold.  One cannot ask somebody to pay income tax on what is effectively a piece of paper.  This happens in cases where companies reward employees with bonuses of shares, namely, the tax is paid when one realises the value of the share.</p>  <p>  At the very least, I request that each individual will be written to again and told this issue will be dealt with in a fair and timely manner, as well as removing the threat of prosecution, penalties and the publication of the individual's name in the newspapers?</p></speech>

He stated this is similar to the general tax treatment applied in respect of share-based remuneration for employees.  He will appreciate that farmers are self-employed and there is a distinction in the tax code between employees and self-employed.  That needs to be teased out a little further.  Revenue should look at that to see if we can try to resolve this issue.</p>  <p>  I am sure Revenue has been aware of patronage shares in Kerry Co-op and in other co-ops across the country, if it pertains to those such as Dairy Gold.  The Revenue Commissioners will have been in receipt of capital gains tax returns from those who sold these patronage shares over the years.  Why are the Revenue Commissioners now claiming they have to be treated through the income tax part of the code?  This does not make sense and we deserve an explanation for that.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners should afford the people in question a large degree of forbearance for all the reasons I outlined earlier, including the pressures the farming sector and farm families have experienced over the past several years.</p><p>As I said, nobody is trying to evade or avoid tax.  People are happy to meet their obligations but want fairness and recognition that they are self-employed rather than employees, as outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1283" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300039#MM00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.  It states, "Farmers who were tax compliant and disclosed the value received will therefore not be facing any additional income tax."  As I understand it, all farmers declared the shares in their tax returns and have done so for a long time.  It is bordering on insulting to use the line I have quoted.  All the farmers were declaring the shares to the Revenue Commissioners for a long time.  As my colleague said, the Revenue Commissioners have collected capital gains tax on the sale of these shares.  It is only when the shares are part of a spin-out from the co-operative to the plc that they become valuable.  To be fair to the farmers, they have been tax compliant and have been submitting information to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is quite clear that the Revenue Commissioners have taken a policy decision in regard to them.  Why are they changing policy?  Why the heavy-handedness in the letter, including the reference to responding in 21 days.  The Revenue Commissioners should have examined this in a proper, calm and rational way.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is implying in his response that there are farmers who are not tax compliant.  According to my information and that of the many farmers to whom I have spoken over the past 36 to 48 hours, they are tax compliant.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department need to recognise that and ensure the view is not being circulated that farmers are not tax compliant.  They have been declaring the full value of the shares to the Revenue Commissioners for a long time and they have been paying capital gains tax on any occasion they sold the shares, for whatever reason.  Perhaps the Minister of State will re-examine this.  The shares become valuable only if there is a spin-out to the plc.  Perhaps clarification is needed on that.   Forbearance and common sense need to apply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300039#MM00300"><p>I very much appreciate the concerns of the Deputies on this issue but I must underline again the independence of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department of Finance does not deal with the individual tax affairs of citizens.  I suggest that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach takes up Deputy Brassil's suggestion and examines this issue so it can be explained properly and fully by the Revenue Commissioners.  There has been no change in policy and no one is operating on the assumption that someone may not be tax compliant.</p>  <p>  In so far as the letters issued are concerned, the wording is standard wording used by the Revenue Commissioners for all forms of aspect queries.  If the shares were not mentioned during the course of an audit, they may not have been considered by the auditor.  It is not necessary to pay the liability within 21 days; it is necessary for farmers to assess their situation and make contact with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  Capital gains tax would have applied on the uplift in value of the shares.  The case raised relates to the original market value received, that is, the base cost that could have been deductible for capital gains tax purposes.  This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners but, in general, where a taxpayer co-operates with the Revenue Commissioners and makes a voluntary disclosure, publication does not apply.  This is an issue faced by employees also.  In many cases, they choose to sell a proportion of shares in order to pay the tax due and hold the balance.  With regard to how the Revenue Commissioners might collect any tax due, they offer a wide range of payment and phased-payment options that would allow affected farmers to meet their income tax obligations in a manner that best suits their individual circumstances.  Affected farmers are advised to engage with the Revenue Commissioners early to address the issues raised.  The 21-day period mentioned in the letter is about making contact with the Revenue Commissioners.  There is not a demand for payment within 21 days, even on the assumption that there is a liability.  The letter makes reference to where there may be a concern or something to be declared.  In cases where a full disclosure was made in a tax return, it is unlikely that any taxation or additional taxation is due.</p>  <p>  On why the shares are being treated as taxable income, they are patronage shares issued by a co-operative to members arising from the trading relationship between the member and co-operative.  In effect, the greater the business links between the milk supplier and the co-operative, the greater the benefit and, therefore, the profit received by the supplier by way of a number of patronage shares issued by the co-operative.</p>  <p>  I am aware this is an issue of concern and that there are details to be considered.  I have more detailed notes that I would be happy to share with the Deputies so that they might understand the approach from the Revenue Commissioners in so far as the Department of Finance is concerned.  However, this is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in so far as its operations are concerned in this area of patronage shares and the letters that have recently been issued to the farmers concerned.</p></speech>

It will soon be a year since parts of areas both he and I represent, including Ballinaheglish, Brackloon, Ballyglass, Smaghraan and all areas around Roscommon and Galway, got a ferocious pounding.  Family life was disrupted by the massive amount of flooding in those areas.  A new Government has been formed in the past year and funding has had to be made available to address the flooding.  The Minister and all politicians, including me, have lobbied constantly to try to get relief to address the nightmare endured by many families over the past year.  The Minister's Department carried out GSI surveys in the area.  Some works could not be carried out.  We were all lobbying for machines to open channels that were not opened in many years, where there were bushes growing and where water was being blocked.  The good news is that Roscommon County Council, in fairness to it, has brought in machines in recent weeks to try to do work.  Ironically, last Saturday - it was not Friday, although the machine had been working at the location for a few weeks - work was stopped by the fisheries.  I refer not only to Brackloon but to all the areas that have suffered the torture of flooding in the past year, especially across the west.  We have to make sure that when some remedial flood prevention work commences, we use a bit of common sense.  We are all trying to get this work done.</p>  <p>  I have worked throughout Ireland on several jobs, including on the River Liffey, a canal and most of the big rivers laying pipes and doing various other jobs.  I am not going to say everything was perfect and that all our paperwork was 100%.  I will never say that because the man who does so is foolish, but the one thing I ask is that, in light of the urgency, especially along the Shannon and in counties Roscommon, Galway, Mayo, Westmeath and Longford, which have been very hard hit and where families have had to endure torture, the Minister give a direction to his Department, which is responsible for fisheries, to ensure someone will say we need to do X, Y and Z if things are not 100% right.  If there is paperwork to be done, we should sit down and do it.  I am not saying we should not dot the i's and cross the t's.  What has happened is that a machine has been idle for nearly a week.  The driver has gone home and the machine has been left there.  The Minister knows the area as well as I do.  They were actually working on a dry drain.  It was going up to near Ballinaheglish, where there is basically a reedbed.  Will the Minister give a direction to his Department to ensure that when it finds something or believes something is not right, it will work straight away with the relevant authority or farmer - there may be different scenarios in different circumstances - and rectify it while keeping the work going.  The latter is the important part.  Neither the Minister nor I, or any other Deputy, wants the rain to come hammering down in a month's time only to have people again go through the torture they went through last year.</p></speech>

I am surprised that he has done so because he stated on local radio last week that he would raise the issue of rural broadband with me.  He did not do that last week or this week in the House.  Last week, while I was being attacked locally, I was trying to put mechanisms in place to support our local beef farmers in the context of the ongoing climate change negotiations.</p><p>I was also surprised because this issue was raised in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i>on 8 November when Mr. James Fogarty wrote an article.  I contacted him afterwards, as did my officials, to explain the situation.  We also explained it to the flood action group in Castleplunkett.  My officials have been in contact with the group a number of times since.</p><p>Roscommon County Council submitted two applications for a derogation on works, one for south Roscommon and the other for mid-Roscommon.  My departmental officials and Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, were out on the ground and spoke to the council engineers in October.  We have been expecting an application to be submitted to IFI since then, but it has not been received.  In fact, IFI stated in the 8 November article that it had not halted works in the area and would contribute to the method statement regarding the environmental mitigation measures that needed to be put in place.</p><p>Deputy Fitzmaurice was present for the visit of the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to the community in Castleplunkett when I made it crystal clear that my Department and I as Minister would facilitate in every way possible any work that could be undertaken.  I took the bull by the horns as Minister.  Instead of considering what was happening in terms of our turloughs, I directed my officials to start carrying out works without waiting for Government sanction.  A body of work and potential solutions are now in place to solve some of the turlough problems.</p><p>I have instructed my officials in the inland fisheries division and IFI to bend over backwards in facilitating local authorities where possible.  Last month, they offered to assist Roscommon County Council with the requisite application.</p><p>IFI is an agency of my Department tasked under section 7(1) of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 with responsibility for the conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource and recreational sea angling.  My Department and IFI work positively with Departments, State agencies, local authorities, groups and individuals on the broad issue of surface water maintenance and channel conveyance throughout Ireland.  IFI is precluded under fisheries legislation from approving in-stream works, those being, works in water, during certain sensitive periods annually, which primarily relate to fish spawning activity.  To minimise adverse impacts on the fisheries resource, works in rivers, streams, water courses, lakes, reservoirs and ponds should, except in exceptional circumstances that I will outline, be carried out during the period 1 July to 30 September.</p><p>On 2 September and with a view to flooding issues in recent years, IFI acted proactively and sent a circular to each local authority's chief executive advising that the window of opportunity for undertaking any necessary in-stream work was drawing to a close.  IFI reminded the local authorities that all programmed works in-stream needed to be completed by 30 September.</p><p>It is important to state that the advice was in the context of IFI's legislative responsibilities and that local authorities were also advised that there may be other agencies under which sanction or approval for this type of work was required, for example, the Office of Public Works and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p></speech>

The facts are there for anyone to see; this is not me saying it.  The assessment was conducted across Ireland.  Our area is deplorable.</p>  <p>  Councils have been awaiting money for a while.  It is good that they have the money to do the works.  Maybe someone overlooked something, but I am speaking as someone who has worked in various parts of Ireland.  When the Minister was in opposition, he spoke at several meetings that I attended at which he referred to various counties where people were more prone to receiving penalties from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister use as much of his discretion as possible or work constructively with the councils?  I welcome his statement that he has told them to go as far as they can.  I am making my request not for the benefit of the councils, me or the Minister, but for the local communities and people who underwent torture during the year.  When a machine is on site, surely there are ways for common sense to prevail and the work to continue over a day or two.  The Minister and I have seen how round bales of straw can be packed together in a drain or on a river.  This method was even used in Connemara.  It is acceptable in places.  Solutions can be found if people work together, but that will not be the case if a machine is just stopped flat on the ground.</p></speech>

IFI met the council, told it the procedure to be followed and said that it was willing to assist the council in doing that.  The Deputy is asking me to use discretion, but my officials and I can only use flexibility and discretion if the legal process of asking for same is followed.  The Deputy knows that did not happen in this case.  The local community also knows because my officials have kept it up to date on this matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300041#PP00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>We had a debate last night and in some ways this is a continuation of that debate and I want to use it, if I can, to explain some of the substance of the Bill.  Some of the issues that are highlighted here could be the subject of the wider debate and the consultation process that we expect to happen in the next six months in advance of a Bill, hopefully this one, finally being agreed.</p>  <p>  I will begin by looking at the structures and then set out the responsibilities.  Deputy Catherine Martin will set the wider scene.  The Title of the Bill is the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill.  We seek to have a mayor of Dublin not a lord mayor.  It is a small detail but it is appropriate to have a mayor of Dublin in the same way as there is a mayor of New York and London.  We do not need to attach the title &ldquo;lord&rdquo; to it.  Whether Dublin City Council continues to use that title in its own mayoral office is a matter for the council.  It is a mayor for all the people and that is the title whoever would win the office would have.</p>  <p>  Most Members present yesterday seemed to broadly agree with the concept of having a mayor and from what I heard in the contributions, most would agree with the structure we have put in place in that we are not seeking to dismantle the existing four council structure in Dublin.  We seek to use the structure and, as Deputy Lahart said yesterday, bring them together to co-operate rather than just compete with each other.  We propose to set up a regional authority for Dublin composed of the cathaoirleach of each local authority, the lord mayor from Dublin City Council and 11 other members who would make up a regional authority of 15 members who would work with the elected mayor in terms of the overall management of the city, providing co-ordination and the various responsibilities we want to give this office.</p>  <p>  Some might argue that perhaps there should be greater or less representation or that the structure should be different.  I would be interested to hear ideas.  The Bill is easily amended to provide for variations.  I believe a team of 15 is about right.  Most of us who work in politics recognise that if one goes much beyond that in size one gets a different breaking down of groups and it does not work as easily in meetings.  There is a reason we have a Cabinet of 15 in the Executive.  I think it is the appropriate number and it allows representation from the councils, including their cathaoirligh, to provide the connection and co-ordination which is what we seek.</p>  <p>  The other advantage of this way of introducing the mayoral office and the regional authority is that we believe it could be done without putting an additional burden on the taxpayer.  We all know that one cannot present an Opposition Bill which has major financial implications for the State.  The structure we set out in the Bill does not do that and that is the reason we are able to present the Bill.  The Bill provides a staff of six to work in the office and a chief executive officer to work with the directly-elected mayor and it allows for the possibility of bringing in additional services and staff but the process involves using the existing administrative resources in the Dublin local authority system in order to cover the costs.  The answer to the question of whether we are not just creating another layer of bureaucracy and adding huge additional costs is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight four areas where we believe a directly-elected mayor could have real responsibility.  First, the Bill allows for the establishment of a greater Dublin transport authority, which would work in conjunction with the National Transport Authority to provide strategic oversight in terms of the regional planning of transport within the city.  Any Dubliner knows we face a real crisis in the city.  We can see it with traffic volumes growing by at least 5% or 6% per annum with major transport infrastructure, such as the M50, now gridlocking and no prospect of providing additional capacity on the road network.  We failed to deliver significant public transport projects in time and there has been a lack of funding by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, or any attention from him to the immediate need we have for investment in bus, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.  There is a clear need to have an office that has real power to pull the various agencies together and to get them working in a co-ordinated way.</p>  <p>  From a previous existence as a cycling campaigner working in the Dublin Transportation Office, my experience is that what hindered progress in terms of transport planning in the city was the lack of co-ordination, agency rivalry and fighting between Dublin Bus, the then Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and the various councils.  A co-ordinating body in transport is needed and someone who is responsible for that to make sure people do work together, think long term and deliver the sort of connected transport thinking in the city that has not been the case in my lifetime and is not the case currently.</p>  <p>  The second area of responsibility in which we wish to give real power to the mayor is in the area of housing.  The critical powers the mayor would have are in the setting and development of a regional spatial plan for the city.  The mayor would have a power of direction over the four councils, which is essential so that they do not repeat what happened previously, namely, competition between the four local authorities for rates and development levies which did not provide for the co-ordinated development of the city.  Such a power, which we provide for in the Bill, is badly needed.</p>  <p>  There was an unintended consequence from an initial good idea in that when it was decided to deal with extreme poverty in the city centre it was decided to clear the slums that existed in Dublin in the early part of the 20th century and we started to move the city out.  The unintended consequence is that we never stopped.  Dublin continues to spread further and further out, whereby we are creating a doughnut city.  That type of sprawl can no longer occur.  We must start bringing life back into the centre of the city because if we do not the transport system will not work.  Another factor is that quality of life will disimprove because people will have such long commutes that they will spend most of their time either on a train or in a car rather than spending time with their family or at work.  Housing is the second key area in which a mayor can take the initiative and bring housing back into the centre, combined with a high quality environment, which is what people are looking for now as we move back into city centres.</p>  <p>  The third area of responsibility for a directly-elected mayor is waste.  Anyone who has been involved on Dublin City Council in particular would welcome that.  In recent years we have seen that the power has been vested in an unaccountable management which completed ignored the wishes expressed by democratically elected members of the city council over the past 15 to 20 years.  As a result, we have ended up with a very large incinerator in the centre of the city which is out of date and does not serve us well.  We want to give the mayor power rather than the managers having power over the waste system, which is what exists at present with no accountability either to this House or to any of the councils.</p><p> Perhaps most importantly, we set out in the Bill the need for the establishment of a regional development board which would take into account not just the Cathaoirligh of the four councils but also representatives from the city from the economic community, development agencies, trade unions and those from an environmental and arts and cultural background so that we start pushing economic and cultural development of our city in a co-ordinated way.  We are already good at this as a city.  We are a successful city.  There is no doubt that Dublin has prospered in the past 20 or 30 years because we have a strong sense of cultural identity and have developed a tech industry, a financial services industry and a very significant tourism industry but everyone who works in those industries will recognise that an opportunity has been missed to really hone and get the development of the city right by having a clear vision around what sort of digital, cultural and enterprise strategies we want to promote.  </p> <p> I was involved in Dublin's bid to become European City of Culture, which was won by Galway - fair play to it.  I thought it was a disgrace that Dublin did not qualify for the final round.  I do not understand how that came to pass because the work that was being done on the bid was exemplary.  The reason it was exemplary and why the city council was doing a really good job was because it was bottom up.  It engaged the citizens.  It was not top down.  That sort of approach is the one we want to apply with our Bill.  Yes, we want to give the mayor powers but we want to do so to give the people of Dublin the power to be able to see and set out the development of our city and to have someone they can call to and hold to account if this is not happening.  That is what this extensive Bill allows for.</p></speech>

A directly elected mayor freed from party politics and the grip of senior council officials can deliver for Dublin.  Council officials have a role to play but it should not be the lead role as they have no democratic mandate and, therefore, are in no way truly accountable to the people.  We need one elected individual - a readily identifiable and recognisable individual who will be the face of Dublin.  We want to put a "face to a place".  </p>  <p>  This is a simple and easy way to deliver political accountability.  It involves a person who will represent all of Dublin both at home and on the international stage and stand up for Dublin - a person whose sole job is to put his or her citizens first and be the focal point to drive the development and progress of the city, support its people, look out for opportunities, protect the city and its citizens against challenges and steward this city towards a long-term sustainable vision.  A directly elected mayor should be a visionary leader, an ambassador who can lead their city, attracting long-term and sustainable investment and jobs.  There is no reason we cannot have a mayor for Dublin followed by a mayor for Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny.  However, it makes sense to start with Dublin where a directly elected mayor would have a mandate from over a quarter of the State's population.</p>  <p>  The C40 global initiative is led by mayors from over 40 world cities who are developing strategies for how each of their cities can lead the way in preventing and staving off the negative consequences of climate change.  A huge number of European cities are at the table but, unfortunately, Dublin is not.  Dublin is not competing with Limerick, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny or Waterford.  It is competing with London, Hamburg, Warsaw and Barcelona.  We need to find new ways to make Dublin and our cities places that are attractive to invest in and more satisfying for people to live in.  We need to be pioneering different and innovative approaches for our cities, all built around the challenges we face.  </p>  <p>  If we look to the UK, we see that Manchester is focusing on the promotion of business creation.  Sunderland is the first English city to use cloud technology to offer broadband service everywhere.  Leeds has developed the concept of "civic enterprise" that mobilises public assets in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors to create innovative responses to public need, for example, the need for sustainable energy.  Bristol is working to create a new social model which will enable its citizens and social institutions to create a non-state vehicle for social investment.  </p>  <p>  It is no coincidence that cities that seem to be adapting to social and technological change are cities like Chicago that are led by strong mayors like Rahm Emmanuel.  Much can be learned from cities like Chicago and New York, not just about policy but also about leadership.  It is striking how mayors like Michael Bloomberg and Rahm Emmanuel embody their cities without getting trapped in parochialism.  They have an outward-looking, entrepreneurial focus that makes them ambitious for their cities, as well as being attuned to what makes their places special.  For example the transformation of New York's Times Square has had a hugely positive impact way beyond Manhattan and shows what can be done.</p>  <p>  We cannot change mayors every 12 months and expect coherent and effective leadership.  Some longevity and continuity is vital.  Sticking with the current annual ritual where political horse trading decides who gets to wear the ceremonial mayoral chain for the following year does not serve the best interest of the citizens.  Our cities need real, transparent and accountable leadership and that means the office of mayor cannot remain a ceremonial role.  The new role must have day-to-day executive powers and be given some real input into improving the quality of daily life of Dubliners.  It needs to be not only their unified voice expressing their concerns but be empowered to resolve for example the escalating transport and safety challenges that cyclists, motorists and pedestrians face, to promote Dublin tourism on the world stage and to foster and promote the arts and literature.  Dublin is uniquely placed to do much more to utilise its world renowned standing in the world of arts and literature.  It is time we got the development of urban Ireland right and directly elected women and men with the vision to take on that task.</p><p>We want to give every Dubliner a vote in 2019 for a directly elected mayor.  We must allow Dubliners to take greater ownership of their city, entrust the people of Dublin and give them a real say and ensure all avenues to have a better Dublin will always be fully explored and utilised.  This is a real opportunity to do that.  The idea of having a directly elected mayor has been talked about and investigated for almost 20 years.  In those years it has received the support of many political parties and Independents.  It is time for action.</p></speech>

The programme provides that, having consulted widely with all relevant stakeholders, the Minister will, by mid-2017, prepare a report on such measures for the Government and the Oireachtas.</blockquote><p>We are again talking about mayors.  I think I outlined last night why it was both appropriate and necessary, if Dublin was to fulfil its potential, to look at providing for an office that could play a co-ordinating and a much more focused and outward-looking leadership role for the city.  I am happy to work towards this.  I believe Deputy John Lahart and Green Party Members, as can be seen this evening, are also working towards it.</p><p>I am pleased to participate in the debate as it provides another opportunity to take forward our discussions on local government reform in the Dublin region.  The debate last night was marked by a good spirit of co-operation on all sides of the House and I look forward to this continuing as we work through the important issues involved.  As the House is aware, the discussions last night were on the separate Private Members' Bill from Fianna F&aacute;il that also concerned having a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  However, the provisions of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill and the Bill before the House take a very different approach.  While last night we were discussing a process leading to a plebiscite and a decision, the Green Party Bill proposes the establishment of a mayoral office.  I understand and appreciate the intention of the Bill which seeks to provide for improved co-ordination and leadership at local government level across the Dublin region by legislating for the formal establishment of a directly elected mayor with conferred functions across a range of policy areas.</p><p>The Bill also provides for the establishment of a Dublin regional authority, as well as a Dublin regional development board and a greater Dublin area transport council, to work with the directly elected mayor in administering the conferred functions.  The Bill envisages the mayor, the regional authority and other bodies taking over specific responsibilities in the areas of land use, waste management, transport and housing services planning.  The specific land use functions proposed in the Bill do not take into account the fact that, under Part 10 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the task of preparing regional planning guidelines has been assigned to the new regional assemblies in the form of new regional spatial and economic strategies.  In the case of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, this covers a much larger geographical area than that envisaged in the Green Party Bill.  Similarly, since 2013, waste management planning has been aligned with the larger eastern and midlands area and is a function of the executives, rather than elected members, of local authorities.  The transfer of such powers to a Dublin mayor would be at variance with the approach taken in the rest of the country.  I am not saying it is not workable, but we need to be cognisant of it.</p><p>On transport, the Bill emphasises the role of the proposed mayor and a proposed Dublin transport council in certain statutory functions of the National Transport Authority, but it lacks clarity as regards resolving the issue of how to address satisfactorily the accountability of the NTA in the wider greater Dublin area in the preparation and implementation of a transport strategy to cover the four administrative counties of Dublin and also the counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow which are all intertwined from a transport policy perspective, given the number of people who work in Dublin and live in these counties.</p><p>The Bill does not fully take into account reform measures introduced by the previous Government such as the replacement of eight regional authorities by three regional assemblies in 2014.</p><p>As regards structures and governance, it is not entirely clear how the mayor would relate to and work with the four Dublin local authorities.</p><p>All of these points reflect issues with the Bill, as it stands, and explain the difficulties we on this side of the House see with it at this point.  They are not necessarily fatal to the Bill, but they mean that a lot of work needs to be done with its provisions before it could be considered a workable model for a directly elected mayor.</p><p>The Bill, in particular, needs to be considered in the context of the commitment in the programme for Government which provides for a necessary period of preparation and a consultation process before a report on local government reform measures such as directly elected mayors and devolution of powers is presented to the Houses for informed consideration by the middle of next year.  A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a number of commitments regarding what the programme terms &quot;the next wave of local government reform&quot;.  This involves a report to the Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017 on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure local government structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.  The programme also references some specific issues to be considered, including directly elected mayors.  My Department has commenced work on foot of the programme commitment, with the aim of building on the measures included in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  Decisions will be a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas, as appropriate, following consideration of the report.</p><p>Particular attention will be given by my Department in the coming months to measures to enhance leadership and accountability in local government, including directly elected mayors; action to widen and strengthen the role of local government, particularly through devolution of functions from central to local level; and measures to reinforce the effectiveness of the 2014 reforms to the local government system such as the new municipal district structures in the light of a recent operational review and consideration of issues around establishment of town councils.  The aim should be to have a broad, inclusive consultation process that allows robust proposals to be brought before the Houses for consideration within the framework of the commitments set out in the programme for Government.  In this context, the Government is open to considering all workable proposals that will contribute to the process.  Key stakeholders from the business, retail and tourism sectors should also have the opportunity to provide input, as well as the general public.  To proceed without such consultation increases the risk of legislative anomalies and unintended consequences.</p><p>While my initial reaction to the Green Party Bill was that we would have to oppose it on Second Stage for the reasons I have set out, in the light of the good spirit of co-operation on all sides of the House on the matter and also because we probably want a very similar outcome, I am happy to put forward an amendment to give a Second Reading to the Bill on 30 June 2017 to allow for its consideration in the context of implementation of the relevant commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government and consideration of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill to which we committed last night.  From my perspective, we are serious about doing this.  I am conscious that there are many challenges in my Department, including housing, water, planning and local government issues and so on.  However, this is a real tangible issue on which we can make significant progress relatively quickly.  It is really encouraging that other political parties clearly want to do the same.  By the middle of next year, if not earlier, we will have practical solutions to some of the issues raised during the debate.  I will do what I can, using the resources available in my Department to facilitate that process.  I would like to work with others to try to get it right.</p></speech>

The Minister has spoken on some of the governmental and legislative framework contained in the Bill.  I want to talk about some of the political elements.  I suspect it is a reflection of his time on the city council but Deputy Ryan referred to the "city".  Coming from Dublin City Council I would say that we have to avoid the exclusive use of the term "city" as used multiple times by Deputy Ryan.  It excludes a whole raft of the population in Dublin.  It was accidental and not deliberate but it was the language used.</p>  <p>  I did not want to speak last night about the Bill being proposed by the Green Party when I spoke about my own party's proposals, but the Bill has some political shortcomings that would make it quite difficult to sell to people on the street.  It starts in the early part of  the Bill.  The Deputy made the point last night about there being almost 150 pages in the Bill.  I have read the Bill through, twice.  I have read it from the perspective of being a good Dubliner who has an interest in this issue, as I know Deputy Ryan does and has done for a long time.  More than 100 pages of the Bill are legal framework.  At the outset the impression is that the Bill is 150 pages of ideas and solutions.  It is not.  There is a lot of legal framework, as is necessary with any Bill, but it is very short on hard, heavy functions.  During the debate last night, reference was made to mayoral strategy.  The Bill says that "The Mayor shall, after consultation with such public authorities or other persons as he or she considers appropriate, prepare a statement ... not later than 6 months after his or her election to the office of Mayor."  That would be a strategy statement.  I believe that Dubliners would expect more than that.  As a Dubliner I would like to have such a statement before I cast my vote.  I do not want to vote for someone who is telling me that if he or she gets as far as being mayor they would have a strategy statement within six months.  This is a fundamental weakness in the Bill.  The Bill also says that "The Mayor shall submit a draft of a strategy statement to the members of the Authority ... not later than 4 months after his or her having been elected Mayor."  Again, I believe that the offices, functions and executive powers of the mayor should be well in place so that people have a very good idea of what a mayor would set about doing.</p>  <p>  When we talk about the role of the deputy mayor, and I understand that these things can be amended, London discovered very quickly that it needed a night-time mayor.  There have been arguments made by Dublin traders and business and community interests that Dublin needs a political voice in charge of evening life in Dublin.  I believe that should form an essential part of any contribution to the Bill.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that membership of the proposed authority  is representative enough.  Again, this can be open to amendment, but I keep finding issues that would have to be amended.  If a previous Minister, Phil Hogan, had not expanded the four Dublin local authorities, particularly the three regional authorities, to 40 members each, then perhaps a regional assembly with two or three members from each county might have been workable.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin will know, there are five electoral local area committees in our administrative county.  Each of them would expect to be represented on a regional assembly to make it truly democratic.  The objectives of the proposed authority are quite vague in a Bill that is so substantial.  The language around the general functions of the authority talks about carrying out of reviews, the promotion of co-operation and the promotion of enterprise and innovation.  This is vague and could be far more specific.  The Bill also talks of requesting things of the local authorities.  If one talks of a mayor directing the four local authorities I suspect this may present a legal issue because currently, as Members know, the only persons who can direct a local authority are its members.  Even on the reserve functions the chief executive officer in most of the local authorities will only take directions from the members.</p>  <p>  The Minister made reference to the content of the Bill with regard to the housing authority.  I agree, but time has moved on since this Bill was drafted, when housing was not such a crisis.  Certainly, if I was a voter in Dublin and the plebiscite had passed and the Bill was passed, come election day I would like to know that there is a body over which the mayor has considerable powers, answerable to an assembly.  Here there is a plan for an agency - chaired by the mayor - to tackle housing and homelessness in Dublin, and that the mayor is responsible for ensuring the agency executes it powers and its functions.</p>  <p>  The language used in the Bill on the greater Dublin area transport council refers to such matters as the council shall monitor, shall make recommendations and shall consider the recommendations.  We, however, are concerned here with a mayor with executive powers, as with the mayors of London and other cities and towns, as Deputy Martin rightly pointed out.  When we point to the challenges facing this city such as traffic congestion, housing and homelessness then someone with a lot of courage and a lot of steel is, I hope, the kind of person the Dublin electorate deserves.  Some would argue that it may not be the individual that Dublin people will get.  The elected mayor is going to have to make executive decisions.  I am not proposing this measure, but one of the things that Ken Livingstone did as mayor was to introduce a congestion charge in London, and while a lot of planning had been done on it, he had the power to execute that decision.</p>  <p>  I was a councillor for 17 years and Deputy Eamon Ryan spoke about councillors and the responsibility for waste management being taken from them.  My memory of that period was that many councillors did not want to exercise that power with regard to difficult, political areas.  I hope a mayor will be different in his or her five year term, if we are looking at that type of term.  Dubliners want an individual who will make those difficult decisions, some of which may be very unpopular but necessary, if taken fairly.  Ken Livingstone's decision was well executed because it was well planned, it was not clumsy and it was not done overnight.  Ameliorative measures had been put in place to ensure that it worked well.</p>  <p>  With regard to the proposed Dublin regional development board for economic development, I agree that it would be great if we got to a point where the Dublin local authorities were not competing with each other for foreign direct investment - as Deputy Curran spoke about in last night's debate on this Bill - and if they specialised in different regions of the county.  Parts of county might become identified as the pharma base, the tech base or as being strong in the food area and so on.  We are way behind a lot of other cities and capital cities in that respect.</p>  <p>  I say these things as constructive criticism but I have reservations about the capacity of the Bill to deliver what is necessary.  I believe it is over prescriptive and outdated in parts.  Most of the proposals in the Bill focus on the period following the election of a mayor.  One of the purposes of the public consultation phase is to enable all stakeholders to have a say, from the chambers of commerce, IBEC, drugs task forces and immigrant communities.  Immigrants can vote in local elections and there is a big immigrant community in Dublin, yet this Bill does not speak to it at all.  That would not have been the case previously with minorities.  Those immigrants all have a vote.</p>  <p>  Since the debate last night people have been on to me saying that nothing was mentioned about the Irish language in Dublin.</p><p>These are all issues that will come back from the public consultation phase.  For me, what Deputy Eamon Ryan has proposed is a cathaoirleach of a regional assembly.  This is what I have pictured in my head, as opposed to someone who can make things happen.  I could not see particular executive powers in the Bill screaming out at me and I was looking for them.  A lot of power resides in the assembly.  While I agree a mayor has to be accountable and constrained, he or she also must have the ability to make particular decisions.</p> <p> I mentioned areas such as the arts and culture, but there is no mention of policing, smart city and climate change functions.  If the electorate is to be won over, it needs to be able to identify that the mayor will have responsibility for specifics in advance of electing him or her, not after the election.  The electorate will want to know the relationship the mayor will have with the bodies or organisations which will carry out these functions on his or her behalf.  The Bill has the ability to feed into this process, but it is full of gaps and deficits.  As the Minister pointed out, we are all part of one conversation, which I accept, with the greater and best interests of Dubliners and Dublin at heart.</p> <p> I made the point yesterday evening that we had a unique opportunity because there was a minority Government.  In different circumstances a Minister in a majority Government could push his or her ideas on a directly elected mayor and a regional assembly through Parliament like a coach and four.  The Minister will go to his or her officials who have all of the expertise at their disposal.  They also have the authority to call in the agencies to engage in consultation with all stakeholders to ensure the ideas and proposals they bring back can be proposed and amended by Members of the House in order that the eventual offering put to the people of Dublin will be one which has been agreed to by the House.</p></speech>

Yesterday we debated the Local Government (Amendment) (Directly Elected Mayor of Dublin) Bill 2016 which was proposed by my colleague, Deputy John Lahart.  I understand agreement has been reached to defer the vote on Second Stage of both Bills until June next year to allow further consideration by the Government of the proposals made and measures proposed.  I agree with this.  The citizens of Dublin will need to know the details of how a directly elected mayor would operate before voting on the principle of having such an office.</p>  <p>  I had the honour of being Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1989 to 1990.  It was a very exciting time for Dublin.  We had had the Dublin millennium celebrations in 1988 and were preparing for Dublin to become a European city of culture in 1991.  We also held the Presidency of the European Council.  There is no doubt that the functions of the Lord Mayor of Dublin are largely ceremonial, but I would not underestimate the huge amount of goodwill there is from the citizens of Dublin for the office of Lord Mayor.  The Lord Mayor of Dublin, whoever he or she is, is highly respected, despite the political cynicism of our age in communities.  This is something we should not forget and something we should harness in the interests of the Dublin region as a whole.  That said, the system of local government in Dublin city, of which I was a member for many years, is not working.  Dublin City Council is simply too big.  It has 63 members and is very fragmented politically.  It has very limited powers.  It is almost impossible to get anything done or any decision of any significance made.  Meanwhile, the problems in housing, transport and planning, in particula,r continue to get worse.  We have outlined these problems in great detail in the debate.</p>  <p>  I believe in balanced regional development in the interests of the country as a whole, but I also believe Dublin can be the engine of the national economy and that if it does better, the national economy will also do better, provided the necessary measures are taken to ensure the benefits of economic growth are spread throughout the country.  Approximately one third of the workforce is concentrated in the Dublin region, while more than 40% of Ireland's GDP is generated in Dublin.  I believe, therefore, in the principle of having a directly elected mayor, but the role and functions of such an office will have to be clearly spelled out in advance of any plebiscite taking place.  Above everything else, there should be no duplication, no waste and no excessive bureaucracy created.  We have experience of the establishment of Irish Water and the HSE which has left a sour taste for all of us.  Citizens will need to be assured the office is necessary and that scarce resources will not be squandered.  It will also have to be clearly spelled out in advance what will happen with the existing mayors and councillors throughout the region and how they would be accommodated in any new reformed structure.  The message is clear: no waste, no duplication, no unnecessary bureaucracy and, above all, no exorbitant salaries.  These are what the citizens will be watching for when they are asked to vote on the proposals.</p>  <p>  We will also have to trust citizens to elect the right person, a person with the necessary skills to do the job.  I trust them to do this.  We live in a democracy and I believe the people are very attuned to the needs of politics.  We hope, therefore, some celebrity candidate without the necessary skills will not come forward, or a household name to whom people might initially be attracted but who might not have the skills to do the job.  The people of the United States have just elected Donald Trump as President-elect.  He has never held political office and we will have to see how it works out.  The person who ultimately becomes the directly elected mayor will have to have a vision, be creative, have a strong personality and the political skills to do the job.  I trust citizens to do this.  I must do so as a democrat, but it is something of which we need to be conscious.</p>  <p>  A directly accountable Dublin mayor with executive powers could improve the quality of life of all those who live in the capital, given that many of the most pressing policy challenges in areas such as transport, housing and planning are most acute in Dublin.  A directly elected mayor with the capacity to make and allocate resources would enhance our ability to respond to these challenges.  Therefore, it is to be hoped a directly elected mayor would contribute to efforts to tackle key strategic challenges and the promotion of continued economic development in the capital.</p>  <p>  A directly elected mayor with executive powers would give a greater democratic mandate to decisions which shape the future strategic development of Dublin.  Having one mandate from the citizens of Dublin, a directly elected mayor would be in a position to drive the development of the city.  Most importantly of all, a directly elected mayor could also help to raise the profile of Dublin at an international level, given the increasingly competitive climate for foreign direct investment.  In this regard, international investors would deal with one decision-making body for the city when considering to invest rather than having to deal with a multiplicity of agencies.  A directly elected mayor equipped with additional powers would allow for clear political leadership at local government level.  This would provide clarity for citizens as to who exactly was responsible for many of the key decisions which shaped the development of the Dublin region and the functions of local government more generally.</p><p>I thank the Green Party for bringing forward its Bill and Deputy Lahart for bringing forward his.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300046#UU00200"><p>As I said last night, Sinn F&eacute;in has long supported the idea of a directly elected mayor but it does so in the context of local government reform.  A purely symbolic position of mayor is of very little value, in and of itself, to the citizens of Dublin or anywhere else.  I share the views of other speakers that we need a mayoral office with real executive powers, which give added value to the operation of political institutions.  I am also strongly of the view that those powers should be devolved downwards and that we should see no loss of powers, resources or functions in the existing structures of local government, which are too weak as it is.  Our vision for a mayor for Dublin, or anywhere else, is one where powers would be devolved down from Central Government Departments or Government-funded State agencies.  The merit of that approach is that not only do we devolve power closer to citizens and their elected representatives, we also bring staff and budgets with it and, in the initial stages, we would be able to craft a proposition which was relatively cost-neutral to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The smart thing would be to start with a limited number of powers and very clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  The value of that is that it would allow the holder of the office of mayor to demonstrate their ability to deliver improved quality services for the citizens of the city and county and to win public confidence from that point on.  The powers Sinn F&eacute;in would like for a mayor of Dublin would cover public transport, major roads, tourism and waste management.  I take the point the Minister made on this last matter but I believe this is actually one of the attractive things about incorporating waste management into the role, notwithstanding the difficulties.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also outlined proposals for an assembly not dissimilar to what is outlined today.  We like the idea of a plebiscite, or a referendum, as it would engage the public and enable them to become part of the conversation and because, if and when the office was established, it would then have clear public legitimacy to support it.</p>  <p>   I have some reflections on the so-called consultation that many of us were involved as councillors in Phil Hogan's period as Minister.  We attended a lot of cross-council meetings and we found that, in the absence of propositions over the actual functions, we really did not know what we were discussing.  In that context there is merit in Deputy Lahart's suggestion of having a public consultation and I supported this last night.</p>  <p>  We must not undersell our existing local councils as many of the things Deputies Catherine Martin and Eamon Ryan spoke of were things mayors, chairs and councillors in the existing local authorities are doing to the best of their abilities.  Part of the difficulty is that they do not have the power or resources to carry them onto the next level.  Significant co-ordination takes place in Dublin in housing and homelessness under the auspices of the Dublin region homeless executive.  While there are problems and limitations we should not undersell the value of the local authorities we have.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the Bill though I share many of the Minister's and Deputy Lahart's views on the details of the Bill.  These are things we can tease out as we proceed with the consultation, outlined by the Minister as part of the programme for Government commitments, and on Committee Stage in the future.  I was less convinced by the case for the Government amendment made yesterday by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, but, having listened to the way the Minister outlined it tonight, I feel it is a very good suggestion to put it into overall Government reform and I am more than happy to support it.</p>  <p>  On the specifics of the Green Party Bill, I feel there is too much on strategy and co-ordination and not enough about actual delivery.  The Bill is about an office which seeks to co-ordinate the activities of existing players in the field, rather than giving the office real powers to oversee the actual delivery of key services, and Sinn F&eacute;in differs from the Green Party in respect of this approach.  We also have suggestions which would change the nature of the assembly.  While Dublin city is numerically larger in terms of population, the assembly would need to be proportionate to ensure all four local authorities felt adequately represented.  In the area of transport, co-ordination is not enough and one clearly needs service delivery.  I am not sure much added value would come from the office of mayor to the area of housing as it is something local authorities can and should do very well.  There is a lot of sense in the proposals regarding regional planning guidelines and one of the merits of giving responsibility for that to the mayor of Dublin would be to reverse some of the many negative impacts of waste policy for the citizens of Dublin.  The Bill has too much around developing plans, strategy and co-ordination and, while I am not against those things, it needs to be more ambitious.  I would also like to see more defined powers.  As we progressed with that and the public gained confidence and trust in the office, those powers could then increase through a process of rolling devolution.</p>  <p>  I welcome the tone of the debate, both yesterday and today, and I think there is enough consensus that, during the Minister-led consultation and on Committee Stage, we can put together a proposition that can translate into putting the proposal into practice.  We have, however, been discussing this for a very long time and I do not mean yesterday and today, nor since Phil Hogan's consultation.  It is an issue to which we come back again and again and now is the time to show cross-party leadership to bring forward legislation, in the timeline outlined by the Minister, so that we can work with the city and council of Dublin to put in place an office of mayor that gives real added value to the citizens of the city and county and show that having a single point of contact in a number of key areas of public service delivery and co-ordination can make a difference to people's lives.  If we can do that it will be a job well done and people will thank us for it and welcome the idea of the office taking on more powers in the future.  I support the Bill and the Minister's amendment.  </p></speech>

We had a wide-ranging debate last night on the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, while tonight we are speaking on the Green Party Bill.  I addressed both last night and said there were good elements in both.  I would like to see a comprehensive proposal and the Minister's point about widespread consultation fits into that scenario.  I support the idea of a plebiscite in the Fianna F&aacute;il legislation but the Green Party has given us a good deal of content to help us consider what, specifically, the functions of the directly elected mayor should be.  It is really important that we get clarity on these functions and on the hierarchy of decision making because otherwise we will get confusion and a lot of structures but not many new initiatives or ideas and not much on what is best for Dublin overall, as opposed to its different bits.  For example, we need clarity on what the responsibility would be for transportation planning and for the infrastructure around waste.  We need a sense of the overall aims and objectives in those areas.  If there is a clear function for the mayor and the other structures under the hierarchy we will get a sense of direction.  In Ireland we have often had very little clarity about what we are trying to achieve and what we want this place to look like in ten years' time.  What size will it be?  What services will it have?  Will it be choked up by traffic?</p><p>Will it be able to deal with the waste that is produced?  Will it have an effective policy whereby people minimise the waste they produce and act to minimise the level of air pollution and the volume of traffic on the roads?  The danger in not being very clear on this is that we would end up with many structures and individuals but not with a great deal of progress.  We need clarity around this.</p> <p> We spoke about the need to ensure there is widespread discussion of this issue among the citizens of Dublin and those of the other cities.  I support what the Green Party said about there being no reason this should be only a proposal for Dublin.</p> <p> Prior to coming to the Chamber, I spoke on the radio station of a certain well known school in Dublin.  The first question I was asked was about housing while the second question was on the idea of having a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  That simple example shows that people in Dublin are talking about this issue.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, it has been talked about for a long time.  The question is, what point will we reach with this proposal?  The idea that we would deal with it again in six months' time at least indicates this will not be a debate that goes nowhere.  We hope it will not be like the issue of Seanad reform or another such issue that we seemed to talk about forever and on which there were endless reports, but where we did not get around to doing anything about it.  In that sense, we need to continue this debate.  I am not saying we should have formalised debates like this but the debate needs to be extended to include the citizens.</p> <p> During the debate on the other Bill last night, I spoke of the limited experience I have of the French model - obviously, there are other models.  We need to have much more clarity on the different responsibilities between the officers and the elected members of councils.  Often the system is such that the officials of a council will draft reports and proposals and bring them to the elected members who will then decide whether to reject or approve them.  I would like elected members to bring forward many more initiatives.  The idea of having a directly elected mayor would give such a mayor the authority to bring forward specific initiatives and put them to the other elected members and also to the people.  That would need to be refined.  It would mean there would be more of an onus on the elected members to show initiative and bring forward ideas based in their experience of the communities they represent.</p> <p> Most of what I wanted to say on this Bill I said during the debate on the other Bill last night.  We all need to think strategically around exactly how this would work.  If this measure were introduced in a fuzzy or an unclear way, it would simply result in a great deal of paperwork and discussion but not necessarily in much action, and action is what we need.</p> <p> I cite the example of housing where, from my experience, it takes an inordinate amount of time to get from the point when a decision is made to build houses in an area and the money is allocated to the point where the houses are constructed.  There are many such delays.  If we had a sense of democratic buy-in, which the proposal before us contains, we would have much more of a sense that local public representatives do not almost automatically reject proposals because they are brought forward by officials of the council.  There would be much more of a sense of having to weigh up the options and ensure that the actions are delivered in accordance with policy.</p> <p> I congratulate the Green Party on bringing forward this proposal.  Generally, there is a sense that this proposal is a good idea.  We now need to be more concrete on what  the functions would involve and on the implementation of this proposal.</p></speech>

I am not opposed to the idea of a plebiscite or a referendum if there is a demand for such but I wish the Government would listen on other matters.  This idea has been knocking around for a few years.  It was certainly widely debated when I was a councillor.  It sounds like a great idea to people to have a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  Everyone thinks we are electing a mayor, and that is fine, but there is much more involved in this.  First, there is huge potential for corruption, concentrating a wide range of powers in the hands of one person and moving decision making further away from local areas and centralising it.  I cannot believe the Green Party is putting forward the idea of what essentially would be a cabinet of ten councillors for all of Dublin.  I am not sure what the other 150 odd would be meant to be doing.  Presumably, they would be twiddling their thumbs.  </p><p>I would remind Members that Ken Livingstone, who should know something about this, spoke out about the concept of directly elected mayors.  He stated: </p><blockquote>I was always opposed to having a directly elected mayor because it concentrates all the power in one person and there is huge potential for corruption.  I mean, you look at all the big developments in London, each of those decisions where it went ahead, was mine.  I could easily have said ... to the developer 'I need 100 grand for this if you want it through'.  That's what happens, pretty much, in America.  At any one time in America there's ... at least 50 mayors in prison for corruption.</blockquote><p>The reason I started with that reference is that I have not heard anyone talk about this aspect of it but in many cities in England people have demanded referendums to get back to the idea of not having a mayor but having a cathaoirleach and a council.  Those questions have to be answered.</p><p>On the Green Party proposal of four local authorities sending ten people to surround this strong man or woman, as the case may be-----</p></speech>

I think it would be highly unlikely.  If we take a council like Fingal, which has 40 councillors, and it has to select two people to go forward to this decision making process, how will that be done?  Representatives of small parties will certainly not be selected.  I am a little surprised that this proposal is emanating from a small party.</p>  <p>  This is not the direction in which we want to go.  Dublin City Council and my colleague, Joe Higgins, a former Member of this Chamber, was a councillor on the then Dublin County Council.  It was a massive body.  We all know about the brown paper envelopes, or rather brown paper bags, in Conway's pub.  Even on rezonings and environmental decisions, the purpose of breaking that up was to break up the possibility of corruption where councillors would be more easily answerable to their own communities.  I saw on my council councillors from Howth voting for rezonings in Blanchardstown, etc.  This is not what we need.  We do not need to take powers from local areas.  We should be devolving powers more to local areas.</p>  <p>  There is a lot wrong with local government.  There has been a trend, particularly with neoliberal politics, of denuding councillors of any powers.  Essentially, there is no longer a waste service, a water service and housing is not being built.  Councillors vote every four years on the development plan and there is not much else they have to do.  A large number of powers are already given to the chief executive officers, CEOs, as they are called now.  They do not even hide the fact that it is a business oriented process.</p><p>They have a huge amount of power as it is.  This is about having one CEO for the whole of Dublin city and county instead of four, yet councillors will have even less to do.</p> <p> We have seen with major infrastructural projects unelected Government agencies being given huge powers over relevant decisions.  A good example is Poolbeg waste energy plant which was opposed by 61 of the 63 elected members on Dublin City Council who were overruled.  Councillors are largely confined now to by-laws, five-yearly development plans and trying to achieve things for people on an individual basis.  Local authority budgets have been completely gutted in the course of the eight years of austerity and when one tries to get things for the people who elected one, it is extremely difficult.  That is the case with things as basic as road ramps.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance would certainly support the restoration of decision-making powers to the 183 councillors elected at the last election.  Their numbers were actually enlarged for the election.  In practice, that means the municipalisation of waste collection, democratic local authority co-ordination of water, democratic oversight of a properly funded mass local authority house building programme and the provision of other amenities.  Without that and without huge investment in local authorities, this whole debate is meaningless.  The silence of the Bill on that is shocking and speaks volumes.</p> <p> The most dangerous idea I have heard is that we need a Boris Johnson or Michael Bloomberg style celebrity to represent Dublin on the world stage.  This is clearly gearing up to be a highly paid job for some politician from one of the bigger parties.  Do we really need to create another layer of bureaucracy?  I am very surprised it emanates from the Green Party whose members I would at least have thought stood for the concept of devolving decision-making to local communities.  I do not see how the ordinary people of Dublin will benefit.  There is widespread evidence from other countries where this strong man or woman has been brought in that it makes privatisation, anti-worker policies and a right-wing trend inevitable.  This is a concept that is pioneered by business and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce whereas in places like Stoke-on-Trent, Hartlepool and Torbay, people have voted in favour of going back to the old system.</p></speech>

One need only look at my constituency in which there are two local authorities, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, which operate like totally different countries in many infrastructural, planning and other matters.  There is a key need to have an all-Dublin approach for the good of citizens.  A lot of people in my constituency, including that part of it which is in Fingal, do not care what local authority area they live in.  They live in Dublin.  While there is a Fingal hurling team, there is a single &quot;Dubs&quot; team and a single culture.</p><p>I warmly welcome this comprehensive Bill from the Green Party and the Bill last night put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il although I think we should create the office of mayor of Dublin for 2019.  The first and second chapters of the Green Party Bill set out comprehensive provisions on the position of mayor itself and the regional authority.  I am not sure that we need a CEO along with the mayor as the mayor would surely be the chief executive.  The provisions on housing and transport set out in Part 4 are clearly critical.  As Deputy Coppinger said, we have lost control of water and drainage and waste collection, which moves I bitterly opposed.  I would restore them to local government tomorrow if I was sitting where the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is sitting.  Broadly speaking, it is about having a single elected person for Dublin rather than unelected bureaucrats.</p><p>Local government really only started in this country in any shape or form in the late 19th century.  For reasons known only to themselves, Fine Gael, supported later by Fianna F&aacute;il, introduced a county manager system from the United States when we gained our independence.  A lot of American areas did away with their mayors and brought in managers, which we took up as well.  Now, we have a situation in which unelected bureaucrats comprise the housing authority, the planning authority, the traffic authority and were previously in charge of water and drainage also.  Anyone who has served in local government, as I was very proud to do as a member of Dublin City Council for just over 12 years, including the period when I led the rainbow civic alliance with Deputy Eamon Ryan and others, knows the frustration of not being able to democratically control the council.  Yet, councils were left with these strange reserved powers in regard to rezoning.  Why was that power left with them or the power to fix commercial rates?  While it is a great honour at the moment to be elected as mayor of one's city or county for a year, some people, like the commentator Vincent Browne, have described those who are as &quot;Toytown mayors&quot;.  One is in for a year and just beginning to get to know the system and then one is out.  It is a great honour for oneself and one's community, but what can one actually achieve?</p><p>In my own experience, the dead hand of local and national civil and public servants often held back our city government.  We had many very good ideas in the rainbow and civic alliance when I led the Labour Party on the council.  We were joined by the Green Party and Fine Gael.  The important point was that the Labour Party was, at the time, the largest party in the group.  Local government has little or no role in Ireland in education, health and policing, which is all the business of local government.  Stockholm has a very similar local government system to us but the mayor, Karin Bj&ouml;rnsdotter Wanng&aring;rd, has a crucial executive role for the capital of Sweden.  One looks abroad and sees the mayors who have come into American cities and done a good job expressing the culture of the city.  Speakers have mentioned former mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg and while one might have disagreed with their political orientation, they seemed to be able to get the city bureaucracy moving for the people.  The current mayor of New York is Bill de Blasio.  They did things in regard to public transport and so on that the local authority was simply not doing.  Two of our twin cities when I was a councillor were San Jos&eacute; and Liverpool.  San Jos&eacute; has always had a mayor and Liverpool will elect one next year where the distinguished politician, Mr. Andy Burnham, is the Labour candidate.  In terms of the mayors of London, I am closest in my views to those of the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the former mayor, Ken Livingstone.  It is generally agreed that Mr. Livingstone did a good job.</p><p>While one might say there is a danger of corruption where one has a single executive power, it exists in this House as well.  If one looks at the Flood, Mahon and Moriarty tribunals, one can see that the House has not been immune from the ravages of corruption.  Currently, there are 17 directly-elected mayors across England.  I noticed in regard to this that it was the right-wing press in Britain that led vicious campaigns against regional assemblies.  Many people, including the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, wanted to have a directly-elected mayor and a regional assembly in Newcastle, but the idea was shot down mainly by campaigns by the <i>Daily Express</i>and the Murdoch press.  Across Europe, we have what are in effect city states like Hamburg and Bremen where there is local democratic control of local functions, which is the key issue we are discussing here.</p><p>Dublin needs a mayor.  There are 1.4 million people living in the four Dublin counties and we are destined to grow to 1.8 million.  I was on the greater Dublin regional authority and with our neighbouring Leinster counties, we are going to have a population equivalent to that of Wales.  Having a focal point of democratic control in that context is critical.  We know what we need in transport infrastructure and, above all, in housing.  It has been so frustrating to come in here day after day over the last five years and watch the Government do little or nothing and produce no houses in the four counties in Dublin.  I cannot believe someone who had to stand for re-election would not have done better.  That is the fundamental point.</p><p>Our Green Party colleagues have set out what the office would look like.  In this context democratic control is important.</p><p>We have to remember that Dublin may soon be the only European Union capital on these islands.  Most of our sister capitals have seriously democratic local administrations.</p> <p> I would prefer the strategy that is being adopted in the Green Party Bill, especially having a regional authority.  The section of the Bill dealing with the relationship with the four counties is critical.  Those counties have to be included.  In the past, Fingal County Council defeated the proposal when the Green Party was in government.  It should not have been in government, but it was with Fianna F&aacute;il and the proposal was defeated.</p> <p> I want to commend Deputies Lahart and Ryan and other colleagues for bringing the Bill forward.  We can construct a really democratic government for this great city and it is what we need.</p></speech>

The position of a directly elected mayor was legislated for as far back as 2001.  The people of Dublin are still waiting to be given an opportunity to vote on whether they would like to be governed by a directly elected mayor, as the 2001 legislation was repealed shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  In 2014, Fingal County Council voted to reject the holding of a plebiscite on a directly elected mayor.  This vote put a halt to the proposals to introduce a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  Many county councillors in Fingal cited the lack of detail and a rushed plan as reasons for their objections, while others were opposed to the role altogether and said the plan was antidemocratic and open to corruption.  I hope the lack of detail will not be repeated when we move on this matter.</p>  <p>  As the Bill does not outline the role and responsibilities of an elected mayor, we have to use this opportunity to review the plans to ensure that Dublin introduces the best and most appropriate model that will have the greatest potential to reap the most reward, rather than simply introducing another layer of bureaucracy and adding to an already cumbersome local government system in Dublin.</p>  <p>  The primary arguments in favour of a directly elected mayor are clear political leadership, accountability and enhanced visibility, which we do not have with city and county managers.  I was a councillor and understand that things have become worse in Tipperary.  We have to be elected and be accountable, but managers are not accountable.  Strong mayors can provide strategic direction and ensure the execution of decisions made by local authorities, while also playing a strong role in representing the authority to the outside world.</p>  <p>  Reforms in 2014 were bulldozed through by big Phil the enforcer, a former Minister.  He bulldozed Tipperary together and did not care what happened.  He left a trail of disaster after him.  Why did he not address Dublin at that time?  He addressed Limerick, Waterford and Cork.  At that time, Fine Gael had a large majority, and thought it could do what it liked and did so but the people sorted it out after that.</p>  <p>  I compliment those who proposed the Bill.  I am a democrat and the people should have the ultimate role in voting.  As I said, we could consider the British model.  I do not agree with a lot of what the British did, but it divided Tipperary which was a wise decision because it is too long and cumbersome to be handled by one authority.  The county was bulldozed together by the man I have mentioned, who has now gone to greener pastures - he is lucky he went before the election because he would be in no pasture but rather out in the long grass for a long time.</p>  <p>  I suggest that we look further afield at successful cities such as Brisbane and Auckland.  They are under the clear political control of an elected executive mayor to whom the chief executive officer and senior management report.  The mayors are responsible for developing and implementing policies, leading the business of the councils, preparing the budgets which are adopted by the councils and ensuring that the councils are active in the commercial development of their respective regions.  That is vital.</p>  <p>  We have a housing crisis with which our managers cannot seem to grapple.  Every local authority could build houses in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, but we cannot build a henhouse now.  There are reports and funding announced for houses, but no worthwhile houses are being built.  Only 30 houses were built in Tipperary, and the same applies to Kerry and other areas.  We have talks, reports, reforms and a plethora of agencies, yet nothing is happening.  We need a directly elected mayor and accountability above all.</p></speech>

I cannot see how this is such a priority or why parties are tripping over each other to be out front with this proposal and ensure that a lord mayor is elected in Dublin.  Surely there is enough bureaucracy and layers of local government, as well as Deputies, Ministers and everything else.</p>  <p>  I do not blame Dublin Deputies for trying to look after their patch, but there are Deputies in the parties putting forward the proposal from around the country.  There is no mention of bringing back the town councils that were dismantled by Phil Hogan.  It is not a priority.  I will talk about priorities. </p>  <p>  The Killarney municipal area had six crews looking after the roads, but that number has been reduced to two and no more staff can be employed.  That situation is replicated right around every municipal area in Kerry and every other council.  I ask that staff be replaced.  We need to ensure that rather than having too many chiefs and not enough Indians that we have enough Indians to look after the needs of the people who are paying rates, motor tax and every other kind of tax.  They see no value in the taxes they are currently paying.</p>  <p>  This proposal is premature until everything else is considered in light of the abolition of town councils.  A mayor in Killarney was vital and is still necessary.  Many visitors from abroad want to meet the mayor, but can now only meet a cathaoirleach - they do not know what kind of giolla deacair he is.  They think he is someone from the mountains who has nothing to do with local government.</p>  <p>  I am sorry, but I will fight for that as long as I am in office because one of the things I promised I would do is try to ensure that we reinstate town councils.  They cost very little and urban councillors did a lot of work.  They deserved better treatment than what they got and I ask that until that issue is considered to the fullest it should not be a priority to elect a lord mayor in Dublin.</p>  <p>  It would be much more beneficial to those who are trying to travel in and out of Dublin if Dublin Deputies built more lanes on the motorways so that people are not clogged behind each other day in and day out and cannot get into Dublin.  Money should be spent on that because the proposal for an elected mayor will cost a lot of money if the Bill is passed.  I ask other Members who are elected by people around the country not to vote in favour of the Bill at this time.</p></speech>

I compliment the Green Party on bringing it forward and I will support the proposal.</p>  <p>  As far back as 2001, the Local Government Act provided that the mayor or cathaoirleach of city and county councils would be directly elected in 2004, but the relevant sections of the Act were repealed by the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 before they were to be implemented in 2004 in the local elections of that year.  This proposal goes back quite some time.</p>  <p>  Our European and American neighbours have had directly elected mayors in their cities for decades.  It is a tried and trusted system, albeit in varied forms across Europe and America.  There is no point in directly elected mayors, whether in Dublin or any other city or town, unless they have real power, responsibilities and, crucially, accountability.</p><p> The proposal before us is a stand-alone one that can be dealt with on its own and there is no need to defer it until 30 June as called for in the Government amendment.</p> <p> There is an urgent need for wider local Government reform, which is referred to in the Government amendment.  I call for the re-establishment of borough and town councils throughout the country, including those in my constituency such as the old Clonmel Borough Council and the town councils of Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary, Cashel, Thurles, Nenagh and Templemore, and the creation of a town council for the town of Roscrea.  There is now widespread acceptance that local democracy has been seriously undermined by the abolition of those town and borough councils and the amalgamation of county councils such as North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, and the last Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  This has been admitted by the current leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Brendan Howlin.</p> <p> There is no doubt that the public in towns throughout the country feel undermined, disenfranchised, neglected and forgotten.  That is the overwhelming view and message being sent to Oireachtas Members, myself included, who meet members of the public in towns throughout the country.  There is an urgent necessity to re-establish the boroughs and town councils.</p> <p> The Government amendment refers to a wide consultation with all relevant stakeholders prior to the announcement of proposals.  I have heard nothing of such consultations.  If they have been commenced, when did they commence?  If not, when will they commence?  What stakeholders are involved?  What is the proposed timeline?</p> <p> As I stated at the outset, I support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300050#YY00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and, in principle, support the concept of a directly elected mayor, but I would like to see it delivered in the context of wider local government reform.  Many city regions do very well.  In fact, it is not something that would cost; it could be an engine for a whole lot of other things that would benefit the whole country.  While a directly elected mayor for Dublin is an obvious first step, if we are serious about balanced regional development we need to put mechanisms in place that give practical effect to it.  It would happen in Dublin as a first step, but would be followed in places such as Cork and Galway.</p>  <p>  In terms of the geographic location of what is proposed, the footprint is too narrow.  The functional area of Dublin is much wider than the city and county of Dublin.  It has taken time for the term "the greater Dublin area" to gain acceptance, including in the Minister of State's area.  Telling Meath people that they are part of the greater Dublin area takes a while to be accepted.</p>  <p>  I listened closely to Deputy Eamon Ryan's contribution.  He identified four key areas that the directly elected mayor would be responsible for or directly involved in.  The first was the greater Dublin transport authority.  The second was planning and housing, including land use and transportation planning.  The third was waste and he spoke about the balance of power.  After the Covanta experience I can well understand that.  The fifth was the city of culture, which I can also understand because the city is steeped in culture and there is so much to be showcased.  I agree that these ideas should be included in the mayor's remit.</p>  <p>  However, the Dublin and mid-east region have been for many years involved in collaborative land use planning.  There is or at least there should be a direct connection between land use and transportation planning.  On those two critical functions, it would be an error to limit the city region to Dublin city and council.  Instead, the functional area should include all or part of the surrounding counties.  The same can be said in relation to waste policy.</p>  <p>  The boundaries of counties, or shires, began to be carved out following the Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century.  County boundaries are unresponsive to the needs of a shifting population.  They were built on the supposition that a population and the land it works are permanently linked.  As such, ideas such as migration and population growth are incompatible.  If we consider population spread, it is clear that the greater Dublin area now spreads almost as far as the midlands.  It is difficult to see how a directly elected mayor would not be constrained by a limited geographical area in dealing with most of the key issues raised.</p>  <p>  One of the big failings in many of our public services is that most operate to their own regions, whether it is the ESB, the health service etc.  If we were to design a system from scratch, the local government regions would be co-terminus with those of other service providers.  That should be included in any reform package.  For example, Denmark replaced 13 counties with five regions and amalgamated many municipal councils as part of a municipal reform in 2007.  Denmark also changed policing districts and electoral wards as part of the process, given that they were both also based on the municipal system.  Denmark is a country to which we look in terms of good local government.  Also, there was reform in Northern Ireland some years ago and it is no longer based on the county system.</p>  <p>  We need to rethink the functions of each tier of local government.  Michael Lyons was commissioned in the UK to carry out an independent review of the UK's local government system.  He concluded that place shaping or the creative use of powers and influence to promote the general well-being of a community and its citizens should be the primary purpose of local government.  When we think of community in this country, we tend to think of it at a much lower level than county level.  Organisations such as the GAA, the credit union movement and Tidy Towns all function below county level.  As stated by others, in that context the abolition of the larger town councils, in particular, was a mistake.  Many of them were very good on what I would describe as soft services.  These services involved people and the facilitation of the creativity we see at community level.  Many of the municipal districts could be recast as district councils in time.  While I completely understand that Irish people identify with their counties for a variety of reasons - usually in September - that does not mean that the best way of organising and delivering local government and public services is at a county level.</p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done and there has been a Green Paper and a White Paper on local government.  Mr. John Gormley was very much the driver behind this when he was the Minister with responsibility for the environment.  A mountain of work has been done on the issue and we should re-examine it rather than reinventing the wheel.  We appeared to be tied into an Anglo-Norman fixation that everything has to happen at county level.  This is not how people function.  These are imaginary lines for many people and, if we are to have something that can work in symmetry and deliver what we want it to deliver, we must redraw them along the lines within which people actually function.</p>  <p>  A directly elected mayor for the greater Dublin region is a good idea, but let us get it right if we put it in place.</p></speech>

I also note that Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy John Lahart, in particular, have made proposals and given us the opportunity to discuss this proposed important reform of the way we govern the city of Dublin and local government in general.</p>  <p>  In 2011, the Fine Gael manifesto contained a commitment that we would support the concept of a directly elected mayor of Dublin, provided that we got it right and ensured that it produced added value and improvements for the city and not just additional cost and bureaucracy.</p><p>It is a great regret that the previous Government, of which I was a member, did not hold a plebiscite on the issue or allow people in Dublin to have a say on directly electing a mayor for the city.  The reason for this was that my local authority, Fingal County Council, vetoed the proposal for a plebiscite.  The Government mistakenly allowed it to do so by framing the legislation in a certain way.  It is a shame a plebiscite was not held at that time.  I hope one will be held in this D&aacute;il in order that people in Dublin will have their say on how they want their city and county to be governed.<br/><br/>I support the concept of a directly elected mayor.  It would be useful to have a figure representing Dublin and advocating for the city internationally and domestically as well as in dealings with central Government and national politicians.  I believe Henry Kissinger once famously asked who he should ring if he wanted to call Europe.  This question, which could still be asked today in respect of Europe, can also be asked of Dublin.  In other words, who does one call if one wants to speak to Dublin?  Is it an interest group such as the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the mayor of the city or one of the other Dublin local authorities or one of the senior officials in one of the four local authorities?  The answer is that one cannot call anybody because no one speaks for the city as we do not have the important office of a directly elected mayor.<br/><br/>A directly elected mayor is an effective means of moving power from officials to elected politicians.  This should occur across local government where too much power rests with the executive rather than with those who have been elected to office.  The relationship between Ministers and Secretaries General is good one.  The latter are permanent officials with particular responsibilities who act as Accounting Officers, whereas the Minister is an elected representative.  A similar relationship could work well in local government between a mayor, who is <i>in situ </i>for two and a half or five years, and a chief executive.  This is the type of reform I would like to take place, not only in Dublin but across local government.  A directly elected mayor would herald a genuine shift in power from central to local government because the person elected would have real authority and a real electoral mandate in his or her dealings with the Government.  This would be a powerful statement and change for the better.  <br/><br/>The current position is that mayors are elected by their peers and hold office for only one year.  Anyone who has held office knows it takes a couple of months to find one's find and get things started.  When the office only lasts for one year it is difficult to get anything of substance done.  One year is much too short and the Buggins' turn system of mayors that operates nationwide is not effective.  <br/><br/>It is important to get the model right.  I do not support the model proposed by a previous Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, which would essentially have created another regional authority with a mayor on top of the existing four administrative counties in Dublin.  The model I prefer is more akin to that which applies in major cities such as London and Paris, where one has a single local authority with an elected mayor and another level of neighbourhood councils below this, for example, the borough councils in London and the <i>arrondissements</i>in Paris.  While I appreciate that Dublin is a small city and it could be argued that such a model would create too much local government in a city of only 1 million or 1.5 million people, the population of Dublin will increase to 2 million in the next couple of decades. <br/><br/>I welcome the opportunity presented to the House by the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il to discuss this important matter.  I hope and expect the Government will advance this issue in the coming years. </p></speech>

I reiterate the Government position of engaging with all interested parties in advancing this important issue.  I thank the Green Party and Deputy Lahart of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for proposing Private Members' Bills on this issue last night and tonight.</p>  <p>  The Government is proposing an appropriate amendment which will give a Second Stage reading also to the Green Party Bill on 30 June 2017.  This will allow time for proper consideration to be given to the complex underlying issues associated with establishing a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  First and foremost, it will be necessary to decide on the appropriate range of functions that could be assigned to a directly elected mayor for Dublin and from where these functions will come.  This necessitates advance consultation with the bodies from which these functions may be transferred, as well as relevant sectoral interest groups and the general public.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a directly elected mayor and regional authority would have major implications for the future of local and regional government arrangements across the greater Dublin area and these must be properly assessed.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy stated, the greater Dublin area encompasses counties Meath and Kildare and other areas.  With the capital expanding, it is difficult for some people living in other counties to accept that they are part of the greater Dublin region because this has consequences as well as benefits.</p>  <p> It will be necessary to clearly define the relationship between the directly elected mayor and the four existing local authorities in Dublin.  Any proposal for a directly elected mayor and regional authority must also have full regard to cost implications and staffing issues and the associated impact on the budgets and staffing levels of the existing local authorities.</p>  <p>  I accept the sincerity with which the Green Party, in particular, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have tabled the Bill and the Government is open to considering any workable proposals.  The programme for a partnership Government includes a commitment to consider directly elected mayors as part of wider potential local government reform measures, including greater devolution and municipal governance.  The programme states that, having consulted widely with all relevant stakeholders, a report for government and the Oireachtas will be prepared by mid-2017 on such measures.  Work on preparing this report is already under way, with the aim of building on the progress made under the previous reform programme.  Decisions will be a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas, as is appropriate, following consideration of the report.</p>  <p>  All of us share a collective responsibility to ensure that the establishment of a directly elected mayor and regional authority will best facilitate the social and economic development of Dublin and that this will, in turn, benefit the country as a whole.  The Government will approach this issue on the basis of benefits that have been identified and whether these benefits outweigh the costs that will be involved. </p>  <p>  The Government side recognises that there could potentially be benefits to be derived from the establishment of a directly elected mayor and this warrants further serious consideration in the months ahead.  We look forward to continuing to work in cooperation with all sides who have participated in recent debates to advance this important issue.  The amendment we are putting forward is consistent with the commitments in the programme for Government and will provide the appropriate context for advancing to consideration of legislation on this matter.</p></speech>

I am glad we introduced the Bill and welcome the Government's decision to postpone its Second Reading until 30 June 2017 as it gives time for consideration of the issue.</p>  <p>  I wish to reflect on a couple of issues in response to previous contributions and outline some ideas on how we might progress this issue.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is in the Seanad discussing another Green Party Bill with Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  The Ministers present should convey the message to him that the Government should allow all parties to participate in the discursive process proposed between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  Apart from Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Ruth Coppinger, who hold a different view, the case for a directly elected mayor for Dublin enjoys the support of all parties.</p>  <p>  The next stage in the process must be a public consultation process in the second half of 2017.  Internal consultation among Deputies and Senators would also be very useful because there is no one as experienced as Oireachtas Members when it comes to the operation of our democratic and political structures.  Most of us have been councillors and know how the system works.  Our role is to lead on this matter, rather than leaving the matter to officials who usually develop legislation.  We are better placed to tease out the choices and they should be a political call.  There is a tension between the political system and the Permanent Government in terms of the design of political systems.  We have a certain role to play and I welcome the Minister's stated willingness to undertake such a process. </p>  <p>  I propose to address a couple of broad criticisms.  The benefit of introducing the Bill is that it will allow us to get down to the detail and offer real choices as part of a proper debate.  A couple of choices emerged from this discussion.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and Deputy Catherine Murphy, a Member representing those in Kildare outside of Dublin city, asked what the geographic confines of Dublin are.  The Minister said this Bill did not take into account the changes made in 2014 by Phil Hogan's reforms.  I do not like the structures the then Minister, Phil Hogan, put in place.  They were fundamentally flawed and were introduced at a time when there was such an anti-political sentiment that one was doing well if one cut back political offices and structures.  As a result, we ended up with three regional assemblies which are inappropriate.  It is not that we do not need an eastern assembly.  We do.  Dublin, however, needs a separate regional authority.  This would have to work with the surrounding counties.  Section 40 provides that, in the development of regional plans, the directly elected mayor of Dublin would have to consult with the cathaoirleach of the mid-east regional authority to ensure it does not contradict the national spatial plan.  Our Bill accounts for the need for co-ordination between the surrounding counties in Dublin.  I believe the four Dublin areas require separate councils.</p> <p> I fully accept that it is all of Dublin.  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire but grew up in the city.  I have never considered myself anything other than a Dubliner, no matter where I lived.  Is the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, a "Fingalian" or a Dub?  No one in Fingal is a "Fingalian"; we are all Dubliners.  I am not a "D&uacute;n Laoghairian"; there is not even a word "D&uacute;n Laoghairian".  We are all Dubliners.  There is a certain co-ordinated sense of Dublin as a city.  It is different from Kildare or Meath.  No offence to those two counties.  If one said to Kildare people that they were Dubliners, they would be equally shocked.  They would go white, even lily-white.</p></speech>

I do not think we have years to do it.  We need to sort this issue out before this Parliament closes.  We have months, not years to get this right.</p>  <p>  Several Deputies asked if we would have a strong assembly or authority representing the city with a mayor on top of that and then local district councils below it.  Deputy John Lahart said our representation of 15 members in an authority should be larger and more representative.  Deputy Ruth Coppinger also agreed but said it should have 40 members.  Once one goes over 15 members, one is into an assembly, a single city assembly which is a real democratic council for the whole city.  That is the choice we have to make.  Our Bill has made the right choice in keeping the four existing local authorities.  They are embedded and have worked to different degrees.  If we rank them, I think D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council would come last.  Maybe that is because I am living there.  The others, Fingal, Dublin City Council and South Dublin have worked well.</p></speech>

I found the local area committees really worked when I was a councillor.  That was an innovation introduced in 1997.

We should be strengthening that local tier at the same time as we create the city mayor.</p>  <p>  We welcome the fact the Government will allow this Bill through Second Stage.  I would prefer if the Opposition got together on the various Bills in this area.  We could easily have managed to develop the legislation over the next six months.

We do not have to go through the Government.</p>  <p>  In this supposedly new politics arena, we should encourage a mechanism whereby the Opposition can genuinely present serious legislation, which is what we are doing here, and have the chance of getting it passed.  If the public administration or the larger political parties do not like small parties putting forward serious legislation, then we do not have new politics.  Instead, we have the same old politics, particularly in this case, with the two large parties working together but not with the rest of the Opposition to put a Bill through.</p></speech>

I want to respond to some of the responses the Minister gave to me this afternoon on the issue of bogus self-employment.  His answers on the number of people categorised as self-employed in the construction industry were disingenuous and bordering on misleading the D&aacute;il.  I have been trying to establish the precise facts on how many are in the RCT system.  The Minister effectively misled the D&aacute;il on the related question on the amount of revenue coming back in under the self-employment tax heading of RTC.</p><p>Let me correct the record on the assertions the Minister made, starting with the numbers and letters.  I checked the letters the Minister sent me and I have also checked others that were sent to him from Ms Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I cross-checked the information with answers the Department has given to Deputies who have asked similar questions.</p><p>  On 19 July 2016, in response to parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Ruth Coppinger, Nos. 168 and 169, on the numbers registered on the RCT, e-RCT and C45 tax systems working in construction from 2002 to 2015, the Minister indicated in a table that there were 74,795 under the heading &quot;RTC registrations/active contractors (principals &amp;amp; sub-contractors)&quot;.  In the Minister's response to me earlier, he suggested he had been accurate in giving an answer that suggested there were 35,000.  He said the higher figure, of 74,795, or nearly 75,000, relates to people whom those subcontractors had employed.  That is misleading.  The question asked by Deputy Coppinger, which the Minister answered, was very simple and straightforward.  The answer he gave for 2015 was 74,795.</p><p>To further confuse the pitch, Deputy Michael McGrath's office, which has been also asking questions, was informed at one point that the number was in excess of 90,000.  I am not quite sure where that figure came from but I take it in good faith that Deputy McGrath's office got it from the Minister in some shape or form.  Therefore, there is a serious mystery here.  In the letter to which the Minister referred, from July 2016, he referred to the 35,000 as subcontractors.  However, in the answer to Deputy Coppinger, given a few weeks later, he said there were 74,000 principal contractors and subcontractors.  The point is that there are 74,000, not 34,000, working in the RTC system.  They are not principal contractors.  In so far as they could be defined as such, the term &quot;principal contractor&quot; loses all meaning.  In reality, we are talking about relatively small subcontractors who, in turn, have ten, 15 or 20 tradesmen, bricklayers or others working for them, all of whom are in the RTC system and defined as self-employed for revenue purposes.  They number 74,000 and whether they call themselves &quot;subcontractors&quot; or &quot;principal contractors&quot; is totally irrelevant.  The point is that 74,000 are classified as self-employed out of a total construction workforce of 130,000.  More than half of the construction workforce comprises supposedly self-employed entrepreneurs.  That is nonsense and it is misleading for the Minister to suggest I somehow did not understand the figures or misquoted them.  It is the Minister who is misleading us as to the reality of this.  We keep getting different answers and definitions in letters.</p><p>Ms Patricia King also suggested the Minister is misrepresenting the figures on the issue.  Following my engagement with him in the D&aacute;il on this issue, which prompted him to ask the Revenue Commissioners to write to me, on 29 July 2016, Patricia King wrote to the Minister and said, among other things, that he misrepresented the position of Congress.  She said it was misleading of the Minister to convey any impression that Congress is in any way satisfied with the performance of revenue relating to the bogus self-employment system in this sector.  It was stated the Minister is misleading the House, not us.  We cannot get to the bottom of this and we keep getting different figures and definitions and so on.  Essentially, this is to cover up what I and, more important, people working in the industry believe to be a massive scandal.</p><p>Next is the issue of the revenue.  The Minister quoted figures today suggesting &euro;132 million came in under the RTC heading in 2013, that the figure for 2014 was &euro;172 million and that the figure for 2015 was &euro;174 million.  He did not acknowledge these are the gross figures, not the net figures.  Even the gross figures do not tally with figures the Minister's Department has given to other Deputies in this House on that issue.  In response to a parliamentary question asked by Deputies Tommy Broughan and Ruth Coppinger, if I remember correctly, the Department stated the gross figure for 2013 was &euro;157 million.  The Minister said today it was &euro;132 million although he told Members in response to a parliamentary question that it was &euro;157 million.  There is a huge discrepancy in that regard, amounting to approximately &euro;30 million, a significant amount.  It is taxpayers' money so we need to know the truth.  Which figure is correct?  Is it &euro;132 million or &euro;157 million.  The difference, approximately &euro;30 million, is a lot of money.</p><p>  The Minister also misleads us regarding the net figure.  The net figure, after repayments, deductions, etc., is only &euro;12.3 million.  This is a very far cry from &euro;132 million or &euro;157 million, whichever it happens to be.  Similarly, the Minister said the figure for 2014 was &euro;172 million.  Figures I have garnered from other data I got from the Minister suggest the gross figure was &euro;201 million, not the &euro;172 million he mentioned today, and that the net figure is &euro;31 million, which is much less.  Different figures come from the Minister on different days.  It seems to depend on the day.</p><p>The Minister mentioned a figure &euro;174 million for 2015, but what was the net figure?  That is the one that counts.  How much does the Exchequer end up with after repayments?  It is much less every other year than the unreliable figures the Minister mentioned.</p> <p> A further piece of evidence is worth mentioning.  I do not understand it fully, but it seems to be related to the major problems encountered in this regard.  Recently I asked the Minister's Department "what exactly the Revenue Commissioners mean when they refer to the estimated value of contract and to the degree this should be accurate as to the actual amount earned by the person to whom that contract refers."  Today the Minister and Deputy Peter Burke called RCT a good system that gave information on the locations and values of contracts.  However, my contacts in the industry tell me that these contract confirmations, as they are called, are not worth the paper on which they are written and that the value of the contract given by the contractor never tallies with the actual amount paid.  It is virtually a fictional figure.  There is a significant discrepancy between the value of the contract and the actual payments made.  This seems to have been borne out by the Minister's answer to me, in that there were 319,114 contracts in the construction sector in 2014 with a value of &euro;28.7 billion, yet the 804,165 payments made only amounted to &euro;10.1 billion.  This seems to confirm what my source told me.  He has and is willing to provide for the Department contracts the value of each of which is a multiple of what has actually been paid to the supposedly self-employed person whose name is attached to the contract.  He cited as an example a contract confirmation in which the value was listed as &euro;25,000 but the worker named only earned &euro;4,800.  That is a major discrepancy at a micro level.  The contract confirmation provided by the principal contractor for Revenue bears no relationship to the reality on the ground in terms of what the contractor is paying.  This forms part of an elaborate tax fraud by such contractors to avoid paying people properly.  Revenue, the Minister and his Department do not seem to want to chase down this problem.</p> <p> This is a significant scandal and tax fraud that we are failing to take seriously.  We cannot even get accurate figures.  In and of itself, the fact that there is a discrepancy from month to month in the figures we get from the Minister justifies the holding of a serious investigation.  We need to get to the bottom of this matter for the sake of the tax revenue being lost to the public and the State and in the light of the abuse and exploitation of tens of thousands of construction workers who are being forced into being misclassified as self-employed when they are really employees of these dodgy subcontractors or, in many instances, large contractors.</p> <p> That is my case.  We may have to argue about it, but we must at the very least get to the bottom of this issue, have it investigated and have the investigation reported on to the D&aacute;il within a minimum of six months, as set down in the amendment.</p></speech>

This issue concerns accumulated tax losses that have built up in the tax system as a consequence of the crash, particularly in respect of banking and financial organisations and the construction industry.  During the work of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I raised this issue with the Revenue Commissioners.  They came up with figures relating to accumulated tax losses.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and the Minister said tax losses were a feature of all tax systems.  According to the reply I received from the Revenue Commissioners, the losses being carried forward in respect of construction for 2014 are &euro;10.4 billion.  I am not sure if the accumulated figures for 2015 are available yet.  If they are available now, they are only just available.  I would welcome it if the Revenue Commissioners made the 2015 figures available.  In respect of finance and insurance activities, the losses carried forward and remaining at the end of 2014 are &euro;119.3 billion.  As one would expect, the losses in the banking and financial sector are significantly greater than those in construction because of the size of the crash.  In further information I received from the Revenue Commissioners, they indicated that the losses used forward that included the current year for financial services were &euro;9.480 billion, &euro;412 million for construction and &euro;15,330 million for all sectors.  Tax forgone in financial services was &euro;1,185 million, tax forgone in construction was &euro;52 million and tax forgone in all sectors was &euro;1,916 million.  In the second list of tables provided by the Revenue Commissioners, tax forgone on further losses built up of &euro;11.7 million, &euro;95 million and &euro;0.9 million.  The figures involved are very significant.</p>  <p>  We are allowing a build up in our system consequent on the crash - we understand the reasons for it - of very large levels of losses.  We have all had a significant amount of discussion of the need to get building and construction, particularly in respect of houses, going again.  Many banks and financial institutions are returning to profitability.  We need investment, particularly in the housing sector with which the construction and banking sectors are hugely concerned.  It seems very odd that instead of having a structure in respect of people at the upper end of income earning involving minimum effective tax rates, we are allowing all the losses carried forward to be utilised against all of the profits generated.  That means that in respect of these sectors, there will be very little in terms of tax take into corporate and other relevant taxes as a consequence of the extraordinary losses carried forward.  It would be fair to say that because of the level of financial and banking sector losses carried forward - the &euro;119.3 billion - they may not pay tax for a very long time.  This seems wrong because in respect of very high income individuals during the tenure of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government, I persuaded at different stages both Brian Cowen and Brian Lenihan of the merit of limiting the use of losses.  They can still be carried forward but carried forward over a much longer period of time and tax is paid at a minimum effective rate.</p><p>This also reflects some of the debate on our corporation taxes.</p> <p> The Minister correctly said that all tax systems have losses built up.  People are most familiar with businesses starting up where we allow them a relatively soft three years to get on their feet and if in those years they make losses, obviously those losses are carried forward.  However, the banking collapse and the construction collapse was not a case of ordinary losses; these were gigantic losses.  In many cases the companies remaining are probably more valuable from a tax-loss point of view than from the likelihood of ever recommencing trading again, but those losses can be utilised.</p> <p> The taxpayers and people at work took the burden following the crash.  As a result we changed the tax system in order that everyone - people at work, people in different lines of business, people making capital gains - contributed more, yet we have this outlier of an enormous volume of losses.  If we do not act to curtail the time over which the losses can be taken and potentially use the availability of those losses to change the behaviour of the companies, to encourage them in particular to build social and affordable housing, we will be choosing to continue to give them an extraordinary level of support at a time when they are returning to profitability and should be making a contribution in corporation and other taxes to the Exchequer.  That is basically the argument.</p> <p> I have no dispute with the Minister over the concept of losses.  Did the losses happen?  Of course, they did.  We all know that; we all paid for them.  However, should they now be utilised to effectively wipe out for the foreseeable future the payment and contribution to tax in terms of corporation and other related taxes of the sectors I have mentioned in particular?</p> <p> The present value of gaining corporation taxes from those sectors in the context of our need to invest in affordable homes and social housing is such that it is wrong for the Minister to say to the banks and construction companies, "You have these enormous losses, just go and use them."  Whenever they make profits, they just use the past losses to write off all taxable profits and can hold on for many decades without ever making a contribution to the Exchequer in corporation tax and other taxes for which they may fall liable.</p> <p> The purpose of my amendment is to address that issue, to review what has been happening in this area and to submit a report to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

We dealt with it on Committee Stage and I do not intend to go over it again because I assume we will be here till the very early hours of the morning at this rate.</p>  <p>  Given that on the current figures we will have less than &euro;600 million available for budget 2018, we will face many challenges.  As the Minister mentioned to me previously, one of the ways of increasing fiscal space is by raising taxation.  The measure in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, which was taken out of the Taxes Consolidation Act - I think in the Finance Act 2013 - was a prudent measure at its time and I believe it is still prudent today.  While I disagreed at the time, it may have been right for the Government to remove it at the time because the Minister has made the argument that without removing it, the State would have to provide further capital to some of the financial institutions and I do not think anybody in this House - definitely not anyone from Sinn F&eacute;in - would stand over such a scenario.</p>  <p>  The late Brian Lenihan put into the original legislation a provision allowing banks to offset only 50% of their trading income with losses being carried forward because he wanted to ensure that as soon as there would be a taxable profit, the State could start getting tax back from these banks when they were profitable.  In fairness to the late Minister, that showed vision and foresight at a time when we were talking about massive losses, but he was able to see down the road that it would not always be that way.  NAMA was going to buy the stressed debt from the banks.  There was going to be a time when he envisaged - we all envisaged - the banks being profitable again.  He therefore wanted to ensure that what is practice for every company operating in Ireland to carry forward losses indefinitely would not apply to the financial institutions and the losses could apply to only 50% of their traded income.  I want the Government to look at that issue now.</p>  <p>  If the report finds that if we did that it would mean certain financial institutions would fall below the capital ratios and they would have to either raise money in additional capital themselves or it would require the State to intervene, then at least we would have that information.  However, there is no suggestion that is the case at this point in time.  I appeal to the Minister to consider reintroducing this measure.  Many of these banks are profitable but they are not paying the appropriate taxes as a result of being able to carry forward losses.  This will continue for many years.</p>  <p>  The argument has been made that we will get the money anyway.  There is truth to that and nobody is denying it.  However, it is a case of timing.  If we get the money in 20 years' time as opposed to a bit now, a bit next year and a bit the year after, of course it is important to us because in the here and now we have existing pressures.  We are all aware of the existing pressures in public pay.  The Dublin Homeless Executive today referred to the scale of homelessness, which has increased by fivefold in the past two years.  The numbers in this city are staggering and it is not  confined just to this city unfortunately.  We also have pressures in terms of services, capital infrastructure and so forth.</p>  <p>  Doing this will not limit the value of the banks or limit the value of the shareholding because they are due to pay this anyway; it is a timing issue at a certain point in time.  I appeal to the Government to consider the approach I have proposed, which is to go back to where we were in 2009 and reinsert the section 396C in the Taxes Consolidation Act to limit to 50% the amount of trading income a participating institution and all other participating institutions in the same group could have losses carried forward offset in any accounting period. That is a prudent approach.</p>  <p>  I hope the Department of Finance issues a report and if that report finds that provision would have knock-on effects of which I am not aware, I am big enough to say that might not be right thing to do.  However, this is one of the options we should consider for next year's Finance Bill.</p></speech>

The scale of it is truly staggering and points again and again to the need to impose, as a minimum, the 12.5% tax rate on gross profits and which we have urged the Minister for Finance to do for the past five years.  I note that Deputy Joan Burton and the Labour Party have recently converted to this view.</p></speech>

They did not implement an effective rate of 12.5% but now they are apparently the ones who invented the proposal.  I am glad that they have had a bit of a conversion on that issue because it is an absolute scandal.  From figures just pulled from the Revenue website today, the full figure for losses brought forward in 2014 is extraordinary.  It is over &euro;215 billion.  It is incredible.  This is a big part of it, but not the only part.  There is a whole series of other loopholes which allowed in 2014 - it really is extraordinary - gross trade profits, declared at &euro;95 billion plus other income and capital gains of &euro;8 billion, giving a total of &euro;103 billion.  After all these deductions are brought in for losses brought forward and other deductions, &euro;103 billion in gross profits becomes only &euro;50 billion in taxable profits, which is more than halved.  It is absolutely extraordinary.  Consequently, because of the failure to impose a minimum effective rate, the loss is in the order of &euro;4 billion per year.  A minimum effective rate has been proposed in our budget submissions for the past five years.</p></speech>

I just cannot resist it really.  When people tell porkies like that it is just too difficult to not respond.  It is extraordinary that &euro;103 billion in gross profits results in total tax paid of &euro;4.9 billion.  That is not 12.5%.  The figure of &euro;4.9 billion tax on &euro;103 billion is 4.75% on gross profits and other earnings.  That is the real effective corporate tax rate and a very significant component of this is the losses brought forward by the banks that the people bailed out.  This allows them to avoid paying tax for years to come.  It is shocking and it is money that is desperately and urgently needed.  I hear the Government state it does not have money for this, that and the other and only has a &euro;600 million fiscal space.  I just feel like screaming as I look at the allowances and deductions given to the corporate vampires.  These are the banks that brought the State to its knees and which we bailed out.  We are now giving massive tax breaks to them.  It is shocking.  The problem with a lot of this stuff is that some of it is so technical I am not sure of the extent to which the public understands the scale.  I certainly intend to make it my mission, as we have tried in the past five years, to explain the rip off to people.  It is one of many rip offs and we will discuss more of them as we debate further this evening.</p>  <p>  Through massive bailouts and huge austerity measures we have nursed these banks back to health and profitability and now they are paying virtually no tax and the Government is probably going to sell them off.  It has already sold off most of Bank of Ireland and at some point, it intends to sell off the rest of the banks.  When the banks finally start to make money, the State will get nothing or very little back from them.  It is one of many tax scandals in this State but the very least we could do is what is being asked for in this motion.</p></speech>

The Minister's counter argument on Committee Stage was that it was a difficult thing to do.  The Minister was concerned about changing normal business practice and he argued that his normal way of doing it was to bring in the levy.  The Minister felt it was a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  Regardless of whether the losses should be brought forward or how many it is reasonable to bring forward, it is definitely an issue the public would have a view on.  It is complicated and technical, as evidenced by the debate on Committee Stage.  As Deputy Joan Burton pointed out, because the public bailed these banks out, simply saying this is normal business practice and these are normal trading businesses, therefore, they should enjoy this but that we have applied a levy to at least address it a little is not sufficient for the public.  I believe that a report, which is accessible to people who might not have the time to spend on the issue, or who do not have accounting and finance backgrounds, would be a reasonable one for the public to get.  Being specific to the amendment, and without prejudice to what is the right answer - there are different views in the House as to what the right answer is - a well written report could lay out the options, including the Minister for Finance's rationale, to explain that bringing the losses forward means the banks do not pay X amount of millions in a given year, how the banking levy goes 20%, 75% or 100% of the way there and showing the two or three options.  The bank bailouts have been such a defining part of what has happened over the past number of years, and because every man, woman and child in the State is directly affected, I believe that the amendment is reasonable on the basis that the public has a right to know.  This debate probably, and properly, belongs as a wider House debate, which would be greatly facilitated by the report.  I ask the Minister for Finance to consider, without prejudice to what the answer might be, that it is reasonable for him, as a member of the Executive, to provide to the House and the public, a report that lays out the options, his rationale and the other positions that have been tabled in the House.  For that reason, I urge the Minister for Finance to accept the amendment tonight and to allow the report to be compiled.  It is a real issue and while there are politics at play, the amounts of money are big enough and the substantive issue is big enough that it merits expert, neutral investigation in a report back to the House.</p></speech>

Donnelly said.  This is an important public policy issue and it is true to say it is a long-established practice within the corporation tax code that losses can be carried forward and offset against future profits.  That is well established in the tax code, about which there is no question.</p><p>To say the least, the NAMA transfers constituted an exceptional event, in that enormous losses crystalised on the financial statements of the participating financial institutions.  The late former Minister, Brian Lenihan, put in a restriction on the capacity of the banks to carry forward those losses and offset them against future profits.</p> <p> What would be the implications of restricting the limitless carry forward, which is the position at present?  For example, by how much would this carry forward have to be restricted for it to trigger actual corporation tax liabilities from the banks in the short term?  What would be the consequences of this for the broader Exchequer, in terms of tax receipts, the implications for the banks and the value of shares?  We all table amendments seeking reports, and the central purpose generally is to get a debate on an issue, and get a report in many instances.  The Minister should share with the House the Department of Finance's assessment of the issue because there are a number of important factors that need to be taken into account and they were discussed during the Committee Stage debate.  It is about weighing up the issues.  I would like to see an assessment done.  It does not have to be provided for by way of the Finance Bill, but the Department of Finance should carry out an assessment of all those issues and all the consequences, and it should be shared with the House and publicly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300059#HHH00200"><p>I thank colleagues for their contributions.  As many colleagues have said, loss relief is a standard feature of corporation tax regimes worldwide.  Under the Irish corporate tax regime, losses incurred in the course of a business are allowed to be taken into account in calculating the appropriate tax due by companies.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over a longer period than just a single year, and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not allow loss relief in the next.</p>  <p>  Under existing loss relief provisions in the Tax Acts, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for offset against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods.  Alternatively, a company may claim to have the loss set off against profits of any description for the same accounting period in which the loss was incurred or of an immediately preceding accounting period of the same length.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and of all other OECD countries.</p>  <p>  In regard to the more specific matter of bank losses, under the NAMA Act 2009, a new section, section 396C, was inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 396C was a provision which limited the amount of trading losses incurred by a NAMA participating bank that could be set off against future trading profits.  The set-off was limited to 50% of the profit of the year.  It did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the provision to allow the carry-forward of tax losses for set-off against future trading profits is available not only for banks but for all Irish corporates.  Accordingly, the removal of section 396C put the covered banks in the same position as other corporates, including other banks operating in Ireland.  It was, in effect, a levelling of the playing field.   Section 396C was as a form of claw-back for the taxpayer.  It was put in place at a time, however, when State involvement in the sector was far more limited and, critically, before equity stakes were acquired in AIB and Bank of Ireland. </p>  <p>  In the lead up to the introduction of the new capital rules on 1 January 2014 under the EU Capital Requirements Directive, CRD, IV, and at a time when the State owned 99.8% of AIB and 14% of Bank of Ireland, section 396C no longer served its original purpose and, indeed, worked against the taxpayer.  Accordingly, in the Finance Act 2014, I deemed it appropriate to remove the provision.  To reintroduce a restriction on the banks' use of their losses would impact the capital requirements of the banks and the overall valuation of the banks.</p>  <p>  In regard to the capital requirements, under the new capital rules of CRD IV, which were introduced in January 2014, deferred tax assets must now be deducted for the purposes of calculating a bank's regulatory capital ratios.  Given the significant deferred tax assets at the Irish banks, the sooner these assets are fully utilised the better, as this would improve the quality of capital at the bank by eliminating the deferred tax deduction.  This holds not only for ongoing reporting to the regulator and updates to the market, but also as part of any stress tests conducted by the regulatory authorities.</p>  <p>  In regard to the valuation aspect, given the size of the deferred tax assets in the Irish banks, market analysts and investors, in valuing one of these banks, would typically allocate a discrete valuation to a deferred tax asset.  Notwithstanding the removal of section 396C of the NAMA Act and the fact the three Irish banks have now returned to profitability, it is expected that deferred tax assets at the banks will take a considerable number of years to be utilised.  If the section 396C restriction was still in place, the period of utilisation would be extended over a considerably longer timeframe, increasing the risk that a bank's auditors would put pressure on the bank to write down the deferred tax asset thereby generating an accounting loss.  Even absent such a write down, investors using valuation models would be likely to increase the discount rate applied due to the increased risk to the deferred tax asset being fully utilised.  This would significantly reduce the discounted cashflow of the deferred tax asset, likely to be in the hundreds of millions of euros, with a euro for euro impact on the valuation of the banks.  However, to recognise the part the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013 the Government also decided the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  The payment of this levy is now being extended until 2021.  It is expected to raise &euro;750 million in the next five years.</p>  <p>  Although significant trading losses forward are reported on the corporation tax returns submitted by covered banks, the timing of when these losses will be utilised will be determined by future profitability.  To restrict the use of the losses would have a significant negative impact on the capital requirements of the banks and on their valuations.  Therefore, I do not accept the proposed amendments.</p></speech>

I do not intend to go in to all detail.  This is complex, but it is not black or white.  It is not an either-or and there can be an in between.  I do not suggest we get rid of all carry forward of the losses, although that would be desirable because the State would be in a better position if we did not have to recapitalise them because it would mean the profits would be taxable sooner for ourselves.  There is a need for a report.  The Minister stated as soon as these deferred taxes are used at that stage it will put the banks in a more healthy position.  At this point in time it does not make a difference.  The question a report should answer is if the measure Brian Lenihan introduced in the NAMA Act 2009 were to be introduced what would be the consequences.  Perhaps 50% is not the appropriate measure.  Perhaps it is 25% or 75%.  A report should weigh up all the impacts in terms of the value of the banks.  Perhaps auditors would possibly ask them to write down deferred tax assets at a later stage.  To tell the truth, if this were done ten years out from now it would be a win win for the people.  It would be good for us in ten years time because it is unlikely, given the state of political or policy intention of the Government, that we will have shares in those banks at that point in time.  I do not want to press this to a vote.  Our time is quite precious as we have a lot to get through and it must be concluded tonight.</p><p>We are just asking for it to be set down on paper.  If we do not get it, we will continue to have these debates.  The Minister has tonight given us more information than we received when we raised the matter previously.  Are we going to go through this cycle continually or is there any substance to the idea of new politics?  I do not have the resources or the expertise on which the Minister can call in the shape of the Department of Finance and even if I did have such expertise, it would not be independent.  We are asking for the information that is available to be put together and presented in a report to be furnished to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in order that it could look at these issues in the context of the next Finance Bill.  It would deal with an issue for which we have limited resources to deal with.</p> <p> Reports with a completion date should never be part of a Finance Bill, but the only way we can avoid pushing this issue is by the Government giving us a commitment that such a report will be commissioned.</p></speech>

It contains a lot of information that has not been put into the public domain before.  I am aware of the fact that, in response to discussions on this issue, the Minister introduced a levy.  The intentions of Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett are good, but I can explain something to him.  We could not possibly have brought this forward at a time when the banks and the construction industry were incurring mega losses in the process of collapsing and possibly about to disappear down the Swanee.  It is only possible to do so as the banks return to profitability.  I introduced this argument in 2006 when, on foot of requests for reports from the Revenue Commissioners to be laid before the D&aacute;il, I asked how many people in the tax system with an annual income in excess of &euro;1 million paid no income tax.  The answer which is in the report to be found in the Oireachtas Library was that there were quite a lot of such individuals.  It gave rise to the introduction of a minimum effective tax rate, based on models in the United States.  I do not suggest this concept is perfect, but it is a device to get people to bring forward, on a current cash basis, payments of tax which, if they were allowed to accumulate, would lead to no tax being paid and no cash flow for the State.</p></speech>

She was in government but did not implement such a measure.  I am glad that she is now echoing the point.  This mechanism, whereby profitable enterprises such as banks which account for a huge proportion of these activities write down their taxable income, points to the need for us to impose a minimum effective rate of 12.5%.  I agree with her amendment and with that of Deputy Pearse Doherty.  I also agree with Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly's point that the very least the Minister could do is accept it in order that we could get the facts and the public would have something to enable them to understand what was going on.  There are huge amounts of money involved and the public deserves to know and make informed decisions on what they want to do with the rate of corporation tax.</p></speech>

I know that there is not a consensus in the House on the issue and that some parties and individuals disagree with it.  Many ordinary people, however, especially older people, rely on the interest income they earn from their savings and investments.</p><p>The link which has been in place for many years between the rate of tax on savings and the exit tax that applies to other investment products such as life insurance products has been broken.  The 2% reduction in DIRT tax will not be applied to the exit tax applied to all such investment products.  There has been a significant increase in the yield to the Exchequer from the exit tax on these products in recent years.  In 2012 the yield was &euro;43 million, but in 2015 it had risen to &euro;247 million; therefore, the breaking of the link has been significant in a number of ways.  If the Minister intends to continue to reduce DIRT tax to 33% in the next four years and the exit tax remains at 41%, there will be a significant difference between the various products.  The exit tax applies to a lot of longer term products and many people formed the view, after seeking independent financial advice, that they needed to take a degree of risk to obtain a higher return.</p><p>That is what they do and they will now be paying a much higher rate of tax.  They are also paying a 1% tax on the amount put into the fund or product.  The purpose in tabling the amendment was to establish if it was a question of arithmetic, if it simply would cost too much to apply the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, reduction to the exit tax applied to other products, or is it a new policy and is the Minister breaking the link for a particular reason?  I know that there is real money involved.  The full year cost of the DIRT reduction is &euro;14 million and I established on Committee Stage that the cost of extending the reduction to the exit tax would be a further &euro;11 million.  I would like to know if it was a question of arithmetic, or is it a new policy and a new policy direction that the Government intends to take in separating the exit tax rate from the DIRT tax?</p></speech>

It is not a policy decision; it is one that stems from a lack of resources to extend it fully.  What the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, committed to on Committee Stage was referring the issue to the tax strategy group in mid-summer to get its advice on how we should remove an emerging anomaly and what would be the best way to approach it.  If the Deputy agrees, we will proceed on that basis.</p></speech>

What the Minister is indicating is that there has not been a policy decision for DIRT tax to fall to 33%, while the exit tax would remains at 41%.  The first point I want to establish is that this is not Government policy as that would be a retrograde step.  Many people rely on the products which are subject to the exit tax.  There is also the additional 1% tax to be paid.  Having spoken to many financial advisers and brokers about the issue, they make the point that many people, especially older people, rely on life assurance policies.  Having a higher rate of tax for no particular reason is not the way to go.  The measure will be implemented, but I would like it to be reviewed.  I welcome the commitment the Minister has given and also the acknowledgment that this will not be a permanent feature, given the differential emerging between the exit tax and DIRT tax rates.</p></speech>

Since that date, a number of amendments have been made; however, the original policy intent of ensuring the tax base is appropriately protected in relation to Irish property transactions remains the same.  </p><p>Amendment No. 35 is a technical amendment.  It clarifies that a specified mortgage will not include a loan or a specified agreement which is part of a CLO transaction, a CMBS or RMBS transaction, a loan origination business or a sub-participation transaction.  The origination of such loans was already excluded from the definition of loan origination; however, there was some uncertainty in the drafting which is clarified by the amendment which excludes these transactions from the definition of specified mortgage.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 provide that sub-participation structures will not be affected by the amendment to section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 brought forward by section 21 of the Bill.  A sub-participation arrangement, sometimes called syndication, synthetic loan origination or synthetic securitisation, is required where, for example, a bank&rsquo;s customer wants to borrow more than that bank can lend, usually for capital adequacy reasons.  The bank will advance the money and then on-sell slices of the risk associated with the loan to other lenders.  The customer continues to deal with its normal bank which is still the lender of record.  The ability to ringfence the slices of debt, through the use of a section 110 company, reduces the cost of such structures without causing any tax leakage to the Exchequer.  Such transactions are an essential part of a fully functioning domestic financial services market.  I, therefore, commend the amendments to the House.</p></speech>

I reiterate that there is recognition of what has been achieved.  Huge progress has been made and I thank the Minister and his officials for the time spent on this issue.  The original draft proposal was leaky, but it seemed to have been tightened considerably and was tightened again between Committee and Report Stages.  I acknowledge what is very good and important work.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stood in for the Minister on Committee Stage.  He spoke about the quantum of money involved.  The figure of &euro;50 million is widely accepted to be a placeholder in the budget document, but the Minister of State provided some useful information on how Revenue had reached the figure of &euro;50 million.  It took a sample of loans, estimated what would be received in tax on them if the loopholes for vulture funds were closed and scaled upwards to a base of &euro;20 billion of loans.  I want to go through it quickly to get the Minister's thoughts on it.  If &euro;50 million was to be the amount received in tax receipts on loans of &euro;20 billion - we know from the companies involved that they are making a figure of approximately 9% or 10% a year - it would give annual profits of &euro;2 billion.  If we were to get &euro;50 million in tax on that &euro;2 billion, the tax rate would be 2.5 %.</p>  <p>  The section 110 tax rate is 25%.  I believe the Minister of State said it was the intention of the amendment to section 110 that all trading profits and all capital gains would be fully taxed at the rate of 25%.  If we move from a tax rate of 2.5% to 25%, we should move from the figure of &euro;50 million to &euro;500 million.  At &euro;40 billion, the data suggest the asset base is twice the figure of &euro;20 billion used by the Revenue Commissioners.  On the &euro;50 million placeholder, if we really do tax the vulture funds, as I believe the Minister has said we will and as I believe we should, the figure of &euro;50 million would actually grow to &euro;1 billion a year.  Inevitably, there would be some leakage, but on a &euro;40 billion asset base and given that we know that they are making a figure of about 9% a year, that gives them trading profits of about &euro;3.6 billion a year.  If we were to tax that &euro;3.6 billion at the section 110 rate of 25% which I believe is the objective, it would bring in about &euro;900 million a year in tax.  On top of this, there would be taxes on capital gains which would also be levied at the section 110 rate of 25%.  Therefore, if we were to do this properly, we should be looking at taxes to the State in the next ten years of &euro;10 billion to &euro;20 billion.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Minister has very little time in which to reply to everybody, but the first question I have for him is whether that calculation seems reasonable.  If the figure of &euro;50 million represents a tax rate of about 2.5%, does he agree that we should be looking to tax full trading profits and capital gains at the section 110 tax rate of 25%, in which case the figure would not be &euro;50 million but &euro;500 million a year?</p><p>I raised the following on Committee Stage and it refers specifically to one of the Minister's amendments.  The tax experts were suggesting that this ability of vulture funds to securitise their loans was a way out.  The amendment to section 110 states it will no longer be possible to use PPNs to offshore profits any longer.  However, exempt from that is securitised loans.  Therefore, the tax advisers are saying this is fine and a way out and that the funds can securitise their loans which takes about two weeks.  It is asserted that they will no longer be constrained and can continue to offshore profits.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stated that the vulture funds would not be able to securitise their loans and that they were explicitly prohibited from doing it.  He said the only group that could securitise the loans and thereby continue to offshore profits were loan originators.  Will the Minister confirm to the House that it is his understanding that vulture funds will not be able to securitise their loans and thereby get around clampdown here?</p> <p> I have covered some of the following in the numbers I have just gone through, but is the following the Minister's intention for all these vulture funds?  They are making a lot of money, as is absolutely their right, from trading income and, as is absolutely their right, from capital gains.  Will the full amount of those profits now be taxed at the 25% under section 110?  That is the second question I have for the Minister.</p> <p> My third question is around the idea of internal loans.  Obviously, how the vulture funds have been operating to date has been to set up a loan from a fund they own in the Cayman Islands which has a variable interest rate.  The interest rate rises and, therefore, all the profits get paid out to the Cayman Islands.  We spoke at some length on Committee Stage about the rate at which the vulture funds will continue to be allowed to pay interest.  The amendment states they will only be allowed to do so at a reasonable commercial return.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I went through this in some detail and I am personally very worried about it.  I believe they will be able to get portfolios of evidence to bring to Revenue which show that a reasonable commercial return in this situation is 18%.  If they achieve that, it will continue.  The rate that is being used at the moment that pretty much offshores all the profits is 18% to 20%.  There is a great deal of evidence around that could be compiled by the large bona fide accounting firms to show that a mezzanine rate of 18% or 19% is still reasonable.</p> <p> I have a concern about that issue.  The Minister of State assured the select committee that Revenue would not tolerate that sort of rate and, at this point, we have to take it on faith.  However, I ask the Minister if he is absolutely confident that, regardless of what the rate is, there will be no ability to do these internal loans any more.  Obviously, they can structure a fund in the Cayman Islands, lend the money into a Luxembourg company which lends it on to another Luxembourg company and eventually it is lent into the vulture funds here.  Therefore, while it might look like a vulture fund is getting a loan from a completely independent fund in Luxembourg, if one follows the international breadcrumbs, it turns out that the same parent company owns them both.  They are very good at this because the IRS in the USA has very serious rules around internal loans.  Therefore, my third question is whether the Minister is absolutely confident that the amendment is sufficiently robust that they are not going to be able to use international structures to hide the fact that they are still lending money to each other.</p> <p> I appreciate that the Minister is not going to be able to answer all this in two minutes, but my final question is around allowing domestic assets into the section 110 companies at all.  The Minister's stated policy position is that assets which generate economic returns in Ireland should be taxed in Ireland.  The amendment, therefore, represents a game of chess.  It states that if a company tries to do X, we will stop it here; that there is anti-avoidance there, that a company cannot do Y anymore, that there must be reasonable commercial returns and that they cannot securitise and get it that way.  It goes on and on and it is a game of chess.  If it were simply stated that domestic assets were not allowed in a section 110 company, the game of chess would be over.  It is check mate.  If a vulture fund had loans on Irish homes or businesses or unsecured debt like credit cards or car loans, as long as they resided in the State, it could not bring them into a section 110 company.  The game of chess is then not required.</p> <p> Inevitably, if a game of chess is played by very sophisticated corporates and the State, the State will win some days and the corporates will win the others.  Rather than construct very complicated rules and anti-avoidance mechanisms, why not just state that domestic assets cannot be used in section 110 companies?  We have looked at various tax jurisdictions around the world and have not been able to find any country which is not a tax haven that allows a box to operate in its economy which is a tax-free box that allows domestic assets in there.  I understand fully why they are there for global securitisation.  The profits are not derived here so we do not tax those profits.  Having spent a great deal of time on this over the last few months, I still do not understand why we do not say that loans on mortgages, hotels and credit cards that are in Ireland are just not allowed in.  It would shut the whole thing down and force the vulture funds to operate, and be taxed, like normal companies.  I finish with that and reiterate that very significant work and progress has been made here, which is very welcome.</p></speech>

I would like a simple answer from the Minister as to why that should not be the case.  It is very technical and one's head would be fried, frankly, with this stuff, which, I suppose, is half the point.  These flipping tax lawyers are so far ahead of us, the Government and Revenue in finding and exploiting these loopholes that one would have to spend one's whole life chasing them round the new corners and loopholes they create.  I was just reading something from Matheson, which is one of the crowd of tax advisers.  It relates to the Irish aviation sector.  I presume the clampdown the Minister is talking about to somewhat address the abuse we saw in section 110 is limited to the area of property.  Aviation is an area to which it should be extended or, if not, one has to ask why we have section 110 at all.  What is going on with this tax break?  Matheson states on aircraft leasing and section 110:</p><blockquote>It is critical to ensure that aircraft finance can be raised in a tax efficient way [I love these euphemisms].  In structured finance and securitisation transactions, an Irish section 110 company is commonly used to raise that debt financing to acquire assets on a tax neutral basis.</blockquote><p>In effect, one acquires a load of assets and does not pay any tax.  This is the advice.  Matheson states an Irish section 110 company is a standard Irish special purpose company that satisfies the conditions of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act.</p><p>An Irish section 110 company is generally entitled to claim a tax deduction on all of its financing expenses, including, subject to some conditions, its profit linked financing expenses.  Therefore, it is generally possible to ensure an Irish section 110 company can acquire assets using debt financing on a tax neutral basis by ensuring it pays all of its return on those assets as tax deductible interest payments to lenders and investors.  In other words, Matheson is explaining how one can get away with paying no tax in the case of people who want to avoid paying tax and make a lot of money in the area of aircraft leasing.  It is telling companies to come into the sector because under section 110 in the area of aircraft leasing one can make a fortune and pay no tax.  It is a major sector; I understand Ireland has the largest aircraft leasing sector for commercial airlines in the world.  There is tax abuse.  To be honest, I do not fully understand it, but I fully understand Matheson is telling investors that section 110 can be used to make enormous profits for people who want to invest in the area and avoid paying tax.  To me, that begs the question as to why section 110 is in place.  It is not just about withholding tax on property.</p> <p> I do not know if I can return to an issue I raised on Committee Stage.  I refer to companies rolling up profits and using the money to acquire more assets.  If that is done for a long enough period - I understand for five or seven years - they will not pay any tax on the capital gains.  This stinks to high heaven, but perhaps the Minister might enlighten me as to why we should allow this to happen.  I ask him to explain why instead of putting a little sticking plaster on a particular area, we do not close this tax loophole.</p></speech>

Some 38,000 people are employed in the financial services industry in Ireland.  It is a sector that is expanding and we think it will expand rapidly in the short to medium term because of the relocation of activity from the City of London as a consequence of Brexit.  Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  This is regarded as an essential component of a modern financial services industry.  It was introduced to match what was happening in other jurisdictions such as Luxembourg and other financial services locations such as the City of London in order that we could build a financial services industry in Ireland and provide good employment for a cohort of people with suitable business qualifications.</p>  <p>  The securitisation mentioned which allows banks to raise capital and share risk by providing a re-packaging and resale market for corporate debt lowers the cost of debt financing.  That is how it works in practice within the financial services industry.  As I said, Ireland is not unique in having a special securitisation tax regime.  Other EU countries such as the United Kingdom and Luxembourg also have special securitisation tax regimes which allow for tax neutral structures.  It is accepted that having the option to have more diversified sources of financing is good for investment and business.  It is also important for financial stability in the economy.  It was introduced to provide the kind of levers of policy that other financial services industries in other jurisdictions across Europe had in order that we could build up that sector of the economy which was very weak in the early 1990s.</p>  <p>  When it was originally introduced, section 110 was intended solely for use in the way I have described, namely, for the securitisation of financial services.  It was never intended that it would cross over into facilitating a reduction in tax due on property transactions.  We are trying to exclude the unintended uses of section 110, while maintaining it as a very important lever of policy for the financial services industry.  It is within that space that the difficulties arise because we want to take out what we consider to be an unintended consequence used for tax avoidance purposes, while maintaining the section to pursue its original intention.</p>  <p>  Revenue disagree with the calculations of Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly.  I have a note that I can read or give to him.  Revenue argues that he is basing his figures on a sum of &euro;40 billion, but that figure is grossly over-inflated.  By the end of 2015 NAMA had overseen loan sales with a nominal value of just &euro;20 billion.  It is also stated the Deputy is assuming a higher interest rate than would be customary and that it is highly unlikely that companies are earning greater than a 10% yield.  In its calculations Revenue would have allowed for standard trading deductions, including an interest deduction based on a reasonable commercial return.  The Deputy does not seem to be allowing for the normal deductions.  Revenue has given a list of possible deductions it would allow.  I have no expertise in this matter; I am simply passing on information provided by Revenue.  I hope the Deputy is right as I could do with an extra &euro;900 million next year as the demands are opening up.</p>  <p>  We can give Deputies notes on all of the answers, but given the time restrictions, I cannot give them to them across the floor of the House.  I understand Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly received reasonably good answers from the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  He can engage privately with the officials.</p></speech>

The fact that companies have made significant amounts of money means that they had smart business people.  To be honest, I do not think people have got their heads around exactly how much profit is being made.  It is off the scale.  Companies are turning investments of &euro;80 million into profits of &euro;400 million, for example.  What is being done is extraordinary and I am concerned about taxing it.  Revenue has stated the figure of &euro;40 billion is grossly overstated.</p></speech>

The yield I used was taken from the filed accounts of vulture funds and was net of normal interest deductions, business costs, operating costs and everything else.  The only thing not included is the placing offshore of profits via PPNs.  Revenue is grossly understating the scale of the money involved.  If it is admitting that NAMA on its own had a figure of &euro;20 billion, that is great, but it was not the only seller to vulture funds.  They bought from many other people.</p>  <p>  Accounting firms have listed all of this information.  When taken as a whole, the figure reaches &euro;40 billion.  The net yield figure of 9% is from the vulture funds.  The Minister did not respond explicitly, but I take it that his intent is that the 25% profit tax rate will be applied.</p><p>In that case and if there is no further leakage, we may not see a figure &euro;900 million, but we should be seeing a figure of many hundreds of millions next year.</p></speech>

The work of Revenue and Department of Finance officials in the past 12 months on this issue must be acknowledged.  There has been a lot of analysis.  The amendments primarily seek to ensure there will be no unintended contamination of what is a legitimate aspect of the financial services industry, specifically, securitisation.  There is a need to shore up that aspect to ensure there will be no unintended contamination.  Section 22 is even more complex and perhaps more controversial.</p>  <p>  Overall, I welcome what is contained in section 21 and the amendments tabled by the Minister.  There will always be a game of cat and mouse between the most intelligent and well remunerated tax practitioners advising funds and the bright people in Revenue and the Department of Finance.  The Minister has made a commitment to close gaps that may emerge and loopholes that may be identified.  It could be along the lines of the way in which section 110 and profit participating notes were used to effectively sweep all of the profits out of the section 110 companies.  That is not the way section 110 was intended to be used when it was first introduced for use in the financial services industry.  Section 22 is even more substantive.

His main argument seems to be that there are 38,000 jobs in the IFSC and that, therefore, we should not worry about people such as those in Matheson telling investors to get into the area of aircraft leasing and use section 110 to ensure they will pay no tax.  To me, that is a big problem, but the Minister justifies it on the basis of some jobs being created.</p>  <p>  To help us to judge these matters properly, we need to know exactly how many people were employed, for example, in aircraft leasing companies in each of the years since this provision was introduced, how much profit was generated in the area in each of those years and how much tax was forgone as a result of the use of section 110.  Then we will be able to judge whether it is a beneficial tax break in the sector or the others to which section 110 applies or just another way for the super rich to make a lot of money and use the IFSC and the tax code as a tax haven.  We need that information to make judgments on these matters.  I would like to see that information.  I know that the Minister does not have the answers in front of him, but I would like to see the facts in order that we can break this down, understand it and see if there really is any benefit or whether it is just another big tax scam.  However, to me, it stinks to high heaven.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily need the answer right now, but, on a technical issue, I would like to know what specific anti-avoidance mechanisms have been developed to provide for constant reviews and address the possibilities raised legitimately by Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly.  Obviously, we will not know until we are further into the financial year or years.</p>  <p>  Charities have been used as part of the vehicle for the schemes being addressed.  Is the Minister reasonably confident that the reputational damage done to charities in Ireland by their association, in almost all cases unwittingly, with these schemes has been addressed?  Are we satisfied that they can no longer be utilised in the fashion they had been utilised?  This issue has been discussed for a couple of years.  Charities are important to the social and economic fabric, as well as to other elements of Irish life.  It is wrong that they were utilised for a purpose which was far from the purpose of a charity in the ordinary meaning of the word.  </p>  <p>  At the end of the day, of course, there are very rich people - billionaires and multi-billionaires - who are investing in these vehicles, but there are also many ordinary people around the world, in Ireland and elsewhere, whose pensions are invested in some of these vehicles.  If we want someone who has worked for 40 years to have a pension, having a properly functioning financial sector is appropriate.  Most people cannot provide individually for a pension.  They have to do so collectively using a savings vehicle.  It is important to acknowledge that this is the kind of vehicle on which the social systems in so many countries are built.  Workers put money aside from their current earnings to have it invested.  Often it is a long-term capital investment.  It is a good social model, provided that it is not abused through the exploitation of loopholes.</p>  <p>  I do not need the answer right now, but I would like to know what anti-avoidance mechanisms are in place and if the Minister is satisfied that charities are now out of the game and that they can continue to operate in Ireland for proper charitable purposes.  The other thing is that, with this type of investment vehicle, much of the decision-making on investing is made by algorithms.  I do not know how well up Revenue and other countries are on algorithms, but Facebook uses them in a lot of political coverage and we have had a big debate about made news.  The same is true of investment models in terms of the way IT structures are being developed and we should be aware of this.  It means that Revenue needs resources to keep ahead of the game.</p></speech>

In certain financial transactions it is common practice for the shares in a special purpose vehicle, SPV, to be owned by a charitable trust.  In Ireland the only type of purpose trust is a charitable trust.  This ensures, first, that the SPV is not consolidated into the accounts of the originator, thereby ensuring the originator is in a position to make further loans and, second, that the originator can achieve bankruptcy remoteness in respect of the assets transferred to the SPV.  The use of a purpose trust for these purposes is a common occurrence internationally in certain financial transactions and a charitable trust is the only purpose trust under Irish trust law.</p>  <p>  As a general rule, Irish bankruptcy remote vehicles are established as orphan companies.  A typical structure for an orphan company consists of an Irish private limited company, the SPV, the entire issued share capital of which is held on trust for charitable purposes.  The shareholders can be individuals or nominee shareholder companies, all of whom hold their shareholding under declaration of trust executed in favour of the Irish charities.  It is important to note that the charity is a shareholder in the company and does not hold assets or liabilities.  All assets and liabilities are held by the special purpose vehicle.  The business is carried on by the company, not the charity. </p>  <p>  The charitable status does not confer any tax benefit on the SPV, that is, the section 110 company.  The use of a charitable trust is a technique used internationally to achieve the aforementioned objectives.  Any residual profit left in the SPV is then paid by way of dividend to the charitable trust.  The charities regulator is reviewing this issue.  I can give the Deputy a copy of the speaking note. </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's statement because I never claimed that the charitable status of section 110 companies was in any way used to reduce their tax liability.  As the record will show, I made it clear that the reasons for seeking this status were to ensure these companies were not part of the accounting process of their parent companies and to deal with the issue of bankruptcy.  At the time, I wrote to the charities regulator providing information on the conflict of interest in respect of the legal firms that have set up the charities and section 110 companies.  In my view, this is the aspect of the matter that is being investigated and, in fairness, it has been highlighted by the Department and Revenue or questioned by individuals within both entities.  It is important to make that point.</p>  <p>  An issue arises from the fact that the only vehicle that can be used for this purpose is a charitable vehicle.  Members of the public find it extremely distasteful that vulture funds are using charitable vehicles.  While it should be made clear that these companies do not obtain tax relief and do not enjoy tax benefits as a result of this status, in the Irish psyche the term "charitable" is associated with helping someone else, whereas many people take the view that vulture funds do the opposite.  While this approach is part of an international trend, the position elsewhere is not identical to the position here.  It may be necessary to examine whether a vehicle other than charities is available that could satisfy this type of purpose and activity.  It is wrong that Matheson has set up a charity that is being used by vulture funds.</p>  <p>  The Minister has clarified that these companies are not benefiting from a tax perspective and that it is the structure of the section 110 company, originally provided for in the 1997 Act, which allowed them to pay as little tax as they have been paying in recent years .</p></speech>

As the Minister stated, the rationale for charitable trust ownership is to obtain protection from bankruptcy.  While I cannot remember all of the details, it did not feel right when I looked into this issue.  I agree with the Minister that this practice is used internationally.  However, the vulture funds in Ireland have set up their ownership in charitable trusts for two reasons, namely, to shield themselves from bankruptcy because Irish charities cannot be bankrupted and to shield themselves from the Inland Revenue Service, IRS, in the United States.  This brings us to the nub of the amendment.  It is my understanding that the IRS could tell the vulture funds that, on the basis that they are US companies operating but not paying any tax in Ireland and taking profits out of this country, they must pay corporation tax of 35% in the United States.  For this reason, they choose to check a box that indicates that what is happening in Ireland has nothing to do with them.  They can say that the loan comes from the Cayman Islands or perhaps a Luxembourg company and that ownership is held by a charity in Ireland, which makes it a fully Irish-owned operation.  As the entity is being lent money from some other fund somewhere in the world, the US vulture fund has nothing to do with it and does not really own it.  One of the reasons for keeping it in charitable ownership is that this status protects the entity from US tax laws.  While I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty that the purpose of charitable ownership is not to avoid Irish tax, I am told that it is to avoid US tax and is part of a tax avoidance mechanism.</p><p>As it happens, this issue arose on the national broadcaster earlier when there was a discussion on the Matheson Foundation.  The latter is wholly owned by Matheson, one of the law companies of choice for many of the vulture funds and one which has helped these funds set up the structures I have described.  Matheson set up a charitable trust that owns many of the vulture funds.  What the Minister described was a legal and financial practice that is common around the world, whereby funds are owned by trusts that are not linked in any way to charity.  However, in this case, Matheson set up a real children's charity.  The last time I checked, the website of the charity in question featured a photograph of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, giving awards to high-performing children at Dublin City University.  Also in the photograph is the chief executive of the children's charity, who is also one of the partners in Matheson.</p><p>I take the MInister's point that, under Irish law, we do not have trusts other than charitable trusts that can be used for the purposes we are discussing.  However, one would not expect charitable trusts established for these purposes to be operated as children's charities.  If, under law, the trust must be a charitable trust, one would expect the vulture funds to park their trust, as it were, in a place where everyone would recognise it.  However, in this case, that is not what Matheson has done.  Instead, it has set up a children's charity.  I have not looked into whether there are other such cases.Several months ago, I referred in the Chamber to the children's charity established by Matheson.  The front page of the charity's website lists a series of groups that it funds, including the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  I referred to this issue some months ago on Leaders' Questions.  In an interview on radio today, a spokesperson for Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, stated that the hospital had never heard of the Matheson Foundation, does not receive money from it and has no idea why the foundation listed the hospital on its website as one of its charitable causes.</p><p>It would be bad enough if vulture funds were using legal boxes to create entities that happened to be called charitable trusts for the purposes of tax avoidance and to protect themselves from bankruptcy.  It is worse than that because, in this case at least, a real children's charity has been created and ownership of the vulture funds has been vested in it.  This charity is owned by the same legal firm that creates some of the tax avoidance.  It is worse again that the children's charity that owns God only knows how many vulture funds in this country - God only knows how many funds are evicting children from their homes - is stating that Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, is one of its charitable causes, yet a spokesperson for the hospital stated on radio today that it is not one of the charity's causes and had never heard of these guys.  That takes the biscuit and must be looked at.</p><p>It is not just a technical issue of other countries having trusts while in Ireland we only have charitable trusts, meaning blind trusts are used.  This has gone way beyond that.  I have met with the charities regulator and, like Deputy Pearse Doherty, brought it to his attention.  The regulator is looking at it.  The level of what is going on, however, is so distasteful that a look from the Department of Finance and others, as well as the children's charity, would be welcome.</p> <p> The amendment specifically aims to break any potential ownership between the vulture fund in Ireland and the loan it is getting.  As we know, internal loans are used to offshore the profits.  My concern is that, if we do not explicitly state that there can be no connection between the loans one is getting at this reasonable commercial return and the vulture fund, they will find ways of creating what looked like independent loans but are in fact internal loans as they are all owned by the same parent company.  Then they walk in with the big portfolio that says 12%, 15% or 18% is perfectly reasonable.</p> <p> The reason I tabled this amendment is because I believe it is an extra safeguard.  As I said earlier this evening, they are not allowed used the profit participation notes anymore.  However, it is for this reasonable commercial rate to be argued very hard.  For example, they say 25% while Revenue says 10% and they end up with 12%.  At least half of the profits will still be offshored.  This is a safeguard that says there can be no link.  Therefore, it makes it much harder for a vulture fund to say we have this fund sitting in Portugal, Tokyo or the Cayman Islands.  If it genuinely has nothing to do with it and it would be considered tax evasion if any link could be found, then it would be a further sensible safeguard to stop gaming of the reasonable commercial return.</p></speech>

We all know what is the ordinary concept of charity.  We are not asking the Minister to have an exact answer now.  Words have meaning.  This is a vehicle.  It must be remembered in the United States that one has the common practice of wealthy people turning over vast amounts of their funds to their charity.  In many cases, they do vast work.  In other cases, the American tax revenue services would be deeply unhappy with them because they are avoidance and mitigation vehicles used against paying tax.</p>  <p>  We are part of the OECD process.  As a Minister, I supported that strongly.  In a globalised world, one has to have structures which are responsive and able to deal with the globalised situation.  That is why I have worked with the OECD, as has the Minister for Finance.  It may be appropriate to bring in somebody like Pascal Saint-Amans from the OECD to have a look at this from a globalised point of view.</p>  <p>  It is important for our society that we maintain the integrity of charitable status.  We have had a situation in recent years where there have been various scandals in different charities around how resources were used.  We would lose something valuable as a society if we were to let go of the idea of a charity being what is the ordinary Irish meaning of charity.  We all know there can be rogue developments or people who do not live up to the standards of integrity required.  The majority of charities in Ireland, however, do a vast amount of good.</p>  <p>  People pay large fees to the partners in large law and accounting firms who provide this kind of avoidance and mitigation advice.  They probably command between &euro;600 and &euro;2,500 an hour.  It is big business.  We have to find a way of separating the two.</p>  <p>  Those who do charity work for Temple Street Children's Hospital and Crumlin Children's Hospital.  They are out in the rain and so forth doing fund-raising activities.  Both are hospitals with which many of us have been associated all our lives, whether as patients or parents.  It is a good example that it should not be possible to use it for another purpose so that the status of the charities is brought down, trivialised or reputationally damaged in society.</p></speech>

There is an investigation by the charities regulator.  However, there is also a need for a Government commitment to this issue, not from a taxation point of view but from a broader sense of justice point of view.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly described how these are real charities which give some money to funds, although they claim they are giving to others but are not.  The moneys are quite small in the context of the amount of money flowing through the vulture funds.  In June 2008, the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government decided to exempt these charities from the provisions of the Charities Bill.  That was wrong.  It is decisions like this that we need to examine again.</p>  <p>  The regulations which apply to other charities do not apply to the charities in question.  They are still charities and have to provide money, regardless of how much it is, to charitable causes.  This is done for facilitating a structure for section 110 companies.  There is a need for a Government response along with that of the charities regulator which, hopefully, will be joined up.</p>  <p>  When the decision was taken to exempt them back in June 2008, there was not as much focus on section 110.  Obviously, they were not involved in buying distressed assets at that time either.  However, remaining outside certain provisions of the Charities Bill is questionable.  There were arguments for it at the time.  Did one want the charities regulator clogged up by all these charities, which really are not charities as we understand them but have been set up to facilitate a financial structure in terms of securitisation?  We need to re-examine that area.  While it might be beyond the Minister's competence, given the roles they have as section 110 companies, there is a need for the Government to look at this in the round and in light of whatever the charities regulator will find in his examination of the issue.</p></speech>

Profits are calculated after taking account of deductions incurred wholly and exclusively in the course of the business from which the profits arise.</p><p>The Irish tax code does not generally disallow a transaction between connected persons where that transaction is carried out on the same terms as a transaction with an unconnected person, simply because it is with a connected person.  A marked example of where the tax code does distinguish such transactions is section 817C, a specific anti-avoidance provision whose avoidance can trigger the 30% tax avoidance surcharge I introduced in the Finance Act 2014.</p> <p> Interest paid to a connected person is deductible only in calculating the profits of the trade where, on receipt, that interest would be part of the taxable profits of the trade of the connected person.  The issue of interest deductibility is currently under review internationally, for example, with the recent EU anti-tax avoidance directive.  The anti-tax avoidance directive was agreed by member states following ECOFIN on 17 June 2016.  The directive contains five significant corporate tax anti-avoidance measures, one of which relates to interest deductibility.</p> <p> Broadly, the interest limitation rule proposes that the tax deductions for interest which a company can claim are limited to 30% of a company&rsquo;s earnings, subject to certain exceptions.  The interest limitation rules must be implemented by member states by 1 January 2019.  However, the provisions may be deferred until 2024 for countries that already have strong targeted interest rules.  Therefore, I cannot commend the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment to the House.</p> <p> On the issues raised by Deputies Doherty and Burton, I agree with Deputy Doherty that we should see what the report of the charities regulator contains and determine how we move forward from there.  I do not believe the report will be to the Department of Finance in the first instance, but we will see where it goes.</p></speech>

My understanding of what the Minister said was that the new rule that a maximum of 30% of earnings could be deducted as interest payments will probably be introduced here in 2024.  Ireland is probably one of those countries deemed to have the laws in place.  I imagine that is not very useful in terms of taxation of the vulture funds.  Will it be allowable for the vulture funds to take internal loans at a reasonable commercial rate?  That is the core of this.  Notwithstanding the technicalities, is the Minister's policy position that loans to vulture funds will have to be from genuine third parties?  Alternatively, will he be allowing in certain instances internal loans to the vulture funds from a different fund, usually located abroad but which might still be under the control of the parent company?  What is the policy position?</p></speech>

I have taken on board the comments made by the Minister on when data would become available and when an assessment would be carried out.  I am not sure the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was in the Chamber when the Minister made a clear and welcome statement that if there were gaps, he would shut them down based on the policy objective.  He said he would not be found wanting.  He has made that clear.  That is exactly what we want to hear.</p><p>The proposal here is that as soon as the appropriate data become available, but not more than within 18 months, a report should be laid before the House.  If it is available within six, 12 or 15 months, we would have a report laid before the D&aacute;il on the effectiveness of the provisions of the Act that are intended to restrict the use of profit participating loans where they are used to finance the business of section 110 companies related to Irish property transactions.  We all know this is technical and that there have been amendments coming from the Department via the Minister on Committee and Report Stages.  There is no doubt about it.  I held back until I got to this point to welcome the work being done by the officials on what many of us on this side of the House were seeking for quite a while.  We raised this issue consistently for quite a while.  We have had engagement with the officials in which they explained the steps they are taking, and they allowed us to explain our concerns about possible loopholes or gaps throughout this process.</p><p>As we get to the point of closing down some of the abuses, regardless of what one thinks of section 110, we should note this proposal is better than what is in the existing legislation.  It will close down loopholes and bring in a certain amount of tax to the State.  The amount is yet to be determined.</p><p>Tax planners were mentioned.  They will already have been working on this to determine whether there is another way and to examine how other jurisdictions integrate.  They will be trying to figure out whether there is a way of avoiding paying the tax or structuring payments in a certain way.  As soon as the data are available, let us have a report, but not later than within a year and a half.  The report might state everything we intended to do under this section is being done, that no loopholes have been identified and that there is no restructuring to avoid tax.  It might state the anti-avoidance measures we have built in are working.  Alternatively, it might state something different and, therefore, allow us to proceed accordingly and inform us.  It is in the context of the fact that we have the budgetary oversight committee.  There is not a majority in government.  The current Government might still be in office this time next year.  It is about providing that information to the House in order we can best take it to the next step, if there is one required on the basis of what the report shows up.</p><p>Considerations like these should not necessarily be built into a finance Bill but there always needs to be a review.  Where there is mobility and a capacity to employ some of the best tax consultants to get around the legislation, we definitely have to review it.  This is important.  I am sure the Department and the Revenue Commissioners will keep an eye on this but it is important that Members of the House have access to the information in a way that is appropriate.  The Minister might state it is not appropriate that we lay it before the House because it could pre-empt what we would do.  I am not sure about that.  We are open to this.  I am looking for a commitment that we will have a document put together at the earliest opportunity, but no later than within a year and a half.  That document could be very small, stating the measures are working effectively.  If they are not, I want commitments that there will be something presented to us that will identify possible problems such that we can work together on addressing them.  We have done so effectively in respect of this section so far to try to ensure the State does not lose the revenue it has been losing over recent years.</p></speech>

On the Department's side, we find those engagements helpful because we are all trying to work in the same direction.</p>  <p>  In so far as the amendment is concerned, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a change in law such as this may trigger behavioural changes, meaning that section 110 companies might simply stop acquiring specified mortgages.  It is possible that the acquisition and management of distressed Irish debt may in future be carried on within the normal Irish corporation tax regime.  Therefore, while the Revenue Commissioners will be in a position to monitor the amount of the profit participating loans restricted pursuant to this amendment, they will not be in a position to say how many of these structures have simply moved into the standard corporation tax regime.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, and as the Deputy is aware, there are time delays between the end of a company's accounting period and the filing of its accounts and tax returns with the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, getting complete data from the Revenue Commissioners may take longer than the timeframe suggested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Given these constraints, it would not be appropriate to put the preparation of the requested report into legislation.  However, the Minister is in agreement with the principle suggested by the Deputy.  Analysis will be performed when an adequate amount of appropriate data is available.  Furthermore, and on an ongoing basis, officials from the Department of Finance will continue to work with the Revenue Commissioners to analyse the use of the section 110 regime to minimise tax avoidance opportunities.  I cannot, therefore, accept the proposed amendment.</p></speech>

The only commitment that I will seek is for that analysis to be shared with others when it becomes available, as that is necessary.  That would fulfil the spirit of the amendment.</p></speech>

Large amounts of tax are at stake and there is an agreed policy position across the House that this needs to be shut down and these companies need to pay their taxes.  They can pay their taxes as 25% section 110 tax, as 12.5% corporation tax plus 33% capital gains tax plus 20% withholding tax or whatever, but they must pay their legitimate taxes.</p>  <p>  In fairness to the amendment, 18 months is a long time.  We were able to raise this matter approximately six months ago based on filed 2014 accounts because they were publicly available.  The State, including Revenue, will have that information much sooner.  I would be concerned with a position taken by the State that it would not report on this matter until it had all of the information.  We do not need all of the information.  From a small number of filed accounts by the vulture funds, we were able to identify that there was something odd happening in terms of large-scale tax avoidance in a way that was never intended.</p>  <p>  It worries me to hear the State say that, while it must keep an eye on this matter, it could not revert to the D&aacute;il within 18 months because it does not believe that it will have the information.  I am less generous than Deputy Pearse Doherty on his own amendment, but a response that claims that the State could not possibly have an informed position within 18 months is ridiculous.  The Minister and the Minister of State should push back on it.  If it takes more than 18 months for the State to get an informed opinion on massive tax avoidance that was never intended and in respect of which there is an agreed cross-party policy decision that it needs to be shut down, it worries me.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State consult the Minister?  To reiterate Deputy Pearse Doherty's comments, the analysis has to be shared.  The Minister of State might confirm to the House that it will be.  It has to be external.  It is reasonable to expect something within 18 months.  This is particularly so because the only reason that the vulture fund issue came to light was that section 110 companies had to file publicly accessible accounts with the Companies Registration Office, CRO.</p>  <p>  It is possible that we are going to see some behavioural changes.  I will be surprised if companies stay as section 110s and start paying 25% tax.  I imagine that we will see transfers of assets to other fund types, but the problem with that is that most of those fund types do not file publicly accessible accounts.  Whatever parliamentary, media and public oversight of section 110s has been possible, if they move their assets into qualified investment funds, Irish collective asset management vehicles or a range of special purpose vehicles, they will become invisible and we will be completely reliant on Revenue telling us what is happening.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State's response suggested that a report would be difficult to arrange because we would see behavioural change.  Of course it is not just a case of examining the same section 110s to determine whether they start paying their taxes.  There is no doubt but that assets will be transferred, sold and restructured.  Section 110s might try to securitise their assets.  All sorts of things will happen, but the State must be capable of tracking the situation.  Will the Minister of State represent back to whoever will be conducting the analysis, be it Revenue, the Department of Finance or external experts, that it must be within the competence of the State to have an informed approximation of the yield on these assets?  We know what the assets are.  We sold them to the companies.  We owned them.  Let us not fall into the trap of saying that, because the assets have moved or been securitised or restructured, it is no longer possible to estimate what level of tax yield we are getting from it.  We need to know that the &euro;40 billion or so asset base that was sold by NAMA, IBRC, HBOS, Deutsche Bank and so on and is yielding approximately &euro;3.5 billion in profits per year is being properly and fully taxed in this country.</p></speech>

It relates to section 110 generally.  I do not fully understand the mechanism through which these companies have avoided significant amounts of tax or even how much they have avoided, but we need to know the details.  What else is happening in the wider section 110?</p><p>I will cite the Matheson document regarding something that I will have to pursue at other times in the Chamber, namely, aircraft leasing and how companies can still benefit from section 110.  The attempt to clamp down on a particular area of property is not applied to other areas.  The size of it is staggering.  I did not know about this stuff; I am reading from Matheson's document.  It reads:</p><blockquote>Over EUR 83 billion of aircraft assets are under management in Ireland.<br /><br />7 out of top 10 aircraft lessors have operations in Ireland.<br /><br />Half of the world's leased fleet of commercial aircraft are leased or managed through Ireland.</blockquote><p>That is enormous.  The front of the document reads:</p><blockquote>Attractive tax environment<br /><br />Ireland offers a very attractive tax environment in which to carry on aviation leasing and financing business:<br /><br />Access to a wide double tax treaty network (over 69 signed treaties)<br /><br />A standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%<br /><br />No withholding tax on lease rental payments<br /><br />Straight-line tax depreciation of 12.5% over eight years<br /><br />0% VAT on international aviation leasing<br /><br />No stamp duty or transfer taxes on the transfer of aircraft or aircraft parts<br /><br />Wide exemptions from withholding tax on interest and dividends<br /><br />Availability of flexible securitisation regime for holding aircraft and receivables</blockquote><p>This is like a menu of tax avoidance that is possible in a massive sector based in Ireland.  A significant part of it turns on section 110.  I want to know more about this issue and the public is entitled to know more, given the fact that we are discussing &euro;83 billion in assets and a large industry, about how much profit is being generated, how much tax is being forgone as a result of the use of section 110 and what actual employment benefit we are getting in that specific sector.</p><p>We need to have facts on this and on the effectiveness or otherwise of the effort the Minister has made to close down one aspect of this tax loophole.  We need proper, easily understandable and digestible, straightforward information in order to be able to assess whether, as I suspect is the case, this is an enormous tax loophole whereby billions are being siphoned out of the tax system by the people investing in these areas and using these mechanisms.</p></speech>

What I did say, on the advice of the Revenue Commissioners, is that to get complete data may take longer than the timeframe suggested.  Therefore, given those constraints and others, it would not be appropriate to put the preparation of the requested report into legislation.  However, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is in agreement with Deputy Pearse Doherty on this, and he would like to assure him that any analysis that can be done will be performed when there is an adequate amount of appropriate data available.  Furthermore, there is ongoing work between officials in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on the analysis of the section 110 regime to minimise tax avoidance opportunities.  When an adequate amount of appropriate data is available, it will be shared.  We share the same intention when it comes to the insertion of this amendment into the tax Acts, in so far as the operation of section 110 companies is concerned in relation to transactions which have Irish property at their base.</p></speech>

What I am trying to get out of the amendment is that, essentially, there should be no such thing as the exclusion of profits from Irish real estate funds.  The Government amendment slightly varies what it had earlier but it still allows significant profits to be excluded.  I do not see the justification or rationale for any profits from the real estate investment funds being excluded and not taxable.  If I understand the very complicated discussion we had on Committee Stage, the funds will be taxed if the profits or dividends are distributed, but if the fund holds on to the property assets beyond five years, they will not be subject to capital gains tax.  As I suggested on Committee Stage, that seems to mean that with the rental revenue the funds are accumulating from very high rents from the real estate they have bought, they can roll up the revenue and profits and, if they do not distribute them, they could just use the money to buy more and more property assets and get a massive capital gain.  As long as they hold onto it for a certain period, however, they pay no tax whatsoever on it.  As we know, the value of property has gone through the roof.  We know the funds are making enormous money on rents, which have gone through the roof, in large part thanks to the profiteering of those entities, and as long as they do not distribute the profit but can use it to just buy up more property, they will pay no tax.</p></speech>

I understand Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s concerns and I share some of them in terms of capital gains tax and the exemptions, but it is important to state that the effect of the suggested deletion would mean that the funds would pay no tax, as is currently the case.  This section, for the first time, will now force them to pay tax through the 20% dividend withholding tax.  If the amendment was agreed, it would leave them paying no tax.  I know that is not the intention of Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about aspects of this section, including the capital gains tax exemption, but I recognise that it is an improvement on the current situation.  We will continue to try to convince the Government about the CGT exemption but I welcome the fact that for the first time the Government has tackled the fund industry and the situation whereby non-resident investors did not pay tax.  I also welcome a provision which we will come to later concerning amendment No. 47 and the fact that one of the areas I had raised on Committee Stage is being addressed.</p></speech>

The effect of the amendment is the preservation of the <i>status quo</i>and so the withholding tax of 20% would not apply.</p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised one particular aspect of the Bill, the provisions around the charitable gain, and there are later amendments to which that debate is more relevant.  The proposal to delete the entire section would bring us back to the <i>status quo</i>and we would not get any of the gains that are being set out by way of introducing the IREF regime.

It would also help matters if the Minister of State would read a collection of notes on a number of the points because we are trying to deal with little bits where in fact there is a structure, and we need to get a bigger picture of what the total structure is in order to be able to reach a reasonable conclusion.  With respect to Deputy Boyd Barrett, to take what has been amended and debated, I do not think anybody, including the Revenue Commissioners, are confident that it is all watertight because we are in territory in which I am not sure many of us have competence.</p><p>This is why I referenced the OECD and people with a global competence regarding some of these vehicles who are interested in tax reform.  All these assets, vehicles or structures are moveable.  If the Minister of State could set out the considerations, architecture and pillars of what the Government is trying to do in the Bill, it would be helpful.  I asked Revenue earlier about when we will get figures for 2014 and 2015.  Will it be after the end of November?  We are moving from a market that was a disaster to one that is in recovery and in which a lot of profit is being made.  If we knew when the next round of figures is going to be available and if we get those figures, we would then have a much clearer picture in respect of what is happening.</p></speech>

The view expressed on Committee Stage was very clear, namely, it is currently the case that property businesses in this country do not pay corporation tax and capital gains tax and that most of them are avoiding withholding tax.  The IREF section tightens up the position regarding withholding tax for some of those.  Let us be very careful about this.  We should not go back one year, we should go back five years.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1230" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="20:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300070#TTT00700"><p>I understood.  My comments are to the Minister of State.  I am not responding to Deputy Burton's comment at all.  I am responding to the Minister of State, to the amendment and to what Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  There is a danger that we take the baseline as today and say that the IREF section brings in some welcome anti-avoidance measures and some new withholding tax provisions and that, therefore, it should be welcomed.  If one ran a hotel five years ago, one paid corporation tax and capital gains tax first like every other company.  Then profits were dispersed to shareholders and 20% dividend withholding tax is applied.  The shareholders then paid income tax and capital gains tax in the country in which they were domiciled in respect of any gains from their share holdings.  That is how a hotel, office block, factory and nursing home worked in this country five years ago.  That is how business in this country worked.  In 2012, the qualified investment fund legislation was radically changed and ICAVs were introduced.  Suddenly, if one ran a property business in this country, one did not pay corporation tax or capital gains tax, there were ten ways around paying withholding tax, one pretended one lived in Portugal for income tax purposes and Ireland essentially became a tax haven for property investment.  No tax was being paid anywhere.</p>  <p>  What this amendment does is copperfasten the fact that property businesses will no longer be property businesses, they will be funds.  In such circumstances, no corporation tax or capital gains tax will be paid and, in the vast majority of situations for professional investors, no withholding tax will be paid because the companies that invest in property in this country are exempt from withholding tax.  If one considers the IREF section in conjunction with what has happened in the past four years - which is what one must do - it means that property businesses in this country will essentially be tax free from now on.  The shareholder abroad may pay income tax in his or her country and may pay capital gains tax on his or her shares but there will be no taxes collected in Ireland.  We are moving what is probably the largest asset base in this country out of the tax net except in a few limited cases,  If one is a domestic investor, there are new anti-avoidance rules which say that one will pay withholding tax.  However, one will not pay corporation tax or capital gains tax.</p>  <p>  An error is being made here, which is that making businesses pay corporation and capital gains tax and then making them pay withholding tax is double taxation.  This is not double taxation.  That is how every business in the country is taxed.  If a person owns a hotel, an apartment block, a number of apartments, a nursing home or a primary care centre, it is possible to say that he or she no longer owns a hotel company, that he or she is involved in a fund and that funds do not pay corporation tax or capital gains tax.  If we take the basic case as of today, yes, the IREF section makes it not as bad but it copperfastens the fact that taxes will not be paid on property.</p>  <p>  At the heart of this is a misunderstanding of what double taxation means.  When it comes to funds, double taxation means that if a fund in the US owns shares in CRH in Ireland, CRH pays corporation tax and capital gains tax, the share disbursement is then made and withholding taxes are applied.  Were the shareholders in the US to be hit for corporation tax and capital gains tax on what was going on inside the company, that would be double taxation because the trading income would be taxed twice.  That is not what this does.  This says that it is double taxation if corporation tax and capital gains tax are applied to a company - to a building such as a hotel - and withholding tax is then applied.  I have the Minister's response to the question I asked on whether IREFs pay corporation tax on trading profits.  He said that, as is standard practice for funds, IREFs are exempt from tax at fund level.  He said that when payments are made from the fund to the shareholders, they are then subject to withholding tax.  He said that this exemption at fund level removes the double layer of tax.  There is no double layer of tax.  Businesses pay corporation tax and capital gains tax and then pay withholding tax.  That is how it works.</p></speech>

Much work has gone into drafting, improving and informing this section, which amends the Taxes Consolidation Act.  I do not propose to go over ground that has been covered in detail on previous Stages as we have dealt with this matter.  I will speak to the intention of the section in terms of why we are putting this in and what we hope to achieve.</p>  <p>  Section 22 provides for the introduction of a tax regime for IREFs by inserting a new Chapter 1B into Part 27 and a new Schedule 2C into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The objective in this regard is to provide for the introduction of a taxation regime for investment undertakings where 25% of the value of an undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  The IREF must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions.  The amendment addresses the issue of non-resident investors who have been investing in Irish property through fund structures thus avoiding a charge to Irish tax on profits arising from Irish real estate.  The 20% withholding tax will not apply to certain specific categories of investors who provide appropriate declarations, including pension funds, life assurance companies, other collective investment undertakings, charities and credit unions.  I should emphasise that the provisions do not in any way reduce the tax payable by investors and that any exemptions provided for in this provision are merely a restatement of existing exemptions.</p>  <p>  Deputy Donnelly anticipates behavioural change that may not take place.</p><p>They say that we are moving a tax base out of Ireland, when the effect of the amendment to delete section 22 does the opposite.  It is now about catching non-resident investors who have been investing in Irish property.  That is what we are working towards in this section.  To delete the section as the amendment proposes would mean that the proposed withholding tax would not take effect.  This would ultimately result in a non-resident still being able to invest in Irish property through funds and pay no Irish tax on the Irish property transactions.  Therefore, it is not proposed to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I will come back in when we come to the Government amendment.  I tabled the amendment, but the real target is the target set out in amendment No. 46 which, unfortunately, has been ruled out of order.  Deputy Donnelly's point underlines why we are concerned about this section, which is that we are allowing the continuation of a special tax status, or non-tax status, for people speculating in property.  They are investing in property and making a hell of a lot of money from rents and then from very significant property capital gains with the appreciation of the property value.</p>  <p>  The Minister is applying a little sticking plaster, which is better than nothing, while allowing the fundamental tax loophole to remain, which is that those investing in property, by declaring themselves as funds, get exemption from normal taxation, both on the massive rental income generated given that rents have gone through the roof and are generating a housing and homelessness crisis, and massive profit on the inflation we have seen in property prices.  They are going to walk away tax-free from all of that.  They will even essentially be able to avoid the proposed withholding tax if they roll up the profits and buy even more property.</p></speech>

I believe Deputy Donnelly is in the same space.  However, there is a huge misunderstanding of what we are trying to do here.  The amendment here is to delete the section dealing with the fund industry which has been buying up property not just in recent months but for some years.  They have bought the country; they have bought Dublin.  What has happened over the past four years is amazing.  I have given the statistics indicating that 66% of commercial property that is bought is bought by foreign money through funds.  They are not Irish residents.  Funds are not structured for Irish residents, but for non-Irish residents because an Irish resident would pay all the tax - they do not pay the corporation tax, but they pay the full tax in terms of dividend pay-outs.  So they are structured for non-resident investors.</p>  <p>  They have been doing it to beat the band.  An Austrian guy has been buying up hotels left, right and centre across the country, structured in one of these funds which is very tax efficient for him.  Despite all its flaws, for the first time ever this provision captures these individuals and the funds industry.  There has been a lot of discussion and good work done on section 110 in terms of the purchase of debt.  The purchase of assets in this country is being done through qualified investor funds as we know.  The purchase of the Central Bank property and other properties is done through these funds and is being done completely tax-free.</p>  <p>  While I am not happy with a policy decision to have a 25% limit, for which there is no reason, and while I am not happy that there is an exemption from CGT in terms of the uplift after holding the property for five years, I acknowledge the work done by the officials.  I also acknowledge that the Minister has accepted this and that there is a dividend withholding tax.  Those areas should be addressed in the future and there is also scope for the withholding tax at 20% to be increased to a higher level as is the case in many of our neighbouring jurisdictions.</p></speech>

Yes, there are exceptions, but institutional landlords in this section remain completely exempt from withholding tax.  Investment undertakings within the European area remain exempt from withholding tax.</p>  <p>  While the section may successfully target a few high-net-worth individuals buying some things, the section locks in no corporation tax and no capital gains tax.  I have not been able to find any other country that does not charge capital gains tax and corporation tax on normal trading profits in the property sector.  Exempting the entire investment-property asset base from corporation tax and capital gains tax is not a normal thing to do.  Dublin now has a property bubble that is bigger than it was in 2007 because they are all coming in here tax-free.  For foreign institutional investors buying property, Ireland is a tax haven; they will never pay any tax.  Other countries do not do this.</p>  <p>  In accepting the section we are saying, "Well, virtually nobody is paying any tax, so let's get a few high-net-worth individuals to pay tax."  No one is paying corporation tax; no one is paying capital gains tax.  Most of the people who buy the assets are also exempt from the withholding tax.  It is madness.</p></speech>

The issue is complex enough as it is.  The Finance Bill was published with sections 21 and 22.  The Government amendment on Committee Stage was so extensive that it replaced the entire section.  Now on Report Stage we again have pages and pages of amendments to section 22, which had already been replaced in its entirety since the initial publication of the Finance Bill subsequent to the budget.</p><p>I make this as a general point with regard to our capacity to process all the complex issues to gain a proper understanding of them.  The Minister's officials have been excellent in providing their time and expertise to all of us and the people who work with us to develop that understanding.  I make the point in terms of parliamentary procedures that for something as complex to change entirely on Committee Stage and then for there to be pages and pages of further amendments on Report Stage is far from ideal.</p></speech>

We are relying on the advice from the Department and the Minister when he put it on the record that the amendments are technical in nature and not substantive.  I know there are a number of substantive amendments to come on this section but, in fairness, this was flagged up as likely to be amended on Report Stage and I am glad it is happening this year instead of holding back until next year.  The points made by Deputy McGrath are solid.  Deputy Burton referred to the cost of the amendments.  I am not sure whether there is a cost associated with the amendments given their technicality, but that could be clarified.  I would like to expand that question.  Will the Minister of State inform the House how much Revenue is expected to take in as a result of the amendments that apply in this section?  There has been a round figure-----</p></speech>

They are technical amendments.  I appreciate that Deputies take it in good faith that this particular amendment being brought forward by the Government makes technical changes.  In so far as quantifying the amount we hope the changes might bring in for the State and the taxpayer next year is concerned, the amount of &euro;50 million was discussed on Committee Stage regarding the work the Revenue Commissioners did in trying to calculate and quantify the amount.  We said it was an estimate and that we hoped it was a conservative one.  The Minister spoke earlier about the total effect of the section 110 companies, the Irish real estate funds, IREFs, and the amount that might be brought in based on the different calculations that have been shared.  The estimate of &euro;50 million is the figure that has been put into the budget figures for next year and which is the figure we hope to take from these combined changes, which I believe are positive measures for generating new taxation, and from the changes we intend to make through the section.</p></speech>

These are two very separate issues.  The section 110 companies are connected only around the edge with the IREFs.  There is a calculation that arrived at the figure of &euro;50 million.  Will the Minister provide details on this split in terms of how much of the &euro;50 million is likely to apply to the section 110 companies and how much will apply to the IREF industry?  This is important.</p></speech>

I couch my question in the simplest possible terms.  As a consequence of the group of amendments, what are the likely gains in tax flows, what are the likely losses in tax flows and what is the net overall position?  It is a very simple, totally reasonable question and it was my understanding that calculations were done in all of these areas.  On a previous occasion the Minister explained a kind of guesstimating process in arriving at the figure of &euro;50 million.  I have to say that, with great due respect, I do not even remotely believe it.  It is just putting a finger up in the air and deciding &euro;50 million.  I have no concept of whether the &euro;50 million is true, false, near or far and it does not sound as though anyone else does.  There must have been some calculations done around advantages as a consequence of making these elaborate arrangements.  That is all I am asking.  On the social protection side where I was involved in budgets over a very long time, we had to go to enormous lengths to identify pretty much every single, solitary figure.  I am just asking for something like the same level of information.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has said it is an estimate.  I would take a fairly broad interpretation of that.  I am not sure there is a detailed breakdown of how he arrived at that figure but my question is whether the yield from these combined measures will be measurable.  With regard to the additional tax that comes in, will the Department be able to say to us in a number of months' time that certain revenue can be traced back to these measures? I would imagine that in terms of the withholding tax provisions on the IREFs, that is very identifiable and that it should be possible to identify the additional income generated by that.  Is any additional income from the section 110 changes going to come into the basket of corporation tax receipts and not be traceable back to these measures?  An estimate of &euro;50 million has been made, but when we all ask parliamentary questions about it in a number of months, is the reply going to be that we do not know as we cannot trace the additional yield back to the measures set out in the Finance Bill?</p></speech>

On Deputy Burton's comments, we did speak about this on Committee Stage and about the work put in by the Revenue Commissioners in trying to calculate the yield in extra revenue to the State from these two changes.  The figure of &euro;50 million is based on the potential profits made on the sample of mortgages that were valued at approximately &euro;1 billion and held by a number of section 110 companies that were examined.  The results of the examination were then extrapolated to a potential mortgage population of &euro;20 billion.  The key assumptions underlying the figures were that only normal trading deductions were allowable and that interest was charged at the normal third party market rates in calculating the taxable profits, that is, no deduction for pop-up participating notes would be availed of.  On Committee Stage we also discussed the possibility of a split of the &euro;50 million figure between the funds and the section 110 companies.  This was requested and I asked officials to look into this, but difficulties arise in splitting the figure with regard to the interaction between the two types of structures.  There is a potential interaction between section 110 companies and these new structures in IREFs but there is an interaction currently between section 110 companies and other fund structures.  Deputy McGrath referred to coming back with definite figures in the future as a result of these taxation changes.  There will be a difficulty around that because some of these receipts could come into the general basket of corporation taxation receipts.  The Revenue Commissioners will endeavour to provide what figures they can, but they have indicated a difficulty in this regard.</p></speech>

I had tabled amendment No. 77, which tried to do something similar in terms of looking through the structure if there was a minimum number of investors.

I take the point about the withholding tax, and this is something of an improvement on what we had before us on Committee Stage, but we are disallowed from doing what we really want to do, which is what we tried to do in amendment No. 46.  The whole thing is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I did not get an answer on Committee Stage, and before this goes through it must be said, that I do not understand why the Minister is allowing tax breaks for property speculators to continue.  This withholding tax is a sticking plaster that will affect some foreign investors, but the Minister is allowing the continuation, and copperfastening, of a special tax status for property speculators who, as has been very well described, are buying up Dublin.  They are making incredible profits from jacking up rents and as long as they do not sell within a five-year period the property assets they buy, and as long as they hold onto them for longer than five years, they will walk away without paying any capital gains tax, and they are making massive capital gains.  Property prices are going through the roof.  We are allowing this and I do not understand why the Minister is doing this.</p></speech>

The only answer I can surmise from this is that back in 2011, 2012 or whenever, the Government decided it wanted to get these big property investors into the Irish property market to inflate the value of property for NAMA to make a profit.  The consequence of this for the Government was it would be able to say NAMA had done its job, it had made a profit and the NAMA strategy had been a success.  However, the consequence for Irish society has been a massive rental crisis where rents have gone through the roof, property prices are going through the roof and we have an increasing concentration of control over residential property in the hands of a tiny number of these property speculators.  It is a deliberate policy, incentivised through this type of measure.  I am amazed the Government would want to continue this.  Whatever arguments it may feel it had in 2011 or 2012, and I did not agree with it then and I argued against it at the time, why it would consider it acceptable to continue this now is absolutely beyond me.  We can see the devastating impact it is having and the totally distorted dysfunctional property sector and rental sector we have in the country.  I would love to hear an answer to this.  It is an unbelievable scandal when what we should have done is kept these property assets in public ownership, used them for social housing and used the rental revenues to come back to the State to build more social and affordable housing, instead of handing over all of this to flipping property speculators and allowing them massive tax breaks on the rental revenue they get and on the capital gains they will get.</p></speech>

The argument we heard put forward on Committee Stage was this was the introduction of capital gains tax.  The argument was no capital gains tax is paid on property now, but because of amendment No. 47 if a property is held for less than five years, capital gains tax will be paid.  This is being presented to the House as an increase in the tax base, but it is not, because until four or five years ago capital gains tax was paid on property gains, just as it is paid on everything else.</p>  <p>  I do not mean to call it a sleight of hand because I am not implying deception, but there is a misunderstanding because this is a marginal benefit in terms of tax if we look at today.  Actually what amendment No. 47 does is state to all of those people who invested in property in recent years during a fire sale, that on all of the capital gains they will make, which is a very large number, for some reason they will not pay any capital gains tax.  Someone who buys an apartment, sells it and makes &euro;1,000 on the sale will pay capital gains tax.   Someone selling shares which increase in value will pay capital gains tax.  Someone selling a field which increases in value will pay capital gains tax.  Someone selling anything that has gone up in value will pay capital gains tax in this country.</p></speech>

Other countries do not do this.  It has led to a property bubble.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The opportunity was to move things in the other direction and state we needed a lot of foreign money to come in here, we basically turned Ireland into a tax-free environment for them and now we have a property bubble and we need to pull back on this, but this is not what the amendment does.  It copperfastens it and it should be resisted.</p>  <p>  I have a specific question on capital gains tax.  Let us say a company makes &euro;100 million in capital gains.  Normally it would be taxed somewhere between 25% and 33% on this.  Now it will be taxed nothing on it.  Will those gains at least carry forward for consideration in the withholding tax?  Previously, if a company made &euro;100 million it paid, let us say, &euro;30 million in capital gains tax and the &euro;70 million left would have withholding tax applied to it.  This is how it is meant to work and we have just taken out the first step.  While I was sitting in the Chamber I was sent two legal opinions from two different law firms which have fundamentally different views on this.  Lawyers today have different views on how this will work.  I ask for clarity on this.  If something is sold and someone derives capital gains from it, we know the person will not pay capital gains tax, but when the new IREF withholding tax is paid will the 20% apply just to the trading profits or will it also apply to capital gains profits?</p></speech>

It will mean more money coming into the Exchequer by capturing an activity where we have taxing rights.  Amendment No. 47 removes from section 22 the ability of an investor who has influence or control over an IREF to receive a distribution of capital gains without the operation of the new 20% withholding tax.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the IREF cannot be used for tax planning and is designed to protect the Irish tax base.  This is a further improvement on the previous section, as was drafted and debated in committee with Deputy Doherty and others, so that we achieve what we intend to achieve with this section, namely, a new source of taxation for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In answer to Deputy Donnelly's points, funds do not pay capital gains tax.  IREFs will apply withholding tax on the gains distributed within five years and to the personal portfolio where it has been operated in the IREF.</p></speech>

Will the withholding tax apply to profits from capital gains?  If an apartment company makes &euro;10 million by selling apartments, will that be captured?  No capital gains tax will be applied to it but will the gain be captured by the withholding tax?  The Minister said the Government retains taxing rights in Irish property but it has given them all away.  It is saying that we retain taxing rights but we are not going to apply corporation tax or capital gains tax.  We have given these rights away over the past five years.</p>  <p>  The Minister said that funds did not pay capital gains tax but companies do.  These are not really funds.  A fund does not pay capital gains tax because the fund owns shares and the company has paid capital gains tax on the profits derived to the fund from those shares.  That is not what this is.  In this case, the funds directly own the properties and the incomes are coming directly to the funds.  That is the misunderstanding on which the suggestion is made that we are removing double taxation or that the charging of capital gains tax or corporation tax to a hotel would be double taxation.  It is not.  Calling them funds does not mean their income is based on shares, like many funds.  This is mixing up the taxation of shares with taxation and profits from assets.  Can the Minister confirm whether the withholding tax will apply to capital gains profits within the funds? </p></speech>

He told me what he thought this was doing and that it is a marginal improvement in that it tries to impose some sort of withholding tax, but it retains the fundamental tax break, or tax status, for these funds that are speculating in property.  Can the Minister explain how it is legitimate or justified for these property-speculating funds to have this special status where they will not pay any capital gains tax on massive gains on property as long as they hold on to it for five years?</p>  <p>  I asked another question on Committee Stage, to which I sort of got an answer but one which was not confirmed.  Is it true that, as long as they do not distribute the rental income they earn as dividends, they will not pay any tax on it?  If they roll up that rental income to buy even more assets and make a capital gain then, as long as they hold onto them from five years, do they pay no capital gains?  It is win, win, win for these guys as they speculate in a property bubble while we get nothing back for it.  Why is the Government doing this?  Please explain to me what the benefit is for this country of retaining this real estate fund special tax status, tax break, loophole or whatever one wants to call it?  I do not understand it, and the Minister has not given any rationale.  All he has done is tell us of the merits of the little change he is making, which is something of an improvement.  Nevertheless he is retaining the fundamental tax break.</p></speech>

I am on record in this House and on a national broadcaster in expressing that view.  This was a conscious decision to allow our country to be sold, particularly in the case of commercial real estate, and to be sold tax free.  It is to do with NAMA, with the banks and with pushing up commercial property prices.  Now, however, everybody including those responsible for the Government's own tax strategy papers is talking about overheating.  The IMF and rating agencies are similarly talking about commercial property and we are all familiar with the statistics showing how far it has risen.  It is because of the funds industry.  An interesting comment was on the question of a sudden withdrawal and that may be behind the Government's intention.  In such a scenario there could be a collapse in commercial property prices that would have consequences for NAMA and the banks because so much of this property is in the hands of these fund structures.</p>  <p>  It is clear that this House will be taking far more interest in section 110 companies and the fund industry because in Finance Bill after Finance Bill these issues have crept in without proper scrutiny by ourselves or knowledge on the part of the Government.  It adds to the argument for providing support for Deputies to deal with these issues.  I acknowledge that the Department has been far more supportive this year than in previous years, particularly on this issue.</p>  <p>  It is a pity that the core of amendment No. 47, which is about limiting individuals for personal portfolios, is wrapped up in the exemption of CGT if they hold the property for five years.  This should not be the case but I welcome the fact that a developer cannot purchase these properties, put them in an ICAV and be exempt from capital gains tax.  While the fund industry does not have tax within the fund, a policy decision has been taken by the Government to exempt these individuals from capital gains tax if they hold onto the assets for more than five years and that is completely and utterly wrong.  I completely agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that there is evidence that we should not be doing this.  We should learn the lessons on commercial property and such people should be subject to capital gains tax.  There is no reason whatsoever not to be and the fact that if they sell within five years they are subject to capital gains tax shows that this is a political decision by Government with no rationale underpinning it.  Even at this late stage I appeal to Government, in light of all the evidence of what is happening with commercial property, to apply capital gains tax for all classes of investors.</p></speech>

I appreciate the difficulty when there is a large change such as this but we debated this at length on Committee Stage.  We debated the operation of funds and the benefits of funds as collective asset investment vehicles in which people could make investments where they could previously not do so and thus take advantage of the larger purchasing and investment power one gets through a fund, or the expertise that might exist within the fund.  One can look at the benefits we have achieved as a State through fund investment in this country, such as the investment there has been in infrastructure and our economy.  It has been very important to us in taking us out of the recession we were in.</p><p>The Deputy approaches this with a particular ideology which does not favour investment in property or profits being made on investments.  He talked about the public ownership of most State assets.  There is a fundamental difference in terms of how we approach the operation of the economy.  It is very difficult to try to get to a similar basis when it comes to issues like these around the funds when we have that basic disagreement.  We discussed this at length on Committee Stage in so far as why we have a funds industry, the importance it plays not only in terms of investments into the Irish economy but for the international financial services sector where high-end jobs are being created - which are taxed at a high level bringing money into the Exchequer - in the managing and administering of those funds through this country into other parts of the world.  It is a very important part of what we have in terms of our offering in international financial services and it is also an important part in terms of what our strategy is in a post-Brexit environment.  We spoke at length about the operation of funds in general.  </p> <p> What section 22 attempts to do, and again we spoke about this at length on Committee Stage, and I appreciate the difficulty around this because it is a technical area and we are adjusting to that with amendments and bringing in new areas-----</p></speech>

Amendment No. 56 does two things.  First, it deletes section 739N as published.  As the ability of closely held funds to distribute capital gains without withholding tax has been removed by amendment No. 47, it is no longer necessary to have the associated anti-avoidance provision.</p><p>The second amendment is the anti-avoidance measure which involved the concept of a personal portfolio IREF.  It has been identified that the definition, as currently drafted, would include structures that it was not intended to include.  Three such structures were identified.  </p><p>First, where a pension scheme invests in Irish property through an IREF, which it controls, the IREF withholding tax would have applied on distributions from the IREF to the pension fund.  While this is appropriate if that pension fund itself is closely held, it is not appropriate if the pension fund itself is not under the control of any of its unit holders.  Therefore, I am providing that the IREF withholding tax will not apply in these circumstances.</p><p>Second, widely held funds may have changed their legal form.  The way in which a change in legal form is technically done is through the contribution of the assets of the old fund into the new fund.  As the anti-avoidance provision is currently drafted, the contribution of those assets <i>in specie</i>into the new fund causes the new fund to be caught.  Therefore, I am providing that if an <i>in specie</i>contribution is the only reason that the anti-avoidance rules are triggered in an otherwise widely held fund, the IREF withholding tax will not apply.</p><p>The third and final amendment is required to deal with larger corporate groups where sister companies may be pension fund managers, investment fund managers and life assurance companies.  As drafted, if a widely held pension fund invested in a widely held investment undertaking where the investment manager was part of the same corporate group, then the anti-avoidance rules would have been triggered.  That is because the unit holder - the pension fund - and the investment manager are technically connected even though in law the investment manager cannot show any preference to the pension fund over the other unit holders.  Therefore, I am providing that where there is a technical connection, but where that connection cannot be used to the benefit of the unit holder, the anti-avoidance rules will not apply.</p><p>I commend these amendments to the House.</p></speech>

The investment undertaking is one that I have been trying to get my head around for some time.  The Minister of State referred to that in his amendment.  The list of groups that are exempt from the withholding tax includes investment undertakings but it is the Government's position that Irish collective asset management vehicles, ICAVs, qualifying investment funds, QIFs, and others will not be exempt from the withholding tax.  Can the Minister of State square this circle for me?  We have a list of exempted investor types, which he has run through - the pension funds, life assurance funds, unit trusts, credit unions and so forth and included in that are investment undertakings.  On a first reading, it suggests investment undertakings will not pay the withholding tax.  I sought clarification on this and the advice I have, if I understand it correctly, is that QIFs and ICAVs, both resident and non-resident, will have the withholding tax applied but QIFs and ICAVs can be owned by investment undertakings.  The standard tax avoidance practice is that one would set up an investment undertaking in Luxembourg, and there are various reasons one would set up two of them and transfer money back and forth before one would sent it out to the Caymans.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether investment undertakings are exempt and, if they are, are ICAVs and QIFs exempt if they are owned by an investment undertaking?  It may be relevant as to whether the investment undertaking is inside or outside the EU as there may be treaty laws that mean we do not apply here and they do not apply there.  Are investment undertakings exempt from the withholding tax?  Are QIFs and ICAVs exempt from the withholding tax?  My understanding is they are not, but are they exempt if they are owned by an investment undertaking?</p></speech>

It is the case that pension funds very often invest in Irish property through an Irish regulated fund, often because banks prefer, for example, to lend to a regulated fund rather than to pension funds directly.  Ensuring that there is not any unintended cross-over here is important.  The fundamental pillar of taxation's interface with pension funds is that they are taxed at the point of exit, and pension funds are in enough difficulty, as we all read on a regular basis, in particular defined benefit schemes, without imposing a taxation burden on them, which would only have the direct consequence of reducing the benefits ultimately paid out to pensioners.</p></speech>

I raised a query in respect of whether the ICAV structure had been utilised in this case.</p> <p> It was widely reported that there was a single property transaction in relation to a property in the vicinity of St. Stephen's Green owned by a very prominent person in Irish business life.  That has been referred to on and off in the newspapers.  Did the Minister or his officials have an opportunity to follow up on my query?  In the first episode, people who had worked in a company for 44 years were thrown out on the street and stripped of all the entitlements for which they had contributed.  In fact, they had to throw themselves on the mercy of the State's insolvency fund which, of course, the State facilitated.  I ensured they got those entitlements as quickly as possible.  I am concerned at what was paid out in a property transaction that was widely reported and not disputed to have yielded a profit for those involved, which was not huge, but was &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million.  In terms of some of the figures which had been talked about earlier, it was relatively modest.</p> <p> What happened in Dublin city caused a scandal to a lot of people as they could see the impact of it.  I asked about it on Committee Stage.  Can we get a comment?  If it is possible to use an ICAV structure in this particular way, we must get some reassurance that the issue of what happened there can be addressed.  There have been other reports in the media about one particular prominent property transaction where, again, there was a use of certain devices and vehicles.  I must acknowledge that for decades in the Irish tax system, there has been a significant and large capacity to avoid taxes by using one device or another and by using different mechanisms by which disposals are made or a disposal is apparently made and then rested so that ultimately no disposal takes place although control and use of an asset may well pass.  There are myriad devices which the people texting Deputy Stephen Donnelly tonight are very well up on.  I would really like to know whether the Minister has a comment on Clerys because this sort of thing offends common decency.  It is like the abuse of charities where Temple Street Hospital, for example, has to say it does not benefit from a particular charitable trust notwithstanding that it had been mentioned presumably as a possible beneficiary of a structure that in essence involves a particular company.  I would really like to know what the answer to that is.</p> <p> If the Minister is not able to give us an answer now, will he provide one at some stage and tell us about it?  It is a good example of how on the one hand people are compliant with their obligations on PAYE and PRSI, as was the employer and owner of that business over generations, and then along comes a new structure that upends that and taxpayers generally pay insolvency of &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2 million.  While it is small in the scale of what we have been talking about, the owners who flipped the asset and sold it on ended up with a relatively modest &euro;20 million or so and were able to walk away.  That is what offends people.  I asked about it on Committee Stage and I would like to see if there is an answer at this point.</p></speech>

It is a continuation of section 739M.  Can the Minister clarify that the new section being introduced does not have an effect on the existing section 739M, which would have dealt with the anti-avoidance measure in terms of multiple funds where a fund purchased an ICAV in another jurisdiction for the purposes of tax avoidance?  A version of that was referred to in Deputy Donnelly's question.  Does that stay as robust as it was in terms of multiple funds being utilised for the purposes of tax evasion?  Will it still be deemed as a specified person so that, therefore, the dividend withholding tax would apply?</p></speech>

In trying to avoid withholding tax by simply placing an exempt fund above or below the existing fund, one would be caught by the anti-avoidance measures in that instance.  The QIAIF or the ICAV will not be exempt if it is held by another fund in that instance.</p>  <p>  In reply to Deputy Burton's question on the Clerys case, I said on Committee Stage I could not speak to that particular issue because legal proceedings were ongoing.  If one looks back at amendment No. 47, it deals with the issue of a person controlling an ICAV to avoid CGT.  As a result of the amendment, the person will now be subject to the IREF withholding tax.</p>  <p>  In reply to Deputy Doherty, it will not interfere with 739M as drafted.</p></speech>

Specifically, if there is an ICAV or QIAIF here which owns office blocks, hotels, apartment blocks or factories and that ICAV or QIAIF is in turn owned by an investment undertaking outside Ireland, will the withholding tax be paid to the Irish Exchequer or transfer under treaty on the assumption that it will be paid in the jurisdiction where the money stops moving?  Luxembourg is usually the jurisdiction of choice because one can get one's profits out of there quite easily.</p></speech>

It is a regime designed specifically for ensuring that where a property rental business is carried on collectively, there is still only a single layer of taxation.  This amendment provides for the transfer of property business from an IREF into a REIT as many property funds may be better able to market themselves as a REIT, an internationally recognised structure, than an IREF.</p><p>As it takes time to establish a REIT, which must be listed on an EEA stock exchange, I am providing that the conversion must take place before 31 December 2017.  Any profits earned within the IREF structure will be subject to the IREF withholding tax and any profits earned after the conversion into a REIT will be subject to the REIT property income dividend regime.  I commend the amendment to the House.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance is to order a study to be carried out on introducing a Financial Transactions Tax and is to report to the D&aacute;il within six months of the enactment of this Act on the findings of the study&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>I will be brief to save us all the Chinese torture we are now undergoing.  It is more for the record. </p><p>In every debate on every Finance Bill since we have come into the D&aacute;il we have said that we should consider a financial transaction tax.  I understand about &euro;2 trillion worth flows through the Irish Financial Services Centre on an annual basis.  There is a very minimal proposal from Europe for a financial transaction tax of 0.01% on financial transactions, net of the stamp duty we already have and to which the Minister always refers.  It is estimated that if we imposed a financial transaction tax, we would generate &euro;320 million net a year, but the figure would probably be much higher.</p><p>It is a negligible tax to impose on the financial services industry.  It would barely feel it.  I do not buy the argument that companies would all migrate somewhere else if a tax of 0.01% was imposed on them, and &euro;320 million or more would be of significant benefit to the people of this country.  It would be preferable to water charges or property taxes which hurt families and would cover the cost of abolishing one or other of those taxes.  However, the Minister resisted and Ireland, along with our friends in Britain, is at the forefront of resisting this tiny taxation measure on financial speculators.</p><p>I do not know why the Minister would not introduce the tax.  I have heard him say that he is afraid that things would migrate to the City of London.  He has never produced any evidence for that assertion, and frankly I do not buy it.  These guys are making an absolute killing.  Large amounts of money are moving through the IFSC and businesses could well afford to pay a tiny tax.  It is disgraceful that the Irish Government stands out in Europe in resisting this very small measure.</p></speech>

His objection has been on the basis that not every country in the European Union was agreeable to this measure and, in particular, that the United Kingdom was opposed to it.  In the context of Brexit and the fact that other countries in the European Union have moved towards the development of a financial transaction tax - some countries have agreement in principle on it - could the Minister update us on current status of the proposals?</p>  <p>  A couple of countries in the European Union have unilaterally introduced a form of transaction tax but have had to withdraw it.  Can the Minister comment on what would happen if countries were to act in concert, in particular given the likely departure of the UK from the European Union over the next two to four years?  There were general discussions at ECOFIN about more co-operation in regard to these kinds of taxes in order to try to offer some level of stability in the financial markets.</p><p>Will the Minister of State say if any progress has been achieved?  Has he, in the context of Brexit, given any further consideration to the developments within the European Union, of which I think we all propose to stay a member?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.729" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="22:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300078#BBBB00200"><p>On carrying out a study on introducing a financial transactions tax, FTT, I would refer to the joint Central Bank of Ireland-ESRI report published in April 2012 which considered the possible economic impact of the application of an FTT.  The report analyses the potential economic impact on the financial industry at that stage based on the Commission&rsquo;s 2011 FTT proposal.</p><p>While I appreciate that the study may be somewhat dated at this point, the report&rsquo;s conclusions are a useful indicator of the possible impact of introducing an FTT in Ireland.  Given that it is Government policy not to introduce an FTT, I do not consider it prudent to allocate resources to further studies or exercises in this regard at this time.</p><p>The joint Central Bank-ESRI report recognises that assessing the likely impact on employment and tax yields due to migration of activity is difficult.  This continues to be the case as it is difficult to assess behaviour arising from the introduction of such a tax and second round impacts on investment and employment.</p><p>In 2012 the financial sector&rsquo;s share of overall economic output in Ireland was around twice as large as that of many other European countries, and in 2016 it remains a significant element within the economy in terms of employment and gross value added.  There is significant employment in the sector, with around 38,000 individuals employed in international financial services, almost one third of whom are employed outside of Dublin.</p><p>The Central Bank-ESRI report sought to identify financial services sectors which could be impacted by an FTT.  It suggested that insurance, banking and financial intermediation, and fund management and security broking were potentially vulnerable to an FTT.  Fund management in particular has been one</p><p>of the growth areas of the financial services sector in Ireland, with some large employers and a total estimated 13,000 employed in the sector.  The UK intention to commence the process of leaving the European Union increases the difficulties of introducing such a tax given the potential for the UK to compete more strongly using different domestic measures for such financial services activities outside of the European Union.</p><p>The international financial services sector in Ireland is now a truly national industry, extending far-beyond the original IFSC in Dublin&rsquo;s docklands.  The sector generates direct employment for approximately 38,000 people across more than 400 companies, with an estimated one third of these jobs located outside of Dublin.  An estimated 200 of these companies are indigenous companies. </p><p>The report concludes that the firms with the highest propensity to migrate following the introduction of an FTT are likely to be in the non-banking sectors which account for the smallest share of gross value added.  Nevertheless, it indicates that the relocation of even a small number of large IFSC banks or fund administration firms would result in a loss of income tax revenue and corporation tax revenue as well as an increase in unemployment.  This would likely still be the impact now of introducing an FTT.</p><p>As I have stated on many occasions, Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions in the form of a stamp duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies which currently stands at 1%.  The yield from this charge in 2015 was &euro;424 million and I understand receipts to the end of October 2016 were more than &euro;316 million.  If Ireland were to participate in an FTT, it would require us to abolish this stamp duty.</p><p>On Deputy Burton's point on discussions at EU level, the position taken by this Government and consistently by the previous Government is that a financial transactions tax would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  This would prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions with a likely loss of employment and tax revenue.  Notwithstanding this, the previous Government was not prepared to stand in the way of EU member states that wished to work together to implement a financial transactions tax and, in this regard, adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced co-operation took place during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January 2013.</p><p>In any event, despite significant engagement by the relevant member states, there has been no agreement on the introduction of an FTT and it is not clear whether agreement will be achieved in the near future.</p></speech>

What emerges from the discussion is that significant tax breaks exist via these mechanisms which enable the very wealthy and vulture funds to get away with using massive tax loopholes.  This relates to the broad point about the context in which this debate takes place, namely, the strategy, which the Government continues to deny but which both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael engage in, of being a corporate tax haven.  I note that a survey was carried out at the Web Summit in Portugal last week and the majority of those surveyed said they thought Ireland was a tax haven.  They are the people to whom it matters to signal to them that it is a tax haven.</p><p>We tried asking for other things but were not allowed to ask for them.  However, what we are asking for here is simply a study to be carried out on the closing of all of these loopholes.  These loopholes are the mechanism by which tax is avoided legally by a variety of institutions.  We should examine the loopholes and the Government should report back, including an estimate of how much could be raised for the Exchequer from a shutting down of these loopholes and this tax avoidance.</p></speech>

Ireland is currently caught between a protectionist UK and a soon to be protectionist US.  Our Exchequer returns will get hit on the SME side by Brexit and it is highly likely that our multinational corporations, MNC, Exchequer returns could be hit substantially by a protectionist America.  We are taking one of the biggest asset bases in the country pretty much completely out of the tax base.</p>  <p>  My fear about the qualifying investor alternative investment funds, QIAIFs, and Irish collective asset management vehicles, ICAVs, being fully tax free has been confirmed tonight.  I have learned two additional things tonight that I had not been clear on.  The first is that not only will capital gains not be taxed at the capital gains tax level but that capital gains will not even be applied to the withholding tax.  It is a more extreme level of Government-sponsored tax avoidance than I had thought.  Widely owned funds - these ICAVs and QIAIFs - are not subject to corporation tax and capital gains tax.  How this is being sold is that they were not paying those anyway but that they will now pay withholding tax.  The second thing we have just found out tonight is that they will not pay withholding tax because they will set up their ownership outside the country.  We are losing all of the taxes.  Yes, there will be a few Irish rich people who buy and sell buildings and we will probably get a few quid out of them, but other than that, this is taking a big asset base out of the tax base.  I cannot get my head around why we are essentially making property investment in Ireland tax free.  We are giving up three levels of taxes: corporation tax, capital gains tax and withholding taxes.</p>  <p>  I know that the tabled amendment probably will not be accepted, but we need to take a serious look at the impact of what we are doing, not just on this section but on what has happened over the past four or five years.  It has almost certainly massively eroded the tax base.  Critically, based on the amount of property bought since the crash and the multiple billions in capital gains that the sale of those assets will realise, how many billions of euro is this Government and the previous Government throwing away in capital gains tax by saying we are just not going to tax property any more?</p><p>I highly recommend that a report which begins to lay out just how big a deal this is be presented to the House.</p></speech>

While acknowledging that the Bill is an improvement on past legislation, the problem is that the previous provisions were rotten to the core and major issues arise regarding how the tax code incentivises property speculation and whether this is appropriate.  A report is definitely required.  Such a report would capture these issues.</p>  <p>  During this debate and on Committee Stage, we have teased out the matter of the dividend withholding tax and to whom it would or would not apply.  I have provided examples of what would happen.  I seek clarification on this issue because I do not agree with Deputy Donnelly's characterisation that, basically, this will all be tax free.  It is my understanding that if an existing ICAV is rearranged whereby it will in future be owned by an ICAV in Luxembourg, the anti-avoidance measures would automatically kick in immediately.  As a result, the existing ICAVs cannot reorganise in such a way as to avoid tax.  If an ICAV is currently owned by a wide structure in Luxembourg or in any other country in the European Union, this does not apply.  The rights and wrongs in this regard are seriously questionable.  However, from my point of view, I do not agree that it will be a free for all or that no tax will be paid as a result of this provision.</p>  <p>  In the context of US-owned firms - for example, Kennedy-Wilson - the dividend withholding tax would apply because they are located outside the European Economic Area, EEA.  Will the Minister confirm my view on this matter?  As Deputy Donnelly stated, we are learning as we go along as a result of the fact that some of the provisions are highly technical.  Will the Minister confirm that the anti-avoidance measures - particularly the general anti-avoidance measures which are written into the tax code and which are quite strong - will kick in?  Will he conform that if, for example, a new or existing entity were to establish an ICAV in Luxembourg for the purpose of holding an ICAV in Ireland, the general anti-avoidance measure would kick in because the purpose of the structure in question would be to avoid paying the tax that would be due in this country?  Even if the latter proves to be the case, there are many smart people who will tease through all of this in order to try to find ways around it.</p>  <p>  This is why it is crucial that we have reports on everything involved, including why the hell we have facilitated - in such a generous way - the purchase of property in the State.  It is wrong to say it but successive Governments have had a love affair with property.  I do not want to go off the subject, but today we received figures on the dramatic increase in homelessness.  We have a huge issue in terms of housing, and a commercial property bubble because it was incentivised through this fund structure.  There is nothing new in this.  It was incentivised ten years ago through a different type of structure by a different Government making different decisions.  We need to break from the love affair we have with property, manage it normally and stop incentivising the purchase of property.</p>  <p>  This is what is happening in terms of the fund structures, despite the advances in the Finance Bill and REITs, on which I want to focus regarding amendment No. 79.  We have a very generous tax efficient structure which now holds billions of Irish assets.  IRES REIT has emerged as the country's largest non-Government landlord.  It has a portfolio of 2,377 apartments throughout Dublin, with annual rental income of more than &euro;40 million.  This has actually increased, because just last week it bought in excess of another 100 apartments.  We are providing a very tax efficient structure for it.  Despite the fact the previous Government introduced so-called rent restrictions, IRES REIT has increased its rents by up to 12% in Dublin in its properties this year.  It states that this is due to tenants leaving properties.  When a tenant leaves a property, the rent can be increased and a new lease begins.  A substantial proportion of the portfolio relating to this entity will be up for renewal in 2017.  IRES REIT has stated it will provide an opportunity next year for more rental increases.  We are in the middle of a rental crisis, people are being put to the pin of their collar and others are being made homeless.  However, one of these REITs, the biggest non-Government landlord in the State, is telling us boldly in its published accounts there are huge opportunities to increase rents again in Dublin, that it did so by 12% this year and that it will do it again next year because a substantial portion of the portfolio is up for renewal.</p>  <p>  It is obvious to me, but the Government needs to ask why are we giving tax breaks to a structure that is hiking up rents and the business plan of which for next year involves further rent increases.  The tenants in these apartments are those who are paying the price because what is involved here is tax that is foregone to the State.  It is similar to Deputy Donnelly's previous argument in terms of how to buy a hotel.  Prior to the introduction of REITs in the 2013 Finance Act, a limited company would have had to purchase the 2,377 apartments involved in this instance.  If we had not introduced this measure in the Finance Act 2013, IRES REIT would be IRES Limited, and it would be obliged to pay 12.5% corporation tax on the profits from its &euro;40 million in annual rent.  It does not do this, however,</p>  <p>  What report, if any, has been done on a cost-benefit analysis of REITs since they were introduced in the Finance Act 2013?  Will the Minister provide details of the tax paid to the Exchequer so far from dividend withholding tax from REITs?  The information should be available.  An Irish REIT is required, subject to having sufficient distributable reserves, to distribute to shareholders by way of a dividend, on or before the filing date for the tax return in the accounting period, of at least 85% of the property income.  One of the proposals I made in 2013 related to the property income of the property rental business arising in each accounting period.  We should have this information.</p>  <p>  The third point I wish to raise relates to the dividend withholding tax applied to distributions from a REIT and a non-residential investor's ability to reduce the rate of dividend withholding tax under the relevant terms of a tax treaty between Ireland and the investor jurisdiction.  There is significant scope for entities to reduce the dividend withholding tax they pay.  We know, for example, that the only tax treaty agreement that specifically mentions REITs is that with the US.  Dividend withholding tax can be reduced to 15% where the investors hold 10% of the REIT shares.  There are questions to be raised and answered on this.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 81 states the Minister shall, within nine months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il a report on the ability of non-resident investors, from countries with which Ireland does not have a double tax treaty, who hold Irish business assets, including shares in Irish businesses, in qualifying investor alternative investment funds, QIAIFs, or ICAVs to avoid dividend withholding tax on any dividends they receive from their Irish business holdings.  I dealt with this on Committee Stage and the officials gave me their view on it.  They informed me last week that all Irish sourced dividends paid to non-resident investors, regardless of whether they are from an Irish limited company or an ICAV, are paid tax-free without the application of dividend withholding tax.  I am not sure about this, but the Minister's advisers and the Department are better informed.  They state that this is the case provided the non-resident investor in receipt of the Irish dividend resides in a country with which Ireland has a tax treaty.</p><p>First, can the Minister confirm whether that is accurate?  Second, can a non-resident residing in a country with which Ireland does not have a tax treaty - for example, Monaco - receive Irish dividends tax-free with no Irish dividend withholding tax paid when they are paid through an ICAV or qualified investment fund?  I ask the question because the focus so far has all been on property assets.  If I were tax-resident in Monaco, owned an Irish newspaper or Irish company, put the shares of that newspaper or company into an ICAV and were therefore resident in a non-tax treaty agreement country, would I be exempt from dividend withholding tax?  My understanding is that I would.  The purpose of the amendment is to examine how these vehicles can be used not only for property assets, but also potentially to hold the shares of companies and, because of tax residency, be exempt from dividend withholding tax.</p></speech>

I thought I knew a thing or two until I started to delve into the world of finance as a Member of the D&aacute;il.  I am consistently amazed by the elaborate variety of mechanisms that somebody - I presume the tax lawyers representing these speculators and investors - has dreamt up.  These tax lawyers then lobby the Government through the Clearing House Group to come up with these vehicles.  They make a fortune out of them, and we get a dysfunctional property sector, a massive property bubble, an out-of-control rental crisis and an out-of-control housing and homelessness crisis.  The Government allows it, and we do not even know how much tax is foregone through all these vehicles: ICAVs, REITs, QIFs and super-QIFs.  You could not make this stuff up.  The Minister cannot even tell us, under these different headings, how much tax on a year-to-year basis we do not get because we allow these tax breaks.  That should be the absolute minimum of information furnished to us in this House to make any judgment whatsoever as to the merits or otherwise of these tax breaks and tax loopholes.  The Minister cannot tell us, but it is big money - billions - and deals with the massive accumulation of property assets in the hands of these speculators, with all the effects it has on the country.  The Minister cannot even tell us how much tax we are not getting.  That is extraordinary.  It is worth thinking about the extent to which the Government will go to try to get water charges from people or go after them for property tax and how they can be hauled through the coals by the Department of Social Protection if it thinks they might be doing nixers or something.  However, when it comes to these speculators, when we are talking about hundreds of millions - probably billions - of tax forgone, the Minister cannot even tell us how much.  It is unbelievable.  Of course, this is so flipping complicated that anyone watching this debate or reading these documents will ask, "What the hell is all that gobbledygook about?"  It is in that labyrinth of complexity that all this stuff is obscured so that nobody really understands what is going on while they are being ripped off on a massive scale.  The term "there is one law for the rich and another for the rest of us" gains a new meaning and significance with this stuff.  All we would like is a little information at the minimum.  We do not think these vehicles should exist, but the Minister should at least give us a little information on the amount of money involved so we can make a judgment as to whether he is making a good call.  We have already made our judgment: it is not a good call.  However, the information and the facts surrounding this should at least be put before us and the wider public so we can understand what is going on and how people are being ripped off.</p>  <p>  I had another point.  It might come back to me in a minute if I get another chance to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.738" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="22:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300080#DDDD00300"><p>In 2010, the OECD published a report on the taxation of collective investment vehicles, or funds as they are more commonly referred to, which stressed the importance of tax neutrality for investments made through funds.  As the investor will pay tax on any income received from the fund, any taxation at the fund level itself would result in double taxation.  Without tax neutrality, the benefits of investing through a fund would be outweighed by the double taxation that would arise.  Most OECD countries now have tax systems that provide for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a fund.  The normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment funds is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.  The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, which, as I have outlined previously, is standard international practice.  In order to ensure that the appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors, funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to the Revenue Commissioners.  This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident.  In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.  There is a recognition worldwide of the benefits that collective investment vehicles provide to facilitate smaller investors in planning for retirement.  In its 2010 report, the OECD noted that Governments have long recognised the importance of funds as a complement to other savings vehicles in terms of facilitating retirement security.  In many countries, participants in defined contribution retirement plans invest primarily in funds.  Because funds allow small investments, they are ideally suited for such periodic savings plans.  They are highly liquid, allowing withdrawals as needed by retirees.  With aging populations in many countries, funds will become increasingly important.  The OECD report notes that a small investor who buys interests in funds can instantly achieve the benefits of diversification that otherwise would require much greater investment.  Funds also allow small investors to gain the benefits of economies of scale even if they have relatively little invested.  In addition, investors in funds benefit from the market experience and insights of professional money managers.</p>  <p>  A REIT is a quoted company used as a collective investment vehicle to hold rental property.  A REIT generally has a diverse ownership requirement, so no one person or group of connected persons can control the REIT.  REITs originated in the USA in the 1960s, and aspects of the REIT model have now spread to become a globally recognised investment standard in more than 35 countries worldwide, including the majority of the world's developed investment jurisdictions.  Again, REITs do not provide any loophole or tax break.  It is important to note that Ireland has extensive protections under our tax code to prevent tax avoidance.  These are strengthened on a regular basis to keep pace with any new threats to the tax base identified by the Revenue Commissioners or otherwise.  Where tax avoidance schemes or abuse of the tax regime are identified by the Revenue Commissioners and brought to the attention of the Department of Finance, any proposals will be considered by the Minister in the context of the Finance Bill.  In this Finance Act, significant moves have been made to ensure that the Irish tax base is appropriately protected, particularly in respect of the use of different corporate vehicles and Irish property.  However, I am satisfied that the use of funds in the wider industry is not a threat to the Irish tax base.  As I have outlined, the use of fund vehicles or REITs is not a loophole or a tax break.  It is simply a method of facilitating collective investment.  Therefore, I do not accept the proposed amendments.</p>  <p>  Regarding amendments Nos. 79 and 81 and some of the questions asked about this section, Deputy Doherty is correct in his interpretation that anyone artificially setting up a Luxembourg fund will still be caught by the anti-tax avoidance measures.  Regarding the treatment of a company in a treaty country, there would be no dividend withholding tax as income tax would not be considered an Irish source.  However, in a non-treaty country, income tax would be considered an Irish source for taxation, and dividend withholding tax would apply in most cases.</p><p>Individual Irish REIT investors will be liable to tax at their marginal rates.  Corporate REITs will be liable to tax at 25%.  Institutional portfolio investors will be liable to tax on REIT dividends at 12.5% because this rate is generally applicable to trading income.  Dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of 20% will be deducted by the REIT from dividends paid to shareholders and will be available as a credit against tax liabilities.  For foreign investors in a REIT, the REIT will withhold dividend withholding tax at the standard tax rate of 20%.  Foreign investors who are resident in treaty countries may be able to reclaim some of this withholding tax under the relevant tax treaty.  Tax treaty rates on dividends vary from treaty to treaty, but the most common rate applicable to small shareholdings is 15%.  This means that Ireland will retain taxing rights of 15% on dividends paid from Ireland.</p></speech>

We are talking here about things that were set up to be, and are, tax breaks and tax loopholes.  It is not an accident that Ireland has the 15th largest international financial sector in the world.  We are talking about Panama on the Liffey.  The idea is that there are no bad consequences here from the point of view of society.  The suggestion is that it is okay and no harm is being done as long as we get the money in, even if there are no jobs or taxes associated with it.  We are seeing what Nick Shaxson has described as the "finance curse", where an outsized finance sector dominates and distorts the economy and distorts society.  That is what exists in this country.  It is just like the oil or resource curse in other countries, with the symptoms including greater corruption, steeper inequality, more repressive government and greater poverty.  Ireland ticks all of the boxes.  The dominance of finance capital is a symbol of a stagnating global economy.  There is no investment in production because capitalists have so little confidence in future demand.  Instead, capitalists are looking for ways to gamble money while paying as little tax as possible.  Successive Irish Governments have sought to facilitate that through the alphabet soup of special purpose vehicles like ICAVs, REITs and all the rest of them.  This gets to the heart of a failed and a failing Government economic strategy.  This is what it means when it talks about industrial policy, which is no industrial policy whatsoever.  It is a shame that the Government will not even agree to a study in order that we can see the amounts of money we are talking about.</p></speech>

REITs and ICAVs and the changes to QIFs were set up to make property investment tax free.  They were not set up to facilitate collective investment.  If one visits any legal website in Ireland or if one reads any of the hundreds of PowerPoint presentations on the issue of REITs, QIFs and ICAVs, one will see that the legal profession is saying unambiguously on its websites that the point of these tax-neutral funds is to avoid paying taxes.  The previous Government took a policy decision to exempt investment property in Ireland from tax.  That is being copperfastened tonight.  One of the many results of this is that we now have a commercial property bubble in Dublin that is bigger than the 2007 commercial property bubble in Dublin.  I have a simple question for the Minister of State.  The Government has repeatedly said that its position is based on the requirement to avoid double taxation.  Will he tell the House where corporation tax is being paid?  If he can show us where corporation tax is being paid and show us how the Government's position will avoid a second charge of corporation tax, that is fine.  I would accept the point about double taxation in those circumstances.  Will  the Minister of State show the House how this applies to someone who owns a hotel, an apartment block or some other property that is in an ICAV?  They all have trading income.  At what point within the ICAV, the QIF or the REIT is corporation tax paid?</p></speech>

The Government never tires of telling us that it is caused by a lack of supply and that we need to consider where that supply should come from.  We think the State should provide that supply, but any bloody supply would be pretty helpful at the moment.  It is an absolutely disastrous situation.  All of these ICAVs, QIFs and REITs, etc., will not deliver a single extra house.  The position might get even worse, as Deputy Donnelly has suggested.  Money is being forgone in tax to benefit people who are just speculating.  That is all they are doing.  They are just speculating.</p>  <p>  When the Minister of State responded to me earlier, he said we have fundamentally different views about the role of the private sector.  I get that, but what exactly is the benefit of this particular private sector involvement?  It is not delivering anything.  It is not bringing us anything.  It is not helping to deal with the housing and rental crisis.  It is making it worse.  I remember opposing the REITs and ICAVs when they first appeared in 2013.  I told the Minister for Finance I could not believe he was introducing these tax incentives.  I did not fully understand what they were.  I saw them and I asked what they were.  It was at a similar late-night session to this one, when we had been debating for hours.  I could easily have let it pass because we were all so tired.  I asked what the REITs were.  I asked whether they would incentivise the kind of speculation that led to the last property bubble.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, said that there would not be a property bubble, but we have a property bubble now.</p></speech>

I made this point strongly on Committee Stage.  It is one of the serious flaws in terms of these funds.</p>  <p>  I have welcomed the Minister's amendment in that it goes further than was the case previously but this allows for those in the funds industry who came here and bought commercial property in Dublin four and a half years ago to hold on to that property for another six months before they flip it and not be subject to capital gains tax.  That is immoral.  We are talking about billions of euro of assets, not millions or hundreds of millions, that have been bought up by international investors who have invested in these funds structures and the huge uplift in commercial property in the past three to four years, which is usually taxable in terms of capital gains if the company was outside a funds structure, but CGT will not apply.</p>  <p>  While I cannot put forward an amendment, as we tried to do on Committee Stage, as did other Deputies, to delete that section, we need a report from Government stating clearly the amount of tax the country is losing because this exemption has been put in place.  It is a fair request that the Government would have to lay before the House, within 18 months of the passing of the Act to allow for the reporting to take place, and every 12 months thereafter, a report on the amount of money the Exchequer is down as a result of allowing this exemption from CGT for funds that hold properties for five years or longer.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty's amendment covers similar territory to that covered in the previous discussion and some of the discussions we had earlier, so there is not a lot to add other than to ask if there is any recognition on the part of the Government that we have a property bubble.  Is there any concern about that, and that these property-based tax incentives, the very thing that led to the last bubble and crash, are producing similar effects again and that we should be doing something to prevent that from happening?  It will be on the Minister's head when this property bubble comes crashing down again.  It is already having a devastating social impact in terms of housing and homelessness and the rental crisis, which is reaching across society.</p><p>It does not affect just the people on the very lowest incomes, but also working people in relatively well-paid jobs who are unable to afford a roof over their heads because there is a property bubble as a result of a group of super rich speculators who think it is okay to profit from the crisis and the shortage of housing.  They are having an absolute bonanza at the expense of the misery of huge numbers of our citizens.  This bubble is staring us in the face, yet the Minister insists on retaining this elaborate architecture of property-based tax incentives.  The Minister is completely refusing to acknowledge in any shape or form that there is a very serious problem that his policies have contributed to creating.</p> <p> If he is not willing to close down these crazy tax loopholes for speculators, the very least the Minister could do is carry out a proper study in which we can look in detail at how it is all working, what impacts it is having, how much tax is forgone, who is benefiting from it and what is the impact of it on wider society, housing, rents and all the rest of it.  I am frankly flabbergasted as to the Minister's motives in all of this.  I was even asking Deputies during the break what the thinking behind this could be.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the Government is completely hostage to these speculators via the Clearing House Group.  That group seems to exercise influence on the Government in order that it puts these measures in place.  It then advertises on its websites to invite investors and speculators to come to Ireland, the best little country in the world in which to pay no tax.</p></speech>

It is basically a request for information of the kind that will ultimately be published in any event by the Revenue Commissioners.  With regard to the requests of a number of Deputies to be allowed to go home early, the Minister for Finance could actually speed things up very considerably by simply clarifying the situation, as he did earlier in the evening with a number of other requests for studies, and that he is agreeable to the amendment.  We were able to reach an agreement on amendments of mine and of Deputy Doherty.  I believe it would be helpful now if the Minister could indicate his position on these amendments.  What is requested is information; it is then for the parties to make judgments on what that information will tell us and what positions may be taken as a consequence of it.  I do not see that there is any problem in principle with the amendment.  The Minister may not like yielding to a request for information, but he has done so now on several occasions in a very reasonable way during the course of the Bill.  I strongly appeal to him and recommend that the information be given.  He has done it for me, for Deputy McGrath and for Deputy Doherty.  We can reach that agreement and probably settle the Bill in the next hour and a half, I presume.  People can then go home at a reasonable hour or go on to something else, as the town will just be opening up.</p></speech>

It is not something from Revenue; it is an issue of policy and was decided upon by the Government.  As the Minister knows, fund investors have a pretty short-term horizon when they consider an investment.  They do not look at ten to 15 years, but more probably at three to five years.  The argument that has been put forward that giving them an exemption that kicks in after five years does not really cost them anything in the sense that they would probably hold the assets for about that period of time anyway, and certainly not for considerably longer.  Therefore, I believe the Minister does need to set out the rationale behind the provision.</p>  <p>  Is it because funds invested in Ireland are based on structures which were enacted in this House that essentially exempted them from tax and, as a result, the Minister is moving the goalposts, which happens every year in the budget to ordinary citizens when tax rates change?  Even transactions that took place some time ago but perhaps have not yet crystalised in a gain would be subject to any changes in rates and so on, which are decided upon at budget time and enacted.  Or, is it because the Minister believes that this is the right policy going forward?  Does he believe that this is the right policy to attract investment into Ireland?  How does he square that with the position facing ordinary Irish investors who do not establish as a fund or who do not set up a fund structure?  They are subject to the capital gains tax regime in the same way that anybody else is in terms of a chargeable gain.  I believe the Minister does need to set out the rationale and logic for that, because this is a significant public policy issue.  The funds are now here.  They have bought huge swathes of commercial real estate in particular and are looking to cash in.  We need to have clarity on what is the policy and the rationale behind it.</p></speech>

In previous amendments in which there were requests for reports to provide information within a certain period of time, we have tried to be able to do that where possible.  It is not a question of principle; it is a question of what information it is possible to provide.</p>  <p>  Speaking to Deputy Doherty's amendment, we debated it at length on Committee Stage.  As a result of the debate that we had on Committee Stage, changes have been made since then to the amendments that are now coming through on Report Stage.  As I previously noted, in amendment No. 47 we are restricting the ability of non-residents to use closely-held funds to avoid paying Irish tax on capital gains on Irish property.  This is in order to ensure that the IREFs cannot be used for tax planning by investors who have influence or control over the IREF.</p>  <p>  On the issue of all other funds, the five-year CGT exemption period is being legislated for to distinguish between funds that flip a property and are in it for the short-term gain and those that hold for longer periods and are therefore a more stable presence in the market.  In the longer term, this will lead to a more sustainable and secure property market for both investors and property tenants, while generating regular and reliable tax revenues for the Exchequer from the taxation of the rental profits.  The IREF provisions do not encompass any tax forgone and, therefore, there would be no additional tax take compared to the current position.  That speaks to the questions raised by Deputy McGrath.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the return required from IREFs will require details of any capital gains distributed without the application of IREF withholding tax.  Revenue will monitor this to ensure that it is not being used by closely-held funds to avoid Irish tax on Irish property transactions.  Should any inconsistencies be found, they will be thoroughly examined by the Revenue Commissioners and acted upon as necessary.  Finally, as the first returns by the IREFs will not be due until 30 June 2018, it would not be possible to prepare the report requested in the proposed amendment.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Government has already written it into the tax legislation and into this Finance Bill.  It is there in black and white.  Let us put on record some of the figures.  In 2006, investment in commercial property from outside of Ireland equated to 2%.  In 2016, it makes up 68% of the investment.  All of that investment heretofore has been tax free.  We have made advances and I acknowledge that there will be a dividend on withholding tax on the funds.  However, there has been a huge increase in commercial property in the last year alone.  Last year, there was something like a 23% increase in commercial property.  The idea that the funds will not be paying capital gains tax is absolutely ridiculous.  It is madness.</p>  <p>  I have made the point time and time again that, in my view, this is a very deliberate and conscious effort by the Government to increase the value of commercial real estate.  When we look at NAMA and the banks, the damage that was done in the property crash was all in commercial real estate.</p><p>That is what went into NAMA.  That is where the real holes were in the banks.  When one pushes up the price of commercial real estate one gets a better return for NAMA and fixes the balance sheets of some of the banks, in which we are now minority shareholders.  That is the intention of Government.  This has been pushed to such an extreme that Moody's and the IMF are warning about imbalances in commercial real estate property.  I am blue in the face saying how much property in central Dublin has been sold out from under our feet in the past number of years.  The amendment does not revisit all of that but that is its spirit.  If the Government introduces a deliberate policy that says to international investors to buy up Ireland but do it tax free in terms of capital gains tax, then the least the Government should do is have the decency to tell us in the Irish Parliament how much the measure will cost the Irish people.  That is what my amendment seeks to do and that is why I will press it.    </p></speech>

If there is no distribution in dividends from the income that is generated by these vehicles but instead the profits are rolled up and used to buy even more property by these vehicles, so that all of the profit gets rolled up into capital gain, the withholding tax does not apply as long as they hold on to it for five years.  Is that right?  Potentially, all of the profits that they make, and are making, from the extortionately high level of rents, as long as they do not distribute them as dividends, but instead reinvest them to buy even more property, so the capital gain element of the investment goes up and up and up, and they hold on to it for five years, then they can walk away and all of it is tax free.  Therefore, the withholding tax becomes meaningless.  Is that not a fact?</p></speech>

His comparison with 2006 is an interesting one because it shows a massive structural imbalance in terms of how property was invested, or the investment around property, in Ireland at the time.  Of course we are talking about a real bubble event.  The Deputy and I both know that from the work that we did on the banking inquiry.  I refer to the almost 100% investment by Irish money in Irish property and the disaster that it led to.</p>  <p>  On the possibility of preparing a report that will have the information that is requested, I am advised that it would not be possible to prepared the report requested in the proposed amendment.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  </p>  <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, we discussed this at length on Committee Stage.  We talked about the gross roll-up regime, how it might apply and the ability of a fund to grow or a profit within a fund to grow without being taxed.  To clarify, the formula used to calculate the portion of the IREF profits is based on a retained earnings of the IREF.  As the IREF's rental profits accrue they become part of the retained earnings.  The IREF may then use its cash surplus, from that rental business, to invest in a capital asset.  If it is then realised as a capital gain that capital gain will then also form part of the retained earnings.  While the cash that is distributed may come from the sale of a capital asset the profits, from which the distribution comes, will be partly from the rental income and partly from the capital gain.  That is, it is not possible to reduce retained earnings other than by making a distribution of some sort to the unit holders or incurring a loss in the current year.  </p></speech>

My amendment proposed that at the earliest stage where data is available the Minister will provide in a report to this House the tax foregone as a result of providing a capital gains tax exemption for property that is held for five years or more.  I ask the Minister of State to think about the matter and discuss it with the Minister.  The Minister of State has correctly pointed out that what happened in 2006 was Irish fuelled investments and a credit bubble.</p></speech>

It is not the same type of bubble that we saw in 2006.  The current bubble is not credit fuelled.  It is tax efficient fund structures fuelled.  It is also foreign investments.  It is unbelievable that until the President puts his signature on this legislation any foreign investor buying commercial property in this country, and the rents that they get for their commercial property, are completely tax free.  That is what has caused a bubble in Dublin.  That is what has resulted in 38% of Dublin being sold in the past three years.  That is why in Dublin we have the second highest commercial property rents in Europe.  If that is not considered a bubble then we need to wake up.  We have a serious problem here.  That is why the IMF and Moody's have issued warnings.  That is why the ministerial advisers and experts in the Department in the tax strategy papers have recommended that we should increase stamp duty on commercial property, which is not happening, because of what has happened with commercial property.  There is a need to dampen down that type of investment.  Everybody knows this.  Some of the Government's backbenchers have complained that there is filibustering.  I have spent a long time dealing with Finance Bills and the debate on the Finance Bill 2016 is the most thorough examination of certain aspects, particularly in terms of the funds and section 110s.  Other areas have gone without the proper scrutiny in previous Finance Bills.  Thankfully, we are all working on this Bill and are starting to reverse the position.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to accept an amendment that we will table in the Seanad that will rephrase this amendment to state "at the earliest opportunity in which the data is available and every 12 months thereafter that the Minister will lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the amount of revenue foregone as a result of this section of the Finance Bill".  </p></speech>

Today we are discussing property-based tax incentives but they are bundled up in a complex web of different types of fund structures.  Some of the earlier amendments proposed an overall look at the system to compare the Irish regime with regimes in other countries and to compare the regime for fund structures here with those for other investors such as Irish investors be they institutional, corporate or non-body corporate.  I believe an assessment should be carried out, including one on this particular issue.  The Minister should and could give that commitment.  His commitment does not need to be statutorily based.  </p>  <p>  Earlier we discussed how the mechanism for tabling amendments that call for a report is generally done to generate discussion.  The Government should carry out an assessment on this important public policy issue, particularly given the structural changes that have taken place in the Irish property market.  In the past significant reports on property-based tax incentives led to major changes in the direction of public policy.  We should take a hard look at this whole area.  </p></speech>

We have, in other areas, tried to provide the information and make the compromises where we could without tying the legislation or the proposal in the amendment, as drafted, into the legislation, because the data would not be available.  It is not that we have a principle of not wanting to provide the information when we can.  It is just that the advice that we are being given in this area is that we will not have the information available and it will not be possible to prepare a report until 30 June 2018.  Of course if the amendment is included in next year's Finance Bill it will be possible to accept it.</p><p>On Deputy McGrath's point, we agree it should be looked at - of course we do.  It is a question of ensuring we have the information at the right time so when we look at it we can have a meaningful conversation around it.  According to the advice we received, if we put this amendment into the legislation we would not be able to meet the requirement.</p></speech>

I appreciate the vote of confidence.  It might lead him to support the amendment.</p>  <p>  I am glad the Government has agreed to introduce country by country reporting.  Those who are fighting for tax reform in the area of corporate tax to try to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance strategies of multinationals have long argued that country by country reporting is key to beginning to close these aggressive tax avoidance practices.  However, they have always said that that reporting, which the Government has accepted has to happen, should be public, and it seems the Government is not willing to accept this and it is what our amendment is trying to press.</p>  <p>  We have spent the last few hours discussing just how complicated the tax avoidance strategies in a number of areas are, in property in terms of speculators and people investing in property, and that is equally true of the tax avoidance strategies of these multinationals.  They have very well paid tax specialists who are working all the time to figure out ways to minimise their tax bill.  Therefore, simply having reports given to Revenue but which cannot be viewed by the public and by Members is not good enough.  These things need to be available for the public to see and for Deputies to see, analyse and judge as to whether these corporations are properly tax compliant and paying the taxes they should on their enormous profits.  I see no reason why the Minister would not accept the amendment.  People like Richard Murphy who has spearheaded the campaign for country by country reporting, which has finally been taken on board by governments, has always said it has to be public and that is true.</p>  <p>  The Minister should accept this.  It would make the transparency we need to have tax justice and tax reform a reality.  I commend the amendment and hope the Minister will consider accepting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.826" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="23:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300087#LLLL00900"><p>I add my support to the amendment.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have been calling for this in terms of country by country reporting, which is to be welcomed, for many years.  It is very much international measures which have forced the Government to move in this direction.  The important part is that it would be public as stated by the previous speaker.  Country by country reporting has to be public.</p><p>There is a wider issue regarding transparency.  We need a public register of beneficial owners.  We encounter that need as we deal with many other matters.  Work has been done in respect of tax transparency and that to be welcomed.  Although, as I said, country-by-country reporting is a positive step, the Government has not covered itself in glory in respect of these matters.  It has been dragged into the era of tax transparency.  Acceptance of the amendment would be positive.</p> <p> Last year, when we proposed a similar amendment, the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Harris, said he had an open mind on public country-by-country reporting.  Since then, however, the Government - Fine Gael supported by Fianna F&aacute;il - took the unusual step of waving the yellow flag regarding an EU proposal to make some information relating to very large corporations public.  It has always been the case that protecting the large multinationals and their tax secrecy has become a matter of national pride.  It is time for the Oireachtas to make it very clear that we support tax transparency.  This measure has been called for by people who are not radicals but who believe in tax transparency and in ensuring companies cannot abuse the system.  The best way to so it is by means of a public register.  Amendment No. 82 does exactly that, and we support it.</p></speech>

It is important that we meet the standards set by the OECD and that we encourage the other OECD member states, which include many more countries than are in the EU, to produce transnational reports on companies that operate across a number of jurisdictions.  It is important that such information be published.  In some cases, when the structure is first being established, it may take time.  However, it should not take too much time to make the information available.  The publication of such information would make for a much better decision-making framework.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.829" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="23:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300088#MMMM00300"><p>The effect of the proposed amendments would be to require Revenue to publish the country-by-country reports filed under section 891H of the Tax Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 23 of the Bill simply makes minor amendments to country-by-country reporting as introduced last year.  These minor amendments are to ensure our legislation is fully consistent with the EU directive agreed after we had already legislated for country-by-country reporting.  Under the internationally agreed approach for country-by-country reporting, the reports filed and shared with tax authorities must remain confidential.  The OECD and the other countries involved in agreeing the BEPS reports have also been clear on this.  If Revenue were to make these reports publicly available, other countries would be entitled to stop exchanging country-by-country reports with Ireland.  This would result in much less information being made available to the Revenue Commissioners and dilute the significant benefit of this important BEPS measure.</p>  <p>  The purpose of country-by-country reporting is to provide Revenue with the information necessary to make informed risk assessments.  It will give a clear overview of the global activities of large corporate groups.  This will enable Revenue to target audits and interventions by highlighting where there may be particular transfer pricing risks.  Making the reports public would not improve Revenue's ability to carry out this work.  Instead, it would be much more difficult for Revenue to do its work because it would not receive the country-by-country reports filed with other tax authorities.  Separately to the OECD's proposals for country-by-country reporting to tax authorities which section 891H relates to, the European Commission has published a proposal for public country-by-country reporting.  This would require companies - not the Revenue Commissioners - to make information about operations, activities and profits in each country in which they operate publicly available.  This proposal is being discussed by member states and is actively being dealt with by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Ireland is actively in engaging in this work.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 83 would impose an obligation on Revenue to make regulations under the section rather than giving it authority to make regulations.  Revenue has already made regulations under this section and they are in force.  This amendment merely tweaks Revenue's power to ensure that minor changes required under the EU directive on country-by-country reporting can be made to the regulations.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they intend to issue new regulations before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 84 proposes to remove Revenue's ability to make regulations protecting the confidentiality of the information.  The amendment is related to amendment No. 109, which involves making the information public.  As I have outlined, I do not support it.  Preserving the confidentiality of the information is an integral part of the OECD agreement on country-by-country reporting.  For these reasons, I am not minded to accept the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.830" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="23:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300088#MMMM00400"><p>We want it to be a legal requirement that Revenue will provide the information and not that it may do so.  We do not want it to be just at the discretion of Revenue.  I do not see why Revenue needs discretion or flexibility in respect of this matter and I do not understand why there is a need for confidentiality.  Our inability to ascertain where these multinationals are making their profits, and their ability to hide the fact, is at the heart of their ability to avoid vast amounts of tax, robbing the taxpayers of Ireland and their counterparts across Europe and the world of enormous amounts of money.  Some estimates put the untaxed profits held by multinational corporations at approximately &euro;2 trillion per year.  Much of their ability to engage in this tax avoidance is based on their ability to mask where the profits are being made.  We want it to be an absolute legal requirement that companies provide this information and that it be made available to the public.  I do not buy the confidentiality argument.  I do not see the justification for it.  Transparency and the imperative for tax justice make it a necessity that we should get the information, that companies should be forced to provide it and that it should be made available for the public to scrutinise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.831" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="23:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300088#MMMM00500"><p>The point of what I read out is that country-by-country reporting arises from an OECD recommendation under its BEPS project.  It was accepted internationally.  Last year, country-by-country reporting was enshrined in law in accordance with our international agreement with all other OECD members.  Part of the international agreement is that while there would be an exchange of information between revenue authorities, such information would remain confidential.  If we were to decide to publish unilaterally, we would be in breach of the international agreement and other countries could legitimately refuse to exchange confidential tax information with the Irish tax authorities.</p><p>There is another forum for debate then, as I referred to in the answer, which is the European Commission.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is involved with the negotiations with it and there is a proposal from the Commission that an obligation would be put on companies to publish the information.  We will see where that lands.  To do what the Deputy requests in his amendments would be a reversal of policy.  Rather than giving us additional information about the global activities of multinationals, it would reduce the information the Revenue Commissioners get because we would be in breach of the OECD agreement to keep the information exchange confidential.  That is the point.</p></speech>

Some mechanism must be found to force these companies to cough up the information.  If there is a real problem in us not getting the information as the Minister suggests - I will think about what he has said - it is a reasonable point.  We need to take a lead and not just be dragged, as we have to date, on these matters.  We must insist that it does happen and the European Union proposal that is being discussed has power so these companies are forced to provide the information.  I do not see why we cannot do it unilaterally, albeit not via the Revenue Commissioners as suggested in the amendment.  We could put a compulsion on those companies to provide those country-by-country reports.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance is to order a study to be carried out on methods to increase the corporation tax take from big business, including by doubling the rate of corporation tax for big business to 25 per cent and abolishing corporation tax breaks and is to report to the D&aacute;il within six months of the enactment of this Act on the findings of this study.&quot;.</blockquote><p>This relates to the tax that dares not speak its name unless it is going downwards; it is the question of corporation tax.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has indicated that the rate has never been and never will be up for discussion.  In other words, corporation tax is beyond the realms of democracy and debate in this House and this country.  We fundamentally reject that.  It is not in order for us to put forward proposals to increase the rate of corporation tax or eliminate loopholes and so on.  This proposal is for a study to be carried out on methods to increase the corporate tax take from big business, including by doubling the rate of corporation tax for big business to 25% and abolishing corporation tax breaks.  The report would come before the D&aacute;il within six months.</p><p>There is much context to this but the first example is the European Commission ruling about Apple's unpaid &euro;13 billion in tax with substantial tax to be added.  This demonstrates quite decisively what the Anti-Austerity Alliance, People Before Profit and the left has argued, which is that Ireland functions as a tax haven for big business and the wealthy, and the losers in this are working people in this country and all across the world.  The Government and Fianna F&aacute;il may not like to hear about the reality but Apple is only the tip of the iceberg.  More cases will be taken by the European Commission in this respect.  We know Google paid a corporate tax rate of 0.14% between 2005 and 2001 and Starbucks paid a grand total of &euro;45 last year.  That is &euro;45 and not &euro;45,000 or &euro;45 million.  We know vulture funds feasting on the carcasses of a property crash pay &euro;250 in tax on billions of euro in assets.</p><p>That is it and Ireland is a corporate tax haven.  In the context of the debate on Apple, this was sold to people as being very important because foreign direct investment, according to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is the seed potato of economic development.  It is 60 years since these seed potatoes of attracting foreign direct investment through low corporation tax were first sold to people as a temporary measure to give the Irish economy a leg-up after years of colonial underdevelopment.  That has not worked and Ireland still lacks an indigenous industrial base.  Even at the height of the boom, indigenous manufacturing employment was only half of the EU 15 average, productivity in Irish-owned firms is low and a few multinationals account for the vast majority of supposedly Irish research and development investment, which still remains lower than the EU average.  That is linked to the low multiplier effect of multinational corporations in our economy.  They buy few inputs in Ireland and they horde or repatriate much of their profit.  Apple is a clear case in point as many of Apple's divisions are headquartered here but the $200 billion or so of retained profits are not invested here.</p><p>We know multinationals offer fewer direct economic benefits and between 2000 and 2015 there was a net increase of only 21,500 full-time multinational jobs, equating to approximately 1,300 per year.  It is also estimated that half of Irish service exports are fake in the sense that most or all of the declared activity really happened somewhere else with a higher rate of corporate taxation.  This is becoming a global story.  I referenced earlier the more than 60% of people attending the Web Summit who believe Ireland is a corporate tax haven.</p><p>In 2010, <i>The New York Times</i>estimated that almost a quarter of Irish GDP came from ghost multinational corporations declaring profits here to minimise their tax bills.  If one looks at the list of the top ten Irish companies, one will see that three of them are multinationals redomiciled here as part of a tax inversion.  It took the Apple case and the leprechaun economics incident, when it was suggested that we had a 26% GDP growth rate, to bring attention to this.  The reality that 80% of corporation tax in this country is paid by multinationals can be explained by the fact that such companies are funnelling huge amounts of profits here to avoid paying as much tax as possible.  The third biggest Irish company, Eaton Corporation, declared profits of &euro;19 million per Irish worker last year.  Irish workers are very productive and create lots of profit for their employers, but this is clear evidence of the use of Ireland as a tax haven.<br/><br/>The brutal point that needs to be made is that this is finished as a strategy.  It is clear from the international picture - the Apple case, the suggested 26% growth rate, the Brexit vote, the election of Trump and recent events in Hungary - that the space for the Irish establishment to pursue its strategy of facilitating the exploitation of Irish workers and resources and the non-payment of tax by European and US corporations is closing quickly.  Such corporations are the only winners from tax competition, which is a disaster from the point of view of ordinary people.  Ireland has been a driving force in the race to the bottom in terms of corporation tax.  As a consequence of the reduction in average corporation tax rates across the OECD from 49% in 1981 to 32% in 2012, vital public services such as those relating to health and education have been starved of resources.  The impact is even worse in developing countries.  The winners of tax competition are those who avoid paying taxes.  The losers are the workers and public services in this country and around the world.<br/><br/>We believe it is time to call a halt to the policy of low corporate taxation in this country and elsewhere.  In co-operation with other countries, this country should reject the race to the bottom and say that corporations should be forced to pay an increased rate of tax.  The Department of Finance has refused for the first time to officially cost our request for increases in corporation tax.  It has done this in previous years by setting out how much would be raised through such a move.  That is one of the reasons I am raising this question.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance proposed in its alternative budget statement that the rate of corporation tax should be doubled for profits in excess of &euro;800,000.  In other words, a new marginal corporate tax rate of 25%, or twice the current rate, should apply in the same way that PAYE workers pay marginal rates of tax that increase as income goes upwards.  Obviously, the corporation tax rate would still be lower than the highest rate of tax paid by PAYE workers.  We estimate that this would raise at least &euro;3.5 billion.  That seems to us to be quite a conservative estimate because the reality is that corporations in this country do not pay 12.5%.  Many companies pay 0%.  The average is probably between 6% and 8%.  We receive approximately &euro;600 million in additional revenue for every 1% increase in the effective rate.<br/><br/>We are calling time on the corporate tax haven strategy.  We are saying that corporation tax should be increased.  We reject the idea that discussing such an increase should be a taboo in Irish politics.  We have set out our ideas for how the additional resources that would accrue from such a change could be used to invest in public services and to pursue a real socialist industrial policy of sustainable public investment that can create sustainable economic and environmental growth as part of the necessary radical transformation to a socialist economy of public ownership of our key resources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.860" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300090#OOOO00200"><p>We want to take this sacred cow out of Irish politics.  The suffocating consensus on the question of this country's 12.5% rate of corporation tax has dominated the Irish political landscape to the extent that we cannot talk about touching it.  It seems that we cannot possibly dream of increasing corporate taxes.  I suggest that this terrible consensus has played a key role in spearheading the race to the bottom throughout Europe and across the globe regarding the amount of tax paid by super-wealthy corporations.  I would add to the points made by Deputy Paul Murphy by arguing that the focus on low corporation tax rates is the single greatest contributory factor to global financial instability.  The less tax these corporations pay, the more wealth is concentrated in the hands of a tiny number of entities that move their profits at a whim to places where they think they will pay the least amount of tax or make the biggest return on investing their money.  The fact that corporations control so much money is making for a chronically unstable global economy.  They literally hold governments hostage.  They really hold us hostage.  We have encouraged and facilitated that.  In fact, we spearheaded the drive towards lower corporation tax rates and our lead has been followed by other countries.</p>  <p>  I would like to add to the figures mentioned by Deputy Paul Murphy regarding our role in the race to the bottom.  The average rate of corporation tax applied across Europe in 2004 was 27.2%.  That figure has fallen to 18.3%.  We have played a key role in encouraging other jurisdictions to adopt low-tax policies.  Ireland has been the reference point for other countries when they have been deciding to cut their corporation tax rates.  The cumulative effect of all of this has been to rob citizens across Europe and the world.  It has even been a reference point for Mr. Trump in his race to reduce corporation tax in the United States.  We have inspired him to do this.  Any benefit we may think we have got from having a low corporation tax rate over a period of time is going to come to an end, even in its own terms, as others try to overtake us in the race to the bottom.  Regardless of what one might have thought about this county's strategy previously, it is coming to an end.  We are saying it is time to call it to a halt.  We should impose a proper tax rate on these corporations while we can and get some money back while it is possible to do so.  We should then use that money to invest in reconfiguring our entire economy and developing a proper and sustainable industrial base that will not be hostage to the whims and fluctuations of the global market and the giant multinationals.</p>  <p>  I would like to make a point about the effective rate, to which I referred earlier.  The Government keeps trying to maintain that our nominal rate of 12.5% or something close to it is the actual rate that is applied to corporate profits, but that is simply not true.  The Government is telling fibs to the Irish public and this House when it restates that case.  As I said earlier, in 2014 total gross pre-tax profits were &euro;95 billion and other income was an additional &euro;8 billion.  This gave us a grand total of &euro;103 billion in pre-tax profits, but just &euro;4.9 billion was paid in tax.  This equates to an effective rate of 4.75%.</p><p>Even if we imposed the 12.5% rate on pre-tax gross profits, we would get &euro;9.2 billion or an additional &euro;4 billion per year.  Imagine the difference that would make and how much extra money we would have for the housing programme we need, the chronically underfunded health service, our education system and all the public services and infrastructure deficits that we have.  That &euro;4 billion would make a world of difference to the lives of our citizens and the health and sustainability of our economy.</p> <p> It is a matter of urgency, if the economy is to be sustained for the citizens in years ahead, for us to move in a radically new and different direction in terms of corporate tax.  That is the thinking and logic behind the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.862" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="00:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300091#PPPP00200"><p>The 12.5% rate of corporation tax is the cornerstone of our corporate tax policy.  It has been a key driver of inward investment since its introduction in the late 1990s.  A number of studies over the past few years have proved how important the 12.5% rate is to the Irish economy.  In 2014, the Department of Finance published an economic impact assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax policy.  This contained the results of extensive research carried out and commissioned by the Department of Finance, which sought to quantify the effect of corporation tax policy on the Irish economy.  As part of this project, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, was commissioned to carry out a study into the impact the corporation tax rate has on the decision of firms to invest in Ireland.  This independent research found that if the rate had been higher over the period of the sample, the number of new foreign investments into Ireland would have been lower.</p>  <p>  A further report by the ESRI published earlier this year again outlined the importance of the 12.5% rate in attracting inward investment.  The paper demonstrated that among all European Union countries, Ireland would be the most sensitive to a change in the corporate tax rate in its ability to secure inward investment.  An increase in Ireland&rsquo;s statutory corporate tax rate of 1% would be associated with a reduction in its probability of being chosen as a location for inward investment projects from non-EU countries by 4.6%.  The Deputy could do the maths on what the reduction would be if the 12.5% rate was to be doubled to 25%.</p>  <p>  I remind the Deputies that although we have a low rate on trading income, a higher 25% rate already applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.  Furthermore, a rate of 33% is applied to the chargeable gains of companies.  As opposed to other countries, in Ireland we have a transparent approach.  Other countries may have a high headline rate of corporation tax but this is usually supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs.  Our rate may be low but it applies to a broad base and therefore the overall level of corporation tax paid to the Exchequer is in line with OECD averages.  Given the independent evidence that has proved the importance of the 12.5% rate to the Irish economy and the ongoing commitment to the 12.5% rate stated in the programme for a partnership Government, I do not accept the proposed amendment or the arguments advanced in support of them.</p></speech>

Mr. Michael Burke, an economist in Britain who writes often enough about Ireland, did an amount of research on this, including the relationship between corporation tax rates and growth.  He concluded there is no effective relationship in that regard and I read another paper with the same argument.</p>  <p>  If there is no corporation tax and there must be public services, what will be the consequence?  It is the imposition of other direct and indirect taxes on workers, which also have a impact in terms of consumption.  The Government and the right wing would like to portray a simple scenario where if taxes are cut, more growth will be created and we might even end up with a bigger tax take at the end of the day.  It relates to the Laffer curve.  Instead, there is a race to the bottom with the likes of corporation tax.  Hungary is aiming for a rate of 9%, US President-elect will go for 15% and British Prime Minister May will go with whatever she wants.  What will we do here if the North has a rate of less than 12.5%?  It is a race to nowhere from the point of view of ordinary people.</p>  <p>  The Government gets itself into trouble with the gymnastics involved.  I listened to Pat Kenny on the radio, whom I would broadly view as being part of the establishment, when he interviewed the US ambassador on the day Mr. Trump was elected.  He asked if it was a real problem that Mr. Trump was talking about reducing the corporation tax rate to 15%.  The ambassador replied it would only be a problem if Ireland was a tax haven and had low corporation tax rates as a main selling point.  On the one hand the Government is trying to say we are not a corporate tax haven and we have other offerings but on the other hand it is a core part of the Government's strategy.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister and anybody who is open-minded on this to consider the following question.  How is it that in the 1950s, 1960s and right up to the 1970s, we could afford the likes of social housing while in Britain they could afford the National Health Service?  We had expansion of a public health system and we were able to invest in all sorts of areas of infrastructure to expand public services but now we cannot afford such things, apparently, as there is no money even to build the amount of social housing we could at that time.  We do not have the money for infrastructure now but we had it then, when we were poorer.</p>  <p>  The level of corporate taxation has dropped from approximately 50% then to negligible levels now and something gives when there is such competition and a race to the bottom.  We go from where corporations pay 50% tax on profits to 4.7% on those profits now.  As a result, we do not have the money for social housing, infrastructure, education and everything we need to sustain a decent society and a proper infrastructure for that society.  That is the consequence of the race to the bottom that the Government has spearheaded and we want to move in the opposite direction.</p></speech>

Section 44 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 extended the period within which the land or buildings may be acquired for the purposes of this relief to 31 December 2014.  If the property is held for the full seven years, the land or buildings will qualify for the full relief.  Partial relief is available if the property is held for longer than seven years.`</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the impact of the capital gains tax relief granted in respect of land and buildings, including commercial property, introduced in budget 2012 and extended in budget 2014.  I am further advised by Revenue that, in view of the fact that the nature of the relief is time related and requires a minimum ownership period of seven years, which ownership period could not commence earlier than 7 December 2011, it will not be in a position to offer initial soundly based costings until the returns for the tax year of 2018 have been processed.  More detailed costings would follow on from the processing of tax returns from 2019 onwards.  There is therefore no basis at present on which to prepare a report on the cost of this relief.</p>  <p>  With regard to Irish real estate funds, IREFs, the proposal ensures that any rental income or development profits earned by the IREF will be included in the calculation of the IREF's profits.  Capital gains will also be included in the calculation of profits unless the asset is held for five years or more.  The exemption from capital gains has been legislated for to encourage sustainable investment focused on the long-term holding and management of income-producing rental property.  This will, in the longer term, lead to a more sustainable and secure property market for both investors and property tenants while generating regular and reliable tax revenues for the Exchequer from the taxation of the rental profits.  Although any gain may be exempt where the property is held for more than five years, tax will still be payable on the rental income that is being generated.  It should be noted that this exemption reflects the current position regarding capital gains tax, CGT, and funds and does not reduce the current tax burden on funds.  Therefore, it does not give rise to an additional cost.</p>  <p>  To ensure, however, that the IREFs cannot be used for tax planning, as I have noted, I am proposing a Report Stage amendment which removes from section 22 the ability of an investor who has influence or control over the IREF to receive a distribution of capital gains without the operation of the new 20% withholding tax.  This proposed IREF is not a tax incentive for people investing in commercial property.  All rental income and development profits earned by the IREF will be included in the calculation of the IREF&rsquo;s profits.  Where an IREF makes a distribution of these profits, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.  The proposal has been drafted in a balanced way to ensure the Irish tax base is protected where Irish property transactions are taking place within collective investment vehicles while not damaging the commercial property market in the long term.  The IREF provisions apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.  Therefore, as the Revenue Commissioners will not receive accounts for these funds until mid-2018, it would not be practicable to prepare the report in the timeframe requested.  I cannot accept the proposed amendment.  Of course, when the data are available, it will obviously be reported on and the kind of information the Deputy has requested will be provided in due course.</p></speech>

It relates to cases in which a farmer leases his land for the purpose of the installation of solar panels.  This is more popular than one might think.  This week, the<i>Irish Examiner</i>reported that Kerry County Council had received six applications in the past 12 months alone for solar farms, essentially for parts of farms to be used for solar power generation.  The particular issue I raise relates to the application of agriculture tax relief, which comes, as the Minister knows, under the long-established provisions of the 90% relief that applies when a qualified farmer inherits a farm.  There is a key test to be defined as a farmer, which is that the beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% of the gross market value of that person's total property at a particular date.</p><p>The issue here is that, for the purposes of establishing whether a beneficiary satisfies the 80% test, Revenue takes the view that land on which solar panels are installed is not agricultural property.  Therefore, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by solar panels, the use of agricultural land for a solar farm may result in the beneficiary's failure to meet that 80% test and therefore to qualify for agricultural relief.  Mr. Jim Gannon, the CEO of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, pointed out in comments today that about 9% of our total energy currently comes from renewable sources, which we need to get up to 16% by 2020.  Tax practitioners are now advising farmers to be very cautious in making their land available for solar panels because of the taxation implications, namely and principally, the capital acquisitions tax, CAT, implications of the possible non-application of agricultural relief.  It is an emerging issue and one which is going to have to be addressed.  I look forward to the Minister's comments on it.</p></speech>

I will speak first to the detail of the proposed amendment and then to the wider issue.  Deputy McGrath proposes changing the definition of &ldquo;farm land&rdquo; in section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  While his amendment as drafted refers to reliefs from capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, the amendment itself affects only a relief for certain income from the leasing of farm land.  As such, the amendment is not likely to achieve the objective which I think Deputy McGrath had hoped for in terms of the treatment of the capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax of solar panel installations on farmland.</p>  <p>  The issue of how the installation of solar panels on farmland affects entitlement to various payments and reliefs from taxation has been raised with both my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recent times.  Various interconnected issues are at play and all of these policy areas need to be considered in a systematic and coherent manner rather than being considered in isolation.  The Government response to such policy issues needs to be consistent and complementary.</p>  <p>  From a tax policy perspective it is important to ensure reliefs from taxation are implemented only after proper consideration and where their effect justifies any revenue forgone.  Therefore, I intend that these various issues should be considered in a unified manner in co-operation with interested parties over the coming months with a view to changes, if any, being made next year.  Given that the proposed amendment is not likely to achieve what I consider was intended by the Deputy and that there are wider policy issues to be considered, I believe this to be a more effective way in which to approach the matter.</p><p>For this reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  However, I accept that this is a genuine issue and may be an issue of greater magnitude in a year or two or three years than it is now, and I am prepared to work with the Deputy to establish the full facts and come up with a solution in advance of next year's finance Bill.</p></speech>

It is acceptable to me.  An amount of thought must go into it, given that there are several potential implications across the tax code if the use of land in this way is not deemed to be agricultural in nature.  Those who are investing in this type of technology will argue that the land can still be made available for dual purpose, for example, an area covered by solar panels can be grazed by sheep.  The issues are significant and have serious implications for farmers and we all buy into increasing the percentage of our energy that is provided by renewables.  We have a long way to go, and at the current rate of progress we will not meet our targets.  This is one area that offers a further potential way to increase renewable levels.  I take what the Minister said in good faith, that he will engage in stakeholders to deal with all the issues in a unified manner.</p></speech>

The Minister established a working group on taxation and charities, which produced a very good report.  Now is the time to signal that the Government is prepared to move on it.  The issue relates to the VAT liability of the charitable sector.  The most recent data, set out in the report of the working group under the Department of Finance, is that in 2010, total expenditure by Irish charities was approximately &euro;1.7 billion and total VAT incurred was &euro;77.4 million, or 4.5% of total expenditure.  It is heartbreaking for many volunteers who spend their time fund-raising for charities that much of the money raised, especially for capital projects, returns to the Exchequer by way of VAT payments.</p><p>A number of models are in use elsewhere in Europe.  The Danish model is probably one of the best.  It caps the amount of VAT that can be repaid to charities under a VAT compensation scheme.  The cap in Denmark is approximately &euro;20 million.  Nobody is suggesting it would start at that level in Ireland.  The ground work has been done.  The report is very good.  We need a policy objective from the Government to introduce a VAT compensation scheme.  The fundamental objective is that the money charities raise through fund-raising is spent for the purpose for which it is raised and does not end up in the arms of the Exchequer by way of a VAT liability.  I hope the Minister signals that he is prepared to move on it.</p></speech>

I raised it, along with many other Independent Members, during the programme for Government talks.  It is a major issue in communities across the country and this is a very reasonable amendment, especially given the many spiralling costs including insurance.  Insurance costs will be very detrimental to voluntary and community associations.  The Minister told us he could have only a certain number of VAT rates.  The hardship is awful.  The Minister expects people who have already paid taxes on their incomes, whether they be self-employed, PAYE workers or social welfare recipients, to fund-raise and contribute, and then charities must pay VAT.</p>  <p>  In my county, many ambulance services are unavailable and the Red Cross provides ambulances on a voluntary basis, expecting a contribution from the patient.  The Red Cross fund-raises to buy these ambulances.  It is farcical in the extreme that a community has to pay a third tax.  They pay for the services that provide ambulances and then the patient is expected to make a contribution to the Red Cross.  This must be dealt with.  Ireland depends on voluntary services to a huge extent.  Some move must be made to right the situation of VAT being paid on defibrillators and many other facilities.  The Minister should consider the amendment in any way he can.  It is long overdue.</p></speech>

We need to see substantial progress.  Work has been done outside the Government on examining the issue.  On Committee Stage, I said I was raising it when I was elected to the Seanad in 2007, and we are still raising it.  This week I was contacted by a local Donegal charity which is doing great work transporting cancer patients to Galway.  When the charity had to purchase a new vehicle, it paid VAT.  Charitable fund-raising events take place in my parish and other parishes around the State for such organisations.  It is not right that some of it is going into the coffers of the Exchequer.  It could be argued that the State should be providing these services in the first place.  It is bad enough that these charities are stepping into the breach; the State also charges them for it.</p>  <p>  It is not an unlimited reimbursement.  It is a measured and affordable step, and the Government must commission a report in time to allow the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to scrutinise it and make a recommendation before the 2018 budget and finance Bill.  I hope the Government indicates that we are on this trajectory and that next year's finance Bill will have something substantial on the issue.</p></speech>

Charitable organisations are, for the most part, outside the scope of VAT.  This means they do not charge VAT on any goods or services they supply and they are not entitled to claim back VAT incurred on inputs related to their charitable business.  In 2015, I agreed to the establishment of a working group, comprising representatives from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Irish Charities Taxation Reform, ICTR, group, to examine options available to reduce the VAT burden of charities.  The working group's report was provided to me at the end of 2015, in my deliberations ahead of the budget 2016.  While the report acknowledges the burden imposed on charities by the inability to reclaim VAT on their inputs, I decided not to introduce any new tax relief in the area, given that I remain to be convinced that the use of a tax expenditure is the best approach in this case.</p><p>There are some 8,500 registered charities in this country and many are already in receipt of significant Government subvention through the Health Service Executive, HSE, Departments, the national lottery and others.  The provision of funding in this way has the advantage of transparency and economic efficiency in that the Government can direct funding to those charities operating where the need is greatest and which can deliver the services most efficiently.  Charities also benefit from favourable and costly concessions across all tax heads.  However, as I mentioned in my recent budget day speech, I have asked my officials to engage again with the working group on charities with a view to reviewing the options available to provide compensation to charities as regards the burden of VAT, while being mindful of fiscal constraints.  I understand my officials have already met with Charities Institute Ireland in this regard.</p> <p> I have some supplementary information also.  The Danish VAT compensation scheme is not the only model the group will consider, and I am reserving my position on this until I receive the report from the group that I have re-established.  As I stated previously, there are some 8,500 registered charities operating in Ireland and the vast majority are worthy of our support.  They range hugely in size and scope from international emergency and humanitarian relief agencies to local community groups.  We need to ensure that Government continues to direct funding to those most deserving of our support.</p> <p> The review group has already met and has agreed to look at how the Danish system might apply to Ireland, as well as looking again at alternatives such as providing VAT refund orders for particular activities or particular goods and services or even for specific sectors, as is the custom and practice in the United Kingdom.  Other considerations of the group involve finding a means of granting VAT relief to charities that would not result in undue administrative burdens on the charities or the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p> In line with the commitments made on budget day, the work has advanced speedily and we will continue to drive it to a conclusion, and we will keep Deputies informed.  In view of that, I ask Deputy McGrath to withdraw his amendment.  I will bring forward a report on the issue and make it available to him on completion.</p></speech>

Listening to the reply it appears he has not made up his mind as to whether he believes this is the right direction in which to go.  It is fair to say he has raised some concerns but he has a group that will now examine the option of introducing some form of VAT relief for charities in Ireland and I welcome that.</p>  <p>  One point the Minister made was that many of the charities receive direct financial support from the State, which I acknowledge, but it is possible to design a scheme whereby the VAT rebate does not occur in respect of expenditure from the money they receive from the State and that the VAT rebate relates to the expenditure on the back of fundraising efforts and non-State sources of funding.  That can be done.  It is done elsewhere.</p>  <p>  I respect what the Minister said.  I will not press the amendment.  I look forward to that work being advanced and I hope he will keep all sides of the House informed as to the progression of this issue because it seems there is broad consensus in the House that there should be some relief for the charitable sector in regard to its VAT liability.</p></speech>

The issue, as I understand it, has particular relevance to the poultry sector, which is very concentrated in geographic terms, particularly around the Border counties.  It makes an important economic contribution to that part of the island in terms of employment, investment and so on.  I would imagine that the issue here, identified by Revenue, is that the flat-rate addition is resulting in more VAT being refunded than is being incurred by the farmers concerned.  The Minister might clarify if that is the thrust of where this is coming from but I am hearing from our Deputies in areas that are affected, and I am sure he is hearing it from his parliamentary party colleagues, that if this goes through as presently constructed, it will have a devastating and immediate effect on that sector.  We dealt with this on Committee Stage and my understanding is that nothing happens automatically on 1 January 2017, that there may be a Revenue review into a certain sector and that if there was to be any change to the flat-rate addition for farmers or a particular sector, that would require a statutory instrument by way of secondary legislation.  The Minister might clarify those issues but the amendment is proposing a deferral for one year to allow the sector to restructure its affairs and reorganise itself.  I look forward to his response.</p></speech>

It provides me, from 1 January 2017, with the power to exclude a particular agricultural sector from the farmers&rsquo; flat-rate scheme by way of a ministerial order.  It does not exclude any sector from the flat-rate scheme from 1 January  2017; it merely gives me the power to make an order for any exclusion to apply.  No agricultural sector will be excluded from the farmers&rsquo; flat-rate scheme on 1 January 2017.  Before that can happen, the Revenue Commissioners must carry out a review of the sector and they will consider the business structures or models in place and the relationships between the parties involved.  If they feel that the application of the flat-rate addition in this sector has resulted in and will continue to lead to over-compensation of VAT to those farmers, they will contact the persons involved and advise them accordingly.  If those persons refuse to change the models or structures that give rise to the over-compensation of the flat-rate addition, a report will be forwarded to the Minister for Finance with a recommendation that the flat-rate scheme be withdrawn from the particular sector.  In other words, the industry will have an opportunity to restructure its operations to allow it to remain within the scheme.</p>  <p>  Any sector where such structures and arrangements have evolved should unwind them now if they wish to continue to operate under the flat-rate scheme.  They will have adequate time between now and the completion of any such review to do so.  Revenue has indicated to me that it would expect to commence any reviews that might be warranted from the start of the second quarter of 2017.  I would urge any sector where there are issues of this nature to start the process of unwinding with immediate effect and to advise Revenue of its plans.</p>  <p>  There are indications about the precise nature of the issue.  There are indications that certain structures or models have emerged in some sectors which, through a combination of normal VAT deductibility rules and the flat-rate scheme, result in a much higher level of flat-rate addition payments and VAT recovery in the sector than would otherwise be available.  While VAT should not be a cost to business, simplification schemes should not result in businesses being over-compensated.  Where there is over-compensation of flat-rate farmers and certain sectors for VAT borne on their input costs, this would have implications for VAT neutrality and possible competitiveness within the sector and within the agricultural industry generally.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath and a number of colleagues have asked that time be provided.  There is no Deputy in favour of tax avoidance or tax evasion.  The request has been for time.  In summary, the position is that the legislation enables me to issue a directive in due course but I can only do so after the advice of the Revenue Commissioners, and they can only advise me after a review.  They will not commence any review until the second quarter of 2017.  When the report comes back to me, I would not expect to be issuing any order until later in the year, and certainly not rushing it.</p><p>My preferred outcome would be that the particular sector involved would move now to change its structure so that we would not be giving back more VAT than we collect because that is what it comes down to.</p></speech>

The Minister was unable to be there but the Minister of State stepped in for him.  The Minister will know that I welcomed the provision on Second Stage because we were conscious of the Commission's view.  It is appropriate that we, in this House, take the relevant actions instead of others forcing our hand to do so.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about a scheme, regardless of where it is.  My track record speaks for itself when it comes to schemes involved in tax avoidance or tax evasion.  He also said that if there are scenarios, then we should unwind them.  The problem is Revenue has given all these schemes a clean bill of health until now.  Why would somebody unwind something that Revenue has said is completely legitimate until now?  If Revenue decides to carry out a review and believes a sector has been over-compensated, I presume at that stage, once the sector has been informed that Revenue holds a different view subject to a review, it will take action.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned that Revenue would allow the sector sufficient time to reorganise itself after a review had been completed.  Will he elaborate on that?  It may not just be a case of unwinding mechanisms, which is at the core of this.  As the Minister mentioned, dismantling a type of model may be easy enough but the difficulty is if the model confers a financial benefit on the sector.  If we dismantle it, we take away the financial benefit.  Will the sector be sustainable afterwards?</p>  <p>  The Minister's earlier contribution suggested that a review would be carried out in the second quarter of 2017 and there will be engagement with the sector to give it ample time to adjust.  Therefore, I presume the Minister will not consider orders until 2018, if an order is required.  I would like him to make it clear whether sustainability of the sector will be a factor in this.  We are very aware that some of this is heavily concentrated in Border communities and that Brexit will have an impact.  There is a need for us to support the agricultural sector while at the same time ensuring no additional benefit is conferred on it by the tax code, which was never intended.  It is time for this but it needs to be a bit clearer in terms of when Revenue will complete its review and the associated timeframe.  The clock will start ticking when a particular sector is first told, despite what has been said beforehand, that it needs to change practices or models engaged in heretofore.</p></speech>

What is at issue here is the operation of a system and how Revenue has identified a flaw in the system that resulted in an over-compensation of VAT, particularly for one sector.  The Minister has outlined a process that will be provided for in the legislation.  He has given some comfort that there will be enough time to tease out the issue properly.  I will not withdraw my amendment until he responds to the issue raised by Deputy Doherty.  The question of the viability and overall sustainability of the sector is not within the competence of Revenue.  The Revenue Commissioners are charged with administering the tax code.  I ask the Minister to address the point made about viability because serious issues have arisen from this matter.  No one in my party can stand over a situation where more VAT is returned than is incurred in the first place.  This debate allows us to tease out all the issues and ensure this matter is dealt with in the proper way.</p></speech>

There seems to be the suggestion also that not every business in the sector was involved in these operations.  There would be a competitive issue in respect of those which were involved and those which were not.  So far it is one agricultural sector that I have been advised about.</p>  <p>  What I propose to do is to ask the Deputies to give me the enabling section.  As I said, the process is that Revenue will not start conducting a review until the second quarter and then it will have to report to me.  I do not have to act on its report within any particular timeline.  I think it is fair to say that since there is no specific time in which the Minister for Finance must decide on restrictions to the flat-rate scheme, the Minister for Finance will have the ability to delay signing an order to restrict the flat-rate addition, if he or she believes that the affected agricultural sector is arranging its business structures, contractual arrangements or models to provide that no systemic excess of flat-rate additional payments over VAT on inputs will occur.  To put that in simple English, I will give the time necessary for the sector to make the arrangements necessary to end the practice.  We will take into account any evidence that is provided as to the effect of that on competitiveness.  Since there are businesses, as I understand it, in the sector which are not involved in these practices, and if they are competitive, then it seems to me that the others can make themselves competitive.</p></speech>

It requests that the Minister, within one month of the passing of the Finance Act, would lay before the D&aacute;il a report on the operation of section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 where gifts or inheritance, in respect of dwelling houses are, in certain circumstances, exempt from capital acquisitions tax.  The section is being used by high net wealth people to pass valuable homes to their children and there have been a number of examples.  I believe the Department has received those examples of houses worth &euro;1 million or so being purchased for children and then using the provisions of section 86 to ensure that over a period of time a very valuable property is passed to the child and that the transfer is tax free.</p><p>In terms of our CAT structures, the Minister increased the threshold for capital acquisitions tax for a transfer from a parent to a child from &euro;280,000 to &euro;310,000 in this year's Act.  The abuse of section 86 can only really be practised by high net worth individuals because only somebody who is very well off could afford to buy a child or a number of children very expensive houses, in some cases for values of up to around &euro;1 million.  Provided they meet the requirements of section 86, which they can arrange, they can pass the asset, which would otherwise incur capital acquisitions tax at the appropriate rate, tax-free to the child.  The purpose of the report would be to set out the context and cost of what has happened here.  This is something which in recent times some wealth managers and tax and legal advisers have advised high net worth individuals to utilise to pass assets to their children without any issues arising in terms of paying capital acquisitions tax.  This is an important public policy issue.  I would like the Minister to agree to have this report prepared and laid before the House.  The Revenue Commissioners are well aware of the situation and I believe such a report could be compiled quickly.</p></speech>

It is a very important one.  On 16 October, I was contacted by a journalist and a concerned citizen about this loophole.  I raised it with the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions on 26 October.  The Taoiseach told me to go away and draw up an amendment to put into the Finance Bill because at that stage it was not on the agenda.  The Department of Finance decided last year it would not reform this rampantly abused exemption from inheritance tax despite knowing for close to a decade that it has been used for tax avoidance by the wealthy.  A specific loophole in Revenue rules allows parents to gift valuable properties to sons and daughters without paying any tax so long as their child has lived in the property for three years and remains there for another six years.  The loophole has in the past been used to transfer properties worth tens of millions of euro each year and has been aggressively used by tax accountants as a mechanism for their wealthiest clients to help shelter money.  Documents obtained by the journalist under freedom of information revealed that both the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have known since at least 2007 that this scheme is subject to systematic abuse.  It is in the public interest to know why this was brought in and when it was changed.  In 2007 there was an investigation done.  It was obvious it was being used by wealthy families for that purpose but it had not been touched.  An e-mail sent from a Department official to Revenue in April this year explained that there was a truncated timespan in which to consider it and so it would be better to postpone.  As part of that discussion, a Department of Finance submission was also circulated which revealed Revenue had already carried out a review of the exemption and its abuse nine years ago.  That briefing note was clear in its findings saying there was strong evidence it was being used by some wealthy individuals to avoid inheritance tax and it is probable that if section 86 relief is not curtailed it will become the vehicle of choice for inheritance tax and passing on wealth to the next generation.  Figures for 2005 show that properties with a value in excess of &euro;1 million had been inherited entirely tax-free on 19 occasions and given as gifts tax-free on four occasions.  This is very serious.  What shocked me when I was approached by the journalist and the concerned citizen was not that we had a tax loophole but that it had been known we have had a tax loophole since 2007.  There is evidence there for it and it was not moved on until I raised it in the D&aacute;il.  Deputies Tommy Broughan and Joan Burton also raised it.  The briefing note in 2005 mentioned two sisters who were both given tax-free gifts of houses, one of which was worth &euro;2.25 million and the other cases involved houses worth up to &euro;10 million.  It stated the system in place now allowed parents to purchase a house for a child to live in and on the death of the parent the child inherits the house tax-free.  It said &quot;To all intents and purposes, this is a mechanism for the tax-free passing on of wealth&quot;.  On occasions, children were renting out the house and living and working abroad.  The exemption generally only benefits high wealth individuals as they are best positioned to purchase a second property outright for the children.  The Revenue Commissioners said:</p><blockquote>[Our] responsibility is for the fair and impartial administration of the tax legislation in place, and responsibility for tax policy rests with the Minister for Finance and the Government.  Revenue has no further comment to make in this regard. </blockquote><p>In response, the journalist approached the Department of Finance about this amendment and it said the investigation by Revenue had conservatively estimated the total loss to the Exchequer at almost &euro;19 million over the period from 2011 to 2015.  It stated that as the investigation had been carried out and a significant modification of the exemption had been included in the Finance Bill, a further historic report would not be warranted.  It is warranted and the Minister has a duty to the people of this country to ensure it happens.  The loophole could have been closed in 2014 when a detailed submission was prepared for the Minister warning him about the tax avoidance.  However, at that point, for reasons not explained in the official records, the Minister opted not to act.  The submission seeking change was bluntly marked &quot;no&quot; in the freedom of information material received, which I have seen.  It has to be looked into.  It is a very serious situation.  Since 2007, the Department of Finance, Revenue and the Minister at the time knew about it.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, knew about it in 2014.  We have to find out exactly what went on. </p></speech>

Earlier this year Revenue carried out an investigation into the use of the exemption as a form of tax-efficient wealth transfer.  Following on from the results of this investigation, I put forward an amendment on Committee Stage, introducing what is now section 51 of the Bill, which will put an end to such arrangements by restricting the exemption to inheritances of dwelling houses.  Parents will no longer be able to gift properties to their children and qualify for the exemption unless that child is a dependent relative, as defined.  Children can, however, continue to inherit the family home and avail of the dwelling house exemption.  In the circumstances, there is nothing to be gained by producing a historical report.</p>  <p>  We have accepted there is a loophole and, on the advice of Revenue, we are closing it in section 51 of the Bill, which was debated fully on Committee Stage and referenced on Report Stage today.  The reason I did not act earlier was because I wanted to establish the facts.  I asked Revenue to do a review and it did a review and found there was some abuse.  For example, I have a note here which says 14 of the properties gifted to children over the five-year period exceeded &euro;1 million in value.  One donor gifted separate properties to four of his children which were valued at &euro;1.7 million, &euro;1 million, &euro;800,000 and &euro;700,000, respectively.  This happened between 2011 and 2013.  There was abuse.  When the abuse was identified and quantified and the Revenue came up with a suggestion on how to deal with this, we moved to close the loophole.  It is closed by section 51 of the Bill before us.</p></speech>

In private discussions with the Department's officials, I suggested restricting it to the principal dwelling.  With regard to Deputy Burton's amendment, there is value in putting a report together as we need to learn from the past.  The information put on the record is new and it is worth quantifying just what has been lost to the Exchequer as a result of this.  It has been reported that a whistleblower has made this information available but there is a concern that this has been known for quite a while.</p>  <p>  The Minister provided an example where it was clear from the data that there was abuse, with one individual gifting high-value properties to children.  Given the conditions that must be satisfied, is there not a case for the anti-avoidance provisions within the Taxes Consolidation Act to have kicked in to stop the abuse?  There is no doubt that such a structure was put in place so that people would avoid inheritance tax being placed on their children in the transfer of an asset.  Remarks have been made that people have been asleep at the wheel and this has been ongoing for quite a while.  Should the appropriate provision of the Taxes Consolidation Act have been used?  In such cases, it is clear that an elaborate structure was used by the individual in question at the very least to avoid paying tax to the Irish Exchequer.  There is a very strong catch-all provision within the Taxes Consolidation Act that should be applied in such circumstances.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us as to whether that happened in that or other cases.</p></speech>

Frankly, it is a very simple and clear example of how people involved with tax avoidance comb through the Finance Acts to see such mechanisms.  This example appeared quite straightforward, as parents could gift &euro;310,000 to their children from a capital acquisitions perspective entirely tax-free.  However, using this mechanism, people could buy very valuable houses for their children and over a period transfer them totally tax-free.</p>  <p>  The Minister has confirmed some additional information.  There has been much talk about the individual who bought four houses for &euro;1 million each for each child.  It is important that the Minister elaborates somewhat on the summary information read into the record of the House.  That is empowering in cases where sometimes people feel it is open to everyone to abuse the tax system.  The vast majority of people in this country pay their taxes and are compliant.  They are citizens who support the paying of taxes to fund health and education services.  It is important to send a message to them that if people abuse the system, we will change it to close that loophole.  For that reason, I urge the Minister to publish the report.</p></speech>

It was only in such a case that a tax benefit would be accrued.  It was opened around 2004 to amount to a gift to children.  The Minister has read some recent information, with the investigation indicating that in 2005, properties with a value in excess of &euro;1 million had been inherited entirely tax free on 19 occasions and given as gifts, tax free, on four occasions.  The Minister was not in the Department at the time, as it would have been under a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.  The change was made under that Minister for Finance, who must have been aware of what was going on.  It remained that way until 2014, when there were again investigations into the process.  The Minister has sat on it since 2014 and not just last year.  There were whistleblowers and the Department and Revenue Commissioners explained what was going on, but nothing was done.  It is really important we get this report done and the people see what went on and how it went on.  We must ensure this does not happen again.  It is not for me to question the political connections of parties like Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and what they might do to support them, as that is another story.  We must find out exactly what went on as it was outrageous.</p></speech>

In the annual finance Bill, we close the gaps.  We do not do it immediately or with a special finance Bill but we do it as we are doing it tonight.  I have no problem in asking the Revenue Commissioners to provide the budgetary committee with a report on the practice or malpractice.  I will get them to do that and have it sent to the clerk of the budgetary committee, the finance committee or both.  I will give Deputies the full information.</p>  <p>  There are always schemes for avoiding or evading tax.  When it comes to a point where the Revenue Commissioners have hard information, they ask for amendments in the law.  They carried out a review earlier this year and told the Department of Finance about it.  We were not quite ready when the Bill was published to have an amendment to deal with this but we did it by means of Committee Stage amendment.  The gap has now been closed.  There is a legitimate scheme whereby family homes may be transferred to adult children caring for their parents or a disabled family member.  This was a very good provision but it allowed a gap for abuse and there is no doubt it occurred when houses were being purchased for children who were not in any kind of a caring or supportive role.  We are not talking about young children when we speak about children.  We are talking about adult members of families getting gifts of property from their parents.  The transfer is from parents to adult children rather than the colloquial use of the term.</p></speech>

Essentially, I am proposing to change the arrangements that are proposed in the Bill in respect of certain people with offshore activities who are seeking to mitigate or avoid tax.  I welcome the moves by the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners to address this situation.  The Bill provides that from 1 May 2017, the penalty mitigation arrangements that are currently available to tax defaulters who make qualifying disclosures to Revenue will not apply firstly where the disclosure relates &quot;directly or indirectly to offshore matters&quot; - believe it or not, we have some offshore tax defaulters in this country - and secondly where the disclosure relates to any other tax default in circumstances in which the person has &quot;before the date the disclosure is made&quot; tax liabilities &quot;that are known or become known&quot; to Revenue and give rise to &quot;a penalty&quot;.</p><p>I will explain the purpose of this amendment, which is in my name and that of Deputy Pearse Doherty.  When an offshore tax defaulter comes to the attention of Revenue Commissioners, it is more than likely that the sums are very significant and potentially very large.  Why should law-abiding and tax-abiding citizens and workers agree to give tax defaulters an extra five months, over and beyond the effective commencement of the Finance Act, to put their affairs in order?  It is possible that tax defaulters will use that time to seek the advice of their current tax advisers or other tax advisers, perhaps with a view to moving their assets further away from the jurisdiction of the Revenue Commissioners and making new arrangements.  For all we know, such arrangements could be effective in avoiding tax.  I am proposing, therefore, to move the date on which this very welcome change in tax law, which will enormously strengthen the hand of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with offshore tax defaulters, will come into effect from 1 May 2017 to 1 January 2017.</p></speech>

I tabled the same amendment on Committee Stage and we had a discussion on it then.  I will summarise the argument for it.  For many years, the finance code has allowed reduced penalties to be imposed on individuals who come forward voluntarily to say they have been involved in this illegal activity.  The Government is saying that after 1 May 2017, they will no longer be able to benefit from reduced penalties.  I suggest that such people have had their chance.  They were given years to come forward.  The inclusion of reduced penalties in a previous Finance Bill many years ago sent out a signal.  The individuals who might benefit from the Minister's decision not to bring this to an end before 1 May 2017 have so far decided not to come forward with their hands up and come clean about the tax evasion they have been involved in.  They have decided to ride it out.  The idea that we would make a legislative provision that will allow this illegal activity to continue with reduced penalties until a date that is eight months away is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  It is quite interesting that no date was provided for when we were talking about the flat-rate addition in the context of VAT.  I took the Minister at his word when he said that time would be made available.  The reality is that under the tax code, the flat-rate addition could be taken from the entire sector within a number of months of this legislation being passed and certainly before 1 May.  At the same time, we are telling these tax defaulters that they have a number of months to come forward before the increased penalties will apply.  This simple amendment proposes to bring the date forward to 1 January.  I listened to the Government's arguments and considered changing the date to 1 March.  The Minister mentioned that it would be difficult for these people to get their accountants to put their work together, but that is their problem.  I think the State has been overly generous to individuals who have been involved in illegal activity and thereby denied the people of this State revenue that should have been paid many years ago.  Therefore, I am continuing to propose that the relevant date should be 1 January, which is still a number of weeks away, and to recommend that the Government and the other parties in the Chamber should support this series of amendments.</p></speech>

The first thing that comes to mind when we are discussing this stuff is why on earth there were penalty mitigation arrangements for tax defaulters in the first place.  Why should people who are engaged in not paying tax be given special deals, or the option of special deals, if they agree to pay tax?  I welcome the Government's decision to change the situation by closing down that possibility, but I do not understand why it feels the need to give tax defaulters months to put their affairs in order.  I suggest we should move as quickly as possible to get the tax that is owed.  I do not understand why we would have any concern for their need to get their affairs in order, to talk to their accountants or to do anything else.  When people owe tax moneys to the State and its people, we should simply get it as soon as possible.</p></speech>

As I pointed out on Committee Stage, this measure is in no way a concession to those who have evaded tax through the use of offshore accounts or failed to disclose offshore assets or income sources.  On the contrary, it is a significant withdrawal of an incentive - the opportunity to significantly mitigate penalties and avoid publication in the list of defaulters by making a voluntary disclosure to Revenue - that is currently available to all tax defaulters.  Offshore defaulters will now face a harsher regime than those whose defaults occur exclusively within the State.  From 1 May 2017, there will be no opportunity for offshore defaulters to make a voluntary disclosure of their defaults.  This measure was put forward on the basis that, with new sources of information coming on stream, Revenue will have access to an unprecedented level of information about financial assets held around the world.  As the disclosure regime is an incentive for taxpayers to disclose matters to Revenue, it makes little sense to offer incentives to tax defaulters to tell Revenue what it will already know from its sister tax administrations around the world.</p>  <p>  While some automatic exchange of information data is already flowing to Revenue under the first directive on administrative co-operation and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, further rich seams of new information will not begin to flow under the OECD's common reporting standards and the second directive on administrative co-operation until September 2017.  In that context, it makes sense to offer people a limited chance to disclose what will otherwise become known later next year.  We have estimated a yield of &euro;30 million from the measure in the budgetary arithmetic for 2017 as a result of the expected increase in the number of disclosures relating to offshore income and assets in the period before implementation.</p><p>If insufficient time is allowed for the initiative to work, then any change in the date could prove counterproductive.<br/><br/>Finally, I also emphasise that the six-month timeframe is in line with the length of time afforded to individuals to respond to other similar initiatives in the past.  On balance, I would consider that the date of 1 May next should be left unchanged and, therefore, I do not propose to accept these amendments.<br/><br/>I am, in effect, following the advice from Revenue, which recommended 1 May as the date.  I ask the House to accept Revenue's advice on this occasion.</p></speech>

The Finance Bill was published some weeks ago and there is still have more than a month to go before 1 January.  If someone who is an offshore tax defaulter has gone to such trouble, then it is almost certain that the moneys and assets - and the trade, if any - involved may well be significant.  The Minister will be aware of that.</p>  <p>  I welcome that Revenue is now utilising the new sources of information that have become available in the recent past.  I also welcome that it has been so active, as this information has become available, in pursuing those who are really giving two fingers to taxpayers, even those on relatively low earnings, who pay both PRSI and USC.  Such taxpayers deserve, as far as the D&aacute;il is concerned, this particular mitigation of or reduction in penalties.  In fact, those affected are being given an amnesty which has been extended for an extra four months instead of just the roughly two and a half months' notice that has been made available from the time of the budget and the publication of the Finance Bill.  I do not see any good reason why the period should be extended.  I am of the view that 1 January would be a perfectly operable date for Revenue to bring in the new arrangements.</p></speech>

Revenue believes, from experience, that a more entrenched cohort of defaulters will fail to come forward but that by getting a significant number of offshore defaulters out of the way in this period, it will then be able to focus its resources on the task of vigorously pursuing the cohort to which I refer.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has expressed a serious concern that shortening the timeframe to a date earlier than May could prove counterproductive.  Tax defaulters need time to assemble the necessary information to make proper disclosures and if they do not have the time to do so, they will have no incentive to do anything other than to wait for, and hope that, Revenue will fail to find them for some reason.  This, in turn, would mean a far less productive use of Revenue resources because it would be obliged to pursue every offshore case individually.</p>  <p>  I advise the House of the considered view of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  The date was not picked arbitrarily.  It is the Revenue Commissioners' advice that 1 May is the most appropriate date.</p></speech>

Briefly, by way of background, section 56 amends section 1086 of  the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which relates to the publication of the names of tax defaulters.  The purpose of the amendments made by section 56 is to ensure that the scheme of publication in respect of tax defaulters operates as intended and clarifies the portion of any settlement sum that may be published in circumstances where the settlement sum comprises an amount relating to a qualifying disclosure and an amount relating to matters not subject to such a disclosure.  As a result of the changes proposed in section 56, only the portion relating to the other matters will be publishable.</p><p>The reason for these further amendments is primarily to correct a technical drafting error made in amending the section on Committee Stage and, in doing so, to clarify aspects of the section.  Specifically, amendment No. 112 is necessary to remove an incorrect reference to subsection (2A) in paragraph (b)(ii) of new subsection (2D), as inserted on Committee Stage.  It also provides, on a  stand-alone basis and in a much clearer fashion, that where Revenue accepts payment of the full amount of a claim in circumstances where there is both a qualifying disclosure and other tax defaults, it will be deemed to have accepted the part of the full amount that relates to the other defaults on foot of an agreement with the taxpayer to refrain from initiating court proceedings, etc.  This will allow the name of the defaulter to be published in respect of the other tax defaults once the publication criteria are met in respect of those defaults.  The amendment will thus allow new subsection (2D) to operate as intended.  It is also necessary to make the existing subsection (2A) subject to new subsection (2D) and amendment No. 111 achieves that.</p><p>I commend these amendments to the House.</p></speech>

The publication of the Panama papers by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has been a very significant event in regard to highlighting the extent to which very wealthy people - families, individuals and groups - can make arrangements through various tax havens throughout the world to hide assets offshore from their home county, including Ireland.</p><p>We have had no information from the Revenue Commissioners about the extent to which they have sought to find details in regard to Irish tax residents, Irish citizens and people associated with Irish companies who may be availing of the arrangements highlighted by the Panama papers.  We know that other countries have done this, including Germany, which is often used as a country of reference by this country in regard to having a tax system which is fair and understandable to people in that country.  On a number of occasions, the Revenue Commissioners have expressed their desire to pursue individuals who have been using offshore tax havens, notwithstanding the fact they are liable to tax in this country.</p><p>It is very important that the message again goes out to compliant taxpayers, particularly people on middle and low incomes who are meeting all of their obligations in accordance with the law, that we will cease to tolerate in this country people who engage in offshore tax avoidance and evasion, thereby reducing the funding for critical services ranging from education and health to social services.  I believe it would be important for citizens to have available to them such a report.  As I said, I know from previous statements made on a number of occasions by the Revenue Commissioners that they are anxious to deal with the kind of tax evasion disclosed by the Panama papers.  This is something every western European country, including Ireland, needs to be worried about and needs to address.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</p></speech>

The release of the so-called Panama papers earlier this year showed how defaulters use offshore structures and accounts to avoid paying tax.  International developments and agreements are leading to the better sharing of information.  To maximise the use of this information, I have brought forward amendments in section 55 of the Bill to the penalty mitigation regime currently available to tax defaulters who make a qualifying disclosure to Revenue, which will ensure that defaulters who have used offshore accounts or assets in their evasion will find themselves in a very difficult position if they do not come forward quickly to regularise their affairs with Revenue.  We have just discussed the question of the 1 May date as against the 1 January date, so the House is familiar with the considerations in this regard.</p>  <p>  While I could ask my officials to prepare a report as suggested, I am not sure it would add much additional value.  In recent weeks the Deputy asked a parliamentary question about the status of my Department's work with the Revenue Commissioners in tackling the tax evasion uncovered in the Panama papers.  I do not propose to repeat the entire reply, which is, of course, now in the public domain, but, in summary, I was advised by Revenue that it has been to the forefront in acting against the use of offshore accounts, trusts and structures to evade tax liabilities.  All told, Revenue's work in regard to all offshore accounts and other financial product investigations has, to date, resulted in the recovery of &euro;2.8 billion in tax, interest and penalties.  In line with its active approach to identifying and confronting those who try to escape their tax responsibilities, Revenue has also advised me that it is examining the information that has become available through the Panama papers revelations, and, in addition, that it has requested access to any elements of that documentation that could be of relevance to its work against tax evasion and avoidance.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the Deputy will recall the recent appearance by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners before the Committee of Public Accounts.  He noted that certain elements of the papers had been placed on the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' website and that Revenue was analysing named Irish persons and entities.  He also noted that Revenue is involved in the Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration, JITSIC.  Therefore, any information that Revenue had has been put in the public domain in one way or another in recent times.  People who had offshore accounts are being given the opportunity to face up to their malpractice between now and 1 May.  If Revenue believes that, through international agreements, it is going to get new streams of information in September 2017, it will be some time in the fall of next year that Revenue will be in a position to provide the kind of report the Deputy has in mind.</p>  <p>  I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.  We will return to it when people voluntarily come forward to Revenue arising from the Panama papers between now and 1 May and, later, when what Revenue describes as new streams of information come through the new international agreements that Revenue has entered into.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-23a.956" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="01:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112300100#YYYY00400"><p>I want to press the amendment.  I am not satisfied Revenue has sufficient resources to actually go after the disclosures relating to Ireland that I am quite sure are within the Panama papers.  Ireland is not an offshore tax haven, although there are many in this House who would claim it is.  We have tax law which is enforced in this country and that is critically important, particularly given people who may be hostile to Ireland's interests are often anxious to portray it as some kind of a tax haven.  It is very important that we address issues like this and that we use the work of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on the Panama papers.</p>  <p>  I would like an assurance from the Minister that Revenue has sufficient resources.  Tracking what has been disclosed by the papers is quite detailed work but other countries have taken rapid action and it has yielded a very interesting haul of defaulters in a whole range of fields.  Given that people buy international tax arrangements which involve fraud, evasion and malpractice, as the Minister has said, I think the House deserves an assurance from the Minister that Revenue will have sufficient resources to go after this.  Certainly, for law-abiding taxpayers in this country, it will be an enormous comfort that people who have been avoiding paying their fair share will from now on contribute properly.</p></speech>

It has carried out an analysis of the ICIG offshore leaks database to identify all cases with an association with Ireland.  A total of 261 individuals, 245 addresses and 51 intermediaries have been identified.  The individuals, companies and intermediaries identified are being profiled using internal systems and open sources and all appropriate inquiries will be made.</p>  <p>  Revenue is participating in two JITSIC sub-groups, the first dealing with non-financial intermediaries; and the second in relation to the exchange of information on engagement.  The aim of this network is to agree concrete actions the tax administrations can take in response to the ICIG information and leading to a multilateral and co-ordinated approach to the data.</p>  <p>  When Revenue committed to pursue these issues, it was allocated an extra &euro;5 million in the budget, as colleagues will recall.  Members will remember that on budget day Revenue was allocated an extra &euro;5 million so that it is adequately resourced to pursue the Panama Papers and other untoward tax evasion problems that emerge.</p></speech>
