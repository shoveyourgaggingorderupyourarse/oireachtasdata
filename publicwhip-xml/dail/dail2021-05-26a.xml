In 2010 a tentative list of sites for designation to UNESCO world heritage status was put forward by this State.  Unfortunately, nothing very much happened after that with regard to that tentative list.  During my time as a Deputy in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il, the D&aacute;il before last, I took the opportunity to visit UNESCO to hear what was happening with the list and the body was surprised to hear from somebody from Ireland, such was the lack of communication or follow-up from here.  I am glad that Ireland is now putting forward a new tentative list and I very much hope there will be a degree of energy involved in that that was sorely absent over the past decade or so.</p><p>The 2010 list contained a grouping of early monastic sites, namely, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Durrow, Kells and Monasterboice.  Fortunately, any UNESCO proposal or designation for a world heritage list has to be accompanied by local buy-in and support and that is something to which UNESCO very much looks.  Unfortunately, in the case of the early monastic site grouping, Offaly County Council for one reason or another were not very interested in having Clonmacnoise designated.  Of the six sites that I mentioned, most people would agree that Clonmacnoise from an archaeological perspective, or even perhaps an architectural one, is the most interesting.  Due to that site not being progressed and the lack of appetite from Offaly to do so, the entire group did not progress.</p><p>Similarly, there was a western stone forts designation which included D&uacute;n Aonghusa, which would probably be the most well-known of them, Cahercommaun, in Killinaboy, north Clare, and three other forts, including two in County Kerry.  As Kerry County Council, for one reason or another, was not very interested in advancing its designation, that grouping fell.  There were other single designations such as the Burren and Georgian Dublin.  It is hardly surprising that Georgian Dublin did not proceed given Dublin City Council&rsquo;s propensity to destroy its Georgian culture at most available opportunities and Senator McDowell has recently commented on that.  While everybody likes to see contemporary architecture, when there is existing architecture of world merit it should be preserved.  I am not suggesting that one builds a <i>faux</i>replica of it in any way, as once it is gone it is gone.  There was for a very long time, and perhaps even now, a lack of awareness on the part of Dublin City Council of the importance of preserving what is there.</p><p>Returning to the main topic, a new list is being developed.  One of the UNESCO criteria is: &ldquo;to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance&quot;.  In that context, Kerry County Council is moving forward with the Valentia Transatlantic Cable Station as a proposal because it was a tangible moment in time when global telecommunications was born and I wish it luck with that.</p><p>There are sites in County Clare in particular, Inis Cealtra and Inis Cathaigh, and these sites are linked with the birth or nascence of a European civilisation, namely, that period in time, the early Middle Ages and the Carolingian court, when the idea of Europe was born.  Whether Europe had a Christian tradition or not was an issue of controversy when the constitution for Europe was being framed.</p> <p>Whether one agrees with that or not, it is indisputable that the idea of Europe was born in the early Middle Ages through the work of a network of monks and they had their origins in monasteries, including Inis Cealtra and Inis Cathaigh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="09:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600004#B00200"><p>I thank Deputy McNamara for raising this important matter.  In keeping with UNESCO advice to review the Tentative List every ten years, my Department launched a call for applications to Ireland's Tentative List of world heritage properties in January 2019.  The closing date for receipt of applications is 30 June 2021.  My Department has invited all local authorities to submit applications to it with respect to properties of natural and-or cultural heritage within their areas of responsibility which may meet the requirements for inclusion on the Tentative List within the Department.</p>  <p>  My Department's national monument's service has been liaising closely with local authorities that have expressed an interest in having a property within their county boundaries included on the revised Tentative List, providing advice and guidance on an ongoing basis.  The Department has also organised outreach events in conjunction with the International Council on Monuments and Sites Ireland and has provided feedback on various projects to all of the 31 local authorities.  My Department's policy for the application has been sponsored by relevant local authorities or other statutory bodies in order to ensure continuity throughout the process.  Individuals and organisations are encouraged to apply in collaboration with the local authorities.  The role of the local authority in the process is crucial in order to facilitate public consultation and wider stakeholder engagement, particularly in light of the requirement under the UNESCO operational guidelines for a participatory planning and stakeholder consultation throughout the process.</p>  <p>  For a property to proceed to nomination for world heritage status, it first must be placed on the Tentative List for at least one year.  Immediately after the June 2021 closing date, my Department will conduct an initial screening of all applications received before transmitting them to an expert advisory group for independent assessment and accreditation.  The expert advisory group will make recommendations to my Department on the properties that should be included in the revised Tentative List.  As a focal point for Ireland as a state party of The World Heritage Convention, my Department will make a final decision in regard to the Tentative List.  In assessing the applications received, the expert advisory group will evaluate a property's likelihood to progress to nomination and inscription on the world heritage list based on the ability to demonstrate outstanding universal value, as alluded to by the Deputy, meaning that its significance is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations to all humanity.</p>  <p>  To demonstrate universal value a property must meet at least one of the world heritage criterion, the relevant conditions of integrity and-or authenticity and there must be mechanisms in place to provide for its long-term protection and management.  The presence of robust local stakeholder support for the project is also considered a crucial element of the viability for a property's nomination to world heritage status.  We anticipate receipt of the following five applications: The Burren, Glendalough Monastic City; the Passage Tomb Landscapes of Sligo, the Royal Sites and Valentia Transatlantic Cable Station.  My Department does not anticipate receipt of an application with respect to the early medieval monastic sites, which has been part of the previous Tentative List, although, as stated, a standalone application for Glendalough Monastic City is expected to be received.  The expert advisory group will then provide guidance as to the feasibility of future world heritage projects in respect of sites on the previous Tentative List for which updated applications are not submitted under the current round.  This would, of course, continue to be subject to the requirement of strong local stakeholder support for the projects in question.</p>  <p>  I look forward to receipt of applications for inclusion on the Tentative List over the months ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="09:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600004#B00300"><p>What the Minister of State said in regard to the process of application differs somewhat from the published criteria.  The Minister of State said that applications must be made in conjunction with a local authority, but under the published criteria, any group can put forward a proposal.  If one was a lip-smacking lawyer looking to judicially review a process, the Minister of State has given fertile grounds just now.  One cannot publish one set of criteria and then apply a different set of criteria, which seems to be case.</p><p>The Minister of State clearly said that he anticipates certain applications, but does not anticipate others.  Is this a done deal?  As I said of the early monastic sites, I readily acknowledge Clonmacnoise would be universally accepted to be the most important.  Glendalough is a beautiful place, as is Holy Island, but neither of them is quite Clonmacnoise.  The big difference is that Glendalough is situated in the constituency of two Cabinet Ministers and Inis Cealtra is not situate in the constituency of a Cabinet Minister.  That, of course, should not be anywhere near the criteria.  It should be based on universal criteria and universal values.  This is about protecting sites of universal importance.</p><p>The French political scientist Olivier Roy spoke about a European civilisation.  Former President Clinton, who addressed this House, not in this particular building but in another that we might some day go back to, spoke about Ireland's role in saving civilisation.  A book was written about it that may or may not be historically accurate.  It is generally accepted that Irish monks and the network of monasteries came out of Ireland - I refer to O'Clery's work in the 16th and 17th centuries, <i>The Twelve Apostles of Ireland</i>which, again may not be historically accurate - and the idea of the re-evangelisation of Europe from Ireland at the time of Charlemagne is of universal significance.  There are monasteries, including two in Clare, Inis Cathaigh and Inis Cealtra.</p></speech>

There is absolutely no interference.  This is a robust, independent process.  I made clear in my speech that individuals and organisations are encouraged to make applications in collaboration with the local authority.  The local authority places structure on any process.  Local authorities are a key focal point throughout the 31 regions in our State.  They are needed to give direction.  I make no apologies in that regard.</p>  <p>  To summarise, my Department is currently engaged in a review of a Tentative List.  It is necessary for a property to be on the Tentative List before it can proceed to nomination for world heritage status.  My Department has been liaising closely with interested parties and has been providing advice and support on preparation of their applications.  An expert advisory group has been formed to assess the potential of each property to demonstrate outstanding universal value and to determine if there is robust stakeholder support for the project.  The expert advisory group will formalise its recommendations to me on the composition of Ireland's Tentative List.  My Department will make final decisions in regard to inclusion on the Tentative List and the suitability of a property to proceed to world heritage property nomination.  The World Heritage Convention, on the advice of the advisory body, makes the decision to inscribe the world heritage property on the list.  The Deputy will note the process outlined is independent and robust.  Currently, no final applications have been received.  However, as alluded to earlier, five applications are anticipated.  The viability for future inclusion of the seven properties on the 2010 Tentative List, including the early monastic sites, will be reviewed by the expert advisory group.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600004#B01300"><p>That would be my intention.  I wish to speak for people who are living in private rented accommodation throughout this State, much of which is substandard.  Many of these people are on local authority housing lists.  I do not want to be overtly political about this or seek to score points.  I am not raising this issue for the purposes of putting a clip up on Facebook.  I merely wish to raise the matter on the basis of the increasing number of people contacting with me who are living in what can be only described as hovels which have passed muster for the purposes of the housing assistance payment, HAP, but in respect of which there does not appear to be a proper inspection regime.  I am not seeking to apportion blame.  I merely wish to speak for these people.</p> <p>In one instance, a family came to tell me about mould and damp on the walls.  There are all sorts of public health issues arising from that, with children presenting with severe respiratory illnesses as a result of living in substandard accommodation.  If the inspection regime was buttressed and kick-started, that would help the situation.</p> <p> In a parliamentary reply to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, in respect of Cork, it was stated that up to September 2020 there were 611 inspections carried out.  A total of 601 improvement letters were issued on foot of those inspections.  Similarly, up to September 2020, in Cork city 434 inspections were carried out, 96 improvement letters were issued and one improvement notice was issued.  The local authorities are at the pin of their collars in trying to manage this service.  It is unfair to expect them to do more with less in terms of the number of employees who are tasked with this job, in respect of whole-time equivalence as to personnel.</p> <p> In the absence of an adequate supply of social housing stock - a supply issue which will pertain for the foreseeable future &ndash; the inspection regime should be robust.  If a landlord acts immorally or unethically in relation to his or her tenants, and does not meet the terms and conditions of the legislation as laid down by this House, the inspection regime should be robust and enforce the legislation so that landlords carry out their obligations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="09:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600005#C00200"><p>I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising this matter.  I appreciate the genuine way in which he put his concerns forward.  I accept that those concerns are valid.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019 specify requirements on a range of matters such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and the safety of gas, oil and electrical supply.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure their properties comply with these regulations.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  The strategy for the rental sector recognises the need for additional resources to be provided to local authorities to aid increased inspections of properties, as the Deputy alluded to in terms of the figures he quoted from the reply to the relevant parliamentary question.  In fact, significant and increased Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities since 2018.  Since then, the amount of money allocated has increased by 300%.  I accept demand had increased also.  In 2021, my Department provided &euro;10 million of funding, up from &euro;2.5 million three years earlier.  The aim is to enable local authorities to target 25% of all local rental properties for an annual inspection.  Significant progress has been made across the sector and the number of inspections has more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019.  However, given the need for inspectors to enter tenants' homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have greatly impacted on private rental inspections.  The County and City Management Association's current guidance does not permit rental inspections during levels 4 and 5 restrictions.  This is to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors.</p>  <p>  On-site inspections fell, understandably, to just over 24,000 last year.  However, the local authority sector has been innovative in its response to the pandemic in this area.  Local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections over recent months and my Department has been happy to facilitate this initiative across the country, most especially with appropriate funding for these inspections.  Dublin City Council has led the initiative, which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic and video evidence by email.  Tenants have been invited to raise any issues or instances of non-compliance that they are aware of and the council reserves the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection, when it is safe to do so.  While virtual inspection systems, at present, have certain challenges and limitations, they have offered a way of providing a standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic restrictions we are in.  I am optimistic that they can and will continue to form part of a newly enhanced post-pandemic inspection regime.</p>  <p>  Like the rest of the country, the sector awaits the full opening of our economy.  My Department continues to work closely with local authorities to make sure that once it does, they will be ready to return quickly to their traditional inspection regimes augmented by virtual inspections, so that it can go towards reaching the ambitious national target we have set.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600005#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I welcome the fact that this is on the Department&rsquo;s agenda in the context of providing increased funding.  I would argue, however, that while an increase of &euro;10 million from &euro;2.5 million is dramatic, when one factors in a county like Cork, I am not sure how far &euro;10 million would go if it was extrapolated out across all counties.  I ask that this be looked at again.</p>  <p>  We all know landlords; they live among us.  Ninety-nine per cent of the landlords I have met are very good and decent people who want to ensure that their tenants are protected and that they live in accommodation of a proper standard.  They are very proud of the fact they have long-term tenancies and agreements with letters, and so on.  However, there are a small minority who I would describe as slum landlords.  In one instance, someone approached me last week to say they had asked for a simple repair and were told that if they did not like it, that they could sling their hook.  The landlord in that case is in receipt of a supplement or subvention from the State in respect of the property involved.  That is the mere point.</p>  <p>  There is a moral and ethical argument here in the context of tenants who cannot get local authority houses at present because of a lack of supply.  These are tenants of long standing.  Some are happy to maintain their arrangements if the repairs can be carried out.  There needs to be a follow up for those people as to the inspection regime.  I am very conscious that we are in this pandemic, however, I make the case and highlight the fact that the inspection regime needs to be kick-started as soon as we can.</p></speech>

His point is very well made and his concerns are very valid; I fully accept that.  As I have said, there is a target for 25%, more needs to be done and we are trying to achieve that with increased funding, albeit in very constrained circumstances due to the pandemic.  My Department has increased funding.  As I said, the current &euro;10 million budget should allow the sector to inspect almost one in four of all rental properties each year.  The regulations also empower local authorities to enforce these standards through financial and other penalties, with the aim of trying to ensure that everyone in our country can live in a high-quality home.  The Deputy referred to very vulnerable individuals and it is our absolute will and intention to protect them, and that is why we are increasing funding.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has also greatly impacted on rental inspections but, hopefully, it will be safe for rent inspectors to conduct on-site inspections very soon.  I commend the local authorities for participating in the new initiative, the virtual inspection pilot project, which saw some 14,000 conducted last year, especially in Dublin City Council, which led the initiative.  The support of local authority enforcement of minimum standards in rental accommodation will continue to be an important element of our rental market strategy.  It will be included in the upcoming whole of Government approach housing for all strategy, in which we will commit to continued investment as well as strategic development of the area for the benefit of tenants and landlords alike.  It is very important that this is a key focus of Government.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's input today is key in guiding us by articulating very vulnerable positions within his community and we will work as hard as we can to ensure this will be increased.  As Minister of State with responsibility for local authorities, I will also keep in close contact with them on this matter.</p></speech>

They are shouting for a complete rethink regarding the narrative of miscarriage and how we care for those who experience them.</p> <p>Some 14,000 women in Ireland experience miscarriage every year, one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage and one in ten women will experience it during their lifetime.  This is a completely foreseeable event and yet we do not provide for it in our employment law.  We ask women to go out and work but we do not provide for this completely foreseeable event to give them certainty that, when this very sad event happens, an event which is often very sudden and shocking, they will have certainty in their employment.  <br/><br/>It is important to say that many different employers respond very compassionately and give women space and time to process the miscarriage, both physically and emotionally.  Let us set out the physical realities on the floor of the House on behalf of women who have experienced this.  It is important that we acknowledge them.  It can take a number of days and can involve a medical process and admission to hospital.  A surgical or medically induced procedure may be required.  It involves a physical trauma and an emotional trauma.  Those things take time.  Women, who are often provided with compassionate leave by employers, deserve certainty and deserve to know that leave will be available.  <br/><br/>There are multiple ways of doing this in legislation.  There could be an amendment to Part II of the Parental Leave Act 1998.  The Labour Party has taken a different approach involving the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  There are many different ways of doing this.  The <i>Zeitgeist</i>around this is now changing.  We need to see action and a response from the Government.  We need to put the reality of women's lives on the Statute Book and to protect them and give them certainty.  We also need to rethink medical care and the medical narrative in this area but I will now hand over to my colleague, Deputy Higgins, and I may follow up on that later.</p></speech>

If people do not believe they do, it is because those women and couples have not shared that experience with them, which is okay.  That is why so many couples wait until the three-month mark to announce their news.  The sad reality is that one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage.  As a State, we give women who miscarry towards the end of their pregnancy the time and the space they need to come to terms with that but we offer no such support to women who lose their pregnancies early on.  They have to use their annual leave.  They have to get a vague doctor's certificate or they have to go into work and pretend that nothing has happened, which is worse.  That is not fair.  My colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, shared her experience yesterday.  In the D&aacute;il Chamber, she told of her experience of five miscarriages.  Her journey is, unfortunately, all too common but it is not talked about generally or in chambers such as this.</p>  <p>  We hear young women raising this issue in the Seanad and, in New Zealand, a young female Prime Minister is leading on the issue.  That is because it is up to women such as us, who have platforms such as this, to speak up for other women who suffer these losses of pregnancy and who cannot effect change in the way we can.  Will the Minister hear us?  Will he support these women and provide for miscarriage leave for women who suffer early miscarriages?</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to come before the House to discuss this important subject.  The emotional impact of pregnancy loss is absolutely tremendous.  Unfortunately, it is experienced by many.  There has been a very welcome move in society towards greater openness about miscarriage and pregnancy loss and the heartbreak it can bring to women and families.  I am thankful that we are all moving on from a time when such trauma had to be shouldered in silence.  It is, however, very clear that parents who have gone through this experience still do not benefit from the kinds of compassionate supports that should be in place at such an incredibly difficult time.</p>  <p>  The Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004 provide that an employee is entitled to full maternity leave in the case of stillbirth after 24 weeks and the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 also provides for paternity leave in this situation.  However, there is currently no provision for the loss of a pregnancy prior to this point, despite the devastation it can bring to parents.  The Government fully recognises the need to assist parents in this difficult situation and on Monday this week it agreed not to oppose the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill in the Seanad, the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021, which provides for leave in these circumstance.  I acknowledge and thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this important contribution to this debate.  I also note and acknowledge the very genuine and personal contributions from Senators that we heard in the course of that debate.  </p>  <p>  While there are some difficulties with the Labour Party's Bill, which the Minister of State, Deputy English, outlined in his contribution, the Government recognises that this is an issue which must be addressed.  In this regard, my Department and I have committed to undertake research to examine how best to support working parents who have suffered a miscarriage.  We need to understand how we can meet the need for time off from work.  This may be through paid leave, additional unpaid leave or other measures required by parents who have suffered a miscarriage.  This research will inform Government policy and help us to develop a practical, workable response through leave or other supports.  We have seen international examples of this type of leave being introduced, particularly in New Zealand, and I will examine those options in the context of the research being undertaken.</p>  <p>  This is an issue that affects both parents and supports should be available to both.  We want to facilitate parents having this conversation with their employers, recognising that they have suffered a bereavement and need time to deal with their loss.  Reproductive health should be supported in the workplace and employees should not feel concerned that an honest conversation about their loss or their reproductive health challenges will disadvantage them in any way.  I am sure most employers would deal with people in this situation in a sensitive manner, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill has alluded to, but a statutory entitlement may provide more encouragement towards openness.</p>  <p>  I again thank the Deputies for raising this Topical Issue matter and I thank the Labour Party for introducing its Private Members' Bill.  I look forward to continuing to engage with Members of the House as we undertake this research and subsequently make proposals.</p></speech>

There are a number of advantages to placing this on the Statute Book.  It recognises that the issue is a practical one that affects people and that a legislative response is appropriate.  Another great advantage is that it allows people to simply call their HR department and invoke their right, or ask their partners to do it on their behalf.  It would be automatic and there would be certainty to the matter, which is really important.  Many of us have had miscarriages.  I have had a miscarriage.  It can take a long time.  One can see on a screen one week that things are not going well and then have this confirmed the following week.  One may need to be admitted to hospital.  These things can take time and they are very emotionally draining.  <i>The Lancet </i>this month has a brilliant editorial on how we think about miscarriage and how that narrative could be reconceived.  It says that, for too long, miscarriage has been minimised and often dismissed and that dealing with a combination of private grief, misconceptions and guilt can lead to women putting more pressure on themselves than is necessary.  I thank the Minister for his response and invite him to invite me to help him with his research, as somebody in the D&aacute;il who has been through this.</p></speech>

He recently extended the period of parental leave to five weeks for both parents, which is really welcome and a great way of supporting modern families.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill has said, we now have an opportunity to further show our support for parents by introducing paid leave for early pregnancy loss.  It is important to acknowledge, as the Minister has done, that while it is a woman's body that experiences the physical loss, the emotional loss is experienced by both parents.  I strongly believe that the State needs to do more to support both parents through this.  Paid miscarriage leave for the woman is a great place to start.</p></speech>

As Deputy Higgins alluded to, we have acted to enhance rights and protections for families, particularly for women, through the parental leave extension about which she spoke and ongoing work to implement legislation on the gender pay gap, through the proposals we are examining with regard to extending breaks for breastfeeding and by introducing, for the first time, paid domestic violence leave.</p> <p>The Government therefore has a strong track record in recognising the protections families need and particularly the protections needed for women in the workplace, in the home and wherever else those protections are needed and in acting.  It is important we do the research.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill alluded to the fact that there is a significant body of information out there.  We use that to ensure that the proposals we bring forward are properly targeted and will be impactful for women who have experienced a miscarriage and for their partners and families.  It is right that we take that bit of time to do the research, but I am very happy to engage with both Deputies or indeed any other Deputy or Senator who wants to engage on this issue because it is really important we have these open conversations on the floors of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Even in doing this, we encourage the wider conversation about miscarriages in workplaces and in society.</p></speech>

Last week my attention was drawn to a very serious and concerning issue, namely the discovery of black grass on a Teagasc plot in Oak Park, Carlow.  To help myself understand more about this I listened to a very informative podcast on the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>website discussing the issue.  For those who are not aware, black grass is an invasive weed which spreads very easily and very quickly.  It can be found in a variety of settings but the setting of most concern is that of cereal crops.  It is a major problem in the UK and can have a devastating impact on crop yields for tillage farmers.  Teagasc made the discovery of black grass in a commercial wild flower mixture which was growing on one of its plots.  The major issue here is the word &quot;commercial&quot;, meaning essentially that anyone could have, and possibly may have, bought similar mixtures of commercial wild flower seeds containing black grass.  We would be incredibly lucky if the only commercial mixture imported into Ireland contaminated with black grass just happened to be bought by Teagasc.  Logic would suggest that this is unlikely and that many people have imported seed mixtures containing black grass from the UK.</p><p>Black grass is a major problem because it spreads so quickly and is herbicide-resistant.  It is estimated that black grass costs the UK economy nearly &pound;400 million and 800,000 tonnes of lost harvest every year.  If we allow this weed to establish itself here, crop farming will be severely damaged.  This is a very concerning development because under the pollinator plan, which is a Government-led initiative that aims to help bees, other pollinating insects and our wider biodiversity, local groups such as schools, community groups, Tidy Towns groups etc., may be importing wild flower seeds to use as part of their efforts.  If black grass is contained in commercially available mixtures, there is an obvious and major risk of its being imported and sown unintentionally right across the country, having a potentially devastating impact on crops.  This weed can spread very easily and rapidly and we must do all we can to stop it.  In theory, the pollinator plan is a great idea but we must be alert to unintended consequences.  If we are to encourage people to sow wild flower seeds and other related plants, it is imperative that we have our ducks in a row and that we have joined-up thinking when it comes to certification and regulation.  It is to be hoped the discovery in Carlow was a one-off exception but we need to be vigilant.</p><p>There are at least two areas on which the Government can act.  First, the Department needs to take this very seriously and put steps in place to raise awareness among those who have imported wild flower seeds and steps to prevent black grass from destroying crops.  Second, I understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has no certification process for imported wild flower seeds.  We are also importing straw which is not being tested for black grass.  We cannot on the one hand encourage community groups and schools to sow wild flower seeds for biodiversity while, on the other hand, fail to ensure that such seeds being imported are not contaminated.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response on the matter.</p></speech>

In total, this legislation is implemented through 12 directives and a number of associated regulations.  The legislation is applicable to the main agricultural crops, covering fodder plants, cereals, beet, potatoes, oilseed crops, vegetables, fruit, ornamental plants and forestry.  The legislation is not applicable to wild flower seeds.  While the legislation covers certain weed and disease species, there are no specific controls relating to black grass.  The number of weed species covered in the legislation is very limited.  Seed from third countries is certified and labelled under OECD rules.  Although there is no specific tolerance for black grass in the OECD rules, they do state, "Crops containing an excessive number of weeds shall be rejected" and "The seed crop should be reasonably free from weeds and other crop species, especially those whose seeds may be difficult to separate from the seed crop during seed processing".</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2021 the UK-GB has been certifying seed according to OECD certification rules and has stated it will certify seed according to EU standards for the next two years.  Member states may implement voluntary controls for seed certified in their own territories but cannot impose those controls for seed certified in another member state.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a voluntary agreement with the Irish Seed Trade Association to impose zero tolerance for black grass, wild oats and sterile brome in cereal crops intended for certification in Ireland.  My officials are in contact with the Irish Seed Trade Association with a view to extending this voluntary agreement to include wild flower seeds propagated in Ireland and imported wild flower species formulated into mixtures in Ireland.  My Department strongly advises that only locally sourced wildflower seeds be planted and my officials are engaging with the industry to ensure locally produced seed is free of black grass.</p>  <p>  In simple terms, my Department is taking swift and strong action to control what we can control in the short term, which is what is within our system in Ireland and the voluntary code that has worked very well for us in the past.  The code is actually at a higher level than the international code, a higher level than the OECD rules and a higher level than EU regulations because we have zero tolerance.  Officials from my Department therefore have a very stringent approach to inspection of all seed for certification here.  It is inspected three times per year.  It is visually inspected when growing and also when being assembled.  There is zero tolerance; any black grass found is removed.  The point about our using wild seed mixes into the future for this area is really important because the concerns the Deputy raises are very real, for tillage farmers in particular but also for commercial cereal crop growing.  People with the best of intentions sowing wild seed mix might inadvertently sow an invasive species that we do not want to become widespread here in Ireland.  My Department continues to keep a very close eye on this and is engaging very closely with the Irish Seed Trade Association on the matter.</p></speech>

What we need is a proactive approach.  We normally see reaction, so I think we have time here.  There certainly needs to be that type of engagement.  If we have no certification process for imported wild flower seeds, that needs to be changed.  We also need some form of social media campaign because there are so many community and voluntary groups involved in biodiversity, particularly at local county council level, that there should be a campaign that makes them aware of black grass and vigilant in identifying it at the very least.  I understand that the Minister of State has had engagement with many of the farm organisations and local farmers, as have I.  He will know that this is the last thing we can heap on tillage farmers and that we cannot put our crop produce at risk, particularly given what will happen with the CAP reform, convergence and our new eco schemes, or the proposal for the new eco schemes, and how much damage that will do to the farmers, with possible cuts of up to 40%.  I therefore ask the Minister of State not to allow this to fester but to ensure that this is very much taken in hand by the Department.</p></speech>

She mentioned extending inspection of imported seeds.  That option is not open to us under EU regulations.  We can control what is propagated here.  The seed that was discovered in the Teagasc plant was imported from the UK.  We envisage that the vast majority of wild seed used in Ireland in future will be propagated here and that where seed from abroad is used, it will be assembled here and we will have control over that.  In all those circumstances, we have zero tolerance for any level of black grass, which is being removed.  The Deputy's points are valid and we take them on board.  We are working on this issue.</p>  <p>  This measure is not reactive.  The voluntary code has been in place for a long time and covers black grass.  We are increasing vigilance.  I will bring back the Deputy's point about a promotional campaign, as it is a point worth making.  We take this issue very seriously.</p></speech>

I thank my Rural Independent Group colleagues for bringing forward this badly needed motion.  I also acknowledge the work and collaboration of the farming organisations which have contacted all Members in the months since last year's general election.  I thank them for their time and expertise and for engaging in discussions on this issue.  I also thank staff members, Mr. David Mullins and Mr. Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, who work with the group, and I commend them on the hard work they have put into the motion.  </p><p>The motion is focused.  It is about achieving fairness and embedding in statute a commitment to price justice for beef farmers.  In no other business or sector would we see producers running at a loss.  I am aware of many beef and suckler farmers in my constituency who are running at a loss.  It does not seem right or fair and it is an injustice that must be corrected.  We are calling on all Deputies, rural and those outside rural areas, to support the motion.  It is about justice and fairness.  We do not need more tokenistic measures.  We do not need an ombudsman which will not have powers to conduct audits of factories associated with Meat Industry Ireland.  We need real change.  The only way we will achieve that is through the establishment of an independent regulator with robust powers to stop once and for all the scandal taking place in this country.  </p><p>We have 70,000 beef and suckler farmers who contribute greatly to our economy.  I would go so far as to say they are the backbone of the rural economy but they are being treated very badly.  The primary producer is the one that is not benefiting or gaining any sort of profit from their high quality produce.  This country has a great tradition in beef and suckler farming and produces one of the highest quality products in the world, yet our farmers are not being fairly rewarded for their hard work, sacrifice and dedication.  Farmers are being taken for granted.  There are also issues around food security.  Our food producers deserve fair play.  That is what the motion is about and I call on all Deputies to support it.  </p><p>The Government needs to accept that many small farmers and factory workers are being exploited by some Irish beef processors and that beef producers are routinely penalised by processors through the targeted operation of stealth and opaque price-fixing practices.  They are in a no-win situation and that must change.  To address this, we are calling on the Government to recognise that the continuing centrality of the beef sector to the rural economy and its role in generating fair farm incomes require a new and imaginative approach.  More important, however, we need the Government to finally accept that existing regulatory and competition protections have proven manifestly inadequate with respect to protecting beef and suckler farmers from unfair price distortions, and delivering credible levels of industry transparency and a just price to the farmer. </p><p>This weakness in the current levels of protections is already recognised at the European level.  If it were not, there would be no need for the introduction of measures such as the unfair trading practices directive.  That in itself is a clear acknowledgement that farmers and those on the producing end of the food chain are routinely exploited.  There is no other word for it.  This exploitation has gone on for decades and must end.  If the existing protections were strong enough or were even being enforced, such directives would be redundant.  As it is, they are being ignored with impunity.  Farmers are sick to the back teeth of the lack of transparency in how prices are set. </p><p>The Minister has commissioned three separate reports from Grant Thornton on this issue, at a cost of over &euro;120,000.  These reports have been rejected by farmers and bodies such as the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, and Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  Only Meat Industry Ireland is happy with them and that tells us all we need to know.  When Meat Industry Ireland is happy, there is a serious problem.</p><p>In March last, the IFA forcefully rejected claims by Meat Industry Ireland that beef farmers receive 80% of total sales revenue earned by processors.  This was after the independent report by Grant Thornton was presented to members of the beef task force.  Meat Industry Ireland claimed that &ldquo;false assertions were made and prominently circulated that farmers only get &euro;2 for every &euro;10 spent on beef by a consumer.&rdquo;  However, as the IFA, ICSA and others have repeatedly made clear, even Grant Thornton admitted to the beef task force that it does not have the authority to access the information needed for a full and independent appraisal of the value of beef at all points in the supply chain.  This is exactly the problem.  Other serious deficiencies have been identified by independent farmers, including that processors do not pay for the fifth quarter, despite its value.  Processors trim the fat from carcasses and penalise the producer, yet separately they sell the same fat for &euro;200 per tonne.  Processors penalise producers if carcasses exceed weight restrictions, yet they keep the excess weight and sell it.  Processors do not pay farmers for the slaughtered animals' blood which has a very significant value for use as a protein source.  </p><p>As part of the disease eradication scheme, significant numbers of cattle are being removed from farms at the expense of the taxpayer but are being gifted to feedlots to boost their profitability.  All of this makes clear that the meat industry is presenting a front around compliance and transparency but no such price transparency exists.  We know it, the meat industry knows it and, more importantly, the farmers know it.</p><p>Have things changed?  No, because the meat industry in this State has been for some time a de facto cartel and a monopoly of extraordinary power and reach.</p> <p>That has to change.  The protected status of the industry and the inability of farmers and politicians to properly hold it to account must come to an end.  I have seen at first hand how difficult it is for new operators to enter the market, including in my constituency in relation to the proposed Banagher Chilling project.  In March of this year, I highlighted this issue and noted that considerable anger and frustration was emerging following the confirmation from An Bord Plean&aacute;la that it was not in a position to determine the outcome of an appeal related to the Banagher meat processing plant.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la indicated it had yet to receive the inspector's report on the appeal, which was due by 1 March, and that this made it impossible for a determination to be made on the case.  This latest setback is totally unacceptable and unjustified, particularly as the board had been due to make a decision as far back as 4 January.  Several months later, no progress has been made and no information is available on where progress lies or what will be done. </p> <p> This inadequate and inefficient operation and the inefficiency of An Bord Plean&aacute;la deepens the perception that any attempt to open up the meat market, whether in the midlands, Offaly, Tipperary, Limerick, Cork or Kerry will be subject to endless delays and bureaucratic nonsense and obstacles.  I have repeatedly made it clear how important Banagher Chilling could be in terms of stimulating the local rural economy, expanding market competition and making County Offaly attractive as a site capable of generating inward investment, which we badly need.  However, none of that appears to be registering with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the slightest.  It seems to be a law unto itself and doing its own thing.  At this stage, the entire process is actively working against not only our local interest but also clear commitments in the programme for Government that beef farmers and the beef sector would be supported.</p> <p> Less than ten days ago, the Minister stated that his Department's statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is merely to approve slaughter plants in accordance with the European Union (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations and, after that, to ensure that approved plants operate in compliance with the EU's food hygiene legislation and animal health and welfare standards.  He also said the Department cannot, in carrying out this process, take into account issues such as the concentration of ownership of inputs to processing, as it is outside the scope of this remit.  That was a telling admission that there is no more power within the Department to ensure animal welfare than there is to ensure the economic welfare of farmers who produce the animals.  That is also why we are not directing this motion at one Department only, but at the Government.  This requires a whole-of-government approach because it touches on issues such as justice, financial exploitation and competition law, as well as agricultural policy.</p> <p> I accept the Minister has made several commitments to transparency, particularly in terms of the establishment of a national food ombudsman.  In his remark here last week, he stated he wanted to see such an office established or &ldquo;something similar.&rdquo;  That "something similar&rdquo; reference is not what we in the Rural Independent Group want.  When the Minister was in opposition, he called on the Government to put an independent regulator in place.  I do not know what has happened the Minister since that time.  Since he went into the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, he has come up with a tokenistic measure, which is not good enough, does not cut it and will not be accepted by farmers because it will not have enough power.</p> <p> We want a regulatory body with proper statutory powers capable of compelling audits on Meat Industry Ireland factories and making enforceable recommendations to that industry.  We want a regulatory body that the industry cannot just choose to ignore or engage with as it sees fit.  The Minister has accepted that the additional powers to be assigned to the new office by primary legislation go beyond those in the unfair trading practices directive and that they are currently the subject of public consultation, which closes today.  We are told this new office will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  This is exactly what the Department and Bord Bia already do, so what is to be gained here, apart from tokenism, duplication and cost to the taxpayer?  The public consultation seems, yet again, to be more concerned with giving the appearance of action and with tokenism than with changing how structures operate in this State.</p> <p> As Mr. Edmund Graham, the beef chair of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, stated only last week, the lack of co-operation by some players with the Grant Thornton report on price composition of the total value of the animal along the supply chain is also undermining the beef task force.  The obvious conclusion to this is the need to establish a regulator, rather than just a food ombudsman, with the power to compel all actors along the food chain to co-operate.  The ICSA was right to say the Grant Thornton report has laid bare the dysfunction within the sector.  While the report was looking for where the margins lie along the food chain, it appears that those beyond the primary producer mark want to keep those margins hidden.  It is a power imbalance we in the Rural Independent Group are seeking to address and set right.  To that end, I hope our motion receives cross-party support.</p></speech>

The beef industry supports more than 70,000 beef farmers and 10,000 jobs across processing, distribution and transport.  The industry is worth approximately &euro;2.5 billion annually and the vast majority of the income remains in the rural economy.  The price of feed for animals has risen by 25%, with recent increases in EU import duty on beet pulp and molasses.</p>  <p>  One of the schemes put in place to help farmers was the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, with 12,600 farmers applying for 2,000 places.  Some 63% of those were beef farmers, depending on this to boost their income.  The scheme was one of the partnership approaches by the Government to help farmers addressing climate change challenges and biodiversity.  Are we actually serious?  There were 12,600 applicants for 2,000 places.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to look at the regulation of the beef industry.  The Minister cannot be seen to regulate the market but he can investigate the failings of the market.  For instance, there are not enough processors in the market.  Will the Minister bring in an independent gatekeeper to the industry, not a paid passenger?  The industry needs someone who, ultimately, will help our farmers and primary producers.  The regulator needs to be given real powers and resources to oversee the sector and make direct recommendations to the Government.  This needs to be a fair competition.  Market transparency and just prices must be given to the beef farmer.  What farmers have been put through from every angle is beyond reason.  The EU is looking for 100% convergence, which will not happen.  A more realistic figure is 75%.  The Minister cannot bend on this.  In the programme for Government, there was a commitment that carbon tax would be ring-fenced for new environmental scheme similar to REPS.  When regulation comes in regarding agriculture, it is important that viable farmers are not compromised.</p> <p>The Minister must work with the beef farmers to bring them into the consultation process, and not just as spectators.  He needs to acknowledge that they have a meaningful contribution to make.  Many of the farming bodies have acknowledged that we need a proper definition of a farmer.  For example, we need to define what an output-based, genuine farmer is.</p> <p> The fair deal scheme requires farm families and small business owners to put aside 7.5% of the value of their land or assets annually to pay for the care of a family member.  This will completely deplete the asset and there will be nothing left for the next generation.</p> <p> Everything that is happening here is putting farmers' lives and the lives of the next generation at risk.  Everything is increasing.  There have been 12,600 applications for 2,000 places.  Fuel has increased by 25% since last year.  Bringing in the harvest costs more.  Everything costs more.  Farmers, particularly beef farmers, need to be protected.  I stated in the D&aacute;il 12 months ago that we needed a beef industry regulator to look after the regulation of prices.  Beef farmers always get the lower price and the feed farmers always get the highest.  I asked the Minister to check the books not on an annual basis but on a monthly or quarterly basis to find out who is getting the highest prices for beef.  Let us have transparency across the entire beef industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600010#H00200"><p>As I open the debate on the Government side, I do so, first, as the son of a suckler farmer in the midlands who has lived the experience that many of the Deputies speaking today say they are aware of.  I grew up on a family farm that supported me in life and gave me the key opportunities to realise my ambition and supported me to do that.  I have also experienced the late nights and long days of hard work and frustration on our family farm.  Over the decades, through the 1990s right up to now, I have seen the many challenges and crises that have faced family farms.  To this day, even though my father is well into his 80s, I volunteer to help him each week on our family farm.  While many Deputies are aware of those experiences, I have lived them.</p>  <p>  I wish the delegation, the Minister and his officials, the very best in the coming days in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations.  It is vital for our country that these negotiations are successful.  I welcome the input that the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and their departmental officials have made and the dedication they have shown.</p>  <p>  The Government is very aware of the challenges faced by the beef sector and the sector&rsquo;s importance to our economy and society.  To put the value of the sector in context, the Irish beef sector comprises more than 78,000 specialist cattle farms, generating &euro;2.3 billion in output and representing 16% of total agrifood export value in 2020.  This reflects the comparative advantage afforded to Irish beef production by extensive grassland coverage.  Beef output also has a high multiplier effect of 2.5 in Ireland.  The sector plays a significant role in rural development and provides major employment in regions where fewer alternative economic opportunities exist.</p>  <p>  In recognition of this vital contribution the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine continually monitors the market situation for beef and other agrifood commodities.  This allows the Department to identify severe market disturbance so that the Minister can respond as necessary and where possible.  A good example of such a response was the &euro;50 million provided for the beef finishers payment last year under the Covid-19 temporary state aid framework.  The beef finishers payment provided support for beef finishing enterprises which were most affected by the market disturbance caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020.</p>  <p>  On a wider level, the Department provides a range of financial aids to support beef farm incomes and to support economic and environmental efficiency.  The core dedicated support for the beef sector under the outgoing rural development programme is the &euro;300 million beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  In addition to this support, &euro;200 million of additional supports were made available between 2019 and 2020 specifically for the beef sector.  These included the beef exceptional aid measure and beef environmental efficiency pilot schemes in 2019 and the aforementioned beef finishers payment and the beef environmental efficiency programme, BEEP, scheme in 2020.</p>  <p>  In budget 2021, &euro;85 million was allocated to specific supports for sustainable beef farming.  This includes over &euro;40 million for the extension of the BDGP during the transition period before the next CAP and &euro;45 million for the 2021 beef sector efficiency pilot that was launched earlier this year.  Work is under way on the development of supports for the sector under the next CAP which will be aimed at further supporting the economic, environmental and social sustainability of beef farms in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A key commitment in the programme for Government is the establishment of a new authority expected to be called the national food ombudsman to enforce the unfair trading practices directive.  Pursuant to that commitment, the process for the establishment of the national food ombudsman is under way.  A public consultation process will inform the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the remit and powers to be assigned to that office.</p>  <p>  In April, the Minister signed Statutory Instrument No. 18 of 2021, which sets out the regulations to give effect in Irish law to EU Directive No. 2019/633 on unfair trading practices in business-to-business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain.  These regulations will come into effect from 1 July 2021 and will apply to agreements for the supply of agrifood products.  One of the key principles of the unfair trading practices directive is to protect farmers and other, weaker suppliers of agricultural and food products from stronger buyers.  These regulations will help to provide that protection and are a significant step in moving to a more even playing field for our agricultural producers.</p>  <p>  Pending the establishment of the new office, the enforcement authority required by the directive will operate in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The authority will have the necessary statutory powers to investigate complaints, carry out investigations on its own initiative and initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the unfair trading practices prohibited under the directive.  The establishment of the new office will require primary legislation.  When established, the new office, the remit of which will include the beef sector, will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland, and will also incorporate the unfair trading practices enforcement authority functions.  In addition to establishing the new office, the primary legislation may introduce rules that go beyond those included in the unfair trading practices directive.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the primary legislation needed to establish the new office of a national food ombudsman or regulator was launched late last month and closes today, 26 May.  All submissions made under this process will be considered.  The Government is committed to delivering an office that will bring much-needed transparency to the sector, and that will ultimately help both our farmers and consumers.  The Government is also fully committed to ensuring fairness, equity and transparency in the agricultural and food supply chain.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to restate the Government&rsquo;s position on the acknowledged need to ensure that any negative impact the EU-Mercosur trade deal may have on the Irish beef sector is minimised.  Ireland has consistently raised concerns about the negative impact that an agreement would have on the EU&rsquo;s agriculture sector, particularly the beef sector.  The Commission has stated that it will make funding available to assist farmers with the challenges of market disturbance which may arise as a result of the deal.  The Commission has also engaged the London School of Economics to carry out a sustainability impact assessment on the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement.  This final report was published on 29 March last.  In addition, the final economic and sustainability impact assessment for Ireland is due to be published shortly.  We await this assessment with interest.</p>  <p>  Portugal currently holds the EU Presidency.  The T&aacute;naiste has held discussions with his Portuguese counterpart in which he stated Ireland's insistence on additional, robust and legally enforceable commitments in respect of environmental compliance being added to the agreement.</p> <p>These commitments on the climate change responsibilities of both parties should include a sanction regime for non-compliance with sustainable development goals responsibilities which could include removal of preferential tariff rate quotas, TRQs.</p> <p> Regarding beef sold into the EU from non-EU markets, there is a legislative framework in place to ensure imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between member states.  Food products placed on the European marketplace are covered by a range of legislation designed to ensure products supplied to consumers are of the highest safety standards.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine plays a part in the enforcement of this legislation along with competent authorities in other member states, other Government Departments and State agencies such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive. </p> <p> The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by member states in the first instance and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety to ensure compliance with all the relevant safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production between member states.  This comprehensive and robust legislative framework and the checks carried out by the relevant competent authorities across EU member states ensure imports meet the requisite standards.</p> <p> I acknowledge the sector has a major beneficial effect on the rural economy.  I know that more than most, as I said at the start of my contribution, in particular in providing employment and supporting incomes in rural parts of Ireland.  This is an issue the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has spoken about many times in the past and will continue to do so in supporting this sector.  As I said, it is a key requirement and ambition of the Government to ensure the viability of our family farms.  In working with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and others, I will do my utmost, having lived that experience, to ensure that comes to fruition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="10:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600011#J00300"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.</p>  <p>  I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on behalf of the people I represent, namely, the small rural farmers throughout County Kerry, from Poulgorm Bridge through Kilgarvan, Kenmare and Sneem to Valencia Island.  They are basically suckler farmers supplying top quality calves to beef finishers and fatteners around the country.  The best of calves leave Kenmare, Cahirciveen and the marts in Castleisland, Listowel and Tralee for beef finishers in the rest of the country.  These suckler farmers play a key role.  They work very hard and produce top quality calves.  They stay up all night when cows are calving and theirs is an onerous job.  They have the breeding of animals down to a fine art.  </p>  <p>  Our 70,000 beef farmers are continuously being put under pressure by the factories when they decide to reduce the prices.  These farmers are the backbone not only of rural areas but the whole of Ireland.  More than 10,000 are involved in the processing industry, which is worth more than &euro;2.5 billion to the economy.</p>  <p>  The factories are blackguarding the beef producers and finishers.  With regard to the four-movement rule and the 30-month rule, as I asked the previous Taoiseach, when an animal is hanging up in a factory who will say it is 31 months old or moved through farms five or seven times?  These are ridiculous rules but I know what they are about.  Their purpose is to give the factories the data so they know when the animals will be coming to them.  They then have animals to match out of their own feedlots and they can bring down the price the farmer should get.  This is what they are doing and it is controlling the prices.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Minister of State said he is a farmer&rsquo;s son.  I am also a farmer&rsquo;s son and a farmer, having been farming all my life.  I understand what people have to go through day and night.  When we overcome everything else we still have to contend with the weather, as we are doing currently.  Fertiliser, feedstuff and diesel costs have gone though the roof, but we will not see prices in factories matching that.  I remind the Minister of State that prices have gone down in recent days.  </p>  <p>  We are calling for a beef regulator to be established to ensure farmers are properly paid.  A beef regulator could also find out what is happening with the retailers.  The retailers are saying they never sought a four-movement rule.  It is of no benefit to them and nor is the 30-month rule.  I appeal to the Minister to get rid of those two rules.  The factories have no divine right or authority from anybody to do this.  I ask the Government to remove those two rules.  Farmers have gone through too much.  </p>  <p>  We need to give greater care and protection to producers and consumers to ensure our emerging international trading environment continues into the horizon.  Farmers are under threat from Mercosur and from New Zealand and Australian exports.  We hear the English are doing a deal with the Australians.  We are supplying the greater part of our beef production to the UK.  If we lose that market, farmers will be put under more pressure by the factories.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure we open up new markets for live cattle exports, notwithstanding what the Green Party has been saying.  Farmers are being victimised and treated like eco-criminals.  The T&aacute;naiste is supporting a vegan diet.  Everything is down on the farmer.  I appeal to the Government to take a stand and show whether they are standing with beef farmers and small farmers in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Carol Nolan, Mr. David Mullins, Mr. Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and all those who helped us to bring this motion before the D&aacute;il.  It is very important.  The regulatory system in place is not working.  Farmers, especially beef farmers, are being let down.  Farmers work hard to make sure cows are in calf and the calves are safely delivered, and enough things can go wrong when a cow is calving.  Nothing tends to go wrong in normal hours.  It is always in the middle of the night when help is scarce that something goes wrong, like a calve being born backwards.  Every type of misfortune known to man, woman and child can befall a farmer and they all happen at the wrong time.</p>  <p>  All farmers want is to cover their costs and make a modest profit.  That is all any farmer wants but beef farmers are not being allowed to do that.  If we consider the cost of maintaining and keeping a cow alive for 12 months, the price a farmer will get for a calf and every other entitlement that applies to that cow, it will not make money for the farmer.  Everybody knows that, and it is wrong.  All anyone selling a pint of Guinness or a pound of ham or doing a day's work wants is a fair price for what he or she is selling or a fair day's pay.  Farmers are not getting that.</p>  <p>  More than 80,000 beef farmers are directly or indirectly involved in the production of beef.  The beef industry is worth between &euro;2 billion and &euro;3 billion annually.</p> <p>Let us take the high cost of feed and the proposals that are coming before the D&aacute;il at present.  Unfortunately, the Minister, his party and his partners in government all seem to think that the Climate Action Bill and its implications for the farming community will not make a difference.  I do not see how they can think that.  If farmers are struggling now, how does the Minister think they will fare out when they find themselves bearing the brunt of the burden of the extra charges, extra taxes and extra restrictions?  We should remember that this is the Government that is seriously telling farmers that in 2027 when they are spreading slurry, they will have to agitate it by electric means and they will have to spread it by electric means.  As I highlighted here previously, that machinery is not in production yet, not in this part of the world anyway.</p> <p> What we are saying to farmers as well is that we are trying to restrict and reduce the herd here at a time when we cannot make money out of what we are doing and at the same time in South America they can knock down and destroy the Amazon forest, plant grass and feed their animals so they can send them up here in the same way as the bales of briquettes are coming from Germany today while, down the road here, Bord na M&oacute;na is closed.  Where is the commonsense in that?  I will never forgive or forget what the Government is standing by and doing, whether it is to Bord na M&oacute;na, the farmers or the fishermen.</p> <p> I acknowledge that the fishermen are protesting in a flotilla today.  They are gone from Dingle, Cahersiveen and around the coast of Kerry, as well as the rest of the country, to protest in a flotilla.  What are they protesting about?  It is to make an honest living, the same as the farmer with the cows, calves and beef.  What do they want to do?  They want to make a living.  If they cannot understand that in Europe, surely be to God the Government and the Deputies elected here, to a man and woman, should be standing shoulder to shoulder with the farmers of Ireland.  We should be saying regulation must be put in place to protect them.  The factories should be taken on for the monopolising, demonising and terrorising of farmers because of the way they are controlling the price of beef.  It is true to say that the blackguarding that goes on and the regulations that are in place are purposely set up to keep down the price of beef.  That is what it is all about.  Let us look at the four-movement rule, for instance.  It is the biggest load of nonsense and baloney that ever was put in place to try and hurt farmers.  I would like the Minister to answer that and to explain it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="10:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600012#K00200"><p>I commend the Rural Independent Group for bringing this motion to the House.  I also commend Deputy Nolan for leading on this important issue.  I confirm that Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies are happy to support the motion.</p>  <p>  The Irish family farm stands as the bulwark of rural Ireland.  The family farm network remains the main economic driver of our communities.  In times of economic downturn we turn consistently to farmers and they never let us down.  The success of family farms is a success for us all.  When a small farm in our constituency makes a profit, it is not siphoned off to a tax haven or distributed in shareholder dividends, it is spent in the local community, the hardware store and the grocer.  It goes to the local GAA draws, the local farm contractor, the local pubs and restaurants.  The problem increasingly is that farmers, in particular beef farmers, are not making a profit to redistribute in communities.  Farm incomes have remained static at best for more than two decades and successive Governments have simply allowed the position to worsen.  For the past five years, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for radical reform to deliver for farm families, in particular in the beef sector.  We have outlined what I have described as the three Fs &ndash; a fair CAP, fair play and fair prices.  We now know that there will not be a fair CAP.  Irish farming has been sold out in that regard.  By the end of the next EU budget cycle Ireland will be paying an additional &euro;1 billion into the EU budget every single year, but the CAP budget will be significantly reduced in real terms.  That is all in the context of Irish farmers being expected to do more and to receive less.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that some stakeholders and media outlets have failed miserably to stand up against the Government or Phil Hogan when this sell-out happened, and the CAP cake was being shrunk, who now at the last minute are agitating and pitting farmer against farmer as to how the cake should be divided.  I say categorically to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and his colleagues that it would be an absolute scandal in the context of the shrinking budget if any single individual or enterprise is still receiving more than &euro;100,000 in farm payments at a time when most farmers are struggling to survive on a fraction of that.  The time for an upper limit payment of approximately &euro;60,000 per annum is now.  Most Irish farmers today are producing more food to higher standards than their parents but with less income to show for it, while at the other end we see that produce being used as a loss leader for large retailers who alongside the processors are making ever-increasing profits.  Therein lies the big secret of Irish agriculture: that there is money to be made in beef.  The problem is that the money is not going to the people who are doing all the work, our local family farmers, it is going to the Larry Goodmans, the factories and the multinational retail giants.</p>  <p>  Farmers cannot work together for fear of injunctions from factories or warnings from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, yet in the meat industry we see increased consolidation all the time and decreasing competition and everybody, apart from the Government and its agencies, knows that there is wholesale collaboration between the factories on prices and that there is, in effect, a cartel in operation.  They can make the rules such as the 30-month one or the four-movement one.  They can call them bonuses, when everybody knows that they are actually penalties, without any logical basis and they can operate without an ounce of transparency.  The situation is compounded by corporate structures whereby in one instance a factory is owned by at least five unlimited companies registered in states as varied as the Isle of Man and Luxembourg.  They can strengthen their hold on the sector through the use of factory feedlots and without even blushing, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, can say his Department has no analysis whatsoever on the impact they have on prices or the environment.</p>  <p>  The EU directive on unfair trading practices does not go far enough.  So far, the Government's implementation of the directive does not go far enough.  What we need is a regulator with real teeth to hold the factories and the retailers to account.  I am not that pushed on what name we give to such a regulator, but it must have the power to address unfair and imbalanced trading relationships within the sector and additional powers to investigate and the ability to level real penalties on the factories that are bleeding family farmers dry.  That is the least farmers expect and deserve and that is the litmus test for the Government.</p></speech>

We have seen farmers continually disadvantaged at every turn, despite the efforts they made through their representative organisations or in some cases, by themselves, when they took to the streets of the capital and demonstrated outside meat factories.  Yet, as we have seen, a hands-off approach has been taken to the meat processing industry.  This has been evident in the demands made of farmers and the prices they traditionally get from the processors.  When penalties are wrapped up and presented as bonuses, then we know that there is something inherently wrong.</p>  <p>  Let us take the 30-month rule which was introduced in response to the BSE crisis.  It still remains in place, despite wide understanding that it is outdated.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has washed its hands of dealing with this demand and the impact it is having on farmers.  Then there is the four-movement rule, which the processors alone seem to dominate, and which is not something demanded by Bord Bia.  It is just a way for those in the meat processing cartel to prevent farmers from having some level of say over price.  I will take these two in-spec demands for a moment.  The term bonus is a misnomer as in reality it is just a way to ensure that penalties exist in order to pay them less.  They are not legitimate rules: that is why the Department does not oversee the implementation of these decisions.  Instead, they allow cartels to pay less for animals that do not fall into these categories.  All the time the meat industry benefits and is shrouded in secrecy.</p>  <p>  During the pandemic we have seen some of the practices that have been ongoing in some of these factories.  We have seen reports outlining major concerns about safe working conditions.  Secrecy has surrounded concerns about Covid outbreaks.  In September of last year, I became aware that Covid testing had been suspended at all meat factories due to the need for testing resources to be put elsewhere.</p> <p>This was despite the fact that, only days before, a cluster of the virus was discovered at a factory in my own county.  In nearly every way we can imagine, different rules seem to apply to meat processing factories.  Most recently, this became apparent when Meat Industry Ireland made claims that farmers receive 80% of total sales revenue earned by processors.  This was laughable considering that Grant Thornton, which undertook the study on behalf of the beef market task force, was refused data by Meat Industry Ireland.</p></speech>

In recent months, as the marts went online, it has given a great in insight into what happens when farmers go to the mart.  For example, on many days I had to write down the weight and the price that the cattle were getting during the bidding when I went to the mart.  The farmer literally has to look at the price and take the decision as to whether to take them home or just let them go when the bid is well below the value of the cattle.  Of course, it is different when they go to the factory because, once they are killed, the price is the price and the farmer has little say.</p>  <p>  It is hard to watch farmers breaking their backs, day in, day out.  The price of meal and fertiliser has gone up, and they are up day and night, calving cattle.  Added to that is the pressure of inspections.  I see my own dad and I know that, especially in recent months and years, he just wonders if it is worth it any more.  He is not the only farmer to think that and, in fact, some farmers have already closed the gates.  They give everything and then they see the factories do whatever they like and get away with it.</p>  <p>  The Government is not doing enough.  It is not taking enough action and these farmers need it to take action.  As mentioned, the four-movement rule and the 30-month rule are perfect examples of that.  The Government has washed its hands of that and said it is just commercial practice.</p>  <p>  What we need is a beef regulator with teeth, and this has been said by farmers over and over again.  I am at a loss as to what has changed because the Minister himself previously called for this.  If the Government does not take action in regard to a beef regulator, more and more farmers will close their gates.  It will literally be the end of a generation in farming the land because the young people will be gone.  They will have no choice but to leave because there will be no income unless the Government takes action.</p></speech>

We need a beef regulator, we need the 30-day rule abolished and we need the four-movement rule abolished immediately.  They make no sense whatsoever.  I thank Deputy Carol Nolan and the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward the motion, which is crucial for the people I represent in Mayo.</p>  <p>  Profits from small farms are passed on to local businesses, services, equipment manufacturers, suppliers, the construction industry and a myriad of supply companies and businesses which are all directly or indirectly beneficiaries of money generated on farms.  Unfortunately, the supply chain is broken, fragmented and disconnected, and it suffers a serious lack of trust between many of the stakeholders.  It undoubtedly needs attention.</p>  <p>  We need an independent beef regulator with proper powers.  The factory bonuses, the 30-month rule and the four-movement rule are designed, as Deputy Matt Carthy said, as penalties.  For God&rsquo;s sake, do not insult farmers&rsquo; intelligence by telling them they are bonuses.  They are penalties.  Why do we still have them in place?  Who was asking for them to be put in place?  Farmers do things that make sense to them.  These rules make no sense whatsoever and the only beneficiaries are the factories and processors.  The same factories are controlled by barons who operate under unlimited companies and there is an appalling lack of transparency that would not be tolerated anywhere else.  What are they hiding, we have to ask.</p>  <p>  Beef farming is in a constant battle for survival.  These farmers face the constant threat of being the sacrificial lambs of the climate change Bill in the move to reduce stock numbers.  The farmers are playing their part in addressing climate change and they are willing to play their part in the future.  All they need is fair play.  We are well-placed to produce the finest quality beef in the world, with exceptional environmental credentials, grass-fed and extensively grazed stock, as part of an agricultural ecosystem developed over thousands of years, mixing livestock and crops managed as family businesses in harmony with the environment, not the huge feedlots or monoculture that we observe in many parts of the world.  However, I have a word of caution for the Government.  A healthy ecosystem, a healthy environment, birds, fish, trees and wildlife will not guarantee the survival of the family farm.  However, a healthy, profitable farm can guarantee the survival of a healthy ecosystem.</p></speech>

Since I was elected in 2016, I have been involved in discussions around the whole issue of beef farming, the beef sector and the suckler sector, which are at the core of Irish farming and the family farm.  All of us know the food we produce in Ireland is of world-class standard, from the family farm and from grass-fed, free-roaming animals, traceable from farm to fork.  It is unique in that respect.  Yet, the farmer, the person who puts in all the effort, gets the least reward.  That is something that has jarred, not just with the farming community, but with the general community for many years.  People want to see the farmer, the primary producer, getting a fair deal.</p>  <p>  This motion focuses on the whole idea of a food ombudsman and a regulator - somebody to ensure the factories and supermarkets are held to account, which is vital and needs to happen as quickly as possible.  However, we also need a fair deal and a restructuring of the process to take place.  The whole system needs to be turned around so we can provide a proper income for Irish farmers which reflects the unique product they produce, particularly in the beef sector.</p>  <p>  We also, of course, have the issue of CAP and the problems around all of that.  What we can see coming down the road is that Irish farmers in particular are losing out, which should not be happening given the position of the agricultural sector and the vital role it continues to play, not just for the farming community, but for the wider community.  As has been said by others, when the Irish farmer is prosperous the rural community is vibrant.  That is what we need to put centre stage in all of this.  We have to make the Irish farmer prosperous.  We have to ensure that small family farms can be viable into the future and they will not be viable if they do not receive a fair price for their produce.  Getting a fair price for their produce is the core of what we need to do.  There are other issues which need to be dealt with and they can be dealt with in another setting, but getting that fair price requires the Government to hold the beef industry to account.  </p>  <p>  That is not to say the Government has a direct role in setting prices, and we all understand that cannot happen.  However, it has a role in ensuring the industry is fair, works for everybody and provides for the farming sector.  Putting a proper regulator in place which not just monitors the situation, but actually has the power to go in and ensure penalties can be put in place where unfair practices are happening, is vital.</p>  <p>  The issue is not just in regard to providing for CAP and all of those issues; the issue is centrally with the Government.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not just the Minister for the food processing sector, but is the Minister for the primary producer as well, and he has to stand up and defend the primary producer.  That has failed to happen and continually fails to happen.  I hope that, as we move forward from this debate, the Minister will step up to the plate and recognise that this is his role, and that he will deliver for the Irish farming sector.</p></speech>

For far too long, there have been extremely unfair trading practices that have disadvantaged small-scale beef farmers.  Traditionally, Ireland is a nation that prides itself on the quality of its agricultural produce, exporting 90% of its beef produce to the value of &euro;2.4 billion in 2018, and has garnered a great international reputation accordingly.</p>  <p>  The fact the Government was supposed to transpose an unfair trading practices directive that sought to strengthen the bargaining position of small-scale farmers but has yet to do so is concerning.  This directive allows for the nomination of an enforcement authority, with a view to preventing the cartel-like behaviours that have long afflicted the supply chains in the sector, consistently putting small-scale farmers at a disadvantage and leaving them struggling to compete with the unjustifiably low prices that larger suppliers can offer.</p>  <p>  I support the motion and the move toward establishing a regulator.  Many stakeholders feel the remit of a national food ombudsman would dilute the function and scope of this agency, and call instead for the introduction of an independent meat regulator.</p> <p>I believe an independent meat regulator is needed but it must be one with real teeth that can genuinely investigate and mediate in respect of the level of control of big processors.  It must be able to hold factories and processors to account.  It is absolutely 100% necessary.</p> <p> Small farmers are the lifeblood of this nation.  They must be protected by the Government.  I call for the Government to meet the programme for Government commitment to ensure this new regulatory agency has a remit for transparency, price reporting and market analysis.</p></speech>

The importance of the agrifood industry to our economy cannot be overstated.  Previous speakers have said that the beef sector supports more than 70,000 beef farmers.  There are approximately 3,000 in County Kerry alone.  The sector supports 10,000 jobs across processing, distribution and transport and is worth &euro;2.5 billion.  Most important, the money is spent locally.  It is spent on the local concrete men when buying drainage.  All the local suppliers benefit from the farmers.</p>  <p>  Farmers are under pressure at the moment with the price of diesel and the results-based environment agri pilot project, REAP, scheme.  The programme has been praised as working well but farmers have great concerns about it.  Beef farmers do all the work here but they are the least fairly paid arising out of it.  I echo the call of my colleague, Deputy Carthy, other Sinn F&eacute;in speakers and others for a properly independent regulator for this sector.  A fair price would do much to help small farmers plan yearly income and outgoings rather than being left at the mercy of fluctuation in prices.</p>  <p>  Intervention in markets is necessary to ensure they function properly.  Farmers in County Kerry and elsewhere have been subject to unfair conditions for far too long.  The beef regulator must be empowered to make the rules and penalties and enforce them.  It must be able to carry out audits in meat factories and retailers.  However, the evidence of what has taken place during the Covid-19 pandemic does not fill me with hope.</p>  <p>  I wish to comment on the Mercosur beef deal.  Beef sold into the European Union must be produced under the same standards, regulations and controls as those imposed on producers in Ireland.  I heard the Minister say the negative impact must be minimised.  That is only stating the obvious.  The time is right now for an upper limit to be imposed.</p>  <p>  Beef producers have been penalised for years by opaque fixing prices.  I echo the comments made in respect of the four-movement rule.  I was speaking to a farmer in Ballymacelligott in recent days who said the four-movement rule and the 30-day rule are nonsensical and must be abolished.</p></speech>

A flotilla has arrived in Cork Harbour.  I wish to acknowledge the wonderful way in which they have organised the event.  They are primary producers as well, of a fashion, and are deserving of our support and attention.  I hope they will be successful in their travails throughout the day and that they will get to meet the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  There is an elephant in the room in respect of beef, namely, the current negotiations between the United Kingdom and Australia on a zero-tariff and zero-quota agreement that could be concluded next month.  My understanding is they are teeing it up for the G7 summit in Cornwall.  I am fearful about that deal because it will have major consequences for Irish primary producers, including Irish beef and sheep farmers.  If the deal concludes, the permutations are such that it will allow Australia to ship beef and lamb without tariff to the United Kingdom.  I am really concerned about how that will impact on Irish exports to the UK.  Notwithstanding the current travails in respect of Brexit, I am fearful that the conclusion of such a UK-Australia free trade agreement would have even more untold and negative consequences for Irish primary producers.  I am keen to hear the Government perspective on this deal and what kind of forward planning the Government is doing to mitigate the effects for Irish farmers.</p>  <p>  We know the nature of farming in Australia.  They have factory farms to all intents and purposes.  If they are able to export to the UK it will have dire consequences for United Kingdom farmers and for Irish farmers.  We wish to know the permutations, what real-time planning is taking place and what mitigation measures the Government will undertake to ensure Irish farmers are supported.  If there is a significant loss of income and loss of what is a vital market, what is the Government doing to offset that potential loss?  We have to hear from Government on its plans in that regard.  It is a vital issue and one deserving of attention.  It speaks to the heart of the motion before us today.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise the issue of market access to China.  Will the Minister outline the status of export beef to China at present?  It would be useful to know the value in euro terms and the status of our trading relationship with China at present in respect of beef exports.  It is a growing market and a vital one, given the primacy of Irish beef.  I hope we will not be locked out of that market for too much longer.  It would be useful for Irish farmers in the export game to know the status of that market.  It would be useful for them to know where the Government is at present in its diplomatic efforts to restore and enhance that market.</p>  <p>  We need to hear from the Government in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We know that many farmers will farm to schemes.  We know there is an inevitability about the fact that climate action measures will be writ large across the next CAP agreement.  The agreement has to come on the basis of ensuring financial supports for farmers.  We must be honest about this.  If there is to be an incentive provided for farmers to move into agri-environmental schemes supported by the Government and the European Union, then there needs to be clarity on what that means and what the permutations will be for farm incomes.  I refer to farm incomes for the type of farmers we are discussing today, namely, farmers who are farming on a marginal income and who are wholly dependent on a market price.  They will need continuing subvention to support their incomes if they are to be guardians of the countryside, to use the often-quoted phrase.  Incentives will have to be provided to ensure that income is supplemented where loss of income is perceived or projected.</p>  <p> I will speak briefly to the reality of where the market is at present.  I understand that the export benchmark price that was negotiated, discussed or landed upon in the context of the beef sector agreement is currently, at 2020 prices, approximately &euro;3.55 per kilo.  I am told that the Bord Bia prime cattle price for exports was approximately &euro;3.56, or effectively 1 cent more.  I would like to hear from the Minister where the Government sees the projected price of beef being one year from now, taking CAP and the UK-Australia agreement into account.  What are the future projections and what plans is the Government making to ensure there is adequate support for the sector and individual family farms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="11:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600015#N00200"><p>In the early 1990s, the beef tribunal examined serious allegations of political influence relating to alleged abuses of the system and failure of regulatory authorities.  Its conclusion highlighted widespread improper relationships between the beef industry and the Government.  It also stressed the lack of regulation and the impact of that on the sector.</p>  <p>  Today, 30 years later, what has changed?  We still have a system that makes a small few people incredibly wealthy at the expense of farmers.  The system is still designed to work for the beef barons while small farms fade away and young farmers have no choice but to pursue other careers but the Government is not addressing that.</p>  <p>  I welcome this motion to ensure that farmers are treated fairly by the industry.  The need for proper regulation and oversight to protect farmers and for workers is crucial.  I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion.  The Social Democrats are in full support of it.  I know the Rural Independent Group Deputies and we do not agree on some issues, but on this matter we are in complete agreement. </p>  <p>  The least we can expect is fair pay for fair work.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in the beef sector, as all Members know.  We all know that small farmers and factory workers are at the mercy of an industrialised system.  We all know about the cartel-like practices in the beef processing sector.  In light of this common knowledge, the response of the Government has been abysmal.  Ministers and backbenchers will claim they are representing farmers but, when it comes to tackling the beef sector, it is literally all bluster with no substance.</p>  <p>  The beef task force, which is the response of the Government to the protests, is rightly criticised for its lack of progress and slow pace.  The issues affecting small farmers are immediate but the solutions are always somewhere in the distant future.  Representative organisations and members of the beef task force are expressing their frustration.  They are seeing little impact after 18 months, with the major systematic imbalances remaining.  The official reports are not sufficiently addressing the concerns of farmers.  Moves for greater transparency are being met by farmers but practices within factories remain obscure.  It is worth noting that it was agreed on the establishment of the task force that a regulator would be part of the discussion but it is yet to get on the agenda.  Confidence in the effectiveness of the beef task force is eroding by the day.  Without substantial intervention by the Minister to bring change that will be felt by farmers, it will fail.</p>  <p>  The system is essentially rigged.  The beef barons win every time and the average farmer loses slowly.  It does not matter how many cattle you have, you will still lose out.  This issue was never about the national herd; it is about prices farmers get.  Follow the money.  The problem is not environmentalism or the consumer and it is not farmers or workers in meat plants.  Rather, it is the small few who are profiting off the back of farmers and factory workers.  We need the Government to change tack and show us it is on our side.  We need real State intervention and an independent meat regulator.</p>  <p>  The motion rightly calls for an "independent beef regulator to address ... the structurally embedded power imbalance created by the de facto monopoly of existing processors and retailers".  The scale of the beef sector and its structural inequalities mean that the proposed national food ombudsman will be unlikely to adequately deal with the issues. All Members know that.  The Government has to recognise it.  It has to establish an independent beef regulator with statutory powers to oversee and, crucially, to intervene in the sector.  Anything less will fail another generation of farmers.  An ombudsman operates within existing frameworks.  In this scenario, it will be operating within existing failing frameworks.  Although it is vital work, the sector needs a regulator, an independent office that can introduce sectoral codes of conduct and enforce legislation.  This regulator needs to be producer-focused.  Primary producers and small retailers can see and feel the absence of regulation to protect them.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, current regulating authorities could have greater oversight of the sector.  For example, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has stated that there is no evidence of a cartel at work in the beef industry but the experience of many farmers - of everybody involved - is to the contrary.  A full investigation by the commission into practices in the industry would be a welcome move.  It is worth noting that there used to be a law preventing below cost selling which protected primary producers and small retailers but it was repealed in 2005 by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and now Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.</p>  <p>  The motion also highlights the plight of workers in meat processing plants.  Regrettably, the scale and persistence of Covid-19 outbreaks in these factories further illustrate the underlying issues in the sector.  The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland described the disgraceful practices to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response last summer, stating that "the meat sector is difficult and dangerous.  Repetitive strain and workplace accidents are commonplace."  Many meat factories do not offer sick pay beyond the statutory rate, which impacts on workers' income and choices about when to return to work after an injury or illness, or even during the current Covid-19 crisis.  In addition, there are many migrants working in the industry, with non-EU workers&rsquo; residency depending on their job.  They have limited access to social welfare and some 10% of them have very little or no English.  These workers are incredibly vulnerable.  We have to consider whether the treatment of a large number of migrant workers in this sector contributed to the conditions that facilitated the Covid-19 outbreaks.</p>  <p>  The poor treatment of farmers and workers is intrinsically linked.  It shows how industrial-scale meat processing treats people - farmers and workers.  Farmers receive prices so low they are forced to protest again and again to save their family farms, while workers, especially the more vulnerable ones, are left open to infection.  Principles of fairness and equity are very clearly lacking in this industry.  It is not too much to expect that farmers get a fair price and that workers have safe working conditions.  It is large-scale meat plants that are the issue here; it is not migrant workers, farmers or small abattoirs.  It is obvious that the industrialisation of practices in the sector has increased the vulnerabilities of most stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The beef industry has been described as a de facto monopoly where the market is dominated by a few large buyers.  This concentration of power gives buyers considerable power over producers.  The scale of the sector in terms of the national economy gives a handful of companies substantial political influence.  Unless we tackle these fundamental issues, nothing will change.  We need the State to step up and address these imbalances.  We need an effective regulator, proper working conditions and fair prices.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies have spoken about growing up on a farm and experiencing this first hand.  I join with those Deputies.  On my family farm, we are slowly winding down out of beef because it is completely unviable.  The entire structural imbalance of power that I described is what people are experiencing on the ground across rural Ireland every day while contemplating whether to bother staying in the industry.  When we see the demise of those small farms and they are all bought up by big dairy farms, that is when we will see the real demise of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

One section of the motion in particular is most welcome, specifically, &quot;that small farmers and factory workers are being exploited by some Irish beef processors; and that beef producers are routinely penalised by processors through the targeted operation of stealth and opaque price fixing practices&quot;.</p><p>The lessons of Covid in particular have highlighted the extreme exploitation and failings in many areas of society.</p> <p>The failings in the meat plants are among the most acute, as is evident from the conditions of the workforce of the meat industry.  There is a striking contrast between the enormous profits of corporate beef processors, such as Larry Goodman, who has been mentioned, and the earnings of the small farmers who supply them and the salaries of the workers in the factories.  The inability of the State at all levels to protect the workers during Covid was raised here last year by us but our concerns were dismissed as if it were some kind of treason to question the meat industry.  One of the former Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine really chastised us for questioning the sector.</p> <p> In one factory alone, 60 out of the 100 workers who tested positive for Covid had contracted the virus because they worked in a chilled air environment in which air was recycled to keep the food cool.  It was argued that such conditions are unavoidable within meat plants but we have seen recent evidence from architect Orla Hegarty that while it is necessary to chill the air, it does not need to be recycled.  The levels of infection were so high because the air was being recycled.  It was a cheaper way to maintain the temperature in the factories.  It is all about costs and cost-cutting.  That is what drives the companies&rsquo; profits, and the profits drive up the rate of infection.  The refusal to grant sick pay was driven by the need for profit.  The refusal to give a decent and fair price to farmers at the gate is driven by the same desire for profits.  Furthermore, State policy in this area, namely Pathways for Growth and Food Harvest 2020, is all informed by the major processors and retailers, not the farmers.  State policy is designed according to the business interests of the big processors and retailers, not the interests of farmers.  This creates an environment allowing anti-competitive practices.  We saw recently how Larry Goodman has bought up even more of the smaller meat producers.</p> <p> We cannot have a sustainable agriculture sector dominated by these corporate companies and we cannot have a response to climate change that allows this dominance to continue.  We cannot sustain rural Ireland or rural farming communities with this model, which grants to some massive and largely tax-free profits but leaves farmers struggling and workers sick.  In addition to needing a regulator with a strong input, we need strong unions.  We need unions in the factories that will stand up against the gross exploitation of the workers, insist on proper, safe conditions and appropriate pay, and address the outstanding issue of making sick pay available to all workers.  Together, workers and farmers have the same interest in releasing the grip of the corporate giants in the industry over their livelihoods.  Together, they can work towards a just transition to complement climate mitigation.</p></speech>

Everybody in the House agrees it is time to see more transparency in terms of understanding our agrifood sector overall and the challenges facing primary producers in particular and also understanding how what we make finds its way to end markets and the supply chain considerations in that regard.  There is a need for a significant review and analysis of the agrifood sector, but particularly of the challenges facing the beef sector.</p>  <p>  We have had significant discussions in the House in recent weeks on sustainability.  This is the new buzzword in our economy.  Environmental, social and economic sustainability are referred to.  What do they actually mean?  Addressing the environmental challenges that revolve around greenhouse gas reduction and the intensification of our agrifood sector seem to be in opposition.  We can understand social sustainability as what I would describe as the retention of regional and rural Ireland, with a vibrant and viable economy.  Economic sustainability is the ability of Ireland Inc., as an exporting nation, to be competitive in exporting in the future.  The beef sector has 70,000 beef farmers and there are 10,000 involved in processing.  The sector is worth over &euro;2.5 billion annually to the Exchequer.  Ireland is the fifth largest producer of beef in the world.  We have an important agri-sector and the beef sector is important in its own right.  There are questions over who controls the market, however.  It is certainly not the primary producers.  Is it the processors?  They have a part to play but I suggest to the House that a significant part of the problem is what the retailer and consumer are prepared to pay for the end product.  I worked in the meat sector for several years many years ago and understand fully the difficulty in trying to market internationally.  The end price is largely dictated to the consumer by the multiples and through their activities.  Those in meat processing are subject to meat brokerage and meat arbitrage.  Some meat cuts lie around for 12 months before they are sold.  People have to understand that there are significant costs within the supply chain.</p>  <p>  Rather than welcoming the appointment of a regulator, I would welcome the appointment of a food ombudsman.  This was highlighted by the beef task force.  This could do a lot to address transparency.  Farmers need to be careful about what they wish for in terms of a regulator.  There could be further regulation at the primary food production end and that might not be what people need.  Therefore, there needs to be transparency in retailing.  I have a particular problem with below-cost selling and loss-leading, which is a significant factor in Irish multiples&rsquo; sales.  I said in the House some weeks ago that a pound of frozen pizza sometimes sells in supermarkets for more than the price of choice cuts of Irish beef.  That is a significant regret for everybody in the House.</p>  <p>  We have to find a way to achieve differentiation in respect of the Irish beef export market.  We have to align Government policy with that process.  We must have transparency, certainly on pricing.  We must have fairness and equity regarding what is being paid to primary producers but we must also see a sustainable pathway indicating how farmers will receive a ready and adequate return for the work they do, which is so important to our national economy.  As other Deputies have said, it is a question of how we are going to deliver equity and fairness for farmers in the future.  I welcome the debate and hope the Minister will provide further opportunities for debate on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="11:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600016#O00300"><p>I welcome the motion.  I welcome the fact that the Rural Independent Group is calling for a beef regulator.  The beef industry in this country is a national disgrace.  We have a system built on the poverty and misery of tens of thousands of beef farmers.  We have many markets that are dysfunctional.  While I am thinking of housing and insurance, I am definitely thinking of the beef sector.  There is an oligopoly whereby a small number of factories make hundreds of millions of euro in profit annually, much of which is taxed abroad, yet there are tens of thousands of farmers who are forced to sell their beef at a price below the cost of production to those factories annually.  We have supermarkets with big pictures of farmers standing in their fields beside their counters that pretend they are interested in their corporate responsibility but they are forcing a price through the market, which means the farmers&rsquo; earnings are lower than the cost of production.  It is an absolute disgrace.</p>  <p>  There are several reasons for this.  The Government is seriously deficient in economic expertise.  A typical leaving certificate economics class would have more economic know-how than the Cabinet.  The relationship between some of the governing parties and the factories in this country is too close.  Incredibly, the Fine Gael Chairman of the agriculture committee of the last D&aacute;il said it was unreasonable to expect a guaranteed price above the cost of production for farmers.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy at the committee, who is now the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, agreed.  That shows the instinct within Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is not to have a fair price for farmers.  Aont&uacute; drafted a Bill called the Equitable Beef Pricing Bill, which seeks to put a floor under the price of beef just for one year and that reflects the cost of production which would be identified by Teagasc to force the beef factories to negotiate properly with the farmers on a fair price.</p> <p> The beef sector is extremely profitable.  There are three elements to the supply chain, namely, farmers, factories and supermarkets.  However, the profits are located in the two latter elements of that chain and are being taken away from farmers.  As a result, farmers leave the land every year.  Teagasc reckons that only 37% of farmers are able to make a living off farms independently, 35% are only in farming because they work off the farm to make sure they can earn a living and 30% are making a loss and going into debt because of the economic structure in the beef sector.</p> <p> I have stood at the gates of beef factories up and down this country with farmers while they were holding their protests.  They were told that there would be light at the end of the tunnel and there would be fairness in the production system but they have not received it as of yet.  Every week, they put in 60 or 70 hours of work to finish up with a price below the cost of production.  This is allowed to happen.  I welcome the fact that the Rural Independent Group has brought forward this motion.  Every tool necessary needs to be brought to bear to make sure we have proper checks and balances over the beef sector in order that all the elements of the supply chain - farmers, factories and supermarkets - get a fair price for a fair day's work.</p></speech>

Anybody who thinks an ombudsman - and I think the Government is looking that way - will solve anything is delusional.  Every day, we all write letters to constituents telling them to go to the Ombudsman.  What happens?  Nothing.  We need a regulator with teeth who can seize computers to find out what is happening.</p>  <p>  This time last year, beef was priced at 350 or 360 cent per kilogramme.  Today, we have a deficit of 100,000 cattle.  There is no four-movement rule at the moment.  The authorities do not mind if 24 movements take place.  There is also no 30-month rule.  All they want is cattle because there is a deficit of 100,000 animals this year and they will pay 415 or 420 cent per kilogramme for an animal aged 36 months or over.  Last year, farmers had to have them under 30 months and three movements applied.  This just shows what is happening.  The beef task force should be abandoned.  Introducing weighing scales in factories was spoken about but it never happened.  I know of an incident where a grading machine was not working in a factory and it was removed.  The Department was supposed to look at that day in and day out.  How much of a loss is that to farmers around this country?</p>  <p>  I support what the Rural Independent Group has done now that our turn has come.  Deputy McNamara and I will put together a Bill regarding a regulator.  Deputy McNamara has put in most of the work.  I believe that if we do not cut to the chase, there will be one loser in all of this.  The farmer is the price taker and the factories and retailers are the price makers.  Reports are being produced by people who obviously do not understand too much about the beef industry saying, "Well, they're not making that much out of it".  People should look at the price of beef today and last year and the price of beef on the world market.  Bring an animal to England today and it will be &euro;250 to &euro;300 for the same animal killed in England as is killed here.  If that does not show us that there is something seriously wrong in the market here, we might as well give up.</p></speech>

As he indicated, we will prepare a Bill if the Government falls short on this.  It is generally accepted that we live in an information age.  Information is everything.  He who has information has power.  All of the information and all of the power reside with the processors because all of the information available to the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and his Department is available to the processors.  They know how many cattle are in this country at any given time and the age of each and every one of those cattle.  If they have a rule that those cattle must be sold at 30 months, they know how much they can offer because they know what the demand is because they control the market.  There are only four of them.  There are two very big players and two slightly smaller players, but the four of them control the whole market so they know what the demand is and what the supply is because they can just look at the computer, see how many cattle are approaching 30 months and ask themselves what they will pay.</p>  <p>  They also know that every time the Government gives money to producers, who, for want of a better word, are being screwed - that is not unparliamentary language - by the practices of those processors, they can take that into account.  If the Government gives &euro;100 per head to compensate farmers for the fact that prices were so low because the processors can manipulate the situation to make them low, they can take &euro;100 off the price of cattle and take that for themselves.  That is precisely what they have done.  They have forward contracts with certain producers - not very many - but they do have some forward contracts.  They also have farmers who provide so-called bed and breakfast arrangements knowns as feedlots.  These are often farmers who over-extended, found themselves in difficulty and were not in a position to keep going so they will now house cattle owned by the processors.  Of course, processors can take those cattle out of the feedlots when demand is high and supply is low from ordinary farmers and use that to manipulate the market so they have all the levers of power and farmers have none.</p>  <p>  The only power ordinary farmers have involves live exports and, of course, the Department makes it very difficult for live exports from Ireland in terms of the number of inspections Department vets carry out on boats.  Of course, boats have to be of a certain standard but there should be a common European standard.  There is a suspicion among farmers regardless of whether it is properly founded or not that it is being made overly difficult for people to export live animals in order to protect the processors.  All of the levers of power are with the processors and none of them are with the producers.</p>  <p>  Like the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, I grew up on a farm and know what is like to stay up all night with a cow that is calving.  I do not do so at the moment as I engage in dry stock but I know what it is like to pay X amount for cattle in the spring and be hammered in the autumn because I have no idea how many cattle are going to be coming on stream in the autumn but the processors do so they have that power.</p>  <p>  I am asking the Government to intervene in order to level the playing field.  That is what this is about.  Unlike the approach adopted by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, as referred to by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the Spanish Government has introduced a bill to ban selling cattle at below the cost of production.  We need to look at that.</p></speech>

Beef farmers have consistently been unable to earn a living wage and are only sustained by direct payments from CAP.  Factory owners have acted in concert to keep prices to farmers down and in the process, have forced farmer-owned factories out of business.  This has led to a <i>de facto</i>cabal of private meat factories that using the best financial and taxation advisers have evolved into major property and landowners.</p><p>The study of the beef sector being undertaken by Grant Thornton is virtually valueless.  Aldi, which is one of the stakeholders, has stated that it believes this is due to the non-engagement of other stakeholders, including retailers.  The deck is stacked against the primary producers, with no information on the value of the fifth quarter heights and no requirement on stakeholders to supply all of the information.</p><p>Farmers face more and more requirements to meet increasingly stringent requirements imposed by bodies such as Bord Bia and others that deliver no proportionate return to farmers but merely add to the earnings of meat factories and multiple retailers.  I have not even mentioned the impact of the feedlots.</p><p>Beef production is a vital part of the fabric of the rural economy, particularly in my constituency.  Unless we get a beef regulator with statutory powers who will look at the full underlying structure of the beef industry in Ireland, that fabric will unravel.  In fact, it has already started.</p></speech>

My mother took over the enterprise at home after my father passed away until I was old enough to take it on.  I know what it is like to derive one's sole income from farming, along with the pressure and work that goes with that.  I assure Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and others that the Government is determined that we have a strong and vibrant beef sector for the next generation.</p><p>I extend to the House the apologies of the Minister, who is in Brussels and who cannot be here for this important debate.  We all agree that the work he is doing in Brussels as part of the CAP trilogues is important for all farmers and primary producers.</p><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment regarding the establishment of a new authority, to be called the national food ombudsman, or similar, to enforce the unfair trading practices, UTP, directive.  As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, stated, it is envisaged that the body to be established will have powers which go beyond those outlined in the UTP directive.  Public consultation on the issue closes today and this will feed into the direction of development of the office.</p><p>I draw Deputies' attention to the fact that Ireland is one of the first of the EU member states to transpose the UTP directive into national legislation.  This is credit to the hard work of the officials in my Department and to the clear commitment of the Government to pursue as many measures as possible to ensure fairness, equity and transparency in the agricultural and food supply chain.  The establishment of this office is what the Government has committed to delivering.  It will be delivered in a way that optimises its usefulness to supply chain actors and consumers.  However, as the Minister previously stated, the office will not have the authority to determine commodity prices.  Neither the Minister nor the Department has or can have a role in determining price for any commodity.  We are not in a position to set up any entity which will run contrary to existing competition law.  If Members wish to examine this issue further, as part of the beef task force agreement the Department commissioned and published a summary of competition law issues as relevant to the Irish beef sector.  This report is publicly available on the <i>gov.ie</i>website.</p><p>There is no denying the importance of transparency in building the trust along the supply chain necessary to develop an economically and environmentally sustainable sector.  This is an area that we have also actively pursued since taking office.  The report done on competition law for the beef task force formed one of a series of three reports.  A further report on market specifications and requirements has also been published and is available on the <i>gov.ie</i>website.  A draft of the third and final report on the price composition along the supply chain has been made available to task force members.  Their comments will be considered before the report is finalised and published, hopefully in the near future.</p><p>These reports are useful in adding to transparency on the way the sector operates.  There have been a number of other transparency initiatives completed under the auspices of the beef task force, including the enhancement of the Department&rsquo;s beef price watch app and the establishment of the new Bord Bia market tracker.  The Bord Bia market tracker presents data on a range of indicators in an accessible format.  This includes price comparisons, a comparison of Irish composite prices for all product, as well as for prime cattle, with an export benchmark price, which reflects the relative importance of key markets for Irish beef.  It also includes an index of wholesale and retail prices, along with a by-product market indicator.</p><p>Both of these initiatives, which were part of the beef sector agreement, have also contributed to increased price transparency in the market.  I should note that my Department already collects and publishes a range of date on the beef sector.  My Department is responsible for collating and reporting meat prices, as well as other data, every week to the EU in the context of the EU market observatories.  The Department then uses this and other data to compile and publish a weekly meat market report with price, production and trade data.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new office of the national food ombudsman will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  We have worked on improving the transparency of this data in recent years.  As I have already noted, neither the Government nor its agencies can have a role in the determination of commodity prices.  However, it is possible to strengthen the position of sellers in the marketplace by supporting collective action through producer organisations, by improving transparency and by prohibiting unfair trading practices.  My Department is taking action in all these areas.</p><p>Producer organisations are an important part of the toolkit in building resilience in the sector by strengthening the position of the primary producer in the supply chain.  Funding providing support for the establishment of beef producer organisations is available under the outgoing rural development programme and will continue to be available in the transitional period.  My officials have engaged extensively with potential groups since the inception of the measure in 2016.  One of the commitments from the beef talks in August 2019 was that my Department would engage to the fullest extent possible to assist with the establishment of beef producer organisations.  This commitment was clearly demonstrated though the engagement with the organisations which have been established, which have publicly acknowledged the high level of support that they have received from Department officials in this regard.</p><p>The establishment of the producer organisations is an important and timely signal to farmers that they can collectively do business in a way that enables them to have increased bargaining power, as well as helping them to increase their economic and environmental efficiency through collaboration with the potential for enhanced knowledge sharing and economies of scale.  My Department is exploring how best to facilitate the further development of producer organisations under the new CAP.  We made a firm commitment in the programme for Government to support the establishment of more producer organisations in the beef sector which we are actively pursuing.  This will strengthen the position of farmers and primary producers in the supply chain.</p><p>Another commitment in the programme for Government aimed at supporting the competitiveness of the sector was the development of an application for protected geographical indication, PGI, status for Irish grass-fed beef.  The development of this application was also an action under the beef sector agreement of 2019.  After an extensive consultation process with stakeholders, a PGI application for Irish grass-fed beef by Bord Bia, on behalf of producers, was submitted to the European Commission last November.  The European Commission has recently responded to this application with detailed technical queries which are now being examined.  If approved, PGI status has the capacity to broaden the range of markets and market segments in which Irish grass-fed beef can compete and to add to its existing reputation as a quality product.</p><p>Encouragingly, despite an extremely challenging year, agrifood exports totalled &euro;14.3 billion in 2020.  Beef exports fell marginally by volume and value in 2020 by 4%.  However, we must remember the challenging circumstances of 2020.  The Government categorised farming and food production as essential services under the Covid-19 regulations.  Since the start of the pandemic, my Department has been focused on ensuring that business and services to farmers can continue, keeping food and other processing facilities operational, as well as ensuring payments and commercial activities necessary to protect farm incomes can continue.</p><p>We have worked closely with all sectors in this regard, none more so than the meat industry, in ensuring that plants remained operational, which is important for primary producers in having an outlet for their stock.  However, ensuring that the health of workers was protected was the Government&rsquo;s priority at all times.  The relevant and detailed public health advice has been implemented.  My Department&rsquo;s statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is to ensure that Department-approved meat plants operate in compliance with the EU&rsquo;s food hygiene legislation, animal health and animal welfare standards.  However, in the current circumstances, in addition to this statutory role, my Department is continuing to provide any support required to the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority at local and national level.</p><p>Many challenges facing the sector remain but so does the opportunity to collectively rise to them to develop a sector that is economically, environmentally and socially sustainable, while recognising that we need to do this in a way that delivers for all stakeholders, in particular for farmers as primary producers.  Continuous, strong and meaningful engagement from stakeholders in the beef task force, as well as in processes such as the development of the office of the national food ombudsman and the development of the new CAP strategic plan, will be central to achieving that aim.</p><p>Deputy Sherlock raised a concern about the UK-Australia trade talks.  As Minister of State with responsibility for new market development and maintaining existing markets, I take a keen interest in such trade negotiations.  We continue to monitor the details of such negotiations.  While the outcome is out of our hands, it is worth bearing in mind that Bord Bia research shows that British consumers have a very high regard for Irish beef, regarding it with the same level of trust for their own British beef.  Bord Bia continues intensive marketing in the UK.  If PGI status is approved, it could significantly help with our premium markets which is absolutely key.  It is about increasing value for our primary producer by accessing higher value markets.  Recently, we had success in this regard in Japan.  It normally was just for beef tongue and offal.  Getting access for Irish beef mince and burgers to the Japanese market has been a significant development which could make a big difference for farmers and primary producers.</p> <p>I thank Deputy Carol Nolan and the Rural Independent Group for raising this important issue and giving us an opportunity to put on the record the work that we are doing in this area to safeguard the future of the beef sector in Ireland.</p></speech>

My father was born in 1911 in Banogue, Croom, County Limerick.  My mother was born in the 1930s in Cloverfield, Dromkeen.  My father's family were Fianna F&aacute;il, my mother's family were Fine Gael and they bred an Independent.  We have an independent voice here today.  They would be so disappointed in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael because of how much waffle the two parties have given us for a hundred years.  We are sick of it.  It is the same spin and waffle all the time.  They have let the farming community and the parties down.  There are so many Independents in this House because the Government has let the farming sector down.</p>  <p>  Since I was elected to this D&aacute;il, the Rural Independent Group has raised the beef industry and the four groups that are controlling the market.  I have asked the Department to investigate the feeder farms that are supplying these factories monthly or quarterly, not annually.  They are owned by the factories and they are paying a lower price than beef farmers pay.  We ask the Government not to sell out its heritage or the farming and beef sectors.  It is selling us out and it should listen to the Independent Deputies.  We are farmers.</p></speech>

I am perplexed by the Government.  I did not hear anyone move an amendment.  The Government seems to have adopted a habit recently of allowing these motions to pass to let its backbenchers off the hook.  Government Deputies can stand at the factory gates with the farmers and say they are with them, which makes a mockery of them, as Deputy O'Donoghue said.  Farmers are smart, well-educated people who understand a three card trick when they see one.  That is what is happening today.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, includes a commitment to "Ensure fairness, equity, and transparency in the food chain by establishing a new authority".  This will be another quango to be set up with a brass plate on the wall, big seats and fancy furniture.  It will be another cabal.  That is what we will have.  We want a regulator with teeth and we will probably have to go outside the country to get one if we get the legislation passed.  We will introduce a Private Members' Bill to put this into action.  The regulator has to have teeth and powers, unlike all the other regulators we have.  As Deputy O'Donoghue and others said, what is going on in this country is like rubbing butter on a fat sow's you-know-what.</p>  <p>  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in, People Before Profit, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party and the others who supported our motion.  They know what is going on.  The beef tribunal told us what was going on 30 years ago.  It was as clear as the nose on our face.  The cheek of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il; they are in bed with the beef moguls.  At least Deputy Heydon, and the Minister of State from Athlone, Deputy Peter Burke, were born and reared on farms and understand farming, although they can see the sector being diminished before their eyes.</p>  <p>  I will not give a history lesson about where I come from.  Everyone knows that I come from the mountains in Tipperary where we tried to eke a living from sheep farming.  A farmer left that hill in Kilnacarriga with six ewes.  Thankfully he had a fine family and we are here.  The lifeblood has been drained out of the people of rural Ireland.  There are 10,000 jobs for 70,000 beef farmers.  They know a cartel when they see one.  Some of the farming organisations are good.  Independent farmers came to the gates last year to bring Dublin to a halt.  It was not that they wanted to do so but that they were desperate.  They cannot keep trading at a loss.  I salute the mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters and the whole meitheal that used to be on the farm.  Now they cannot afford to keep anyone on the farm.</p>  <p>  The Green Party, through the programme for Government, will not let people build a house unless they are a designated son or daughter and have a landholding of 40 ha.  All the rest of the family can go to hell or Connacht.  Cromwell is back in the form of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with his policies, the 2040 plan and the planning regulator.  It is a dictatorship.  Where has democracy gone?  Where is the freedom that Dan Breen, Michael Collins and all the others fought and died for throughout this country?  We sold it out to big business, which is controlling us.  We cannot interfere in the market but the Government can vote through and implement the universal social charge or any tax it likes.  It implemented a carbon tax in the last Finance Act and we cannot even vote on it again for the next ten years.  It says we cannot interfere but we are not asking it to interfere.  We are asking it to stand up and face down four big beef cartels.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to sit the T&aacute;naiste down and explain to him what a beef mogul or beef baron is.  He does not know what they are.  For him, they are a figment of the imagination.  He was our Taoiseach and wants to be Taoiseach again but he does not know what a beef baron is.  Get the wellies on him and march him down to see the factory farmers.  Some are now owned by former IFA presidents.  They are screwing the very people who worked for the IFA and other organisations for years, and are still members.  This is what happens when they control the feedlots and we have the four-movement and 30-month rules.  We were told earlier by Deputy Fitzmaurice that these rules are an issue because the factories need the beef.  The rules were put in place by Ministers over the years at the behest of those funding the big parties and some Independents.  We know that.  It is quite obvious.  You get what you pay for and that is what the Government got.  It is destroying the farmers.</p>  <p>  We want rural Ireland to be sustainable.  All the money a farm gets is spent locally on contractors and local merchants, self-employed people and the people they employ, whether that is farm relief or ordinary labourers.  There were 10,000 jobs.  We saw during the Covid crisis the way workers are blackguarded.  Look at the conditions that workers in those factories are living in.  There are ten of them to a bed and maybe 30 to a house.  What kind of history and dirty linen are we going to have exposed in 30 years by countries that send their people here expecting them to be looked after?  Irish people went all over the world to work.  We worked hard and we were not treated too badly.  We were certainly not treated like that.  We were treated with respect and dignity.  There is no dignity or respect in this industry for the farmers, producers or workers, and the Government knows that.  It will happily continue to let things proceed so badly or it will set up an ombudsman.  We have ombudsmen for everything.  They are toothless, useless and fruitless.  They have staff, a team and an office, with a plaque on the front wall.  People can come in to make their complaints but they might as well write to Santa Claus because they would get better answers.  It is all a ploy.</p>  <p>  We are not only talking about the beef industry today.  I see the Taoiseach has arrived.  I welcome him back from Brussels.  He is well aware of his party's connections with the beef industry for the last 30 years.  He has been at the centre of Governments since the 1990s and he kept the previous Government propped up with the so-called confidence and supply arrangement.  The Government tells us that this is not going on and it is a figment of our imagination.  The Rural Independent Group will not stop until such time as we have some kind of fairness.</p>  <p>  The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, which was set up to deal with plastics, has become a monopoly.  It was founded by some senior members of the IFA.  It has wiped out the small producers such as Declan Doocey in Lismore and others.  Representatives of the IFFPG appears before the committee last Tuesday and told bare-faced porkies.  They told the committee that the plant in the midlands was recycling 50% of the plastic collected.</p></speech>

The IFFPG knew before that committee meeting that large amounts of contaminated plastic were being returned from Turkey.  It telephoned the businessman in question one hour before the committee meeting to discontinue his contract.  It has learned from the beef industry and is setting up cabals to exert control, regardless of farmers.</p>  <p>  We are proud people of the land and so were generations before us.  We had the Famine and recovered from it.  We had the War of Independence, the occupation of our country and the Black and Tans.  Now we have these people silently destroying our families and squeezing the life out of the farmers.  Farmers are going off the land and being hunted.  The land is being taken over by forestry.  People can plant forestry but they cannot get a licence to cut it.  It is more control by the Green Party and regulators.  The way farmers are being treated is bizarre.  They deserve better.  They deserve to be recognised and respected with a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and a fair price for their animals, not the control that we currently have.</p>  <p>  As for the task force, we might as well have children making and stirring Bovril because they can drink it.  They are stirring it around.  There are former Secretaries General in charge and they will keep the rules they put in place.  They will not make any changes and the farmer will not be any better off.</p> <p>We will all be lamenting.  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad?  T&aacute; deireadh na gcoillte ar l&aacute;r.

It is so sad with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael celebrating their past heroes from 100 years ago.  They are turning in their graves at what those parties have done to the country and they should be ashamed of themselves.  I wanted to push this to a vote but the Government has a new plan of not tabling a counter-motion.  I want to push it to a vote anyway.</p></speech>

We are very conscious of the fact that members of the Garda put themselves in harm's way day in and day out to keep our communities safe.  We express our appreciation for this and extend our solidarity to the two garda&iacute; in question and to the community in Blanchardstown for which this is also a very violent ordeal.</p>  <p>  On Friday, the Taoiseach will make his announcement on the next phase of the reopening of our society and our economy.  There is no doubt there is a feeling of hope and optimism as we look forward to getting back to some kind of normality.  People want to get back to work and businesses want to reopen.  As we head towards Friday, there are still 300,000 workers relying on the pandemic unemployment payment and a further 300,000 still depend on the wage subsidy scheme.  As the Taoiseach is aware, many of these people have not seen a day&rsquo;s work over in more than a year.  Despite the reopening, they are not sure when they will get back to work.  They depend on these income supports to pay the bills, pay rent, provide for their children and put food on the table.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach had planned to cut these supports from January but the onset of the third wave forced him to change his mind.  In April, he resurrected his intention to introduce cuts from the end of June, even though thousands of workers and businesses will still be prevented from earning.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the sectors affected include aviation, arts and entertainment, restaurants and pubs that do not have outdoor areas, as well as aspects of the tourism sector that cater for international visitors.  In addition to the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme, those receiving the short-time work support are also in a situation where their eligibility is coming to an end but they will not be back in full employment.</p>  <p>  For weeks, these workers have had a cloud of uncertainty hanging over them.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, said the Government would give clarity regarding the future of these payments by the end of May.  It is 26 May but these workers still do not know what they will face come the end of June.  It is unfair to leave them with this level of stress and anxiety.  Everybody wants to get back to work as soon as it is possible and safe.  These workers are not looking for big bonuses or the massive pay hikes that others have seen during the crisis.  They simply want fairness and an assurance from their Government that the rug will not be pulled from under them while they are still going through very difficult times.</p>  <p>  It is not good enough simply to say that there will not be a cliff edge.  These workers need to know they will not face any cut.  We have consistently said to the Taoiseach that so long as we have a public health emergency that prevents people from going to work or reopening their businesses they need to be supported, and I am sure the Taoiseach agrees with this.  Everyone wants to get back to work but the reality is that we will still face restrictions for some time and, let us say it out loud, we are still unclear and cannot be certain about new variants in the future.  It is clear that income supports should continue until the autumn at least.  This makes sense.</p></speech>

A total of 96% of the supply that comes in is being administered within a week by the HSE.  People have commented on the efficiency of the vaccination programme and how effective it is.  We have been very clear consistently in our interventions since the commencement of the pandemic.  Throughout last summer and the first six months of this year, the State and Government intervention has been unprecedented in supporting incomes and in supporting businesses and enterprises.  The entire rationale for this has been to protect as many jobs as we possibly can and to protect incomes above what they would otherwise have been given the impact of the virus on so many industries.</p>  <p>  Without question, the impact has been most significant on the hospitality sector, the aviation sector, the arts and entertainment sectors and a number of other sectors that are related to these areas, such as taxi drivers.  We have always amended our schemes with a view to trying to get more and more sectors covered by the supports.  The next phase will be how we re-engineer, and facilitate the rebooting of, these sectors of the economy over the coming six months.</p>  <p>  The national economic recovery plan will be the framework within which we identify the growth areas for the future and how we assist economic recovery as we reopen society in an effective way.  We have said there will be no cliff edge in terms of the reduction of supports and this remains the position.  The Cabinet subcommittee on economic recovery will continue to meet to finalise and fine-tune the national economic recovery plan.  We are very conscious of the significant difficulties in aviation for the workers in that sector, including pilots, cabin crew, ground handling staff and throughout the sector.  They have been out of work for a long time because of Covid-19, particularly because of the third wave.  There are also the related hospitality and tourism industries.  There will be good news in June for the hospitality sector, as hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and guest houses will come back on 2 June and outdoor dining and drinking will return on 7 June.  This is very positive.  We will be in a position on Friday to clarify what is possible for June and July in all of these sectors, particularly aviation, hospitality, the arts and sport.</p>  <p>  Last evening, two garda&iacute; were shot and wounded.  As I said in my statement last evening, it illustrates once again the extraordinary commitment and contribution of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the public well-being and the public interest.  Last night's incident illustrates that around every corner as the garda&iacute; go about their duty one never knows what can befall them.  I wish the two garda&iacute; a speedy recovery and thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its consistent support of the public interest and of our citizens as they go about their daily duties.</p></speech>

I want the Taoiseach to tell hundreds of thousands of people who are still relying on the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage subsidy scheme and the short-term work support that they will not experience a cut.  I make that request to the Taoiseach in the full knowledge that workers want to get back to work and we want to get them there.  We want to get business reopened and we want to do it safely.  We know we will not have a complete reopening of society and the economy in each sector overnight.  For those workers, can the Taoiseach assure them that there will be no cut and can he further assure them that the supports they rely on will be extended to the autumn at least?</p></speech>

Part of that plan will focus on the digital transformation and jobs in the new green economy.  It will also be focusing in on the medium-term framework for particular sectors that have suffered more than most as a result of the pandemic and factors relating to it.  That means evolving the supports towards the second half of the year and a proper targeting of those supports to facilitate growth because we want to facilitate people to get back to work in the different sectors as safely and as securely as we possibly can.</p>  <p>  If one thinks of what has happened over the past number of months, construction has come back.  Retail now has come back.  Our schools are reopened for quite some time and our childcare has reopened.  This plan is working and we have managed to keep the pressure on the virus whilst rolling out the vaccination programme.  That is our intention and we are mindful of protecting people and businesses and jobs to the optimal degree that we possibly can as a Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="12:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600021#T00300"><p>I also want to be associated with the remarks in relation to the garda&iacute; and send my party's well wishes for a speedy recovery and solidarity to both the garda&iacute; and the community who have been traumatised by this.</p>  <p>  Whenever the Government's housing policy comes under attack, the Taoiseach consistently tells us that the State, and not the cuckoo funds, is the biggest player in the housing market.  Let us examine this.  The Government has called its housing budget the biggest in the history of the State and, at &euro;3.3 billion, it is, but is our money being well spent?</p>  <p>  Fine Gael's Rebuilding Ireland programme had a construction target of 8,900 social homes for 2021.  Under the Government's revised plan, the target has increased to 9,500.  Given the Government has upped the housing budget by &euro;500 million, an additional 593 housing units does not seem like much bang for the buck.  Despite the fact that construction target has increased by 593 houses, the Government claims that an additional 28,500 households will secure social housing this year compared to Rebuilding Ireland's target of 22,157.  If construction has increased by only 593 units, how is it that social housing provision is increasing by 6,343?  The answer is the private rental sector, through an increase of 5,800 housing assistance payment, HAP, mostly, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenancies.  The Government's plan to proved social housing is utterly reliant on the private market.</p>  <p>  Long-term leasing deals entered into with vulture and cuckoo funds are rapidly increasing but we have no way of knowing how many of these are currently being negotiated.  Replies to parliamentary questions cannot be relied on, which is shocking.  The only reliable information we get is when individual local authorities speak to journalists and divulge figures.  The deputy chief executive of Dublin City Council, Mr. Brendan Kenny, has said that the local authority is negotiating for 1,700 long-term leases.  The Taoiseach stated that long-term leasing deals entered into with cuckoo funds are bad value for money and the prospect of local authorities being locked into so many for up to 30 years must fill him with dread.</p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach states that the State is one of the biggest players in the housing market, let us be clear about what he means.  In case there is any confusion, I want to clarify.  The State is prolific in the private rental market.  Obviously, that is through those supports I referred to, but it is also snapping up homes on long leases.  The State is also, via the strategic investment fund, pumping hundreds of millions of euro into large developments that are exclusively bought by cuckoo funds, and obviously that strategic investment fund is what is left of the pension fund.  The State is also determined to sell off vast tracts of land at rock-bottom prices.  Therefore, the State is a big player but on the wrong side.</p>  <p>  What is wrong with doing what we have always done, and that is directly building?  What is wrong with using the &Oacute; Cualann model at scale?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600021#T00400"><p>I thank the Deputy of raising the issue of housing which is the key social issue of our time and of our generation.</p>  <p>  First, there is nothing wrong with the direct-build model.  I want to see more direct build and I am supporting more direct build.  We are saying Government wants to develop that.</p>  <p>  The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, the Deputy referred to, has been in place since 2014.  I do not think the Deputy is suggesting that we switch off that scheme right now because that would mean thousands of people who are dependent, who do not have the incomes to buy or to secure houses, would be deprived of accommodation.  That is not a practical suggestion that we immediately wean people off that.  There has to be a phased rebalancing of focus in terms of direct building, increasing the housing stock of local authorities and of approved social housing bodies so that one reduces the dependancy on HAP and leasing initiatives over time.</p>  <p>  Long-term leasing is bad value.  Any public private partnerships, PPPs, or partnerships should involve the stock coming back to the State after such a timeframe.  That is my view and I continue to make that clear.  However, let us be honest also that the bulk of the focus over the next number of years will be on build in the social housing context but, more than that, in terms of the allocations and the provisions.  For example, &euro;690 million is going for affordability measures.  That will be the cost rental scheme, the shared equity scheme, the help to buy and Rebuilding Ireland.  That is to enable people to afford to buy houses in the private sector but it is very important that people are given opportunities and supports by Government to be able to buy housing at affordable levels.  The expansion of Part V of the planning Act to designate a range of homes for first-time buyers, and also for social, within any scheme is an important aspect of that.  The 400 units in the cost rental 25% below market values is a good initiative.</p>  <p>  We have brought 2,500 social homes back into use since we came into office.  These are local authority houses that were lying idle.  We gave specific funding to get them back into use.  This year, funding is being provided to local authorities to remediate approximately 3,000 units.  There is real urgency being applied to this issue.  I do not want to see vacant local authority houses out there.  That is, in my view, something that we can do quickly and in a focused way.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency Bill will provide social and affordable housing on their lands.  We need that legislation through to enable the agency to get going.  Also, there has been progress made in relation to family homelessness.  Overall, we want to directly build 50,000 new homes over the next five years.</p>  <p>  The real capacity issue for us as a country is delivery.  We are simply not building enough housing units, year by year, right now.  Covid-19 hit us last year.  It has hit us this year in terms of outputs but we simply have to get supply up.  Everybody, at every level, local authority level and national level, needs to put the focus on delivery and getting projects finished.</p></speech>

Essentially, that is what we are seeing because the scale of what is being built is being outstripped by the amount that is being spent on rents.</p>  <p>  If long-term leasing is bad, what is the Taoiseach doing about it?  One cannot rely on replies to parliament questions on this.  One hears about long-term leasing locally.</p> <p>It does not appear on a list anywhere in terms of what is negotiated or concluded.  We know what has happened.  There is a terrible lack of transparency in what is happening.  It is being pushed heavily by the Housing Agency.  There is a brochure on its website.  In terms of how Ireland is being marketed, there is reference to rental returns.  We are being picked over.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about long-term leasing?  It is going to be such a benefit to the sector that it will mean we will live on the never-never.</p></speech>

Everybody in opposition, including the Deputy, says this is an emergency.  Yet, they seem to think we have the luxury of voting everything down at the last minute when the project is before the council and all of the negotiations between council officials and other parties have been finalised.  The scheme to which I refer includes over 230 social housing units and 230 affordable homes in a housing scheme of 1,200 units.  Ideology gets in the way.  People say they cannot and do not want to support that.  There is always an excuse to object to something.  We all have our political or ideological perspectives.  For God's sake, we need to get houses built in this country and we need to get them going.  One of the biggest problems we have is delivery on the ground and getting shovel-ready projects started.</p></speech>

Ireland is an agricultural country with the best farm producers of quality food in the world.  Farmers were encouraged over the years to invest in good faith, with the belief that they were being progressive and their hard work and the food they yielded was and still is recognised as the best in the world.  They were assisted by Teagasc and other semi-State bodies to become gold standard producers.  The CAP was initially introduced to drive the agricultural sector to provide safe food, which is what it did, all for the benefit of the consumer, while applying the greenest methods available for the times we are in.</p>  <p>  Farming is the largest indigenous rural industry this country has.  It is rural Ireland's biggest employer, and has proud progressive producers.  The Government has pulled the rug out from underneath the sector.  It agreed to disincentivise the productive farmer by introducing convergence to increase the payments of non-productive farmers who have nothing to do but sit and wait for it to happen.  Why is the Government driving this policy?  Does it not understand that some of those most affected will be tillage farmers?  Does not realise that this is an anti-green policy?</p>  <p>  All it will achieve is to make tillage farmers non-viable and they will exit the industry.  It may be the case that this is not the intention of the Government, but that is what will happen.  The sector that we have relied on for carbon sequestration has been given the biggest kick in the teeth imaginable and left wondering what it is all about.  While we are past preventing convergence, the Government must understand the consequences of going beyond 75%. </p>  <p>  It may believe in some misguided way that it will level the playing field to go further, and it will, but not in the way that the Government or the EU expects.  It will level it in that the Government will make many farmers unviable because convergence, when combined with the proposal to pay eco-schemes on a flat rate per hectare, has a high risk of making more farmers unviable.  Many farmers will see a reduction of 40% in their single farm payments combining both schemes.  This cannot happen. </p>  <p>  Convergence and the new proposed eco-schemes are an attack on progressive farming.  What does the Government say to the next generation of progressive farmers taking over?  They are all capable, willing and able to adopt to the greening of farming in Ireland.  The Government is telling them to come on in, but do their worst and it will pay them more.  It is telling people to come from the top to the bottom when everyone else in the world goes the other way.  Can the Taoiseach commit that there will be no talk of anything above 75% on internal convergence and that eco-scheme payments will not be an addition to the basic farm payment and will not be based on costs incurred and income foregone, which will be just another form of convergence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600022#U00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very topical issue, as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is currently in Brussels working on CAP.  Of course, this Government did not introduce convergence.  That is the first point.  The focus of the Deputy's contribution was on this Government.</p>  <p>  This is a centrally mandated approach across the European Union and from the European Council and Parliament.  It is an EU mandated policy.  In the first instance, it is a system of redistribution of direct farm payment funds.  It has been occurring for half a decade.  It is a hugely emotive issue.  Notwithstanding the fact that the matter is largely decided on in Europe, there is room for negotiation and getting the balance right. </p>  <p>  There is room for negotiating as maximum a degree of subsidiarity as possible in implementing the proposal in Ireland.  The Minister is seeking the maximum degree of subsidiarity to deal with this issue.  He supports the EU Council position that convergence should be around 75% of the average by 2026, but we cannot guarantee that because the Parliament has pushed for 100% convergence.  Perhaps the Deputy could talk to Mr. Mick Wallace MEP or some of the other MEPs to try to focus on getting the Parliament to reduce its ambitions in this regard.  It is pushing for 100% convergence.  The Portuguese Presidency has put forward compromises of between 75% and 100%.  Negotiations will continue around that. </p>  <p>  The Government has, since 2020, paused further convergence until the negotiations in Brussels are concluded because we understand the issues.  There are winners and losers in the convergence process and programme.  I understand up to 60,000 farmers will have gained, and if we are throwing in the greening aspect the figure could be up to &euro;95 million.  About 54,000 farmers would have lost out.  It is a very difficult issue.  We are very conscious of it, as are the Ministers.  </p>  <p>  Since 2015 all EU member states have used this method of payment.  From the Government's perspective, we believe in food security and a viable and sustainable agriculture industry, as well as food production and food safety.  The Irish food production system is probably one of the most efficient, not just in Europe but globally, and is constantly working to improve its emissions performance.  That is a broader debate within Europe.  We want there to be more opportunities for others to increase farming incomes around environmental programmes and so forth.</p></speech>

I am very concerned when he tries to devolve responsibility for dealing on behalf of Irish farmers to the EU Council of Ministers or whatever it is.  What comes to mind is what my mother used to say, namely, if they jumped in the river would you?</p>  <p>  The reality is that the farmers of Ireland depend on the Government, regardless of when the process began, to negotiate on their behalf to ensure that convergence does not go beyond 75%.  Our fishermen are holding a protest in Cork today because this Government and previous Governments have sold them out.  There is nothing to be gained for rural Ireland from the way the Government is carrying on.  The eco-scheme I spoke about is another form of convergence. </p>  <p>  The Minister spoke on the radio this morning and denied figures from his own Department that farmers stand to lose up to 32% of their basic farm payments.  He denied that was the case, even though those figures have been produced by his Department.  I am very concerned that the Government is on the right road with the negotiations.  I ask it to do its best for what is our greatest asset.</p></speech>

In Ireland, citizens, that is the voters, are consulted every four or five years at the time of a general election.  However, institutions that are part of, or close to, the State have regular and daily access to Ministers, power and Government decision-making.  In fact, many Departments even pay these organisations to provide them with advice.  Is it any wonder then that the system is stacked against the ordinary man and woman?</p>  <p>  Today, and every day, Irish people are hammered by the Government's approach to taxation.  The marginal rate of tax, PRSI and USC on average workers now rests at 52%, while on the other hand the rate of corporation tax is 12.5%.  This represents a difference of nearly 40 percentage points and contrasts with Germany, where an average worker pays 28% in income tax and corporation tax is 26%.  In Germany, the same loopholes do not exist for large corporations and investment funds to evade paying tax while in Ireland, these loopholes mean that large investment funds, corporations and cuckoo funds pay little or no tax at all.  Google, one of the world's richest companies, was facilitated to move &euro;63 billion in profit out of Ireland in 2019 and pay &euro;263 million in taxes, thus representing an effective tax rate of 0.4%.  This means that for every &euro;100 earned by Google it paid 40 cents in tax, but out of every &euro;100 earned by the average worker in Ireland in 2019 he or she paid a staggering &euro;52 in tax.</p>  <p>  It is obvious what is going on.  One does not need to be a scientist to see who is getting special treatment here.  It is an utter disgrace of gigantic proportions to see the deep rot and hugely significant issues that are conveniently never debated in this House.  This needs to change.  The Government needs to come clean here.  Successive Governments have turned a blind eye to this behaviour and conveniently swept it under the carpet.  That does not resemble a socially just or democratic country.  These are not the values that our founding fathers fought for, those men and women who were brave and some of whom paid the ultimate price.  They were patriots and selfless men and women.  They certainly did not pay the ultimate price to allow, 100 years on, constant exploitation by foreign multinational corporations and to see our people punished and abused in that way.  As I said earlier, we celebrate them and we should live up to their ideals and standards. </p></speech>

Every Deputy in this House is elected at every general election.  I have equal respect for all Deputies by dint of the fact that they have been elected.  It is too easy a label to throw out there and it is deliberately done to undermine people, when we have a strong, functioning democracy in Ireland compared to other countries.  We also continue to reform our Parliament and we facilitate a whole range of groups in society to access parliamentarians, to influence policy formulation and to advocate for their interests.  There are aspects of our system that continually need reform but we should always affirm the strengths of Irish democracy as the world becomes more authoritarian.</p>  <p>  Regarding taxation, I do not know whether the Deputy is saying that 12.5% for multinationals is too low or is wrong as part of a wider model.  When he speaks about those who lost their lives or fought in the War of Independence, I often think of Se&aacute;n Lemass who was 16 years of age when he was in the General Post Office, GPO, in 1916.  He is a person worth studying in terms of how his life evolved.  He was an internationalist, he believed in joining international rules-based organisations and he was way ahead of his time in supporting access to the Common Market.  In the early 1960s he could see what was coming downstream and he wanted to prepare Ireland for it.  He did much work to get Ireland ready to join the EU, which is probably one of the best things this country ever did.  I am particularly proud of Fianna F&aacute;il's role in leading Ireland into the EU because it turned us from being an inward, insular island into a far more outward economy.  We have benefited significantly because of our membership of the EU on so many fronts.</p>  <p>  On the foreign direct investment model, over the past 50 years, since we decided to look outwards, we have attracted some of the best manufacturing facilities to Ireland, whether it is the Intels, Hewlett Packards or Apples of this world or the pharmaceuticals.  Only this week, Pfizer announced that mRNA vaccine technology will come to Ireland to be manufactured in Grange Castle.  That places Ireland at the centre of the manufacturing of vaccine substances which can be used in Europe and all over the world because it the fastest way to get vaccines out across the world.  That model will change over time and the OECD is looking at the broader framework governing corporate taxation.  However, it has worked for Ireland as a small island, which has to compete with other big players in the economic field.  We have attracted thousands of good-quality jobs in the farming and technology industries as well as the digital sector. </p></speech>

Merck Sharp and Dohme and other companies are doing great work.  I am saying that 40 years on we need to review taxation.  Why is the ordinary worker only paying 26% in Germany and 52% here?  There are no tax havens for those multinational companies in Germany because they respect its people.  We had a different issue regarding Germany last week.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned Se&aacute;n Lemass.  He and his Government colleagues bear no resemblance to those fine men and women of 1916 and 1921.  None whatsoever.  They have sold out to the EU.  We see that with fisheries.  Deputy Michael Collins has apologised for his absence from the House as he is standing this morning with the fishermen in Cork.  We see it with our agricultural policy, as Deputy Murphy referenced.  The Government is beholden to Europe and anybody that keeps it in power.  All these organisations have too much access to the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  The OECD has questions to answer as well.  We need to come clean, open our eyes, be fair to our people and treat them with respect.  The Taoiseach is some man to lecture about good democracy when he has trampled on democracy for the past 14 months and will do so again today by voting for more draconian measures.  He has some cheek.  </p></speech>

Those who earn the most, pay the most.  The overall taxation framework in Germany is much more onerous than is the case here if one takes all the social insurance and contributions that have to be made into account.  The Deputy is not comparing like with like there.  If he is advocating that we leave the EU, I disagree with him.  We have to work for a stronger EU into the future in the context of global challenges, the most recent being the cybersecurity attack on the country and its health service.  Whether it is climate change, energy efficiency or working together, if we work collectively with others, Europe will provide us with the most effective way out.  There is also, of course, the trading and selling of goods and services into a huge market, which is significant for Irish companies.  They create jobs by selling the goods they make and services they provide into that market.</p></speech>

As of this month, a total of 250 claims have been made against the State by women who were damaged and injured by the CervicalCheck scandal.  Court proceedings have been issued in respect of 190 claims and 31 claims have been concluded.  As of 12 May, there were 160 active court cases involving women affected by this scandal and, of those, only three have been transferred to the tribunal.  The 221+ support group is very critical of the tribunal, as the Taoiseach knows.  It has no confidence in it and says that it has struck an iceberg.  Equally, the women affected have no confidence in the Minister for Health or the process over which he presides.  Given the seriousness of all this, the ordeal the women and their families have been through and the significant public concern about this matter, what is the Taoiseach going to do?  This tribunal is not working.  How will he intervene?</p></speech>

It is the Government's view that the tribunal offers a number of advantages when compared with taking High Court proceedings, as outlined by Mr. Justice Meenan in his report.  The tribunal is up and running.  The Deputy is correct that three claims have been received by it and these have been advanced promptly.  It is our view that the tribunal offers a far more effective and quicker approach to getting claims resolved.  The tribunal is an alternative venue for the exclusive purpose of dealing with the claims promptly.  Of course, people have an entitlement to use the courts but we believe the tribunal offers a very good forum.</p></speech>

There is a view that we need to decriminalise the drug user - not decriminalise drugs or legalise them, but take the drug user out of the criminal justice system.

There is still a criminal penalty around abortion and there is still a three-day mandatory waiting period that has no medical basis.  The review of the legislation is coming up soon.  However, there is no clarity on the format and timelines involved.  When will the review be happening?  Can the Taoiseach assure us that it will draw on the experience of abortion care in Ireland and examine how the law and services are meeting the needs of those seeking and providing care?

The 47 people involved include Leung Kwok-hung, also known as Long Hair, the veteran democracy campaigner and left activist who spent more than 15 years in the Hong Kong legislature.  They have been refused bail and face jail sentences of up to life imprisonment if found guilty of the trumped-up charge of subversion.  Will the Taoiseach send the strongest possible protest to the Chinese embassy in order to register the opposition of the Irish Government and the Irish State to the trial of these election candidates?</p></speech>

The Government, working with our European Union colleagues, has already conveyed and articulated our deep concerns about what is happening within Hong Kong more generally, particularly as regards democracy being applied.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will continue to make representations on this specific issue and more generally about what has been happening in Hong Kong.</p></speech>

The scheme to support them, namely, the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, is to cease on 30 June.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that this scheme will continue, particularly as intensified infection prevention control measures will remain in place in nursing homes and there will be enhanced safety measures for residents, staff and visitors?  Removing the scheme would be akin to the decision to not initially prioritise nursing homes.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the TAPS will continue, as it stands, until the recommendations of the expert group on Covid-19 in nursing homes are implemented and the relevant resources provided?</p></speech>

It is important to point out that according to the most recently available HSE data from 10 May, more than 6,675 applications have been processed under TAPS and &euro;93.9 million in direct financial support has been provided to the nursing home sector.  In total, &euro;42 million has been made available for this year while &euro;92 million was provided in 2020.  There are also additional supports available for PPE, Covid response teams and so on.  The good news is that this was never meant to be a permanent scheme; it is a temporary scheme.  There has been a substantial improvement in the levels of the virus in nursing homes.  Serial testing is indicating very low levels of the virus.  Clearly, as society begins to reopen, these supports will be reviewed and the Minister for Health and his Department will be in touch with the nursing home sector to work that out.</p></speech>

Despite the fanfare to date, Project Woodland has not delivered one additional licence.  Farmers in the industry cannot wait any longer, nor can the construction sector or people who want to build homes.  There are approximately 5,000 applications for afforestation, forest road and felling licences in the system.  These are pending decision.  Based on the current output and the fact that 195 licences were issued in April, it will take a further two years to clear the backlog let alone process any new applications.</p> <p>This is bizarre; it is GUBU type stuff.  People cannot get timber.  It has gone up by 100%.  The sawmills cannot get it and cannot sell it on to merchants and people cannot roof their houses, build extensions or do anything else in the middle of a housing crisis.  This is pure and utter madness and it is unacceptable to the sector and to the farmers.</p></speech>

Clearly, there have been significant backlogs as a result of all the objections to a host of licence applications in recent years.  There has now been significant recruitment to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and a 90% reduction regarding aspects of this.  However, there are still backlogs.  I met recently with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, the Secretary General of the Department and the assistant secretary with responsibility for this area with a view to accelerating this process and ensuring we can introduce greater capacity to get these licences processed.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will not be familiar with the specifics, but I have emailed his office and the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Rabbitte, with the facts.  Seven years ago, a few families in Manorhamilton started working with Leitrim County Council and the HSE to provide this accommodation.  Family members are, of course, extremely worried that as they get older they will be unable to care for their loved ones.  Leitrim County Council is willing to provide the housing, but the HSE has stated that no funding is available to staff the facility for 2021.  After eight years, the HSE must commit to funding in 2022 and I ask the Taoiseach to use his personal offices to assist in this.</p></speech>

It is obviously a good and solid project in respect of the provision of independent living accommodation, which is something I strongly support.  I commend the council for proceeding to build the facility.  I will work with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the Deputies in the constituency and with the HSE to see if we can get a resolution to this.</p></speech>

It states: "all parts of Ireland must thrive if we are to prosper as a country".  Project Ireland 2040 envisages, approximately, an additional 250,000 people living in rural Ireland in the next 20 years.  If that is to happen, our planning policy must show some understanding of rural Ireland and of the needs and rights of the children of farm families to continue living on their family lands as they have done for generations.  When is it proposed that we will see the publication of the sustainable rural housing design guidelines?  Will those guidelines protect the rights of the children of farm families to continue living on their family farms?</p></speech>

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is currently preparing updated rural housing planning guidelines which will continue to allow for the development of homes in rural areas, while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns to avoid overdevelopment.  He expects to receive an initial draft of the development guideline document in the coming weeks.  There will then be a need for an environmental assessment, as well as internal and external consultation.  It is expected that the final updated guidelines will be available later in 2021.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that there has been strong delivery of new homes in rural areas in recent years, with planning permission granted for around 26,000 rural houses in the last five years.  In the same period, nearly 93% of that number of rural homes were actually built, which is in sharp contrast to a lot of what is articulated about house building in rural Ireland.  We only built 20,000 houses last year, and a significant number of those were in rural Ireland.  That is not often said.</p></speech>

The HSE and Clare County Council prohibited bathing in the area.  Raw sewage flowing through the pipes and out into bathing water has now occurred for three consecutive years, and this has now been in contravention of the EU wastewater directive for 16 years.  We had been hearing that the upgrade to the infrastructure would be completed this year.  However, Irish Water has now stated that it could be four years before modern sewerage infrastructure is installed in Kilkee.  Local councillor, Cillian Murphy, a party colleague of ours, and the whole community is up in arms.  We are asking the Taoiseach and the Government to intervene to put a spurt on to ensure we do not have to wait and to be 20 years in non-compliance with the wastewater directive.  We need clean and safe bathing waters in Kilkee.</p></speech>

Many Corkonians, indeed, spend their summer holidays there.  I will intervene and talk to the Minister to see if we can get this project accelerated, because pumping raw sewage into a bay of this importance is not acceptable in this day and age.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has allocated substantial additional funds to Irish Water to improve our overall performance in respect of water treatment plants and water infrastructure.</p></speech>

The answer given has been that the test would be going online, and I was delighted to see that it did go online on the Road Safety Authority, RSA, website yesterday.  Several constituents have contacted me about this issue to say that when they attempted to register for the test that the results keep showing no availability.  Is the system operational yet, or is this a glitch?  I tried it myself and it did not work.  The response that kept coming up was that there was no availability for any dates in May, June or July.  Many young people are seeking to sit the driver theory test to allow them to get a job at a local farm, perhaps driving a tractor, during the summer.  They cannot do that without having sat the test first.  How many people will be accommodated via this online method?  If the backlog cannot be cleared in a timely fashion, could a temporary W category licence be allocated to those young people?</p></speech>

The RSA has begun offering the driver theory test online on a pilot basis and, as such, only a limited number of places are available.  The RSA will offer more than 3,000 online tests in June and it aims to increase this number in the coming months, subject to the pilot not raising security or other issues.  A key priority for the Government is to move to in-person theory tests as soon as the public health situation allows to allow people to undertake driver training.  In light of the significant backlog of customers awaiting tests, the RSA is also working to increase capacity in its physical testing centres.  This will see the number of tests in centres increase from an average of approximately 15,000 tests per month, pre-Covid-19, to build up to 50,000 per month gradually, once the service reopens.  We are moving in a step-by-step approach to open driver training and testing and in recent weeks essential driver training and testing has been opened on a limited basis for non-essential workers, as well as motorcycle training and testing.</p></speech>

Last week, the airport was served a hammer blow by Aer Lingus when the airline announced that it was closing its permanent cabin crew base there.  Government Deputies in the region met the Taoiseach last Thursday regarding this issue.  At that meeting, the Taoiseach committed to meeting representatives of Aer Lingus to seek a reversal of this decision.  Obviously, the Government is in discussions now with the airline, which is looking for a cash injection, a bailout or call it what you will.  It is important that this cabin crew base is retained in Shannon Airport and that this is part of any deal reached with Aer Lingus, along with the airline's strategic routes which provide connectivity for business and tourism.  I ask the Taoiseach to update the House regarding the talks.  Did the Taoiseach meet with representatives of Aer Lingus and if so what was the outcome?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that I met with him, Deputy Cathal Crowe and all the Deputies and Senators from the region.  That meeting served to convey the sense of urgency and importance that public representatives in the mid-west, and in Limerick and Clare especially, feel about this issue, as well as the need for action concerning Shannon more generally and in respect of regional connectivity.  I made it clear to Aer Lingus that the Government's priority is regional connectivity.  Yesterday's decision by the European Council confirming the introduction of the digital green certificate in respect of Covid-19 to facilitate travel is an important development.  The Government will be considering this and wider issues concerning the support of the aviation sector, via airlines and airports, in the coming days and next week.  It is an issue which is really up there in terms of Government priorities.</p></speech>

We have a window of opportunity to use the powerful lever of Horizon funding to pressure Israel to end its apartheid regime.  The new Horizon fund, which is worth &euro;95.5 billion, represents a chance to hold Israel to account in respect of what the House agreed yesterday is the<i>de facto</i>annexation of Palestinian lands.  For Israel to access funding and the high-value research network relating to Horizon, it has to renegotiate a bilateral agreement with the European Commission.  First, the Commission needs to seek a mandate from the European Council to enter negotiations.  That is what is happening at present.  The Government needs to make clear at meetings of the European Council that it will not support any mandate for negotiating with Israel.  The Horizon funding represents a power lever that can be used to pressure on Israel.  Over the past seven years Israel has received &euro;1.24 billion in funding.  In comparison, Ireland, as a full member of the EU, has received &euro;100 million less than that.</p></speech>

However, I caution that we cannot overstate the leverage that can be gained from something like the Horizon fund in respect of this issue because there is not unanimity across the European Union with regard to Israel and Palestine.  Ireland has had a very strong position on the matter for many years.  Other member states do not share our perspective on the issue.  We succeeded in having an agreed conclusion this week in respect of the issue in the context of calling for a two-state solution and a cessation of hostilities.  The Deputy will recall, however, that it was very difficult for the Foreign Affairs Council to get agreement on the issue.  We will continue to raise this matter at all fora, from the Security Council down, in terms of the need for Israel to adopt initiatives and policies that facilitate long-term peace,but also proper treatment of Palestinians and movement towards a two-state solution.</p></speech>

People are being told that they will get appointments in a year or two.  That is crazy stuff.  These are young people who want to get on the road.  Their work is necessary.  I said it last week when we raised the same issue that there are young people in the farming sector who want to be able to draw in silage, save crops and make hay and silage.  There are youngsters who want to go out and do many different types of work.  They are all essential workers.  If they are going to work in a local shop that might be located five, six or ten miles away, that is essential work.  On behalf of the young people of Ireland, I plead with to put the necessary resources in place to allow them to pass their theory tests immediately.  Otherwise, they will be waiting months and, perhaps, as I stated, as long as two years.</p></speech>

Overall, almost 150,000 people have had their tests repeatedly rescheduled throughout the year.  Facing into the summer holidays, there is a real opportunity for people to take the test or have driving lessons and get the on-road practice.  There needs to be a reopening of in-centre testing.  A date must be set for that as quickly as possible.  The opening of the online portal in the past number of hours is a very positive move.  However, the numbers on the pilot are fairly limited.  Looking at the lengthy delays in respect of this matter, there needs to be a greater capacity to do online tests.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise with the Minister for Transport the necessity of quickly ramping up the online option.  The system is already booked solid.  There are no slots available today.  Capacity needs to be ramped up as quickly as possible in order to give drivers the opportunity to get on the road and get their lessons done.</p></speech>

He made a good point that the summer months represent a very good opportunity to get moving on this issue.  I stated that in excess of 3,000 online tests will be offered by the Road Safety Authority in June.  The authority is also working to increase capacity in its physical testing centres, a matter to which the Deputy also referred.  This would see the number of tests in centres increase from an average of approximately 15,000 tests per month prior to Covid, and will build up to 50,000 per month on a gradual basis once the service reopens.</p>  <p>  We will make further announcements at the end of the week in respect of the ongoing reopening of society.  Covid-19 has had the impact here, not Government or anybody else.  Therefore, the challenge is how quickly we can get this back up and running, given that it is very important for young people who are seeking employment and who just generally want to be able to get on with the process of learning to drive.</p></speech>

Do we support the extension of the emission trading system, ETS, to new sectors so that those who produce carbon efficiently can deliver European needs more effectively?  What is the Irish ask in respect of effort-sharing, in respect of which we did have a lower target recognising the strains relating to agriculture?  Have we sought to change how carbon sequestration is measured by the EU in order that the huge opportunity that exists in the context of forestry and land use in Ireland can be fully exploited?</p></speech>

Ireland was broadly able to accept the conclusions.  The Commissioner made a presentation.  What I would say is that a simulation or modelling exercise or a comprehensive impact assessment need to be carried out in respect of the effect of Commission's proposals on each member state.  That has not happened yet.  That is the next stage of the operation.  That will deal with the expansion of the ETS to other sectors, the effort-sharing aspect and carbon sequestration.  Quite a number of countries are also seeking to expand the latter.  Carbon sequestration would have positive implications for us in terms of land use and afforestation.  Countries like Sweden and Finland would be of a similar view to Ireland.  In terms of effort-sharing, we want to see the impact analysis and what will be the actual impact of the proposals on us.</p></speech>

Oncology services have been very badly hit.  There has been a drop in cancer screening, cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment.  A red flag has been raised this week by Professor Seamus O'Reilly, who stressed that delays in the identification and treatment of cancer can lead to increased mortality.  For every six months that there is a population-wide difficulty regarding diagnosis, it leads to increased mortality over a ten-year period.  We must ensure that the investments in budget 2022 are made in cancer care, in the urgent recruitment of more consultant oncologists and in diagnostics and treatment.</p> <p>I ask the Taoiseach to commit to that in budget 2022.</p></speech>

The issue has been to facilitate the safe return of non-Covid services.  The focus in the reopening of society on a cautious and phased basis was to prioritise the return of health services.  The cyberattack has hit that even more in terms of what it did to the Nimis diagnostic system and scanning capacity, particularly in radiology.  That is coming back in quite a number of hospitals.  There is no doubt that we will allocate resources and do everything we possibly can to restore services, particularly cancer screening programmes, oncology services and surgery in general.</p></speech>

Our approach is founded on the Good Friday Agreement and engaging with all communities and traditions to build consensus on a shared future on the island of Ireland.  I established the shared island unit in my Department to act as a driver and co-ordinator for this work.  Operationally, the unit is focusing its work in three areas: commissioning research, fostering dialogue and building a shared island agenda, including delivery of the commitments in the programme for Government.</p><p>The shared island unit is progressing a comprehensive research programme, working with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Irish Research Council.  The research programme with the ESRI is on the economic and social opportunities from increased co-operation on the shared island.  Research outputs will be published.  The 2021 work is examining aspects of health, education, enterprise and the services economy on the island.  Scoping papers on each of the ESRI research topics were published on Monday, 17 May 2021, and are available at <i>gov.ie</i>.  As set out in the scoping paper, ESRI work on education this year is examining patterns of educational participation and attainment on the island, looking at how education and training systems, including at third level, shape these outcomes and assessing what lessons can be learned.</p><p>More broadly, the Government is committed to working to enhance all aspects of North-South co-operation on the island, including in third level education, and to supporting a North-South programme of research and innovation, including an all-island research hub.  In budget 2021, the Government announced a shared island fund, with &euro;500 million being made available through to 2025 and ring-fenced for shared island projects.  The Government is working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government to progress existing and new cross-Border investment projects.  Our priorities for such investment are set out in the programme for Government.</p><p>On 28 April last, I and the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, launched phase 2 of the Ulster Canal restoration project, enabled by an allocation of &euro;6 million from the shared island fund and &euro;5.6 million from the rural regeneration development fund.  The shared island fund has also provided a further &euro;1 million for phase 3 of the project to undertake feasibility and pre-construction work, which has now begun.  The Ulster Canal is an excellent example of what North-South co-operation can achieve, as an amenity that connects towns and communities in the central Border region and a sustainable tourism initiative that will create jobs and be a linchpin for other economic opportunities on both sides of the Border.</p><p>I launched a shared island dialogue series to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue on our shared future on the island founded on the Good Friday Agreement.  I addressed a dialogue with young people on 26 November last on the theme of new generations and new voices on the Good Friday Agreement.  Dialogues on climate and environment, civil society engagement and equality on the island have also been held in recent months, with participation by the relevant Government Ministers.  The dialogue series will continue through this year, including with a focus on the economy, health and education on the island.  The dialogues are engaging with hundreds of civic representatives in the different sectors across all regions, communities and traditions on how we can work together to build a shared future on the island.  Reports on the dialogues are available at <i>gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

I will give a minute and a half to each Member, but it will be at the expense of the subsequent questions because we are going to run out of time in the overall 45 minutes.  Is it agreed to give each Member a minute and a half on this group of questions?  Agreed.</p></speech>

With regard to the shared dialogues, the Taoiseach said that hundreds of people have participated.  Is it possible to get the specific number of how many people have taken part so far?  The Taoiseach addressed what issues will be discussed.  Is there scope to move to either blended or in-person dialogues?  At what stage is this hoped to occur?  Ultimately, what will be the result of the shared dialogues?  Where will the reports go and with whom will they be shared?</p>  <p>  More specifically on North-South relations, we have discussed the importance of attendance at the North-South Ministerial Council many times.  Equally, it is extremely important for the Minister for Health to meet with the Northern Ireland Minister of Health in person as soon as possible.  I call on the Taoiseach to confirm that will happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600027#Z01800"><p>The point made by Deputy Richmond about the North-South institutions functioning is essential.  I see no good reason that the Minister for Health would not meet with his Northern counterpart.  That meeting should happen as a matter of urgency.  More generally, and particularly in light of the new leadership of the unionist parties, we need to recall that all the Good Friday Agreement institutions must work efficiently so I call on everybody to honour those commitments.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach about research commissioned by his Department as building blocks for the work ahead.  It is welcome that the research is taking place.  I also wish to mention other pieces of work being done.  For example, the Royal Irish Academy's project, Analysing and Researching Ireland North and South, complements the work of the ESRI and NESC.  The RIA is an all-island body.  It represents academics North and South, including those from a unionist background.  It brings together evidence bases, research and questions of policy.  It contributes greatly to the public debate.  Academics have said in different forums that the Government seems intent on adopting a Science Foundation Ireland funding model through research centres and they do not believe that is the right way to go about this.  The Taoiseach needs to give that some consideration.</p></speech>

We are very much at risk of a further breakdown in relations, and Mr. Poots is of the view that North-South relations have never been worse.  Ms Nichola Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, has sought legal advice on the boycott by the DUP of the North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  Has the Taoiseach received any advice on this?  The North-South Ministerial Council is a key part of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

It is about breaking down division and showing the value of unity and alignment from the bottom.  I gave the Taoiseach a concrete example of this a few weeks ago.  Taxi drivers affected by the Covid pandemic in the North have been given a financial package of up to &pound;3,000 to deal with overhead costs, insurance costs and all the costs and debts they have built up because of the loss of income incurred by Covid-19.</p> <p>I asked the Taoiseach, as the taxi drivers have done, to do the same down here.</p> <p> I understand the Taoiseach met with taxi drivers this week and still the Government, despite vague promises, has committed nothing in terms of a supportive financial package for an industry that has been decimated.  As the Taoiseach knows, the taxi drivers will conduct a large drive-by protest at Leinster House tomorrow.  The industry has been decimated and taxi drivers have asked for a supportive financial package that is similar to the one available in the North.  Let us start aligning North and South in a tangible way that means something to ordinary working people and take our lead from the good example in the North, where a serious financial package was put in place for taxi drivers.  Will the Taoiseach do the same for the industry that has been so badly decimated and the taxi drivers affected here, in advance of the protest tomorrow?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="13:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600028#AA00200"><p>We often talk in this House about sectarian division.  I want to say a few words about the exact opposite.  Some weeks ago, workers at the Hovis bakery in Belfast decided to take industrial action over the fact that they have been offered less than 2% of a wage increase this year.  Catholics and Protestants stood united on the picket lines for the 12 days of the strike, after which they won an 8% increase over two years, despite the fact that they had received pressure from the PSNI to disperse on the grounds of Covid-19 regulations.  The protestors organised their picket lines in a socially distanced and disciplined way, and won.</p>  <p>  They were visited on the picket lines by cr&egrave;che workers from Queen's University Belfast who have been taking various forms of industrial action since International Women's Day on 8 March.  They are, this week, escalating to a one-day strike.  This is in opposition to unilateral changes in their working conditions.  There is a theme here of Covid being used as an excuse by the management to try to force through those changes.  Workers stand in their way and workers are making a stand.  I wish them well and give solidarity greetings from the Socialist Party to both the groups of workers. They are an example to us all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="13:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600028#AA00300"><p>I welcome the fact that the Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland, ESRI, is conducting research on the economic and social opportunities from increased co-operation on the island.  I have read the scoping paper in detail, particularly the section on education.  We need to come away with clear actions that can be implemented to increase North-South co-operation on third level education and associated timelines.  We have been conducting reports and carrying out research on cross-Border co-operation since the Williams report in 1985, yet we have seen very little progress, particularly in student mobility.  Since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the cross-Border enrolment of students in third level on this island has remained unacceptably low.  It has, in fact, declined in the past ten years by 18%.</p>  <p>  In the North, students from the South account for approximately 4% of the total student population while, in the South, students from the North make up less than 1% of the student population.  We must ask why that is.  It takes the same time to travel to Belfast from Mayo as it does to Dublin or Cork.  We know many of the reasons.  There is a difference in the admission systems, an inequity between A level and leaving certificate grades, and a lack of information for students and teachers, particularly around access and supports.  I hope the ESRI will be instructed to lay out practical measures and actions that the Government can take to end this situation.  I firmly believe that if we invest in an all-island educational system, we will see the benefits not only in educational attainment, but also in creating an understanding of the many cultures and traditions across our island.</p></speech>

They movingly told of their experiences and what happened to them.  The actions of the British in murdering its own citizens 50 years ago were those of a rogue state.  The British took action to stop people finding out the truth in the intervening time and those were also the actions of a rogue state.  The British are now reneging on international agreements that they have signed in the past number of years.  Those are also the actions of a rogue state.  What legal advice has the Taoiseach got about what this country can do in international law to force the British to adhere to the agreements they have signed with this State and the parties in the North of Ireland?  We should be bringing the full weight of international law to bear on the British to make sure they fulfil their responsibilities, especially in providing justice for victims.</p></speech>

I do not have a specific number with me but I can refer him to the shared island unit which can give an update and briefing on the matter.</p>  <p>  We have been pressing for, and insisting on, full adherence with meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council.  We are being told that there is no deliberate policy of non-attendance at some of the sectoral meeting.  That is something we will continue to pursue and on which we will engage with the new unionist leadership.</p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned the Royal Irish Academy.  We are funding a broad range of research projects and are not committed to any one particular model.  Science Foundation Ireland has done a lot of work with the UK research and innovation centre.  That is important and it would be good for us to develop and fund expanded levels of research, involving North-South and, indeed, east-west co-operation.  We have, for example, already funded a range of projects under the Irish Research Council.  We are working with the council, which is obviously separate to Science Foundation Ireland.  A funding call is currently open for academic contributions across the strands of political policy and economic co-operation, and civic, social and cultural connection and understanding on the island.  Up to ten research projects will be funded, starting this year and concluding in mid-2022, as part of the Irish Research Council's New Foundations programme.  That is one area.</p>  <p>  The other area is working with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on a competition for collaboration between consortia, North and South, around specific research issues that would be of mutual benefit to all on the island.  That is also being worked on and a broad-based approach to research is envisaged.  The shared island unit and I are open to good quality proposals.  We want to see an element of competition for the research funding and a strategic approach must be adopted, considering the value of the research programme.  A whole range of topics are under consideration, including cybersecurity, biodiversity, technology and so on.</p>  <p>  We are pursuing a meeting with the new unionist leadership and will engage.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised a broader issue about adherence to the Good Friday Agreement and to all strands of it.  Dialogue is the most important and effective mechanism, as we have learned over the years.  That said, within the European framework, Europe is already taking legal action in respect of unilateral actions taken by the UK Government in respect of the commencement dates around the protocol.  Nonetheless, a process is now in place between Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič and David Frost in respect of the adherence to an international agreement that has been arrived at by the British Government with the European Union, which includes Ireland.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600028#AA00700"><p>The same point applies to the Stormont House Agreement.  There can be no unilateral action under the Stormont House Agreement.  There must be full engagement with all of the parties and, indeed, the two Governments.  That is the approach of the Irish Government to that matter.</p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked about justice for the families of the victims of the Ballymurphy massacre.  That is a matter for further discussion, as are a range of other issue across the board.</p>  <p>  In response to the questions asked by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I met with taxi drivers last week and had a constructive and lengthy meeting with them.  I will be reverting to the Minister responsible and the Government in respect of the issues raised at that meeting.</p> <p>One can compare like with like in terms of supports in the North compared with the Republic.  The Deputy's suggestion that nothing has been given here is wrong.  A range of supports has been provided.  The issue is the scale, quality and quantity of those supports and whether more can be done.  We must work to do more to try to facilitate taxi drivers, particularly as the economy and society are reopening, in order that we can deal with the issues they have that are specific to their industry.</p> <p> In the spirit of solidarity, Deputy Barry raised the issue of the workers in a bakery in Belfast and cr&egrave;che workers in Queen's University Belfast.  I welcome that the bakers got a resolution and successfully campaigned for improvement in their conditions and pay.  We also hope the cr&egrave;che workers can get a resolution on their issue.</p> <p> Deputy Conway-Walsh raised the issue of education and ESRI research.  The ESRI research covers cross-Border trade in services on the island of Ireland and work on the structure and composition of that cross-Border trade is under way.  The ESRI will then compare the primary healthcare systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland and draw implications for policy.  The ESRI generally does the analysis and research on implications for policy formulation and it is then up to the Government and other agencies to decide on implementation.</p> <p> On education, the ESRI will compare patterns of educational participation and attainment in the two jurisdictions and assess what lessons can be learned for the future.  One area that has not received the attention it should have over the last decade has been participation rates in third level education in all communities, particularly socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland, as well as levels of completion of second level education.  In some areas of significant socioeconomic disadvantage, progression to further and third level education has been far too low.  A very substantive programme needs to be developed by the two Governments, with the Northern Ireland Executive, to deal comprehensively, once and for all, with the issue of educational disadvantage in the North.  That will take time.</p> <p> Some communities that historically relied on traditional forms of employment, whether it was shipbuilding, textiles or whatever, have not quite made the same adjustments that have been made in other areas of Ireland that suffered similar adjustments in an earlier period but managed to bring in technology and other new industries, and also developed educational opportunities.  I believe that is key and I look forward to the ESRI report in that regard.</p> <p> It is not so much about saying we can create an all-island system.  There is an education system in the North.  We can seek greater complementarity.  I put forward proposals seven or eight years ago around curriculum complementarity, for example, the English curriculum and whether we can develop shared narratives around certain areas of historical study, and also around qualifications in terms of facilitating progression, North and South, to various third level situations.  That has worked over the years but it can be improved upon, particularly given the changes this year in respect of the costs that will apply to Irish citizens for admission to Scottish universities and third level institutions.  That will have implications for third level places here.  We are looking at potential tie-ups between colleges, North and South, and having institutions working together on certain programmes and projects, whether that is Ulster University Magee Campus working with Letterkenny Institute of Technology or other institutions or whether it is Queen's University Belfast working with other institutions.</p> <p> The ESRI is then looking at factors that could enhance the attractiveness of the island as a whole to high-value foreign direct investment, FDI, and identifying opportunities for greater co-operation and policy co-ordination.  As part of the shared island fund, we are looking at funding and being part of the city deals project, which is around investing in industrial parks on the Derry side and the Donegal side, with a view to combining the various assets, be it the skilled labour force or the FDI attractiveness of the Southern side.  It is about asking whether we can develop more FDI jobs in the overall north-west region and be facilitative of that.  The investment in those parks will certainly be a very important development and we look forward to the ESRI's work in that regard.</p></speech>

This Cabinet committee last met on 30 November and will meet again shortly.  I have regular engagement with Ministers, at Cabinet and individually, to discuss priority issues relating to their Departments.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of meetings have been held between my officials and officials from relevant Departments since the establishment of the Cabinet committee in July 2020.  The impacts of the pandemic across all areas, in particular arts and culture, have been considered by the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 and as the successful vaccination programme allows us to progressively reopen the economy, the economic recovery plan will set out how we will support the full resumption of economic activity and get people back to work.  In particular, we will be looking at the arts and cultural sector, which has been a consistent part of the agenda of both the Covid-19 sub-committee and the economic recovery sub-committee of the Cabinet.  We have worked on what types of specific supports we can provide to the arts and cultural and entertainment sectors and how we can facilitate their return now as society opens.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet economic recovery plan and the Cabinet sub-committee will obviously deal with broader labour market and enterprise supports.  We have been clear there will be no cliff edge.  As I said, in terms of live events and arts and culture, we will also continue to support those sectors in addition to investing in infrastructure and reforms to enhance our long-term capabilities.  In making those considerations, sectors such as live events and arts and culture, which are reliant on mass gatherings, will be given strong consideration.</p></reply>

In that report, Traveller children describe their living conditions as hell and say that because of these living conditions, they feel like garbage.  The report exposes severe violations of children's human rights due to insecure, unsafe and uninhabitable accommodation.  It lists rat infestation, damp conditions, lack of sanitary facilities and lack of heating among the very serious concerns it details.  What action is the Government taking to address the very severe housing problem faced by Traveller families, in particular Traveller children, and the very serious violations of human rights detailed in the report?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will be aware of the scarring and damage experienced by young people and children, particularly disadvantaged children, in the past year or so owing to the lack of in-school tuition.  The UK has provided a fund of &pound;1 billion.  The Government here has allocated approximately &euro;40 million for a summer programme.  Will the Taoiseach speak to the necessity for catch-up funding? </p>  <p>  Will he also speak to the need for all schools to retain their current teaching posts?  I am aware of a school in Ardfert outside Tralee that is losing a teacher.  A number of other schools have contacted me with regard to losing teachers.  Is it not time for a moratorium on schools losing teachers in order that we can repair the damage that has been done to children and young people over the course of the last year?  That was not the Government's fault, of course, but we must invest to drive down class sizes and overcome and repair the substantial scarring and damage that occurred in the past year.</p></speech>

My first question is whether the Government is going to do the pilot on basic income for people working in the arts.  Second, we have recently had a good news story with the reports about the Disney production, "Enchanted".  However, other reports suggest the film might more accurately be called "Disenchanted" when it comes to some of the people working on it.  Reports suggest, for example, that many of the performers and dancers found themselves being paid less and being denied the residuals or royalties for their work on the film under a so-called industry agreement that is shocking compared with the position and conditions those performers enjoy in films made in Britain and elsewhere.  In addition, stage crew from the Irish Film Workers Association who worked on the first "Enchanted" film - this is "Enchanted 2" - were picketing outside Disney because they have been blackballed by the Irish production company involved, which has received tens of millions of Irish taxpayers' money-----</p></speech>

The constituency is a great area in which to live but also has one of the deepest socioeconomic disadvantages in the country.  There has been a service, Hesed House, operating in Inchicore for people with mental health difficulties for 28 years.  Approximately 80 to 100 people pass through its doors each week and it is a vital service, particularly for local youth, schools and the provision of family support.  It is already in the heart of a deprived area.  Yesterday, staff received a telephone call to tell them the service is shutting down as the HSE has withdrawn its funding.</p>  <p>  This will be a huge blow to all the people who use Hesed House.  In fact, I think it will drive them back years.  The staff are deeply concerned for their users but we, as representatives, are deeply concerned for all of them, users and staff.  Young and old will be pushed back many years and will lose faith in the system.  It has been repeatedly said over the past year that as we go from lockdown to reopening, we have to look at the damage caused by lockdown and what it has done to people's mental health.  The Taoiseach and every Minister talk frequently about the mental health of our population.  Here is a prime example of a mental health service, staffed by volunteers and workers in the community, that helps people on a regular basis.  It has now had the rug pulled from under it.  Will the Taoiseach comment on this and will he intervene to save the Hesed House service in Inchicore?</p></speech>

The report, undertaken on foot of a complaint submitted by the Cork Traveller Women's Network and the Cork Traveller Visibility Group as a last resort after years of campaigning, concluded that Cork City Council had failed to comply with the minimum requirements of the law, had acted in a discriminatory fashion and had violated the human rights of the children living on the site.  The social affairs correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Kitty Holland, this morning described the report as &quot;the strongest report on children's human rights abuses in Ireland&quot; she had read in two decades in journalism.</p><p>Cork City Council is the landlord of the site and has the power to resolve these problems.  The Taoiseach's party is part of the ruling group on the council.  The message that urgent action needs to be taken must be driven home to the council officials and every elected member.  To that end, I ask the Taoiseach to make a statement here on the matter and consider making a visit to the site in question in the weeks ahead.</p></speech>

Its concerns are well founded as Departments plan for another budget without the data needed to properly inform budgetary decisions crucial to the lives of citizens with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach about two reports that are outstanding and would go some considerable way to address this data deficit.  The first is the Department of Health's disability capacity review, which was due to be published by the previous Government.  The second is research by Indecon commissioned by the former Minister for Social Protection two years ago to consider the cost of disability.  That report was due to be completed last year but the current Minister confirmed last week that it still has not been received.  The delays in these publications are not academic matters.  They are very serious.  Can the Taoiseach reassure all of us that both reports will be published, and published in good time, to help inform a budget that I hope, on this occasion, will do justice to, and recognise the very considerable needs of, our citizens with disabilities?</p></speech>

First, the report is a shocking indictment of all concerned in terms of the failure to develop plans for both the halting site itself and the housing that will be needed to deal with all of the residents.  The site is far too overcrowded and there have been many issues with it for a long time.  In my view, the council needs to take actions and decisions and implement them.  Not everybody will be satisfied and happy with those decisions.  My understanding, and I will be reverting to the council on this, is there have been lots of different initiatives and plans produced over time but they have not brought a resolution.  The consequence of that failure to get a resolution to a lot of the issues is children living in absolutely unacceptable conditions in terms of health, hygiene, quality of life and so forth.  It is absolutely unacceptable and the local authority will have to move decisively now in response to the ombudsman's report.</p>  <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point regarding catch-up funding for schools, the &euro;40 million allocated for the summer is a good and expanded initiative primarily dealing with special needs provision during the summer months but also with children who have been educationally disadvantaged because of Covid.  The Minister is looking at the next school year with a view to integrating additional supports to help students who may have fallen behind or who need additional supports arising out of the impact of Covid-19.  It is a very important and serious issue and the Minister is taking it seriously.  The Minister has also taken a benign approach to the reallocation of teachers generally to schools across the country and many of them have retained teachers.  Of course, the pupil-teacher ratio was reduced in the last budget, which was a significant move in itself, fulfilling a commitment we made in the programme for Government.  It is something we were very anxious to get movement on quickly.  Again, we will look at education in a favourable light, notwithstanding the challenges facing us from a budget perspective as we continue, we hope, our cautious and significant reopening of society.</p>  <p>  Obviously, education is critical.  We showed our prioritisation of education by getting our schools back last September.  A huge effort was made by all of the teams in schools, from parents to teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, school staff, principals and education and training boards, ETBs, right across the board, as well as all the communities wishing them on.</p> <p>We got hit with the third wave, we got the schools back up again and now we must ensure we can settle it down in the next school year.  We must do this in order to give the kids every opportunity we possibly can to grow and develop and overcome whatever negative impact Covid might have had on quite a number of students.  I have no doubt it impacted on their development, their overall well-being and their educational attainment itself.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the arts sector.  In the sector the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is working on the idea of a universal basic income and is doing some other work on that with other Departments including the Department of Social Protection to see what type of scheme could be developed.  I do not have the specifics of the working conditions or pay that apply to the Disney production, "Enchanted 2".  There may be an alternative view to the one the Deputy articulated and I am conscious of that.  Quite a number of times he makes observations and others do not often get the chance to defend themselves or respond.  There could very well be an alternative narrative to the one the Deputy has described.  Suffice it to say that all the regulatory frames governing pay and conditions should be adhered to and all the basic conditions the State insists on should be adhered to.  There is no excuse on productions of this kind for workers, artists or dancers to be left short-changed.  That should not happen because the purpose of such investments, of the facilitation of film-making in Ireland, is to provide quality employment to people working in the arts right across the board-----</p></speech>

Again, I am unsure if there are particular local or specific issues for why the HSE is withdrawing funding.  We have provided additional funding to the HSE this year for mental health services so it should not be an issue of funding.  However, there may be other issues.  I will ask the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Butler, to check this out and work with Deputies and Senators with a view to seeing what can be done to ensure services can continue for the users of that particular service and to look at what the story is here and why this has occurred right now, in the middle of Covid.  We have provided additional funding to mental health over and above - in fact, in one of our earlier announcements this year we allocated an extra &euro;10 million to mental health and particularly for community initiatives.  I do not see why this has happened here and I do not have the specific details of the centre, which the Deputy will appreciate.</p></speech>

That must come to an end.  All parties to this must agree to the decisions the council takes on this.  All parties to this must agree to the various proposals that have been put forward in the past and we now need cohesion and unity of approach to get this issue properly resolved, from a human rights perspective but also just for the basic well-being of the children and families concerned.  The initiatives in response to this must be agreed to and brought through because it is not at all acceptable that there be this level of deprivation and lack of access to basic living conditions.  There is also a very strong health and safety dimension to this which causes me great concern.  We have had very tragic circumstances in the past in respect of loss of life at halting sites where health and safety was just not what it should have been.  There is an imperative here to get this issue sorted once and for all because neither children nor anyone else should be residing in circumstances that are so poor for quality of life, but also for health and safety.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  By the way, I must tell the Deputy there is no ruling group on Cork City Council.  Deputy Barry served on the council himself before he became a TD and is well aware of the issue.  This is an issue we can all agree should be dealt with.</p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald raised the issue of the Oireachtas disability database group.  Again, when I was last in government, there was a comprehensive intellectual disability database which provided very good information which informed Government decisions and the allocation of resources.  This was likewise the case for physical and sensory disabilities.  That was developing at the time and seems to have weakened over the years.  We need more proper data to inform the provision of services.  We must also look at how services are provided into the future.  This should be from both the health and educational aspects, particularly for people with disabilities and children with special needs.</p></speech>

This Bill emanated from the Seanad on Monday, as we know, with a vote taken at the time.  I understand there is no pre-legislative scrutiny when a Bill is initiated by the Government or anybody in the Seanad.  It is shocking.  There are to be three different legislative measures on top of what we had in the Health (Amendment) Acts.  The lockdown has been the longest in Europe and instead of coming in with a vote on a sunset clause for the restrictions as promised for June, we will pile three legislative measures on top of this.  It is a dolly mixture with liquorice allsorts.  There is no pre-legislative scrutiny, which is outrageous for such serious legislation.  It is shocking that this could not be brought through a normal process involving the health or justice committees.  It is a three-card trick to cod us as well as codding the people.  I have seen enough of this and am opposed to this process.  It is shocking that the Bill will be taken with no pre-legislative scrutiny or proper debate, having come through the sneaky avenue of the Seanad.  It is rotten to the core.</p></speech>

There was a briefing for Opposition health spokespersons on this Bill because the health committee was asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  In that briefing, the officials made us aware that the Department and the HSE became aware of the need for new legislation as opposed to a resolution of the D&aacute;il some time back in March or April but it was only last week when we first became aware that the Bill was required.  We should have been made aware of this much earlier.</p></speech>

The people in rural Ireland elected us and we are meant to be acknowledged as a group.  The Ceann Comhairle has always done that but this is not good enough.  Not only will the Minister not answer questions but he is now ignoring our group when calling people to a health briefing.  It is the first I heard of it.</p></speech>

The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period of application of certain emergency provisions that have been key to providing for the Government's public health response to the pandemic.  The emergency provisions that are to be extended are in the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020, and the Health (Amendment) Act 2020.  On 9 June 2021, certain emergency provisions in all of these Acts are due to expire.  The Bill I am presenting to the House today provides that the operation of the emergency provisions concerned in these Acts be extended for an initial period of five months to 9 November 2021.</p>  <p>  The current draft before the House provides that any further extensions are limited to a maximum of three months at a time thereafter and each extension must be approved by a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  I am proposing some changes that I hope will alleviate concerns that have been raised.  We had a very good debate on this issue in the Seanad and I also received a letter from the Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  I have reflected on the debate and the view of the health committee within the wider context and whereas the initial five-month extension is warranted, necessary and proportionate, I understand the concerns that have been raised about possible additional extensions after that five-month period.  I have decided to seek Government approval to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to provide for just one further extension of no more than three months, subject to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I am of the view that given the current uncertain trajectory of the disease globally and the priority need to protect public health, progress on the vaccination programme notwithstanding, the emergency provisions are required until 9 November.  At the same time, however, I am deeply conscious of the extraordinary nature of the provisions in question and, in particular, their impact on fundamental and civil rights.  That is why I am now proposing that only one further extension of up to three months by resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas should be provided for in the Bill.</p>  <p>  We need these emergency powers to unwind the measures that are currently in place in an ordered and sustainable way and allowing one further extension of no more than three months is justified and proportional.  If we find ourselves in the position, which we all dearly hope we do not, whereby we need some targeted public health measures beyond February 2022, we would introduce another Bill and put it through the safeguards that the legislative process provides.</p>  <p>  The change I am proposing is substantive and based on the views expressed across the political spectrum in this House, the Seanad and the health committee.  I share these views.  These legislative provisions are the platform from which we can implement measures to provide for protecting our health service and for breaking the chain of transmission of this disease.  I know this House is fully aware of the continuing precarious trajectory of the disease around the world.  The epidemiological position in Ireland is stable but, as we are all aware, it is under constant pressure.  The incidence of Covid-19 is still high, albeit stable.  There are still considerable uncertainties around what measures may be needed over the course of the rest of the year but we are united in our clear and ongoing objective to slow down and minimise the impact of this disease, and in so doing to protect the health of the public and dilute its impact on both our society and economy.</p>  <p>  Some Members of the Seanad on Monday referred to these powers as draconian, which is not an unfair description.  I used the same description both as Minister for Health and when I was Opposition spokesperson when the initial legislation was introduced early last year.  They are draconian but the measures concerned have provided us with the necessary tools to stop the disease from spreading uncontrollably, especially any exponential spread, and help keep people safe, first and foremost.  Ultimately, the measures have provided the means to protect public health and keep people safe.</p>  <p>  Members of both Houses, both in plenary sessions and in the health committee, have also sought for the legislation to be reviewed.  This is entirely understandable.  In terms of the measures taken under the legislation, Government decision-making has been and is informed by public health, economic and social impact assessments undertaken on an ongoing basis throughout the pandemic.  As colleagues are aware, there is a very rich source of information available online through the minutes of National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, meetings, the papers discussed by the team, the analysis provided to me and the Government by NPHET and the letters of recommendation from the Chief Medical Officer to me.  They are all available online, as they should be.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently sought to introduce measures where necessary to protect public health and they are kept under constant review.  The measures have been tough and very challenging but they have worked and have saved lives.  They have stopped many things happening in this country that happened in other countries, which were deeply worrying to see.  We have had one of the lowest excess mortality rates from Covid-19 in Europe and the measures we introduced - and, more important, the public support for them - ensured our health service was not overrun.  Unlike in many other countries, although the health system was under very serious pressure, hospitals, emergency departments and intensive care units were not overrun.  That was thanks to the public backing the measures and the extraordinary ongoing work of our healthcare professionals.</p>  <p>  Vaccinations offer very significant protection at an individual and population level but it will be some time before there is a sufficient level of the population fully vaccinated.  Moreover, whereas there is emerging evidence on the efficacy of available vaccines, we still do not have full information on the impact that vaccines will have on transmission, the length of vaccine-induced immunity and the potential impact that variants may have on vaccine effectiveness.  In general, international agencies are continuing to advise the use of a range of non-pharmaceutical measures until there is a greater understanding of the role of vaccination on the course of the pandemic and there is greater impact from the vaccinations on the disease.</p>  <p>  Specifically with regard to the date of 9 November, as proposed in the Bill, this is a date that was informed by public health authorities, with the view being that the measures might well be required into late autumn or early winter, given that we expect to see a large amount of mixing indoors at that time.  As I have said, these measures are tough and have been very difficult.  We are all acutely aware of the impact of these measures on individuals, families, communities, businesses and so much more. They have come at a serious cost but they work and have worked.  It is all our hope that the measures will only be needed for a short time.  I have just come from a meeting with the Chief Medical Officer, following today's NPHET meeting relating to advice that will be brought to the Cabinet on Friday.  I am very happy to report, as I am sure Members are aware, that NPHET's view is the trajectory is positive, again thanks to the Irish people getting behind the measures day after day and keeping case numbers and hospitalisation figures low.</p>  <p>  I will now outline some provisions of the Bill in more detail.  The Bill is divided into five sections.  Section 1 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 to allow for an extension of operation of Part 3 of the Act from 10 June 2021 to the later date of 9 November 2021.  As I have set out already, I am proposing to provide for only one further extension of no more than three months, subject to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p> The Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 inserted new sections 31A, 31B and 38A into the Health Act 1947.  Section 31B allows the Minister for Health to make an affected area order.  The State has been deemed to be an affected area since 7 April last year.  Section 31A provides for the making of regulations for preventing, limiting, minimising or slowing the spread of Covid-19 to a region where an affected area order applies.</p> <p> Section 2 amends section 1 of the of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to allow for an extension of operation of Part 5 of the Act along the same lines, namely: that Part 5 of the Act is extended from 10 June 2021 to 9 November 2021 or the date specified in a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  As already stated, I am proposing, subject to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to provide for only one further extension of no more than three months.</p> <p> The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to adopt a cascading approach to the role of the independent consultant psychiatrist and the role of mental health tribunals, which review orders involuntarily detaining patients, whereby pre-Covid measures are retained in the Act.  Where it is not possible to operate these measures safely, provisions are in place to ensure the review of detention can continue remotely in the current public health emergency.</p> <p> Sections 3 and 4 provide for the same amendments and terms for extension for the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 and the Health (Amendment) Act 2020, respectively.  As indicated, I am proposing to provide, subject to a resolution of both Houses Of the Oireachtas, for only one further extension of no more than three months.</p> <p> The Health (Amendment) Act 2020 provides for the making of regulations to prescribe penal provisions in regulations made under section 31A of the Health Act 1947, to be fixed penalty provisions and dwelling event provisions.  The Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with statutory enforcement powers in relation to licensed premises and registered clubs, to ensure strict adherence to public health measures on premises where alcohol is sold for consumption on these premises.  In considering whether this Act should continue in operation, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, consulted the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris.  The Commissioner advised that if the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 was not extended beyond 9 June 2021, then members of An Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not have a clear lawful basis for entering a licensed premises to address breaches of the Covid-19 regulations.  Liquor licensing legislation would not provide a power of entry for the specific reasons of addressing breaches of Covid-19 public health regulations.  I take this opportunity to compliment An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its work during this national effort.  Garda&iacute; have continued to take a measured approach at all times.  They continue to engage, educate, encourage and, only as a last resort, enforce.  I add my voice to many others in the House regarding what happened yesterday in the context of the shooting of two garda&iacute;.  I wish them a very speedy recovery and I wish their families the very best.  It was an absolutely despicable act of violence against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p> Section 5 states that the Title of the legislation shall be the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2021 and that it shall come into operation on 10 June 2021.</p> <p> As I have here previously and elsewhere, these powers do not sit easy with me.  I doubt they sit easy with any Member of the Oireachtas.  They should not sit easy with any democracy.  I believe, however, that they have been required up to now to support public health measures, advice and guidance. This Government wants to lead our return to normality as quickly as possible.  Importantly, we want to do so safely.  We want to make sure that we do not go backwards or need to reintroduce measures.</p> <p> I welcome this opportunity to provide an overview of some of the key provisions in the Bill.  I look forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage and to listening to colleagues' contributions during today's debate.  The Government believes that ensuring the continuation of these measures is the responsible thing to do.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The last time that similar legislation brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas, no Opposition amendments were accepted.  Not only were they not accepted, most were not reached because very limited time was given on Committee Stage.  I have already had conversations with our whip, and I am aware that the issue was raised at the Business Committee.  Sufficient time really needs to be allocated in respect of Committee Stage this time around so that reasonable amendments being tabled by the Opposition can be debated and that some level of democratic oversight is brought to bear in the context of this very important issue.</p>  <p>  As the Minister pointed out, the Bill is draconian.  It gives him extraordinary powers.  We are being asked to give powers to the Minister to make regulations we will not be able to scrutinise or evaluate and on which we will have no say.  For those reasons, we need to be assured that the Minister has listened and engaged and that the voices of members of the Opposition are not only heard but are taken into account in the context of the Bill.  The days of giving the Minister or anybody else a blank cheque to make responses of the nature envisaged are long gone.  If the Minister was in my position, I imagine that he would argue the same.</p>  <p>  When one looks across the political spectrum in different parts of Europe, by and large, the support the Minister and the Government have had from the Opposition in the response to the Covid-19 has been quite remarkable, especially in light of the huge difficulties to which the public health restrictions have given rise for workers, families and businesses.</p>  <p>  I am one of those who gets a massive amount of lobbying from members of the public.  The latter have many different views on the public health restrictions.  Sometimes, and for different reasons, people argue for more restrictions, while others argue for fewer restrictions or do not want any restrictions at all.  We all must show leadership.  We all must follow very clearly the public health advice and ensure at all times that it is about keeping people safe.  Nobody wants public health restrictions of the nature of those that had to be introduced over the past 12 months.  Those restrictions were put in place because of the need to deal with a highly infectious virus that caused a pandemic.  People were dying and action had to be taken.  I accept that.  I also accept that as we go forward there will still be a need for public health measures to remain in place.  Like the Minister, I hope that we would not see them in place for a second or a minute longer than is necessary.  The sooner the opportunity comes to ease those restrictions we should take them.</p>  <p>  I celebrate the fact that major efforts have been made.  I recognise the huge contribution of workers, families and businesses in recent past months, especially since January and the third wave, which took many, if not all, of us by surprise.  It has been a really difficult couple of months for people given the restrictions that were put in place in early January and right through to now.  The curtailment of people's ability to work, meet their families, socialise and live any kind of normal life has been absolutely horrendous.</p>  <p>  The impact of the restrictions on healthcare has also been horrendous.  We will discuss all of that in due course I am sure, as all of the consequences of missed care come at us.  All of that will have to be dealt with.  The restrictions we have put in place have not been without consequences.  I would be the first to say they were necessary and I will not abdicate my responsibility in making sure that people's health is put first, in keeping people alive and in keeping people safe.  Equally, when we approved the resolution to extend the sunset clause the last time around, I said to the Minister directly that I felt the length of time by which he was seeking to extend it was way too long.  I say the same again now.  An extension until November is far too long.  Sinn F&eacute;in will table amendments to extend the sunset clause until 9 July.  That will allow for democratic oversight and it will give the Minister the opportunity to return to the House to extend the restrictions again, if necessary.</p>  <p>  Thankfully, because of the collective efforts of the vast majority of people in the State, we are now beginning to see an easing of restrictions.  For the first time in a long while, last week and the week before people returned to work and non-essential retail opened.</p>  <p>There are now more opportunities for people to engage in outdoor and indoor activities.  We celebrate, as anybody else does, all of that.  It is a huge relief for people and it is a return to a level of normality.  More restrictions will be eased in June and tomorrow we will see what is in the roadmap, which has been well publicised in advance.  Potentially, there will be more easing of restrictions in July, with even travel being a possibility at the end of July and in early August.  Again, I will support all of this.  When the public health advice is clear and if it underpins what the Government brings forward, I will support it, including when restrictions need to be put in place and, equally, when they can be eased.  We all want to see this relief given to workers, families and businesses.</p> <p> It does not make sense to people looking in from the outside that when all of these restrictions are being eased at a certain pace, the House is being asked to extend the emergency powers until November.  Essentially, what we are doing - and I have said this previously - is outsourcing the implementation of these emergency powers specifically to the Minister and to the Cabinet.</p> <p> I know the Department, the HSE and the Minister were working under extreme pressure,.  When the third wave came at us in January, speed was important and decisions had to be taken very quickly.  It is a cause of irritation for those of us in opposition, who support provisions such as this and support public health advice, that when regulations are published, we do not get a heads-up or notification by email and there is no briefing.  Sometimes, the first we learn of it is through the media or sometimes if we just happen to have staff who are refreshing their browsers when regulations go up on the HSE website or that of the Department.  That is not acceptable and I have said it several times.  This is why it is frustrating.</p> <p> The emergency powers we give the Minister, after which he can make regulations, are not subject to any approval by the Oireachtas.  We are not asked to give consent.  We are not asked to give an opinion.  We do not have an opportunity to review their effectiveness.  Nor, by the way, at any time over the past 12 months have we had the ability to review the effectiveness of the provisions of the previous legislation, which are essentially the same as those in the Bill.</p> <p> The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has, as the Minister knows, raised concerns.  Earlier today, I mentioned a briefing for health spokespersons.  It was actually a briefing for the Oireachtas health committee so it was only for members of that committee.  We were asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  We had a hearing at which we listened to representatives from Mental Health Reform and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  At the briefing with the Minister's officials, they told us, as I stated earlier before this debate started, that it was probably sometime in March or April that the Department became aware of the need for legislation.  That was because the existing legislation includes provision in respect of "resolution" as opposed to "resolutions from time to time".  It would seem that, out of an abundance of caution, we were told there had to be new legislation.  When we go back over the transcript of the proceedings in the Seanad, however, there were contributions which show that it was known that there would have to be a new Bill once one resolution was passed.  Notwithstanding this, the Department told us it knew in March or April, yet only last week members of the health committee were contacted to say that there would be need for a new Bill and we were asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  Why were we not told weeks in advance?  Why was an opportunity not given to the health committee to probe this in greater detail?</p> <p> I certainly will be reserving judgment on whether I can support the Bill.  It will very much depend on the time allocated for Committee Stage and the Minister's willingness to engage and accept amendments.  I will conclude by reiterating what I said earlier.  Neither I nor my party can continue to give the Minister or the Government a blank check in respect of public health restrictions.  There has to be democratic oversight and proper accountability.  There has to be proper transparency.  I cannot support many of the provisions in the Bill.  I will seek to amend them and if the amendments are accepted I will be more than happy to support the Bill.  Other than that, we will have to wait to see what transpires on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="14:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600034#NN00200"><p>As Deputy Cullinane said, the Bill is basically an extension of what we have had up to now.  Deputies on all sides understand that measures have to be in place to ensure people comply with the regulations, which are about keeping communities and people safe.  We all endeavour to do everything we can to encourage and work with people and make sure there is compliance with these measures to ensure we try to keep the Covid-19 pandemic at bay.  At the same time, it is very unusual that we are in circumstances whereby we have had measures such as these in place for eight months and many people have fallen foul of them for doing things they would do in the normal course of their lives.  By mid-April, 20,242 people had been issued fines for leaving their homes and travelling 5 km outside of their areas or for organising parties or attending events.  This is stuff we do normally and that we encourage people to do as part of commerce, business or life but we find we have this very restrictive set of penal measures in place to constrain people.</p>  <p>  We have to acknowledge that this is very difficult for people.  It is difficult for the Oireachtas to be dealing with it and to be allowing this sort of thing to happen because it completely goes against the grain for the vast majority who believe in civil liberty and ensuring that people have basic freedoms.  We are curtailing their freedoms.  We are doing it for good reason - I understand this and respect it - and we have all worked together to ensure that we can provide adequate supports for people in the circumstances.</p>  <p>  Another issue that arises is the mental health aspect and how it has curtailed lives to such an extent that many people are very stressed, anxious and worried about all of what is going on.  Sometimes the mental health element is portrayed as a reason for having fewer restrictions.  The latter does not reflect the point I am going to make.  It is the reason we need to ensure that we have adequate supports in place for people and to ensure that as we move out of this people are protected and maintained in their communities and feel that they can move back out into society safely.  Many people do not feel this and the mental health services will have a huge amount of work to do.  They were totally under-resourced prior to this and, as we move forward, they will need additional resources.</p>  <p>  I understand the need for the measures in place in the context of what garda&iacute; do and how they behave and act in the context of all of this, particularly with regard to licensed premises.  The timescale involved is what bothers me and the vast majority of people.  The Minister has proclaimed that the vaccine roll-out is going well and that we are moving ahead with it.  We all welcome this.  I received the vaccine last week.  We are getting there.  As we endeavour to move forward, we need to get to a situation whereby more people have the vaccine than do not.  We are getting close to that point.  We need to give people hope that we are moving away from the current level of restrictions and the curtailment of freedoms.  Renewing the restrictions for almost six months flies in the face of people's hope.</p>  <p>  This legislation before us will dampen down the hope to which I refer.  I do not think we should do as is envisaged.  This is why adequate amendments will have to be tabled.  We should be reviewing the legislation more regularly because it is so extreme.  I appreciate that the extreme nature of it means there is a responsibility on us.  We cannot shirk that responsibility.  The Government is taking the lead here.  It takes the advice of NPHET and receives adequate health advice on all of this.  The latter is necessary and has to happen.  However, the Government must also heed all of the rest of us in these Houses who deal with the public every day and who work with people who are stressed, who are under pressure and who want some relief.  There needs to be adequate respect for the elected Members here.  The way this respect can be shown is by the Government sitting down, working out amendments and conceding that there needs to be a more timely review of the powers involved rather than extending those powers for the better part of six months.  I hope this will happen and I hope the Minister will take all of the views expressed today on board as we move forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="14:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600035#OO00200"><p>While this Bill is important, just as important is the debate that surrounds it.  We have been consistent in backing the public health guidelines while calling for proper measures on quarantine, track and trace and vaccine roll-out but we also believe the restrictions must be proportionate.  It is these fundamentals that the Government needs to get right and I believe there have been many failings in doing so.</p>  <p>  On looking at the Preamble, everyone accepts that "a public emergency has arisen" and as for "extraordinary measures", Deputy Martin Kenny has noted that 14,000 people have been fined for leaving their homes.  The debate, however, turns to liberty being fundamental in any republic.  At times, citizens have had to resort to the High Court to test the proportionality as to whether some of the restrictions have been fair.  The Preamble goes on to state "the trajectory of that disease continues to be precarious", and while the number of cases was 1,200 in October, down to 162 in December and back up to 8,000 in January, they have reduced a great deal since then.  There is a balancing act between the rights of citizens to life and bodily integrity and those of liberty.</p>  <p>  It is true what the previous speakers have said about the sacrifices that have been made by all citizens in this country.  I refer to sacrifices in education and in employment but also sacrifices that have resulted in an increase in domestic violence and an increase in drug taking.</p>  <p>  We have come to a point where in my constituency of Kerry, there have been only two or three cases in hospitals over the past five weeks.  People cannot attend matches.  People cannot go for a 5 km run for a charity event.  The work on the greenways in Kerry more or less stopped because of the restrictions.  The county clean-up day was ceased because, according to the local authority, if there were half a dozen people on a country road on a Sunday morning, that was an organised event and it could not take place.  It was ridiculous.</p>  <p>  There is another aspect in which the Government has failed, namely, in the establishment of clear guidelines grounded in law and in medical evidence in which the public can have faith.  The Government asked the D&aacute;il to debate changes to the Health Act which enabled a statutory instrument which would have compelled the businesses to keep receipts but then backed away from that.  They allowed for ambiguities to be built up between public health guidelines and what was a matter of criminal law.  Legal sanctions were used inappropriately, even against the advice of Dr. Holohan, who warned of certain activities being driven underground.</p>  <p>  Most importantly, the Government has consistently not communicated the risks of indoor versus outdoor activity.  I refer to the recent fiasco over the Clare-Wexford game.  Fifteen months on, has anybody looked at the evidence of transmission in outdoor sports?  Has anyone analysed the data or are there any data to say that two players who marked two other players on a pitch which is 150 yd long could possibly be a close contact?  It cannot be the case.  I am worried that this completely risk-averse type of call could make prisoners of us all.  The Government will have to make a call and not hide behind advice without testing it to the hilt given the sacrifices that I have already mentioned that have taken place.  Otherwise it is bad news for the workers in aviation who are standing outside the conference centre today, who have argued for the antigen testing that is acceptable in 15 other countries.  Football matches still cannot continue and as we look across to the Six Counties and across the water, we see the opening of outdoor activities there.</p>  <p>  I have been involved in park runs for the past few years.  It is a brilliant voluntary community-led activity that 12,000 participate in weekly.  It is still off the table.  Eighty thousand people undertake 650,000 runs or walks.  As for the participants, 7% have a disability, 17% are from the lowest socioeconomic percentile and 50% are women, all groups that have been heavily impacted by Covid-19 restrictions.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for having met organisers this morning to consider a trial run.  While elite sports have their advocates, unfortunately, runs and social events such as Park Run do not have that kind of slick PR machine behind them.  There is no reason that I can see why those events cannot take place as soon as possible.  Otherwise there is no benefit to the vaccine roll-out.</p></speech>

A recurring theme of this pandemic has been what we just heard.  I get what Deputy Daly says.  When one takes issues in isolation, for instance, if such and such happened, one asks what is the risk of that, but when we were in the teeth of the worst waves, it was not necessarily the act of going for a run with a few people in the park that was dangerous but rather the cumulative impact of risk of people moving, congregating for a cup of tea or coffee afterwards and deciding that as they would usually go for a spot of breakfast afterwards, they might just do that.  It is easy at this point when we rightly are feeling a bit more hopeful about things that we can look back at measures, take them out of context, and ask why do we need we to do this or that.  We continue to make huge sacrifices.</p>  <p>  This disease has had an unbelievable success rate in making fools out of many of us by constantly wrong-footing us.  When we feel we are getting ahead of it then it comes back and bites.  When it bites, it bites hard and puts pressure on our health system.  People get sick, people get very sick and people have died and will continue to be so.</p>  <p>  The success of the vaccination roll-out is what is different about this time.  That is the factor in this debate at this point of extension, which requires some further discussion and teasing out on Committee Stage.  We hit a wonderful milestone yesterday; that of 2.5 million vaccinations.  That is incredible.  Particularly over of the past couple of weeks where we have had a ransomware attack on our health service systems, that we managed to keep some critical health services going and managed to keep the vaccination programme on track is unbelievably commendable.  In fairness, it goes from root to branch.  It is the front-line workers but, in fairness, it is also the civil servants, the people in the Minister's office and the Minister who have kept that going.  One has to acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  It is that success that has given people hope.  It is what we are expecting this week from the announcements regarding indoor and outdoor dining and a return to safe travel that is giving people hope.  The Minister will understand that the date of 9 November jars with us, because it seems so very far away at a time when we are so hopeful about unwinding these restrictions and about returning to something of a normal life.</p>  <p>  I came to the Chamber to listen to the Minister's opening statement.  I requested a copy of it, which I received, because I was looking to see a deeper explanation of the rationale behind the date of 9 November.  It was not there.  Maybe the Minister will come back to that in his closing remarks or refer to it between now and Committee Stage because we will require some more convincing on that.  With all the optimism out there, that is what we require and expect.</p>  <p>  The Minister admitted that 80% of the adult population will be vaccinated by the end of June.  We will have a safe return of some international travel.  I have just come here from the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, where we were meeting and speaking to workers from Aer Lingus.  There is a heap of concerns.  They have lost jobs.  They are worried about losing more jobs but part of it was how do we return to safe travel, how do we test people who are working in aviation and what about vaccinating people who are working in aviation such as cabin crew.  All of these questions are still out there.  The vaccination is giving all these industries hope that we can return and that these extraordinary measures can be unwound.  It is trying to find that spot that acknowledges that there is still an uncertainty with this disease and that we have variants of concern out there on our planet that are circulating.</p> <p>We need to manage and be prepared for that and have resilience.  We can do that without pitching the date of 9 November.  We have had discussions on that in the Labour Party over the past few days.  We know the Minister takes no joy in these regulations.  No one wants to deliver these in any circumstances.  I imagine the vast majority of Members of the House feel this way. </p> <p> If reports are to be believed, the events industry as well as safe travel and indoor and outdoor dining will return in August or September.  There are reports that people will be allowed back to view sports and it is to be hoped people will be at League of Ireland matches later this summer and into the autumn.  All of this stands in stark contrast to the date of 9 November.  We hope that, as we unwind, circulate and have an outdoor summer, numbers continue to be controlled.  Let us be honest; they are not reducing as much as we would like.  As the numbers continue to be controlled, it is to be hoped they will reduce and those who have been vaccinated will not get as sick.  </p> <p> I hope we will not see a spike in numbers in August and September because if we do, the 9 November date may seem more logical.  At this remove, it does not.  By 9 September, we will have seen what has happened over the course of the summer and the gradual unwinding.  That would be the appropriate point for the restrictions to be extended to and, thereafter, the situation reviewed on a month by month basis.  That would be our proposal.  We feel it is a belt and braces approach that acknowledges what is happening at the moment regarding vaccinations and the unwinding of restrictions.</p> <p> Regarding pre-legislative scrutiny, we understood the position when the world was in a mega panic in March last year.  However, we need more scrutiny of the Bill now.  We now have the time and space to do that.  I am on the Business Committee and we are having major discussions every week to make sure we have enough committee time and venues.  These discussions cause consternation, but it is vital that the Legislature continues its work.  We have the time and space to discuss this in more detail and I ask the Minister to do that.</p> <p> At this time, we have a chance to review the impact all of the restrictions have had on people.  This is probably the first time we have had a chance to do that.  My colleague, Senator Annie Hoey, in the Seanad debate on the Bill earlier this week, called for a human rights analysis of these measures to be carried out.  That is a fair ask and would be the compassionate and understanding thing for the Government to do.  I ask the Minister to respond to that.  </p> <p> We should not extend the measures beyond September until such a review has taken place.  We need to ensure that the rights of the people we represent are respected at all times and the most basic tenets of democracy we are expected to uphold in the House are implemented.  Will the Minister commit to a review in the House of how the laws are being implemented and how often they have had to be used before the end of June?  I will raise this matter at the Business Committee.</p> <p> Members of the public seem concerned about these measures continuing.  I have had discussions with a number of constituents over the past number of weeks.  Some people are coming from a very far right libertarian point of view, and that is not a view I share.  Other people are coming at this from a human rights perspective and have seen people in their lives suffer under the restrictions over the past year because they have been harsh and tough.  That is what is driving an awful lot of people, very understandably and compassionately from their point of view, to ensure that the restrictions do not have to continue for any longer than is necessary. </p> <p> This is another opportunity for the Minister to be open, transparent and honest with the people we represent who have had to abide by these restrictions over the past 15 months.  If they continue beyond the 9 November proposal, they will have been in place for over 18 months.  We will see what happens during the debate, but at this stage we plan to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage next week to change the date, end the restrictions in September rather than November and implement the monthly legislative review on the effectiveness of the measures from the end of July onwards. </p> <p> We want, and feel there is space for, more discussion.  When it comes to Bills like this, we should be presented with as much information as possible, and more information than we have received thus far, on the effectiveness of the proposals and how necessary they actually are.  We cannot just be a rubber-stamping tool.  No one wants that.  We want to pore over all of the details and have as much information as possible.  We are coming off the back of the success of the vaccination roll-out.  A few weeks ago, grandparents were vaccinated, followed by parents and friends.  I look forward to when the vaccine is rolled out to people in their 30s so that I can get it.  Every time another cohort is included, it brings more energy and greater hope that we will have a safe outdoor summer and be able to intermingle again.</p> <p> It has gone unreported that very early on in the vaccine roll-out process people with mental health issues were included as one of the first cohorts.  That was an important inclusion and was carried through by the HSE.  We have so much more work to do for people with mental illness in terms of fully including them in our health service, breaking down stigmas and providing access to therapies and health services.  It was very important that people with mental illness were included at the very early stages and that their physically vulnerability as immunosuppressed people was recognised.  I commend the HSE and everyone involved in that decision because it has not been reported widely enough.  It should not go unnoticed.  That is the current situation and we look forward to further engagement on it.</p></speech>

When these measures were last before the House in October 2020, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled an amendment to limit the scope of the emergency legislation.  We sought for the Government to bring forward less discretionary legislation which did not avoid D&aacute;il scrutiny.  The existing legislation is giving far too much discretion and emergency powers to the Minister for Health.  I am not saying he gets pleasure out of implementing these measures and I understand difficult choices have to be made, but the key point we are trying to get across is that democratically elected representatives in the Chamber have to have a voice in these matters because these powers are extensive.</p>  <p>  We are opposed to the continuing operation of the emergency legislation, with such broad discretionary powers, delegating what we believe should be Oireachtas, Seanad and D&aacute;il responsibilities to the Minister for longer than necessary.  Our approach would not undo the restrictions, but would ensure that new regulations are adequately scrutinised, debated and, ultimately, agreed by the D&aacute;il.  They would not be delegated to a Minister with no requirement to seek the approval of the House.  The Government has proposed to extend the emergency measures to 9 November.  We do not believe this long extension, without scrutiny, is warranted at this stage.  The measures may need to be extended, but they have to be debated in the House.</p>  <p>  As hospitalisations come down, vaccines ramp up and society reopens, there is no need for such broad discretionary powers for the Minister.  Whether the health regulations need to remain in place is a matter for the House.  The vaccination campaign is going well.  The only difference we on this side of the House have is that we would advise the Government to keep its foot on the pedal.  I had my first vaccination recently and can report that the centre in County Laois is excellent.  The work the staff there are doing is tremendous and it is a great credit to everyone involved.  We complained when things were not going well, so I want to give credit when they are.</p>  <p>  We have tabled amendments to the Bill to limit the operation of the Bill to 9 July and require that the restrictions secure the approval of the D&aacute;il going forward.  We will continue to be informed by the evolving public health situation.  We have supported all health measures and interventions deemed necessary by the public health advice which allowed us to keep the virus under control.  However, we cannot support the Bill in its current form.  We submitted an amendment to change the date from November to July so that we could have a full debate in the House.  The Minister was given extraordinary powers in good faith by Deputies last year.  We put that faith in him.  To push the sunset clause out to 9 November is a step too far.</p> <p>We need to see a clear plan coming from Government in terms of exiting the restrictions.  In the absence of such a plan, unfortunately, Government is seeking a <i>carte blanche</i>authority for a further six months.<br/><br/>It is a push and a step too far for many members of the public.  A constituent was on to me about it this morning before I came here to make sure I raised my voice about it.  It is not that they do not support the public health guidelines or want to open up everything in a <i>laissez-faire</i>kind of way, but they do want to see it properly debated.<br/><br/>Many members of the public continue to support the public health measures.  We have done our part, and the Minister will admit this, in trying to bring the public with us and keep it on side in terms of following the public health measures and the advice given by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the HSE.  However, this does not sit right with them.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="14:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600037#QQ00200"><p>A national emergency existed last year and this House passed a number of pieces of emergency legislation, which the Minister is now seeking to extend beyond their express expiry date on 9 June.</p><p>The legislation before us provides for one extension and further three-monthly extensions of the four pieces of emergency legislation we passed last year.  This legislation conferred wide-ranging and draconian powers on the Minister for Health, which he admits, and on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The legislation also gave a <i>carte blanche</i>to the Minister to introduce a raft of regulations, which impacted many areas of our daily lives and democratic freedoms.</p><p>This legislation was supported by the Social Democrats and other parties and groups in this House when it was introduced, because of the unprecedented nature of the emergency the country was facing.  At the time, the country was battling a killer virus which has cost thousands of lives, brought our health service to its knees and forced the shutdown of vast sections of our economy.  The only weapon we initially had in our arsenal in this battle was social distancing.  People had to remain separate, stay apart from their friends and families and stay safe.</p><p>The draconian nature of the powers was directly related to the level of danger which existed in our communities when the virus was exponentially spreading in the community and leaving a trail of death, debility and grief in its wake.  The Government needed extraordinary powers to deal with this extraordinary danger.  However, there was an acknowledgement that once the danger receded, the requirement for these powers would too.  A sunset clause was built into the legislation which allowed for one extension, after an initial period of six months, while a review of the impact of the legislation was also promised.</p><p>Today, we are still battling that virus, but now we have a powerful weapon, our vaccination programme.  Consequently, our odds of success in this war have been markedly improved.  Some 15% of the population has now been fully vaccinated and nearly 50% has received its first dose.  All credit to everybody involved in that, especially the HSE.  Businesses, closed since last year, have finally begun to reopen and that is to be warmly welcomed.  There is hope, once again, that life can return to normal.</p><p>Yet, the Government is asking the Opposition to support its attempt to extend the same level of draconian powers which were required at the height of this crisis, despite the situation now being, thankfully, vastly improved.  Some on the Government benches do not seem to accept the situation has improved and that we need to take a new approach.</p><p>The purpose of severe lockdowns and the curtailment of rights necessitated by the introduction of this legislation was to flatten the curve and stop the spread of the virus.  When the epidemiological situation changes, so too does the need for the restrictions to the same extent.  It is important that as a matter of course and practice, before we pass any legislation, we read it thoroughly and look at the analysis underlying the rationale for it.</p><p>There have been many problems with the manner in which the Government has exercised its powers since this legislation was passed.  Some 67 separate sets of regulations have been introduced and more often than not there has been no advance notice, approvals, reporting, impact assessment, oversight, scrutiny or briefings.  This is a weak spot on behalf of the Government.</p><p>In the early days of the virus, we were getting twice-weekly briefings which was helpful.  It meant everybody was in possession of the same information and it was easier for us to work together in the national effort.  The fact the Government has stopped doing that for some time is a problem.  There has not been a briefing since last December.  That is regrettable and I ask the Minister to try to address that issue because the Opposition, similar to much of the public, has been left completely in the dark on proposals in respect of regulations under this emergency legislation.</p><p>This lack of transparency has caused huge levels of confusion and anxiety.  On occasion, there has been no clear distinction between activity which is illegal and that which is advisory.  For example, some understood the advice last year that older people should cocoon to be an effective house arrest, when it was advice.  There were other problems too.  Travel restrictions prohibited people from leaving their county, even if that meant needing to travel 3 km to get to their nearest town.  Many unintended consequences could have been foreseen with proper discussion and Oireachtas scrutiny in advance and avoided, for example, the problems we saw quickly emerge in terms of domestic violence and its increase.  It was only after the event there was a response to that growing issue.</p><p>Regulations which precluded single people having any social contact made no sense and the D&aacute;il had to insist they would be changed.  It would have been better to discuss that in advance.  The situation in which garda&iacute; were required to record what food people were eating in pubs was a terrible one in which to put them.  It should never have happened and should have been discussed.  That and other actions were required of the garda&iacute;, which they were quite reluctant about and, as we heard on several occasions, there was little guidance issued to them on what they were being expected to do with these special powers.</p><p>Emergency measures in respect of mental health tribunals were unnecessary and unused and yesterday, Mental Health Reform made it clear it is requesting those measures be scrapped.  There is a need to recognise and accept some of these measures were excessive, unfair, unreasonable, confusing and made no sense.</p><p>The health committee had to deal with this last week.  We appreciate the briefing we got from officials, but we were asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  For legislation which is so important, it was unreasonable and showed little or no regard for the parliamentary procedures and the requirement for parliamentary oversight.  As the Minister knows, the committee had to write to him expressing its concern about that and requesting he would consider amendments to this legislation.  That was not done easily and was done with the support of the entire health committee.</p><p>I ask the Minister to listen to other Members of the House who would like to see him taking a more reasonable and cooperative approach to this.  We should not further extend wide-ranging blanket restrictions on people&rsquo;s fundamental civil rights and liberties unless that extension is necessary.  Therefore, the reasonable and sensible thing to do is to review the legislation, remove the draconian measures which can no longer be deemed necessary or defended and extend those measures which are required.</p> <p>This review could be carried out in a reasonably short period of six weeks and would provide valuable information, for example, on whether enforcement powers have been disproportionately used in certain geographical areas or among certain demographics.  We need to get that information as we have no disaggregated information on the imposition of fines and prosecutions.</p> <p> The Social Democrats do not want to jettison all these measures.  Instead, the proposition is simple.  We want the Minister to consider amending this legislation to allow a rollover of the measures that are absolutely necessary, subject to a review being carried out.  The Minister can then return to the Oireachtas prior to the summer recess to consider the outcome of the review and amend the legislation accordingly.  Restrictions that are necessary to protect public health and protect the reopening and the hard work of the Irish people over many months should be retained but those that can no longer be defended should be dropped.  In addition, I reiterate my request that the Minister give people notice prior to introducing any regulations, in order that they can be considered.  Around 48 hours' notice would be appropriate.  Ideally, the approval of this House or both Houses should be required for the passage of those regulations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600038#RR00200"><p>Since last March, our response to Covid has been one of emergency thinking, with a heavy reliance on secondary legislation.  We rushed legislation through last March in a very different environment.  The Minister described that legislation as draconian and I agree with that description.  In a million years I would not have expected to have to vote for that kind of legislation but the Covid pandemic has been extraordinary.  It was a crisis and a time of great uncertainty.  We did not understand the virus and there was no sign of a vaccine.  Thankfully, things have changed quite a bit and the roll-out of vaccinations is very successful.  I got my vaccine in Citywest some weeks ago and I can attest that, as others have said, it was very efficiently dealt with.  We understand the virus much more now, although I am not sure we are getting the message about airborne transmission out very clearly.  The situation is not static.  It changes from time to time and so should our response.</p>  <p>  Covid is still present and is still a significant risk but the issue is how we manage that risk.  The more vulnerable people in our population have now been vaccinated so we need a much more nuanced approach to how we manage the risk going forward.  It is disappointing to be presented with this legislation today because it seems this debate is an afterthought.  Last week I woke up and turned on the radio to be told that the Government had decided to extend these measures to November, as if it did not matter that the Oireachtas has a view.  The Government thinks that because it has the numbers it can just do this.  That is the message that came across.  There has been a feeling all this year that the Opposition only comes in to criticise and moan and groan but we do not feel we are being heard.  We are here to represent the public just as the Minister is.  The lack of briefings on these matters and being presented with legislation like this, where we will fall off a cliff edge if it is not passed before a certain date, show the weakness of the Government in its lack of forward thinking.</p>  <p>  This legislation was extended to 9 June with the understanding that this date was the sunset clause and the safeguard.  High levels of the virus are still circulating in the community and there are risks from variants.  We have to collectively manage those risks but we also have to balance them against people's fundamental rights.  The Opposition is being taken for granted.  Emergency measures are meant to be temporary, according to international law.  The extension of emergency powers is a substantial step and is not a decision for Cabinet to make but one for the Oireachtas to make in its totality.</p>  <p>  There has been a change in the public mood over time as Covid has had a serious impact across society.  Significant damage has been done to children as they have been out of school and there has been a double disadvantage for children with disabilities.  There has been a loss of confidence for older people.  One of the saddest things we heard last year was when older people said they felt they had to cocoon and had no contact with others.  They said that life was not worth living.  There has been a loss of confidence, a paralysis and an institutionalising and it will be very difficult for people to get their confidence back.  On the one hand, we are being told that many things are being opened up.  Much of that is very welcome and we accept it has to be done safely but, at the same time, the more that draconian measures are imposed, the less people will feel able to reconnect and pick up their lives where they left off. </p>  <p>  With the successful vaccine campaign, we are at a point where we should be considering what we can do rather than what we cannot do, and the extension of these powers wholesale to November is the opposite of that message.  During the pandemic, there was a huge amount of confusion about which measures were mandatory and which were advisory.  The Government did not clarify those matters and it made people feel even more imposed on in the loss of their civil liberties.  As it stands, NPHET does not have any members with human rights and equality expertise and it dissolved the sub-committee that did have human rights experts on it.  The Government oversight committee that filters NPHET recommendations has no representation from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Whole sections of society are not being taken into consideration, with a very narrow focus to the advice being given.</p>  <p>  It is essential that a human rights view of Covid enforcement powers be instigated as a matter of urgency.  This has been called for since last year and the Government has yet to engage with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on the matter.  We understand the public health risks.  Some of the restrictions may well be necessary but they must be subject to scrutiny.  The absence of a review of emergency powers at regular intervals is a source of concern.</p> <p>Regarding disaggregated data, the Garda Commissioner accepts it is required.  It is important that we see those data because the impacts involved are very different, especially concerning fines.  We do not know who has been fined and we do not know if it has been disproportionate.  A fine is only punitive if it really hits people's pockets.  For example, if it is a question of someone paying an extra &euro;100 fine incurred because of a foreign holiday, that is not a draconian measure.  On the other hand, if a pensioner goes three, four or five miles outside his or her zone during level 5 restrictions and consequently incurs a &euro;100 fine, that will be pretty significant for that person.  Therefore, we need to get that information regarding the fines and we must know how these powers are being applied.  In the absence of doing that, it is unfair to ask the Oireachtas to just pass this legislation and present a <i>carte blanche</i>to the Government to put together statutory instruments or regulations and not have those reviews.  We must have those reviews, therefore, and the Social Democrats will be introducing amendments to this Bill.  I hope they will be received in such a way that the Minister will at least be open to giving them consideration.  </p></speech>

I thank the Minister for being here today.  Many of us have met representatives of the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, today.  The pilots are just outside the national convention centre today and they have met many Deputies on their way into the D&aacute;il.  The point the pilots want to make is that we are all waiting with bated breath for these announcements to be made on Friday regarding easing restrictions on international travel, and international air travel in particular.</p>  <p>  The point I wish to make on their behalf is that the digital green certificate makes provision for testing.  It allows for rapid antigen testing and for antigen testing in its basic form as well.  This must be an option for the Irish State.  It has been embraced by 15 EU countries out of 27, and it must also be a method used in Ireland too in future, in tandem with PCR testing.  The reality is that taking a PCR test three days before travelling is a bit like breathalysing people before they go into a pub, because not all the information will be captured.  A rapid antigen test done on the day, however, some six or seven hours before departure, will detect a hell of a lot more.  This must be the way forward, and it is a method which must be in the mix.  </p>  <p>  Turning to mandatory hotel quarantine, MHQ, we must retain that system, but only for people coming from countries which have a wild variant of Covid-19.  We must enable air traffic from our neighbours in Europe, Britain and North America and we must welcome with open arms people who have been vaccinated in those countries.  We should retain such quarantine, just in the basic form, for those countries where there is a wild variant.  I finish by reiterating two numbers that I gave here yesterday.  On 12 January, 8,200 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the country, but the number yesterday was around 400 cases.  The two situations are not comparable and our State's response should also not be the same.  I thank the Minister.  </p></speech>

It is important that this legislation be discussed and debated in this House and that we examine it in detail.  The background to this debate is also important.  Since the pandemic struck last March, more than 4,941 deaths have been reported and I express my condolences to all those families and individuals impacted.  In addition, more than a quarter of a million cases of Covid-19 have been recorded here in Ireland.  I also express my thanks to all the front-line workers who have looked after us all throughout the pandemic, namely, the doctors, nurses, hospital staff, supermarket workers, the wonderful Dublin Bus drivers and other transport workers and of course the garda&iacute; and fire fighters.  They, and many others, have been key to us tackling the pandemic up and down the country.  They all answered the call and kept the country going throughout the worst of the pandemic, especially in the early days when the full potential impact of Covid-19 was unknown.</p>  <p>  The past 15 months have been a long road with ups and downs.  We are now, thankfully, approaching the final leg of the journey.  We have come a long way, but we are not there yet.  The Chief Medical Officer has signalled concern about the growth in cases of the new Indian variant.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Cathal Crowe, regarding the measures we must take concerning travel.  While there is strong confidence that our vaccinations are effective against the variant, we still have a way to go to ensure the vast majority of our population has received its first inoculation.  It will likely be late July or early August before we achieve the figure of 80% of adults having been fully vaccinated.  The vaccination programme is going well, better than many forecast, including Deputies in this House, and it will be possible to reopen society and the economy further as that endeavour gathers pace.</p>  <p>  However, we must be cautious.  If the Indian variant, or another unknown variant, were to become established here now, it could cause a fourth wave, despite all the vaccinations.  Schools and colleges must be a focus of our reopening in September.  That must be a priority, as I am sure it is for the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues.  I support the continuation of this legislation on the basis that we have the tools ready to protect our economy and society if necessary.  That said, however, there are certain elements of which the Minister will be aware, such as statutory instruments, that we need to revise.  One of those concerns religious services.  The Garda has powers but if retained, they might be utilised and we do not want to see that happening.  </p>  <p>  If we are going to reopen the economy and society, we must ensure that it is a process, which is free of any unintended consequences.  Equally, consideration must be given to day care services in this regard.  I have spoken about this issue many times.  We must also put a timeline in place for that area, because the elderly need it.  I also spoke to the Minister previously about drive-in movies, and the little lacuna there which needs to be resolved in the new announcements on Friday, hopefully.  While I hope that the legislation will not be used to any great degree in the months to come, obviously, we want to avoid any further waves or mass infection.  </p>  <p>  We have, however, seen some parties in this House today take wildly different views on the Covid-19 strategy.  In one week they call for us to follow the NPHET advice and then in the next, they call for a zero Covid strategy, while recently also demanding universal mandatory hotel quarantine for all travellers to Ireland.  Today, they are questioning the very framework that underpins the public health strategy.  It is quite a journey for some of those parties.  I do not know where they stand or whether a different decision will be reached by them next week.  They go from one extreme to the other, like an autumn leaf in the wind.  They are constantly blowing around and coming up with different strategies.  I note that some of them are not here this afternoon.</p>  <p>  In contrast, however, the Government has generally taken a sensible, stable and cautious approach to the management of the pandemic and to the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  It has been difficult at times for all of us, as it has for the Minister and his colleagues.  I am sure there will be other bumps along the road during the reopening of the economy and society.  It is challenging, and we knew it would be going into this process, because we are in unprecedented times.  This strategy is working, though, and, thankfully, we are making good progress on the road leading us out of this pandemic.  I call on all Deputies to support the extension of this legislation for a limited time.  Let us finish the journey and lead Ireland out of this pandemic.  I ask the Minister, in whatever time he may have left, to respond to me regarding the statutory instruments.  </p></speech>

I want to refer briefly to a point made by one of the previous speakers.  It is utterly ludicrous to suggest that the same measures and approaches should apply on days when there are six cases and on days when there are 6,000 cases.  I find it more than ludicrous that the Government and Government representatives should be suggesting that approach.  It is important that the strategy adapts and I would have thought that was a view shared by others.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that aspect, it is important that we recognise that we are now beginning to see the economy and society reopen.  Thanks are due in no small part in that regard to the commitment shown by the public to adhering to the public health messages and restrictions, to the dedicated work of medical professionals and healthcare workers and to those who are working on the vaccination programme.  As we move through this phase of the pandemic, it is important that the Government is in tune with the needs of workers and businesses.  This means that there can be no cliff edge for workers when it comes to supports such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  These supports are essential for workers, who need certainty in this regard.  Workers need there to be a plan.  They need to know how they are going to be able to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads.  As the International Monetary Fund, IMF, has stated that there should be no rush to unwind these payments, I call on the Government to give a firm commitment to workers concerning the continuation of these schemes. </p> <p>An essential part of reopening is giving people the confidence to do it, in line with public health restrictions, slowly if they need to, but not propelled by an economic need.  That has to be essential.  Health, safety and the protection of customers, workers and business owners needs to be at the forefront of what we are doing.</p> <p> Many businesses that have received supports such as tax warehousing, the CRSS and others need to be given certainty as regards their situation so that they can plan ahead.</p> <p> In relation to the reopening of the economy, I wish to highlight the situation of pubs and restaurants and indoor dining.  Throughout the pandemic, I have met with business groups, their representatives and workers' representatives regarding the difficulties that the hospitality industry faces.  A date for the reopening of indoor dining has yet to be announced.  Pubs and restaurants cannot be expected to purchase stock, schedule workers, roster staff and make all the necessary preparations for reopening unless a clear timeframe is set out.</p> <p> A few weeks ago I met with representatives of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association and the Restaurants Association of Ireland to discuss their views on a reopening plan.  They have stated that they absolutely support the public health measures, but they also want to see fairness in respect of reopening.  They want to have input into the reopening plan, they want certainty and they would like to see all indoor dining reopen together.  The Government must now sit down individually with these stakeholders and engage with them directly regarding the reopening plan.  Restaurants, pubs and indeed the ordinary punters who will be going to them, are confused to see the return of a 105-minute time limit on sittings for indoor dining.  It must be addressed.</p> <p> I have asserted on a number of occasions that if the rules are simple and easily understood, people will follow them.  We must understand that people want to follow the rules.  They want to follow the regulations and do the right thing.  However, they do need an element of clarity and they need to see that the rules make sense.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600040#TT00200"><p>People Before Profit will be opposing this Bill.  Unlike most of the Opposition, we also opposed the pervious extension of the emergency powers in October 2020.  We again oppose their extension for the same reasons, which have only become clearer over the course of the last six months.</p>  <p>  Once again, we are being asked to approve the extension of draconian emergency powers without any review of how they have operated and with no opportunity for meaningful oversight by the D&aacute;il.  We have already endured six months of rule by decree by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.  The D&aacute;il should not simply nod along to this again.  Instead, we need a proper review into how these so-called Covid powers were actually used against Debenhams workers, taxi drivers and Palestine protesters.  What is more, we need to restore the right to safe, outdoor socially-distanced protest.  It is time to lift the ban.</p>  <p>  The Garda has repeatedly refused to provide a breakdown of fines and arrests by ethnicity, despite repeated requests from the Policing Authority and despite promising to provide that information.  However, the evidence already exists.  It is already in the public domain that the Garda has applied its powers in a discriminatory way.  Young people, for example, have been disproportionately targeted.  Some 77% of fines have been imposed on people under the age of 35, compared to 1% on those aged over 65.  Incredibly, close to half of all Covid-related fines in Dublin have been handed out in just two of its 18 Garda districts, namely, Ballymun and Blanchardstown.</p>  <p>  What concerns us even more is the effective suspension of the right to protest.  Even though many of the most onerous restrictions have been lifted since 10 May 2021, such as the 5 km limit, and non-essential retail has reopened, the effective ban on political protest through the prohibition of outdoor gatherings larger than 15 people remains in place.  Despite this, several important protests have taken place over the last few weeks, including large protests against the bombing of Gaza and the occupation of Palestine and smaller protests against the housing crisis and the pollution in Dublin Bay.</p>  <p>  Last Saturday, thousands marched on the Israeli embassy in Dublin to demand the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and sanctions on Israel.  Some 22 other pro-Palestine protests took place across the country.  It is clear that regardless of the law, working class people will continue to exercise their inalienable right to protest.  With this Government in office, they have no other choice.  The very least the Government can do is to stop criminalising them.  An exemption from the ban on outdoor gatherings of more than 15 people must be provided immediately for outdoor protests, which can be organised in a safe and socially-distanced manner.</p>  <p>  There is no evidence that outdoor protests lead to significant Covid transmission.  A study of 300 US cities by the National Bureau of Economic Research of the huge Black Lives Matter protests last summer found "no evidence that urban protests reignited Covid-19 case growth."  Not only that, the study pointed out that retail shopping, which is currently legal here when protests are not, was "potentially riskier for disease spread."  This is in line with what NPHET and the Government are telling us about the relative safety of outdoor activities.  Dr. Colm Henry of NPHET has asserted that the transmission of Covid-19 outdoors is 19 to 20 times less likely to occur than indoors.  Less than 0.1% of cases here have been traced to outdoor transmission since the start of the pandemic.  Unfortunately, our tracing system has not been given the resources it needs to trace every single case properly.  Of those that have been traced, only a tiny percentage have been linked to outdoor transmission.</p>  <p>  We are constantly and correctly being told that it is much safer to gather outdoors than it is to gather indoors for any reason.  Yet, the Government is maintaining a ban on outdoor protest despite reopening indoor activities like shopping and promising to reopen indoor dining in bars and restaurants over the summer, even though all the international evidence shows that they are among the most dangerous activities from a public health perspective and a frequent source of superspreader events.  Besides one being much safer than the other, what is the difference between outdoor protests on the one hand and shopping and dining indoors on the other?  Clearly, it is that shopping and eating out are profit-making activities including for the big businesses that lobby Government and influence the decisions of the right-wing politicians who run our Government.  By contrast, outdoor protests or sitting outside at Portobello make profits for nobody.  Worse than that, from the Government's perspective, protests are about holding the powerful to account.</p>  <p>  It is very convenient for a Government presiding over the worst housing crisis in the history of the State to ban us from protesting about it, especially when it has already lifted the ban on evictions and rent increases brought in to protect public health during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government would have us believe that Covid is sufficiently under control for landlords to be able to throw families out into the street and into crowded homeless accommodation, but not under control enough for us to be able to protest about it.  The Government would have us believe that Covid is sufficiently under control for KPMG to send in scabs to pack up Debenhams stock and for the garda&iacute; to break up pickets, but not under control enough for workers to be allowed to defend their livelihoods peacefully in a socially-distanced manner.  We reject that logic completely.  We will be voting against this legislation.</p></speech>

There were unknowns about the right approach to take, in respect of how the virus might spread and what was immediately required in terms of action to protect life and health.  We have learnt a huge amount since then.  At that time we supported the legislation.  However, at that time, it contained a sunset clause and was bundled up with all of the supportive measures, such as the PUP, the wage subsidy scheme and the ban on evictions and rent increases.  Now, most of those measures are either gone or going.  Every attempt is being made to wind up the payments.  We can see evictions and rent increases being pursued enthusiastically across the State.</p>  <p>  As we exit the emergency and as the vaccine roll-out improves, it should be noted that there continue to be public health problems.  We must be mindful of the public health advice and how we follow it.  We also need to be hugely mindful about how we reopen the economy and, in particular, reintroduce foreign travel etc.</p> <p>We also must be very mindful of how we reopen the economy, particularly foreign travel.</p> <p> Obviously we do not disagree with public health emergency measures, but we cannot agree to an unbridled and far-reaching extension of Garda powers.  The record speaks for itself, and Deputy Paul Murphy has outlined much of it.  However, I will speak briefly about the indiscriminate way the Debenhams pickets were approached not just by the Garda but also by the State, because the Garda did not operate in a vacuum.  It operated in close collaboration with KPMG Ireland, one of the highest paid consultancy firms in the State and paid by the State to carry out much of its dirty work.  In that situation they were allowed to bring in what we describe as scab labour, labour that was blacklegging the strike and attempting to move the stock when it was non-essential work.  We were still at level 5 and non-essential work was not just being allowed but also being protected by no less than 12 Garda paddy wagons on Parnell Street, the armed response unit and the public order unit.  At least 60, if not 100, garda&iacute; were on Henry Street from about 8 p.m. until about 8 a.m.  I was there for some of it, so I witnessed it.  I witnessed workers being dragged out onto the street, bundled into paddy wagons and taken to police stations.  I also witnessed names being taken, people being arrested and hefty fines being issued to them.</p> <p> If the Minister wants us to extend those powers, he probably thinks we are mad.  The last Fine Gael Deputy who spoke, Deputy Devlin, said Members of the Opposition are like autumn leaves blowing in the wind.  I do not know if he thinks he is Frank Sinatra, but if he passes this legislation he will be like somebody who has forgotten that there are several seasons.  He wants to go from late spring and early summer straight into the winter and to allow these draconian measures up to the end of November 2021.  We are not having it, and I do not believe the majority of ordinary people would respect or thank us for it.  It is way beyond what is required.  The Minister should go away and come back with legislation that improves the supports for ordinary people, to allow them to stay at home if their workplaces are dangerous or if there are overcrowded situations which they cannot attend, and maintains the financial and other regular supports.  He should also state that this is for a short period until we get through the vaccination process and see where it takes us.</p> <p> Like other Deputies I have taken part in Palestinian demonstrations and Black Lives Matter protests in reaction to very serious crises across the world.  In that reaction people did their best to socially distance and wear masks, unlike those in other gatherings who did not.  The distinction being made between them is important, and I am making it.  I am not asking others to make it.  At the start of this debate we talked about how we would restrict the use of alcohol in public spaces.  There was a big debate about the young fellows with the six-packs in the parks being stopped more regularly than the very wealthy with a crate of wine in the back of the Mercedes-Benz.  The statistics before us have proven that correct.  The vast majority of fines are imposed on young people in working class areas, and the vast majority of stop-and-search incidents happen to young people in those areas.  These laws are being used disproportionately.  Along with the banning of taxi drivers' protests and the treatment of the Debenhams workers in Limerick, Tralee and Henry Street there is enough evidence for us to say that we will not support the extension of these draconian police powers.</p></speech>

I will focus on the issue of emergency powers and the right to protest.  If I have time, and I probably do, I will make some points about mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  When these powers were introduced last year I spoke out against them.  I made the point that in a capitalist society the State would use these powers to curb the right to protest, and that has proven correct.  Taxi drivers who planned to protest in Dublin were threatened with fines of &euro;2,000, with potentially heavier sanctions for the organisers.  This was despite the fact that the drivers did not plan to congregate in person, but to stay in their vehicles.  When Black Lives Matter protested in the capital last June, stewards were questioned by garda&iacute; and had their names taken.  The threat of potential prosecution was widely advertised by the Garda in the media.  In the middle of last March, garda&iacute; intervened at the socially distanced Sarah Everard solidarity protest in O'Connell Street organised by the socialist feminist group ROSA, took the names of organisers and attendees and subsequently issued fines.  Workers at Debenhams in Henry Street, Dublin, and in Patrick Street, Cork, conducting an official strike against their employer and organising disciplined, socially distant protests had their names taken by garda&iacute; under the regulations.  Workers in Henry Street were told by the officer in charge that their protest was not essential.</p>  <p>  The culture of repression facilitated by the Covid-19 emergency laws segued into the drastic actions taken by garda&iacute; in enforcing a court injunction against Debenhams workers.  Over the course of 50 days in the months of April and May, more than 300 garda&iacute;, by my estimate, were mobilised in Limerick, Waterford, Tralee and Dublin to physically remove pickets and their supporters from blocking the entrances to stores when strike-breakers wanted to gain access to the buildings.  These actions represented an unprecedented level of Garda intervention into an industrial dispute in recent years in this country.  All this has served to have a general chilling effect on protest, as was clearly intended in the first place.</p>  <p>  Young people are reporting increased levels of Garda harassment.  More than half of all fines issued under the emergency laws have been issued to young people between the ages of 18 years and 25 years.  The Policing Authority recently reported that student groups are now saying that policing in this State is "intimidating" and "negative".  That is little wonder given that the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Drew Harris, said he made no apologies for what he described as "aggressive" policing measures in respect of student gatherings - so much for gradual escalation and consent based policing.</p>  <p>  I opposed the mandatory hotel quarantine regime when it was debated in the D&aacute;il in February.  Of course, there is a need for comprehensive and far-reaching measures to prevent the virus, including virus variants, coming into this State, but mandatory hotel quarantine is a disproportionate response.  I will address that issue in greater detail in the debate on it tomorrow.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, we are not out of the woods yet with this virus.  There is still a need for great vigilance.  The discipline of the general population has been key to combating the virus.  That discipline must be maintained through hand washing, wearing masks, social distancing and the other measures we know so well at this stage.  Indoor environments clearly pose a significantly greater risk, and pressure to prematurely reopen indoor dining and drinking in restaurants and pubs should be resisted.  However, there is enough legislation to deal with that issue.  The general emergency laws should not be renewed at this point and they certainly should not be renewed in such a way that they carry over into next year.  To be clear, I am not just saying in that instance they should not be renewed, full stop.  Repression must not be part of the new normal.</p> <p>The civil liberties of the people need to be guarded and protected.  This legislation should not be renewed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600042#VV00200"><p>I welcome this important debate.  I know Deputies on all sides of the House are concerned about some of the implications of the sorts of powers that have been taken.  It is important that we scrutinise these issues and look at ways in which we can gradually return to greater normality through the legislation we enact.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that some of these powers are truly exceptional.  They ban travel, which is a normal right of a citizen, on a widespread basis.  They ban events and permit entry to a person's dwelling in certain circumstances.  They provide enforcement powers that are made by regulation and not subject to the sort of scrutiny to which we are used.  They change the terms on which mental health tribunals occur.  Fundamental rights are at stake in such tribunals.  The powers also allow for the detention and isolation of citizens.  There is no doubt they are extraordinary and exceptional powers that should only occur in the most exceptional of circumstances.</p>  <p>  Everyone realises we have been living through the most exceptional of circumstances and that powers of this nature have been needed.  However, we need to start thinking about how to gradually unwind them.  Every one of the powers seems to be reinstated by this legislation even though the conditions may have changed.  That is why I have some misgivings.  I do not know the nature of mental health tribunals being held in the environment in which we are living but I would have thought some of the powers, for example, those to proceed on the basis of remote assessment and one-person tribunals, go to the heart of how fair a process can be for an individual.  While those powers may have been justified, and may continue to be justified, there is no doubt that we are moving into a period when they will be far less justified.  Some of them may no longer be necessary.</p>  <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that we have made extraordinary progress and the risks associated with the virus are changing dramatically.  The 14-day incidence rate of the virus is 0.1%.  In other words, 99.9% of Irish people have not tested positive for Covid over the past 14 days.  Less than 1% of our hospital beds are now occupied by people with Covid-19.  Half of our people have either been vaccinated or inoculated by contracting the virus over the past year.  We need to start looking more forensically at these powers to distinguish which of them continue to be necessary.  We must consider whether we should be starting to look at more demanding standards and thresholds to justify the continuation of those powers.  Perhaps we need to consider having the exercise of some of the more intrusive powers recorded and the record kept so we can see the justification for their use.  We need to include a timely review of the exercise of these powers to ensure people are not casually applying them because they are available.  An insufficient level of scrutiny might allow people to slip into a lazy use of these exceptional powers.</p>  <p>  I wonder whether we could start to look at the schedule of these powers which, as I outlined, apply across a whole range of normal activities.  We could start to examine whether some of the relevant sections are no longer necessary.  They have had commencement orders and in some cases, we must ask whether they should be discontinued.  That is not to say they would be removed from the Statute Book but if the powers were to be recommenced, they would come back to the House and we would have the opportunity to hear from the Minister the reasons it was deemed necessary to recommence them.</p>  <p>  I admit I do not know the ins and outs of the various areas and the challenges that exist in the holding of events, the running of mental health tribunals and the enforcement of travel restrictions.  However, the situation is undoubtedly changing and we cannot continue to expect people to suspend their disbelief, if you like, and allow powers to remain without a greater level of scrutiny, evaluation and review of the continuing necessity for them.  </p>  <p>  I do not mean to suggest that I am opposed to the continuation of these powers at the moment.  It is undoubtedly the case that over the course of the summer, we will need to ask people to observe restrictions and if they refuse to do so, we will need the power to require them to, on pain of some sort of penalty.  However, we are a democratic House and I am conscious of the extraordinarily intrusive nature of these powers.  I ask, therefore, that we put in some protections and that the Minister and his colleagues design some protections, some process of dismantling, so that we can have confidence there will be no lazy or casual application of exceptional powers just because they remain in existence.  </p>  <p>  I am acutely conscious of the difficulty of the task facing the Ministers for Health and Justice, and Ministers in other spheres who are party to some of these powers.  However, I urge them to recognise that a balance must be struck in everything.  There are personal, economic and social costs and impacts to the decisions that we make, even at a time when public health is under some stress.</p></speech>

I have been amazed by the lack of analysis of what has happened in this society in recent months.  The political and media classes have done little analysis of what is going on.  I understand we have gone through a crisis and I understand that, at times, there was a danger of the health service being overwhelmed and protections needed to be put in place to make sure that did not happen.  I also understand that Ireland was far more exposed than practically any other country owing to the fact that we have such a weak health service because there has been so little investment in it over recent decades.  However, it must also be said that Ireland is a radical outlier in terms of the length and severity of the restrictions.  No other European country comes near.  The length of time and the severity of the restrictions here have been a multiple of those imposed in most other European countries.  That fact has been under-analysed by the political and media establishment in this country, which is shocking.  There has been no benefit to the restrictions.  There is very little difference in mortality and morbidity as a result of Covid between Ireland and Germany.</p>  <p>  Lockdown and restrictions are not cost-free exercises.  They are extremely damaging tools in their own right.  They push hundreds of thousands of people into poverty.  They deny homes to people.  They deny crucial treatment to people with cancer, heart disease and mental health illnesses.  They are invasive, intrusive and draconian.  Any argument for their use should only be at a time of serious catastrophe and emergency, and it is clear that Ireland is not in such a situation, or anything near it, today.</p>  <p>  For much of the past year, the Government has bypassed the D&aacute;il on oversight and accountability.  It is amazing.  I have watched taoisigh leave Government Buildings, drive past the D&aacute;il, go to RT&Eacute; studios and announce some of the most draconian laws and regulations that have ever been introduced.</p> <p>Deputies have not had the opportunity to push, challenge or ask serious questions of the Government about what it is doing.  The fact that this has been done with the collaboration of most of the Opposition parties is absolutely incredible.  People Before Profit, the Social Democrats and the Labour Party all jumped on the zero-Covid bandwagon.  It is an incredible situation.  If we were to take these parties' logic to its conclusion - the idea that we must get to below ten cases per day before we could leave the most restrictive elements of lockdown - most of this country would not open for another six months.<br/><br/>Sinn F&eacute;in has been a major disappointment.  The largest Opposition party has sat on the fence for most of the last number of months.  There has not been a cigarette paper between Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael for most of that time.  As with the banking bailout vote, proper opposition was missing when it was needed.<br/><br/>The leader of the Social Democrats complained today that the Opposition was ignored.  The Opposition voted in the legislation which facilitated it being ignored just a number of months ago.  Aont&uacute; is the only political party that has actually provided real opposition to this whole process, along with a number of notable Independents.<br/><br/>Ireland is a Petri dish for groupthink.  It has all the ingredients of herd mentality, with a small and excessively concentrated media and a careerist political class.  The lack of critique, questioning and challenging is absolutely amazing.  Some of those who asked questions lost their jobs and some were vilified and shut up.<br/><br/>There is a chilling effect in this country with regard to dissent, one of the most important elements of a healthy, functioning democracy.  Deleting the ability for citizens to safely dissent creates a dangerous situation in any democracy.  That groupthink has been obvious on many occasions in Irish society, including during the banking crisis and the housing crisis, but I have never seen it as pervasive as it has been during this crisis.<br/><br/>The majority of the vulnerable cohorts are, thankfully, vaccinated.  This is not January.  The numbers of people with Covid-19 in hospital and intensive care are, thankfully, extremely low.  I am not saying we are out of the woods.  I am saying the conditions do not warrant this legislation and it must be opposed.<br/><br/>Government policy has been a string of contradictions.  Indoor dining will start on 2 June but we still do not have a proper date with regard to indoor dining in pubs and restaurants.  There is no scientific logic to this.  Is a hotel pint a kind, unassuming drink and a pint in a pub homicidal?  Are chicken goujons in a hotel peaceful but chicken goujons in a pub malevolent?  It is absolutely ludicrous.  Open up all parts of the hospitality sector under the same regulations and use a bit of cop-on instead.<br/><br/>I tabled a parliamentary question last week, which revealed that 40,000 people have been fined so far under the legislation.  That is an incredible number of people.  In County Donegal, a helpline was introduced in order that locals could report on other locals with regard to breaching the restrictions.  Partners of pregnant women were forced to wait in hospital car parks while women were giving birth.  A priest in County Cavan was fined for saying mass.  A Protestant pastor in Dublin was arrested.  Children were gathering in Galway and a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator said the Army should be brought out to tackle them.  Some protests were banned while others were allowed to go ahead.  That is an extremely strange situation in a democracy.  All protests should have been allowed to proceed peacefully and safely.<br/><br/>It is also incredible that when one looks at those restrictions and at the political class pointing the finger at young people, protestors, families or husbands wanting to be in hospital to support their partners, the majority of people who died from Covid-19 caught it in one of two locations - a hospital or a nursing home.  When the whole country ground to a halt, the epicentre and most significant and dangerous place for a person to catch and end up dying from Covid-19 was a hospital or nursing home, all of which are owned, run or regulated by the Government.<br/><br/>At the start of the pandemic, some nursing homes started to close their doors to visitors.  The Government turned around, slapped them on the wrist and said &quot;No&quot; and that it was unnecessary.  It is interesting that one of the reports that followed stated that the HSE intercepted supplies of personal protective equipment, PPE, oxygen and staff that were designated for nursing homes.  The word &quot;intercepted&quot; was used by the current Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who was the then Opposition health spokesperson.  Responses to freedom of information requests we submitted showed that the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, would not meet Mr. Tadhg Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland during that particular emergency.<br/><br/>I want to quote a statement the Minister for Health made in this House in March last year when the original Bill was going through Second Stage.  At that time, he was the Opposition spokesperson on health.  He said:</p><blockquote>	I have concerns about the fact that there are no real sunset clauses and that the provisions can be extended ... [on and on and on].  I also have concerns ... [about] the breadth of the designated people who can essentially tell a citizen that ... [they have] to stay ... [at] home. </blockquote> <p>That same Minister is running this legislation through the D&aacute;il today.  Where are the debates on the extension of the temporary assistance support scheme?  The scheme is due to run out on 30 June and there is considerable alarm in Nursing Homes Ireland about the fact it has not received any commitment that the scheme will continue.  It looks like the nursing homes, where people suffered the most, are in trouble again.<br/><br/>I will close with the words used by the Minister for Health in the Seanad yesterday when he said &quot;... the powers we are discussing are draconian.  They do not sit ... comfortably in any healthy democracy.&quot;  That is an incredible statement to make, yet the Minister who used those words is about to introduce that legislation again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="15:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600043#WW00200"><p>As the Covid-19 situation was developing, I voted give to give the Government these special emergency powers.  I did so in good faith in the belief the powers would be used in good faith.  Unfortunately, there have been too many examples of these restrictions being unnecessarily draconian and going beyond what I consider reasonable.</p>  <p>  This has been shown on many occasions, not least when the Minister for Health said that priests would not be punished for saying mass only for that very thing to happen just a few weeks later.  He still has not apologised for misleading the D&aacute;il on the issue.</p>  <p>  Another example was the use of these powers to close parks and other public places.  I am fortunate enough to have a home in the country with a garden.  Many people living in city centres do not have the same space and, therefore, the local park was very important to them.  The Government banned people from using parks.  Many public amenities were closed and certain areas of Dublin city are still closed off.  It is madness.</p>  <p>  A third example of these powers being used in bad faith was when services such as cancer screening and various treatments were stopped.  How many missed or delayed cancer diagnoses have resulted from these restrictions?  How many mental health issues have been caused by the restrictions?  How many suicides did they cause?  It seems the powers that be did not mind what a person died from as long as it was not Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Was this a proportionate response?  Was it really necessary to use these powers to stop people visiting family or meeting each other for a chat?  We endured the longest lockdown in Europe, with contradictory and nonsensical rules being implemented.  Adults have been treated like children.  The nanny state has wrapped us in cotton wool.  People who were sceptical about the lockdown approach were cast aside with ridicule while the professional curtain-twitchers and scaremongers were given a soapbox at almost every possible opportunity.</p>  <p>  We have a virus that attacks the unhealthiest, yet the Government used the emergency powers to close down opportunities for people to exercise and stay healthy.  The Government has used these powers to dictate to people when they can and cannot hug their relatives and made people afraid to visit a friend or relative living alone.</p>  <p>  We cannot turn on our State broadcaster without hearing almost constant doom and gloom.  The situation with the pandemic has changed dramatically.  We have a vaccination programme.  Most vulnerable people have been vaccinated.  We must allow people to get back to normal.  Why are we not doing that?  Does the Government not trust the vaccines and the vaccine roll-out programme?</p> <p> Now is an appropriate time for the Government to change its approach.  To date, the approach has been to dictate and talk down to people.  It is still imposing stupid guidelines such as the proposed 105-minute limit on visits to pubs and restaurants.  I ask people to bear in mind that these are only guidelines.  That particular guideline will encourage people to move around to multiple pubs.  If a pub or restaurant wants to impose a time limit, that is fair enough, but it should be left to each business to decide for itself, depending on its circumstances.  The attitude of the Government is that it knows best how people should live their lives.  We must move away from dictating.  The Government should provide the information and even advise people, but it must let them decide for themselves.</p> <p> We saw fabulous performances in golf at the weekend by Shane Lowry and P&aacute;draig Harrington in front of 10,000 spectators in the USA.  In Europe, there were 7,500 people in the grandstand at the Monaco Grand Prix, 10,000 at a Premier League soccer match and 3,500 indoors at the Eurovision Song Contest.  This coming weekend, 500 spectators will be allowed to attend National Football League games in Northern Ireland.  Only a few days ago, the Down junior camogie team travelled to Taghmon, County Wexford, to play a National Football League game.  The Down team was allowed to travel to Wexford on a bus but this weekend, when the Wexford team goes north to play Armagh, the members will not be allowed to travel together on a bus.  Is Covid different here from anywhere else?  Are we allowing fear and scaremongering to dominate?</p> <p> Months ago, the Government was happy enough to keep level 5 restrictions in place for as long as it could get away with it.  I called for a plan for how to get us out of level 5, which included the use of antigen testing.  The latter is forming a key part in other countries' reopening plans, but a member of NPHET recently compared this type of testing with snake oil treatment.  With attitudes like that, it is no wonder the Government has not seen a place for antigen testing.  That needs to change.  Michael Mina, professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, explained last week that antigen testing can be more useful than PCR testing, particularly for identifying whether somebody is infectious.  In this country, the Government is dragging its heels on its introduction.</p> <p> Covid-19 has introduced many new phrases into everyday conversation.  One of those phrases, used regularly by the Government, is that we will "follow the science".  It seems the Government is following the science when it suits and ignoring it when it might leave Ministers with egg on their face.  For example, of the approximately 258,000 cases of Covid identified since the beginning of the pandemic, only 300 were associated with outdoor activity.  Similar findings have been shown in studies across the world.  Has the Government's approach changed based on this science?  It is still keeping people from outdoor activities and it still has not allowed outdoor dining to resume.  These things are happening throughout the world but we are still behind the curve.</p> <p> We continue to hear scaremongering about new variants, even though the vaccines have been shown to work against them.  We need to trust people to make decisions for themselves and get back to normality.  We are being asked to extend emergency powers until November and possibly beyond.  Those powers have been used to place draconian restrictions on people's freedom.  They should only be in place when absolutely necessary.  The test of the restrictions is whether they are necessary and appropriate and what are their consequences.  I have weighed up the consequences we have seen over the past year and the fact that the vast majority of our vulnerable people have been vaccinated.  I have come to the conclusion that allowing the Government to continue with these restrictions indefinitely is no longer necessary or proportionate.  As a result, I will be voting against this Bill.</p></speech>

Enormous credit is due to the people of Ireland for their efforts in that regard.  It is important to acknowledge the enormous work the staff of our health services and the HSE have done over the past 14 or 15 months.  I also acknowledge the huge work that is going on in the health service at this time.  Family members and I have had to engage with the HSE in the days since the cyberattack.  It is remarkable how many services are continuing even as so many are hugely affected.  It is a major cause for worry but there is great work being done and enormous dedication shown to ensure as many services as possible can continue.  That effort has been quite impressive in my experience.  Credit is due to our healthcare workers for that as well as for their part in getting us to a situation where restrictions are unwinding.</p>  <p>  As we reopen society, there is a danger that some of the protections and scaffolding that have been created for certain sectors and workers may be cast aside.  It is vitally important that there be no cliff edge in terms of the withdrawal of supports.  There are many industries that will take time to recover.  Hospitality will reopen but the question is whether, after the first couple of weeks, it will consistently get back to the level it was at in 2019.  We do not know the answer.  The industries that rely on the hospitality sector, including taxis and food supply businesses, may also take time to recover.  Other industries, such as aviation, will take even longer.  I have raised my concerns in that regard with the Minister for Transport.  Along with measures such as the digital green certificate and a continued provision of increased funding for our airports for the next three or four years, it is vital that subsidies such as the EWSS are continued for workers who return to work on limited hours and limited contracts.  They need to be supported and I am very disappointed that Aer Lingus has not decided to use the EWSS to keep workers employed over the course of the two months for which they are being temporarily laid off in Cork.  That is poor and I prevail on the Department and the Government to put pressure on the company and provide whatever supports are necessary to help keep those workers in employment.</p>  <p>  There are tens of thousands of people working in the hospitality sector, in pubs and restaurants, and many of them have suffered and put up with a great deal during this crisis.  They did so knowing they were assisting the response to the public health emergency.  However, there is a lot of frustration with the guidelines.  There seems to be an incoherence in regard to the guidance for hotels and restaurants.  As the previous speaker noted, the 105-minute rule arguably encourages people to go to a number of different venues.  That is not desirable and the rule should be reconsidered.</p></speech>

I find it difficult to accept some of what has happened since the beginning of the Covid crisis.  I take the opportunity to thank the workers on the front line and others who gave over their usual and way beyond what was expected of them to treat patients and make the regulations work.  I am thinking of garda&iacute;, doctors, nurses and all the people who have helped during a very precarious time.</p>  <p>  It is hard to plan for something like Covid because we do not know what will happen next.  We do not know what variant is around the corner or where the next outbreak might be.  All we can do is put our best foot forward and do so with a certain degree of humanity and compassion.  An understanding of the general public, what people want and what they have put up with since the start of the Covid crisis, must form part of our consideration.  During the period of lockdown, a huge amount of damage has been done to the economy and society.  It will be a long time, how long we do not know, before we see some sort of rebuilding of the economy, society and even of families.</p> <p>I will reluctantly go along with the legislation before us because we are now midstream and it is very difficult to comprehend what might be needed in three or four months' time.  However, members of the public are telling me that they want to see an end to these draconian measures.  They want to see us coming out and do not want to see a rolling lockdown or a rolling implementation of the measures.  I ask the Minister to consider responding to that and to give a clear message to the public, who are deeply concerned.  In our response to Covid on the economic front, while we gave great supports to the main part of the economy, sectors were left out and I have mentioned those who were over 66 years of age to the Minister previously, as well as other sectors.  The Government made very little effort to reach out to them and to bring them with it and I am shocked by that.  It is not good enough that the majority would be helped.  It is an effort on the side of the Government to ensure everyone who is being affected is helped.</p> <p> I have continually referred to the mental health issues that are now falling out of families who were never affected previously, as well as in respect of those who had been affected previously but whose situation has now worsened and who cannot get appointments.  I also tabled parliamentary questions on this issue during the week.  I have asked the Minister to consider the private sector, those who are giving counselling services and so on but that was met with a resounding "No" from the HSE.  It is the same for a family that is planning for someone to go to America for college or Erasmus purposes.  This is, again, a question I put to the Minister recently and the answer I got was so disrespectful to the Parliament it was hard to credit.  It more or less gave me the two fingers and told me where to go.  However, that family or families that I was representing had a right to know and the Minister should have responded differently.  He should have responded with the information that family was seeking.  Even if the answer was "No", it would have been far better to consider their position and to give that answer straight and fair.  What about those people who must travel to America for college or courses and who are trying to book their flights and accommodation?  The Minister and the Government show no understanding of it.  Therefore, my appeal to the Minister is to deal with the simple things as well.  He should deal with the issues that are emerging and the simple questions that are being asked and should stop the mixed messaging that has gone on over the past while.</p> <p> People are simply asking for information.  The aviation sector is just asking for information and there seems to be no definite plan we can explain to it.  I asked again about people in the retail sector and there is no understanding about what they must do to accommodate the holding of stock and the reopening of such enterprises.  There is only a general response to the sector.  Therefore, in the course of the next few months, when we are encouraging people to open, I want the Minister to be really specific and have really clear language in terms of the information he gives out.  I agree with previous speakers that this thing of an hour and five minutes and some of the other regulations currently being spoken about are absolutely farcical.  They will do nothing for the businesses the Minister is engaging with, nothing to do with the sector he is engaging with.  It gives them hope and then the Minister takes away 90% of that hope.  Please understand that a business cannot just reopen and a society cannot just reopen.  It must be done sensibly, with sympathy and with financial supports.  I ask that whenever a Member of this House asks for information, he or she should get it, regardless of party membership.  This is because when Members are asking for information, they do so for someone in their community who is in trouble.</p> <p> I place on record my thanks to Taiwan for making available a huge amount of personal protective equipment, PPE, for the various community and nursing homes throughout the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1476" speakername="Paul Donnelly" time="16:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600045#YY00200"><p>There is no doubt these laws are absolutely draconian, that is recognised by everyone.  In any normal society the laws we have been living under would never be contemplated nor would society ever have approved of their being brought in.  However, the majority of people have believed and indeed agree that in a pandemic, they were needed to control the virus.  Many people still believe some of these laws are necessary.  However, there is a growing number of our citizens, as well as ourselves, who are becoming increasingly concerned that the leeway given during the pandemic is now being taken advantage of.  We are coming out of this pandemic and the numbers are still of concern but there is a recognition we are going in the right direction.  That is good news and I know from interactions with my constituents that they also feel it is going in the right direction.  I see no need to roll over these draconian laws for another three-month period without reflecting on them, taking our time, seeing which ones we can get rid of and which ones must be dropped.  It is reasonable that we come back here in July, and if necessary, the month after and the month after that, until they have all been removed from our legislative system when no longer required.  I ask the Minister to let us work together to build confidence that these laws will only be there for as long as necessary and not a minute longer.  To continue to roll this legislation over for another three months without further scrutiny is to shake citizens' confidence in the idea these laws were only temporary and a response to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  There is something that could really help to build confidence.  I know there are reports coming through that we will be ramping up to 400,000 vaccines over the next month, which is really welcome.  I got the vaccine last Friday over in Citywest and cannot compliment the staff enough.  However, there were huge queues and the wait for the vaccine was well over an hour.  I have heard of people waiting well over two hours for the vaccine.  Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown in Dublin West has a catchment area with a population of 330,000 people.  I ask that, in order to build confidence, we look at using it or a similar site within Dublin 15 as a vaccination centre when those extra vaccines come through.  It would be really useful and help to build confidence.</p></speech>

I also wish to praise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and condemn last nights' incident.  I thank the Garda, front-line staff, hospital staff, nursing home staff and all the people.  The meitheal spirit came back in when this plague hit us.  However, the reaction of the Government has tried to destroy that meitheal spirit.  Much has been said here.  I object to this Bill being taken today because we were meant to have a sunset clause of 9 June.  That was passed by people although I voted against it.  I did vote for it in early times back at the very beginning because I, like everyone else, was frightened but thanks be to God the impact was nothing like what was feared.  I saw very soon that we needed to let the people live as well, and live with Covid.  However, we did not do so.  I must raise the way the Government has treated us as Opposition leaders.  Neither the Minister for Health nor the Taoiseach have met Opposition leaders since last October.  The Minister for Health has never once replied to any question I have asked him in the Chamber.  I put parliamentary questions in as does Deputy McGuinness.  He gets replies, thank God; I do not.</p> <p>At least he gets those replies, although they might be a disgrace and not fit for purpose, as he said.  The Minister is demonstrating arrogance in treating the House like this, depriving it of its powers to represent the people.  This is not insulting me but rather the people in Tipperary who elected me to come here and get answers to questions and provide some leadership.<br/><br/>The Minister has known since March that an ordinary discussion of the sunset clause and vote would not do.  Why did he not tell us earlier?  I found out today from Deputy Cullinane that there was a briefing for the health spokespersons of groups last week but we were not invited.  Sections of our democracy have been put in the bold boy corner.  Apparently they did not need to come.  That is shameful.<br/><br/>This year, four Bills on this matter have been put in front of us.  I want to be fair but critical of the media, particularly RT&Eacute;.  On Tuesday last week, it was leaked from the Cabinet that the emergency provisions would be extended and Mr. Paul Cunningham tweeted this as a fact, despite the fact that there was yet to be debate, amendments and votes in the Seanad and here.  He was asked by a very eminent barrister to withdraw the claim made in the tweet but he did not even acknowledge it.  It is the same with <i>The Irish Times</i>and the <i>Irish Independent</i>, which gave the impression this was a done deal.  Is this House so irrelevant now and our democratic system so undermined the media can tell people such things via tweets?  It frightened people and my phone and those of many others started ringing, with people calling from all over the country.<br/><br/>People were calling us because they were worried.  Why was that kind of blackguarding going on?  The news was leaked but the Bill still had to come through this House.  I know the Minister does not have much respect for us but the legislation must come through here.  We have the right to speak to the Bill and oppose it.  We will oppose it 100%.<br/><br/>I have said that extensions to four pieces of legislation constitute the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) Bill 2021 that we are now debating.  Why was it necessary to introduce a new Bill as each Bill could have been dealt with individually?  Does the Minister consider the extension of Part 3 in the Act to be so important as to justify an individual vote by all Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la so that all of those who continue to vote in favour of this &quot;draconian&quot; legislation - to quote the Minister's words from the Seanad on Monday - can be held to account by the public?<br/><br/>The Minister said in the Seanad that these measures were draconian and he called them worse while he was in opposition, saying he would never support them.  He tripped over them when he became a Minister and got into power.  To hell with the people or the accountability to this House at that stage.<br/><br/>Is it the case that Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 has been lumped in with other legislation in order to create confusion, conflate matters and give Deputies an out if they want to vote in favour of an extension, citing that they are not just voting on Part 3 of that Act?  This is a three card trick, as I said.  The Minister is trying to kid us but he will not kid us or the people.<br/><br/>Why did the Cabinet make selective leaks about this emergency legislation, including extending Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, in full knowledge that a vote would have to take place in this House?  Where is the accountability and respect for Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la in this House?<br/><br/>There have been unfortunate deaths.  I hope those responsible in the State will be brought to The Hague or somewhere for crimes against humanity.  Some 2,000 people died in nursing homes and they all had families and loved ones.  Some 750 people contracted Covid in a hospital ward, including a good friend of mine.  That is 2,750 deaths, if we can believe any of the figures.  They have been up and down and changed around, all so as to create fear, intimidate and destroy democracy.<br/><br/>One death is one too many and I sympathise with families and staff in nursing homes and hospitals.  They could not even have a funeral, time with their loved ones or a family wake, which we hold so dear in Ireland.  I hope the Minister will be held accountable.  He was not there at the start but another Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, was, along with the rest of them.  Somebody must be held accountable.<br/><br/>We now know 99.1% of people tested are negative but apparently we still want to proceed with this draconian legislation for a further six months.  We fought for a sunset clause that would take effect on 9 June, which we got, but now the Minister is piling on another four Bills on top of the original legislation.<br/><br/>Why is antigen testing not being used?  The whole of Europe and the rest of the world is using antigen testing.  A couple contacted my office last night with a sad story.  It was a young man and his wife, whose dad is a distant cousin of mine.  Her father is terminally ill and receiving palliative care.  The husband and wife, along with their four kids, arrived in a port in Ireland by car to come see her dying father.  They had used antigen tests so they were sent back and mercilessly refused entry to this country.  They had to travel back to where they came from on a later ferry without seeing the woman's dad, the grandfather of the children.  What kind of trauma does this inflict on people?  It is inhumane.  We see what happens at borders in Third World countries and say it is inhumane but this is an equivalent level.  We are meant to be a civilised country.  The antigen tests are accepted all over the world but not here.<br/><br/>Many people have said PCR tests are inaccurate.  I am not a scientist but the system is flawed.  It is being kept so vested interests can make money.  There are conglomerates in major industries that have doubled their income in this pandemic while small family businesses and those who are self-employed, including the man with a van, performers, actors, dancers and staging personnel, have seen havoc wreaked on their livelihoods.  The conglomerates, meanwhile, are doubling or tripling their income.  There is much money being made, and as Churchill said, never waste a good crisis.<br/><br/>These events are being hijacked and the Minister is a willing accomplice.  He had no experience.  I would give anybody a chance and I wished the Minister well on his appointment.  He was an Independent, like me, when he was first elected to the D&aacute;il before jumping ship to the Social Democrats and then jumping again, this time into bed with Fianna F&aacute;il.  That was the party he castigated and I would not even repeat the names he called that party as I have many friends in Fianna F&aacute;il.  To make it worse, he has treated us arrogantly in this House.  He has not once responded to a question from me.  The Ceann Comhairle and the Government Chief Whip have asked him to do so.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, is the same.<br/><br/>In the middle of a crisis he closed a wonderful hospital in Carrick-on-Suir, St. Brigid's.  He met Councillor Kieran Bourke and Deputy Jackie Cahill in July last year and I met Councillor Bourke on the same night.  The Minister gave an assurance that the facility would return to normal use when Covid-19 passed but he upturned those words to a colleague in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The place was closed in November after all kinds of subterfuge and downright lies.  The Minister threw Councillor Burke under the bus.  He had a commitment from the Minister, which he broadcast and told people about in good faith.  If a man does not have his word, he has absolutely nothing.  The wonderful hospital, for which many people fundraised, is gone now and closed.  The rooms are dark.  We are told there would be a diabetes centre when there is a primary care facility the size of this room folamh.  It is a waste.  Doctors and nurses worked in that hospital and there were people from my constituency and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, and Deputy McGuinness who used it for the likes of palliative care.  People fundraised for beds and kitchen equipment to make it a bit easier to provide the excellent palliative care.  It was about making people's last days comfortable.  Boxes were left at funerals as goodwill donations and all that was thrown back in the face of the people.<br/><br/>This entire episode has been a massive slap in the face for democracy.  I have used words several times and I will not mention them today.  I mentioned the 1930s in Germany.  We approved the powers initially but when we saw they were not necessary, we opened our eyes and asked questions.  Anybody who spoke out, whether doctors, consultants or whoever else, was banished, sacked or unceremoniously dismissed.  These were the best of people.  Dr. Tony Holohan has been challenged by groups of doctors to have a debate but has refused point-blank to meet them.<br/><br/>In the last meeting I had with Dr. Holohan in the Taoiseach's office in Government Buildings, I asked him about the science behind churches being closed.  I was very concerned about what had happened to Fr. PJ Hughes, Protestant clergymen and many others but he would not answer me.  The third time I asked, the Taoiseach asked him to respond to me.  The Minister was there as well.  He said &quot;Deputy McGrath, we are dealing with a pandemic, we will do the lockdown and do the science later.&quot;  What arrogance shown to a public representative or anybody else.  He spoke about doing the science later but there has been no science.  It has been a con job from the start.  There was no science and he would not listen to any debate.  RT&Eacute; and the mainstream media were bought out.</p> <p>They are &euro;5 million better off now than they were when this started.  All of the local radio stations, including in my area, got massive money.  Not having a contrarian view is very dangerous for democracy.  Without proper discourse and debate, we have nothing.  I am glad, therefore, that more Opposition Deputies have joined us and will vote against these measures.</p> <p> As I said, the Minister has known since March that extending the sunset clause would not do, and he kept that information from us.  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, as I said earlier.  The Minister introduced it in the Seanad, which is sneaky, because legislation introduced in the Seanad cannot have pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is a three-card trick all the time but people are wise to what is going on.  None of the four Bills Deputies will vote on this week will have had pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Joint Committee on Health could have dealt with the Bill if it had come before it, as it should have given that the Minister has known since March.  The crack all the time is that we do not have time, it is an emergency and the legislation is urgent.</p> <p> The guidelines have been illogical and confusing.  Here we go again, waiting until Friday night for more announcements.  I have publicans, shopkeepers and those who work in hospitality waiting to find out what is going on.  Now the Minister has had a brainwave and people will not be allowed to stay more than one hour and 45 minutes in a public house or restaurant.  I believe this is to suit the restaurants in Dublin which want a turnover of business, for which I cannot blame them.  The Government is kowtowing to them.  The guidelines say that tables indoors must be 1 m apart, and now the back of the chair must be 2 m from the back of the next chair.  The Minister is out to finish small pubs completely.  The Government is blackguarding small restaurants and hostelries of different hues.  It is shocking confusion.  Businesses want clarity about starting up again.</p> <p> I spoke to a good friend of mine, Val O'Gorman, a young businessman who runs Mr Mister in Cahir.  I asked him on Thursday how his business was going this week.  Business did not start, he said, because people are still not going out.  They cannot go anywhere and they have no need to dress up.  There is no certainty and there is no real hope.</p> <p> I salute An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Tipperary and all over the country.  I condemn the horrific event last night.  I salute Sergeant Ray Moloney in Cahir Garda station and his excellent team of community garda&iacute;, Jenny Gough, Noel Glavin and the another great garda whose name I cannot recall.  I salute Sergeant Kieran O'Regan and Garda Claire Murphy in Clonmel and all the other community garda&iacute;.  They do great and sterling work.  We are damaging the Garda, however.  The Garda stopped a drive-by taxi protest in Dublin.  That was draconian and definitely 1930s style.  The drivers were not going to get out of their cars.</p> <p> We also see the damage being done to Aer Lingus pilots, with whom we met over the past days.  Our airlines are being destroyed.  Will the Minister please do something to save our airlines?  We need them.  Aer Lingus is a wonderful flagship and there is great respect for our airlines, including Ryanair.  We will need connectivity when this pandemic is finished.  We met the pilots today and yesterday and they are begging and pleading.  They told me the Taoiseach had driven by in his car.  When he is out of office the Taoiseach might want to fly Aer Lingus.  We will need an airline to fly.</p> <p> When we consider what is happening at Shannon Airport, we are being destroyed in rural Ireland.  The closure of the crew base there is just the latest development.  When these operations leave that kind of a set-up, we never get them back.  There are opportunities now, if we are looking for them, to have connectivity with other parts of the world and bring in tourists.  Ireland has the eighth highest number of American visitors in the world but they are heading to the Caribbean now.  We must get those people back here.  They are our brethren and diaspora, and they want to come back.</p> <p> Mar fhocal scoir.  I am disappointed and have been let down by the democratic system.  It has failed us here.  The Minister is continuing to be complicit in this failing.  He is actually designing it to fail and to be unfair.  We need to get F&aacute;ilte Ireland back to getting tourists into Ireland.  It has to stop issuing regulations on when people can do what, where and for how long.  It knows nothing about that and it has completely denied it had anything to do with the regulations.  The Minister uses it as a stool pigeon to blame afterwards.  The unfairness and inequity are appalling.</p></speech>

When these powers were first brought in there was a need for exceptional emergency powers, but we do not need them now.  We have vaccines and the vaccine roll-out is going well.  It was going so well in Killarney that it has been paused for three days until Friday.  It is going well on our side of the country, except that we are bringing people from Cork and Waterford to Killarney and people from Rathmore, Gneeveguilla and east Kerry are going up to Limerick, which does not make sense.  I am asking for that matter to be rectified because people from Waterford came to Killarney again on Monday, even though I raised the issue with the Taoiseach last week.</p>  <p>  Instead of extending these powers, I ask the Minister to focus his attention on the mental and physical health of people all over the country.  With regard to mental health, the curtailing of civil liberties, for which our people gave their lives and their blood more than 100 years ago, has gone on for long enough now.  The vaccine is dealing with the virus and hopefully will get the better of it.  On physical health, patients have had cancer treatment impeded, held up and held off.  People are very worried because if cancer treatment is not carried out when it should be carried out, hours can perhaps be the difference between a person staying alive and not staying alive.  I ask the Minister for Health to focus his attention on that.</p>  <p>  The Minister said that pubs and restaurants can resume outdoor dining and hotels can resume indoor dining.  I am not upset at the hotels being able to have their customers inside, but I am upset for the ordinary punters who are told they must eat and drink outside in this inclement weather.  Maybe the Minister will tell us that he will sort out the weather also.</p>  <p>  In the Six Counties people can eat and drink inside bars and restaurants.  Ordinary people just want to have a pint or a meal in their local bar or restaurant.  If the Minister insists that it is only hotels that can accommodate this, people from all around rural County Kerry will go into the towns of Kenmare and Killarney just to get in from the rain and into hotels to have a pint.  Spreading the crowd around like this is not on at all.  The Minister must trust the people and advise them.  Holding on to the restrictions until next November, or maybe even February, is not good enough.</p>  <p>  I have a question on NPHET.  Dr. Tony Holohan is advising against antigen testing.  Is another member of NPHET involved in testing?  Does that member have a testing enterprise or is he involved in a company that produces test kits, which are in competition with antigen testing?  I have asked this question of the Taoiseach a couple of times before and he told me there was no such member of NPHET.  I have been told there is.</p>  <p>  It is very unfair that pubs and restaurants will not know the details of the restrictions until the very last minute.  The Minister said he will tell us on Friday, but I am afraid he will not even do it then, although he knows the details.  It is wrong to assume that publicans can bring in beer and restaurants can bring in food at very short notice.  It is not like that.  They must get staff, prepare and buy stock.  The  Minister must give them a proper chance.</p>  <p>  I cannot vote for the extension of these exceptional powers.  The exceptional need that was there when these measures were first brought in is not there now. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="16:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600047#AAA00300"><p>I thank the Minister for setting out in detail the reasons new legislation is required to deal with Covid-19.  In March and April 2020, legislation had to be introduced to give powers to the Government and the Minister to bring forward the necessary regulations.  This legislation was required to have careful and planned management of how we would deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>At that time, thousands around the world were becoming seriously ill and dying from Covid-19.  Some of the provisions of the 2020 legislation will come to an end on 9 June 2021.  It is, therefore, necessary to bring forward the Bill in order that powers can be extended for a further period of time.  Dealing with Covid-19 posed major difficulties for the entire population of the country.  There were major challenges for the entire population of the country.  There were major challenges in our nursing homes, hospitals and residential care settings.  It was also highly risky for all patients, residents and staff members working in these facilities.<br/><br/>It is important that we do not forget the dedication and commitment of the medical teams and all of the support staff.  The medical teams had to deal with a virus where there was very little information available on the best way of managing and treating the patients who had contracted it.  These teams responded in the best way possible and provided the care and treatment that was required in the most difficult of circumstances.  Many healthcare staff themselves contracted Covid-19 while working and some have been left to deal with long Covid.<br/><br/>We have learned some very clear lessons from the Covid pandemic.  Lesson No. 1 is that the Covid virus must never be underestimated.  The pandemic has also taught us that acting early and acting decisively is crucial to controlling the spread of the virus.  We now know that tough public health measures do work.  We know that outside is much safer than indoors, that masks do work and that good ventilation makes a difference.  Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of scientists and pharmaceutical companies, a range of effective vaccines have been produced and more are in the pipeline.  The vaccine dividend is very obvious in nursing homes, in the healthcare sector and in the wider community.<br/><br/>We know that some Covid-19 variants are highly transmissible.  The scale of the pandemic around the world makes it inevitable that new variants will emerge.  Some of them will be more transmissible while others may be more dangerous.  We know the damage the Kent variant caused at the beginning of the year.  We know there are real concerns regarding Indian variants now circulating in the UK.  There are also cases of the Indian variant in this country.  As we relax restrictions, a high level of public vigilance will be required.  It is necessary to have legislation in place that will allow the Government to respond effectively to any dangerous new developments that may occur during the summer.  Public safety must remain the Government&rsquo;s first priority.<br/><br/>The pandemic is first all a health crisis but it also is an economic crisis.  The Government has responded to the economic crisis at all stages and for all sectors of the economy with speed and generosity.  This partnership and collaboration among social partners has helped support a high level of social solidarity during the pandemic.  On the situation worldwide, it has been repeatedly said that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.  The stark situation in India and the spread of dangerous Indian variants make the point that the fight against the Covid pandemic is a global fight.<br/><br/>The World Health Organization is providing strong leadership on Covid and, more recently, the IMF has produced an economic analysis which illustrates very clearly the enormous economic benefits to economies and peoples everywhere if vaccines are rolled out with speed across the entire world.  Writing in the <i>Financial Times</i>today, Martin Wolf makes the point that the economic benefits of vaccinating the whole world by the middle of 2022 would be of the order of 180 times the cost of doing so.<br/><br/>During the Covid lockdowns, personal savings have increased significantly.  As the economy reopens and people begin to spend more, we should all be aware of the benefit of spending local and supporting Irish producers, Irish suppliers and Irish services.  The hospitality and tourism sectors have been particularly badly hit during the pandemic.  Now is the time to support them and help them recover some of their losses.  Simply put, the further away from home we spend our money the less chance it has of returning to our local communities. <br/><br/>While we have learned a lot during the past 18 months, there is still one big unknown.  We do not know the trajectory of Covid-19.  It is contained and under some control at the moment but we do not know what its trajectory will be in the months and years ahead.  We must hope for a good outcome but we must also be prepared to face whatever unwelcome turns this virus may yet take.<br/><br/>On the legislation itself, when the Government brings forward emergency measures it is important that there are checks and balances, in particular in respect of ministerial regulation.  Last week in the House, I mentioned a regulation put in place that did not have the required legislative support.  It was left in place for more than 28 years and when it was eventually identified more than &euro;400 million had to be refunded to people from whom moneys had been illegally deducted.  Likewise, the legislation and every ministerial regulation must be carefully monitored and must go through the appropriate scrutiny.  The Oireachtas must not vest in the Government powers that at some later stage can be used in an inappropriate way.  Therefore, I welcome the decision by the Minister and the Government to provide for three-month reviews.  This is important.  I thank the Minister and his Department for all of the work they have done over the past 12 months in dealing with this very difficult issue.</p></speech>

The Minister recognises these are essential services and we have worked together in the past to get these services back up and running.  The Covid-19 crisis has been especially difficult for people in recovery.  We are being contacted by many individuals and groups to state they are seeing an increase in relapses into addiction.  They are also seeing more people develop harmful addiction patterns.  The Minister has told me he will look at this after Friday.  He should be looking at it now and advocating for these groups in order they can be included in the announcement and are not an afterthought.  They are considered essential services and we know people in recovery have struggled through the pandemic.  These meetings are a vital lifeline for people and they need this support.  We hear that attendances are increasing and people are being turned away from meetings because they have to stick to the guidelines.  All I ask is that we, and the Minister, are proactive and take a proactive approach to planning for the increase in numbers in order that no one is turned away.  These are essential services and they need to be opened.</p>  <p>  On a separate issue, there is very little in terms of entertainment at present because of the restrictions.  We have to reimagine how socialising can be relaxed because of the risks posed by Covid-19.  One of the innovative ideas that came out in Cork and throughout the State was the introduction of drive-in cinemas. Following last week's comments by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that they are safe because people do not leave their cars, the Government needs to update the information on whether these cinemas can reopen.</p>  <p>  I cannot understand why we are sitting here at present and not in Leinster House.  It costs tens of thousands of euro every week for the D&aacute;il to sit here.  I have to speak to shop workers, factory workers, taxi drivers, front-line healthcare workers and garda&iacute; who do not have this luxury.  We have one rule for politicians and another for ordinary people.</p> <p>We should be meeting in Leinster House and doing our business in the same way as every other worker in this country must do every day.  I ask the Minister and the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mattie McGrath, to seek a way to get us back to Leinster House.</p></speech>

I will not be supporting the legislation, although I would class myself as a law-abiding citizen and believe in the necessity of laws.  What is happening here is that Draconian legislation is being rolled out without any real discussion, except for this limited debate we are now having.</p>  <p>  We are back debating the extension of four significant items of legislation without any review of their operation.  No evidence has been put before us, with the exception of the Minister's speech in which he told us that what is proposed does "not sit easy with" him.  Is it not a profound statement that the legislation does not sit easy with him?  There is no analysis of its operation, no human rights assessment and no concrete analysis of the affects of the legislation to date or how it has been operated.  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny.  If something does not sit well with the Minister, one would imagine that he would look at the appropriate procedures and mechanisms and obtain an analysis of the legislation in order that it would sit better with him.  One of the most obvious ways to do that is by means of pre-legislative scrutiny with the relevant committee and having the various relevant organisations come before that committee, including the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which we set up for a particular purpose, and other organisations as well.  In addition, ordinary people might come fore the committee to indicate how the legislation has affected them on a daily basis.  We have done none of that, however.  We do not have a Bills digest because the Library and Research Service has not had an opportunity to prepare a comprehensive note so that we can be educated on what is proposed.</p>  <p>  The Bill was listed as a priority in the Government's summer legislation list.  There is no surprise about that, and we already knew about the sunset clause.</p>  <p>  I supported the legislation which, significantly, was introduced the day after St. Patrick's Day last year.  I remember having the most serious doubts and I did as much as I could in the limited time available to analyse what we were doing.  To a man and a woman in this D&aacute;il, we gave the then caretaker Government our full support.  Nobody disagreed, even though many of us had serious concerns.  Of course, it is a regular activity that the Government includes good and bad in legislation so that we in opposition are caught saying that if one votes against something, one is voting against the payments which are absolutely necessary.  It is seriously disingenuous of the Government - as was the case with that which preceded it - to approach legislation in that way.  I gave my consent in March 2020 on the basis of full and frank disclosure.  If people go back over any of the contributions I have made since, they will discover that I pointed this out.  I wanted to trust even though my experience in life told me not to do so.  It was a pandemic and for the sake of vulnerable people who needed to be protected, I went with that legislation on the basis that the Government would come back and give us full and frank disclosure of how it was operating.</p>  <p>  As already stated, our purpose today is to amendment four items of legislation.  I will not go into them.  They are all outlined in the Bill before us, which gives Draconian powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, indeed, to other agents of the law such as a medical officer.  I would have thought that the Minister would explain to us at least why that is necessary approximately a year and two months since the pandemic was declared and when the numbers have gone the right way.</p>  <p>  I do not like listing off numbers but as of 14 May, which was the last update we received, there had been 254,870 cases of Covid and 4,941 deaths.  Some of those deaths should not have happened but that is a debate for another day.  We did not protect our vulnerable from day one.  Quite a substantial segment of the media had absolutely no interest in questioning what was happening when some of us questioned, way back in March and April, the position in respect of nursing homes, meat plants and direct provision centres, which were not put to the top of the list.</p>  <p>  I can forgive mistakes being made because it was an emergency situation, although we were fully aware, in January, February and March of last year, what was going on in other countries.  We should have been fully aware, from the HIQA reports, of the state of our nursing homes.  We had to adopt a strategy to cope with Covid in a particular way because we had utterly failed to put in place a public health system - in the context of acute hospitals, primary care and, more importantly, the public health segment - that could assist us in trying to deal with a pandemic.  Even with that strategy, we failed by discharging patients with Covid from hospitals and admitted them into other facilities without testing them.  That, too, is a matter for another day.</p>  <p>  We set up a committee, chaired by Deputy McNamara, which did a very good job and produced a report that was ignored.  Then, the committee was disbanded.</p>  <p>  In a pandemic, what is needed is trust.  When all Deputies give the Government their full support in respect of Draconian legislation, if that trust is betrayed, it has the most serious consequences for democracy.  It has serious consequences for me, as a Deputy and as a woman, having no trust in a system because I, in turn, cannot inspire trust.  I still went along with the Government up to a point but as more and more legislation came before us without any analysis or data, I said - I say it again now - "No, I cannot do that."</p>  <p>  It is not good enough for the Minister to state that what is proposed does not sit well with him.  It is not good enough for him to come before the House with legislation that allows for rolling sunset clauses.  It was the Opposition, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and various other organisations that insisted on a sunset clause in the first items of legislation and now even that is being undone with a series of rolling sunset clauses.  The Minister tells us that he will change this with an amendment.  If one were cynical - I am deeply cynical but I try not to be - one would think that we will now talk about a sunset clause in terms of how great the Minister is to realise that we should not have rolling sunset clauses and how great it is that he is willing to change his view on that as opposed to getting a full and frank analysis of the Draconian legislation before us from the relevant committee and that said analysis could eventually be debated in the D&aacute;il.  Deputy Bruton referred to the mental health tribunals.  What the Deputy said was extraordinary.  I am in complete agreement with his assertion that it is time for a forensic analysis of the legislation.  One wonders how this legislation will be passed because there has been no forensic analysis.  If Deputy Bruton is saying it is important, one would think the Government might also think it is important.  However, we are going to pass this Bill in the absence of any forensic analysis.</p>  <p>  Looking at the mental health tribunals that were introduced under the Mental Health Act 2001 following huge effort and analysis but, like that, it was decided that such tribunals could be reduced to one-person operations and could be done on paper.  One would imagine that the Minister would have some statistics for us in respect of the operation of these tribunals.  One would imagine he would have some information on how many people a medical officer has decided, in his or her opinion. represent a threat in the context of the spread of Covid, etc..  There is absolutely nothing before us, however.</p>  <p>  The one good thing that was done was by the former Minister for Justice who gave a role to the Policing Authority to monitor this legislation.  That, in itself, has given rise to fascinating reports.  I understand that 14 or 15 such reports have been produced.  I have monitored them closely.  In April, we were informed that were 20,242 fixed charge notices had been issued for breaches of Covid regulations, 72.4% of which related to people for leaving their homes.  Those in the 18-to-25 age group were the subject of 53% of the fines and 75% were levied on males.  The point I am making is that there is a trend with regard to how the provisions in the legislation are being applied.</p>  <p>  There are regulations that have never been looked at in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>There are 92 Covid-related statutory instruments.  The Policing Authority has stated that they are absolutely impossible to follow.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has said they are very difficult to follow.  At the very least, regulations should be brought before us and published before they can become law.  None of this has happened.  I could go on but I will not.  Maybe I will get another chance on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I watched him throughout the debate as I listened to Deputy Connolly.  I do not always agree with Deputy Connolly but I always listen to her for a couple of reasons.  One reason is because she usually has something interesting to say.  The second is that, like everyone else here, she is elected to the House.  I have to take issue with the fact that the Minister is going through his departmental files as the debate is going on.</p></speech>

I will ask the Minister to address these, as he has agreed to take a note of them.</p>  <p>  We rolled over much legislation in October before the deadline of November.  I implored the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who sat approximately where the Minister is sitting now - the Minister was also present - to come back to us with a report on mental health tribunals.  Can we see that report before we vote on giving powers to roll this over indefinitely?  We are talking about introducing all of these amendments indefinitely.  Why do we not just amend the Mental Health Acts to say that people will not have a proper mental health tribunal, because that is what we have done?</p>  <p>  As Deputy Bruton said, there may have been a very good reason for this at the time, and I agree with him that there may well have been an excellent reason for it at the time, but that reason has passed.  If a person is being held involuntarily, that is happening because a doctor believes he or she poses a danger to himself or herself or others.  A mental health tribunal is held because a person wishes to challenge that and argue he or she has the capacity to engage with the world and does not need to be detained.  I cannot think of anything worse than a person being told he or she has had a hearing and others who looked into the case, disagreed with him or her and agreed with the person who is his or her captor.  How would a person have confidence, as a detained person, that an independent process looked into his or her case if he or she is not even brought before a tribunal and the decision of the tribunal is not properly imported to him or her?</p>  <p>  When we rolled this over we did not have proper statistics on presentations for self-harm.  I ask the Minister to tell me I am wrong and that we now have full statistics from March 2020 until April 2021 in respect of each and every emergency department in the State on presentations for self-harm.  How many suicides have there been?  Has there been an uptick in suicides in respect of 2020 or the first 12 months of the pandemic to March this year?  Do we have that information?  If not, how on earth can we make these decisions to roll the legislation over? </p>  <p>  I am not saying anything that I have not said before, but it strikes me as absurd that we are giving power to the Government to roll these regulations over.  In a couple of weeks' time I am sure as a Parliament we will roll over the Offences Against the State Act and the existence of the Special Criminal Court.  I do not have a problem with special criminal courts.  However, I refer to an independent commission chaired by a former Attorney General and member of the Supreme Court, the late Mr. Justice Anthony J. Hederman.  I have a problem with the fact that a person can be tried in the Special Criminal Court solely on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and that cannot be challenged.  We have rolled that over year after year, and then after an independent report, we rolled it over again.  Despite UN criticism, it was rolled over anyway.  That is where we are heading with this Bill. </p>  <p>  For the Minister to say that it does not sit well with him is a nonsense if he is introducing legislation to empower this to be rolled over year in and year out and month in and month out.  I fear that is what will happen.  Why are we rolling it over?  I am minded of a quote from when I studied law a very long time ago about the exclusionary rule of evidence, namely, that it is easier to sit in the shade and put chili peppers under some poor devil's nails than to gather evidence in the heat of the hot sun.  It is not an exact quote.  </p>  <p>  Why are we assuming these powers?  What have we done to increase healthcare capacity in order that some of these measures might not be necessary?  I am afraid to say I do not see a huge amount of information on that.  I appreciate that ICUs and hospitals cannot be built overnight.  They are in China.  In Wuhan a hospital was built in a fortnight.  We are modelling all of these lockdowns and extraordinary measures which are a complete anathema to western civilisation and our way of life from China.  Where are the new hospitals?  </p>  <p>  We could build fever hospitals in the 1950s when the country had a lot less money and tuberculosis, in particular, was rampant in our community.  We did not lock down our society in response to that because we acknowledged it would be around and we would not be able to get rid of it for a while, and that was not an appropriate response.  We are saying that we are nearly there and Covid will not be around for very much longer, but if we are wrong and it is around we need these powers to deal with it.  Which is it?  The Government could introduce legislation to extend the measures, which I would still oppose.  I, like Deputy Connolly, did not call a vote and oppose this draconian legislation a year ago although I feared it would be abused.  It was rolled over. </p>  <p>  Enough is enough at some point.  The powers have been in place.  The people have been locked down.  The same trolley count is evident in the midwest today as it was six months, a year, 18 months or two years ago.  Nothing has been done to increase hospital capacity or improve our stock of schools and the type of schools we have.  Yet, billions of taxpayers' money has been spent or, rather, borrowed and spent.  To quote the "Scrap Saturday" line of the late Brian Lenihan, "Maybe they'll forget".  I sat in Government backbenches and had to vote for budgets that were a choice between bad and worse.  I fear that is where we are heading again quickly if, instead of increasing our health capacity, we resort to locking down society and the economy.  </p>  <p>  We are going to do it at the behest of an unelected group of people, namely, NPHET, which is answerable to nobody.  A committee used to interrogate it.  Maybe the style of the interrogation was unpleasant for it.  If it was, I apologised at the time and I apologise again.  That is democracy, however.  If people want to wield that kind of power they have to answer questions to somebody.  It seems that it does not want to, even the very few difficult questions it is asked in press conferences.  One member came out against antigen testing, notwithstanding the fact that the European Union agreed to antigen testing across the bloc in the past.  Moreover, the chief scientific adviser to the Government has come out in favour of it.</p> <p>Yet it is this same adviser and the modelling group he is a member of that largely determine Government policy, which is wildly inaccurate, unfortunately.  It was wildly inaccurate in October-November when we locked down.  The idea to lock down to save Christmas was dreamt up by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  Of course it was going to have disastrous consequences, because we had an over-restrictive regime in place during the summer when people should be outside socialising, meeting and doing what human beings do.  We locked down in winter to save Christmas celebrations which were, perforce, going to be indoors, based on flawed, or apparently flawed, modelling.  Notwithstanding the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response report, none of the recommendations of which have been implemented, nobody has ever asked that all the information available to NPHET, including the modelling and coding, be published and peer reviewed.  That has not happened.</p> <p> We roll over the Special Criminal Courts, to which I object, and we roll over people who are suspected of being involved in a proscribed organisation.  In this instance, we are rolling over restrictions on people for doing what every human being does.  It is not acceptable.</p></speech>

The last year and a half has been incredibly difficult.  Mistakes were made and there is no question about that.  I still cannot understand why we did not control people who returned from Italy in the spring of last year.  We knew that was the main source.  I still cannot understand why we did not say to people who went to Cheltenham that they would have to quarantine for two weeks.  I still have serious misgivings on how the nursing home issue was handled, when people were discharged from nursing homes who potentially had Covid.  In 20 or 30 years' time, just as we look back at things in previous generations, that particular episode will be examined fully and I am not sure we will come out of it in a good light.</p>  <p>  It is well known that I oppose guillotines in the D&aacute;il unless there is an extreme emergency.  I believe in talking things out and giving everybody their say until, at least, I have done my best to persuade people to my point of view and they have done their best to persuade me to their point of view.  However, when I look at the bigger scene from a human, community and ordinary people's point of view, I have to look at what would have happened if we had not had restrictions and pit that against what did happen because we had restrictions.  At every step of the way, as any human being would, I will look at details of what was done and ask why this was or was not done.  Sometimes the Government was too strict and at other times too lax.  These are matters of detail, but the general position is that we needed controls. </p>  <p>  We have to admit that Covid has taken a huge toll.  There are a significant number of deaths and people who are suffering from long Covid and mental health issues.  Young people have lost well over a year of their lives in very constrained circumstances, when they should either have been in college mixing with many new people for the first time or in school doing all the things young people do.  I have to hand it to the young people of Ireland for their solidarity.  They have shown solidarity against a disease that would be much easier on them in the generality of these things, statistically, than it is on those who are in the older population.</p>  <p>  I am absolutely glad that we seem to be getting to a better place.  I received many letters and emails from people about the restrictions and this Bill.  I did not manage to answer them all, but my reply was that the practical effect of the Bill is quite simple, which is that we and the Government are rolling back the lockdown but it is a tricky balance as we found out at Christmas.  It is a balance between opening up and not allowing the genie out of the bottle again.  It is a race between opening up and the roll out of the vaccine.  We seem to be stuck at about 400 cases a day.  There are 40 people in intensive care units, ICU, at the moment.  I have been watching the British figures for a long time, day by day, and when I translate them, taking their population into account against ours and allowing they are six weeks ahead of us in the vaccine roll-out, they have for a long period been at about 100 to 200 cases a day.  In relative terms we are worse.  At this moment in time they, again, have much lower numbers in ICU than us, equivalent to the population. </p>  <p>  We are in a delicate position.  If we do not open up people will move on, but open up too fast and we might go backwards with the spread of the disease.  It was very difficult.  Families were separated from their loved ones.  I have grandchildren I have only seen a handful of times and a new grandchild in England I have not seen at all.  I have family in Australia.  These are all difficult realities so none of us is immune to what all this meant.  We can be over-legalistic about everything, but the reality on the human level and the real choice was that it was better to make all those sacrifices, take all those inconveniences, not visit the neighbours, not go to all the things one would normally go to, not meet constituents who had problems and try to do it other ways.  It was better to do that and try to come out the other side of this in the whole of one's health.</p>  <p>  As one of the older members of the House, I probably take as much physical exercise as most.  I do about 10 km every day, I am active, in the whole of my health and have not had a sick day in I cannot remember how many years.  However, I am told that, statistically, somebody of my age would be at very high risk if they caught Covid.  Speaking for my generation, I really thank the younger generations who were willing to take restrictions because they knew the older generation would be hugely vulnerable to this, even if the risk for them was much less.  Up until Christmas, many people said to me the restrictions were way too strict.  Then January and February happened and the hospitals were full.</p> <p>There was one lady I knew very well, though thankfully I do not know many people in the whole of their health who died from this disease.  I was talking to her at the beginning of January.  I knew her well and used to be on the phone to her.  She was a widow living on her own.  What happened in her case was that a friend came to visit, they had a cup of tea and went for a drive.  The friend did not realise she had Covid and this lady got it and was dead by the end of the month.  If she had not caught Covid, there is no reason to believe she would not be in the whole of her health today.</p> <p> I heard people in the debate this evening talking about capacity in the health service.  Of course we need capacity in the health service, and that issue must be addressed, but that does not solve the Covid dilemma.  We did not try to control Covid because we did not have capacity in the health service.  It was a factor, particularly in the beginning, but the other factor was that preventative medicine is always a much better option for a bigger number of the population than trying to cure them when they get sick.  That is why we have campaigns against smoking, that is why we encourage people to take exercise, and that is why we have so many checks on people's health.  No matter what the capacity of the health service is, the effort should be to avoid people winding up in hospital and minimise the number of people who do.  Everybody who reflects on it would say that hospitals and care are hugely important when people need them but that they are the last option.  It is much better never to wind up there if it can be avoided at all.</p> <p> We have some magnificent scenery around where I live and we are willing to share it with anybody who wants to come.  One of the great positives that has come out of this is the huge appreciation people have developed for exercise, the great outdoors, nature, and a different type of life than they may have been living beforehand.  In some cases people had more time at home because they were working from home.  I hope that good things will come out of this whole episode, as always happens with things like this.  One of them could be a much better work-life balance for people with young families.  They would not have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning, leave the kids at the cr&egrave;che at 7 a.m. and come home at 7 or 8 o'clock at night, try to look after the kids and tumble out of bed again the next day.  Many more of them will be able to live a much more civilised life and work from home two or three days a week.  Even on the days they go in, they could do so outside rush hour and not be sitting in traffic for an hour and a half on a journey that might take half an hour or three quarters of an hour at off-peak times.</p> <p> There seems to be some worry in the ether that lockdowns will last forever.  I do not really buy into that because if there was no good reason as the people saw it - not as the barristers, lawyers and solicitors here see it but as the people do - and if they did not think lockdown was needed, there would not be any compliance.  In practice, enforcement of all this has, in the main, been benign, reasonable and proportionate.  None of these regulations would have worked if the vast majority of people did not know in their hearts and souls that there was a need for what was being done on health grounds and that it was in their interest.  The vast majority of people adhered to the rules because they knew in their heart and soul that it was being done for their good.  In the very unlikely event that any Government thought it could continue with lockdowns when there was no significant risk to the people, it would be absolutely foolish to do so because the people would do what they would and they would not do what they have done, which is to comply.</p> <p> In reality, all the other lockdowns, partial lockdowns and partial reopenings were in a different scenario from the one we are in now.  So far, it would appear that the vaccines are very effective in stopping transmission and preventing people from getting the virus asymptomatically or symptomatically and winding up in hospital or an ICU.  The HPSC epidemiological reports show that as we move down the age cohorts of people getting the vaccine, the incidence of the disease is collapsing.  The incidence of hospitalisation is collapsing in the groups among whom there were once the greatest numbers of deaths and hospitalisations.  I do not take this issue lightly.  I hope we will not have to continue with lockdowns.  I am very confident that we will not and that Covid is something with which science is beginning to catch up.  Even if new variants appear, scientists will be able to vary the vaccine to deal with any possible mutations in the future, as they do with the flu vaccine.</p> <p> The situation as I see it is that the Government has a tricky decision to make, on the advice of NPHET.  At the end of the day, it is not NPHET that is making the decision; it is the Government.  The decision to be made is how quickly to open up and how confident it is that when we do, the disease will stay under control.  We are lucky that Britain has got ahead of us.  We are very lucky that there is a country across the water with a massive population that is six weeks ahead of us and has opened up way more than we have.  Even on this island there are six counties where there has been a much greater opening up and it appears that, because they have reached a certain level of vaccination, they can control the disease in a stable way.  The portents are good.</p> <p> Civil liberties are hugely important.  There are major protections within the Constitution of this State for people's civil liberties, including the inviolability of the home, the right to public assembly, the right to free association and so on.  If any Government were mad enough to go beyond the point of reason, balance and overwhelming scientific evidence by continuing with lockdowns into the future, I do not think this D&aacute;il would pass such a proposal.  Even if we all got a rush of blood to our heads, I imagine that someone would take a case to the courts on constitutional freedoms and I have no doubt that the Supreme Court would rule in that person's favour, if it did not believe there was an overwhelming argument in favour of the restrictions.  There are a lot of protections in that regard.  Sometimes people who look at things through a microscope all the time do not get the big picture that the ordinary people who do not spend their days delving into the minutiae of laws see.  We were faced with an unprecedented situation and, as I have pointed out, I would argue with some of the details of how it was handled.</p> <p>I thought it was sometimes way too strict and other times not so strict.  Intrinsically, however, there was a high rate of compliance with the advice and directives from the Government because the people, the ordinary people, understood the risk.  They understood that even if there were no rules, that it was in their own interest to adhere to the measures.  </p> <p> Some people told me that they thought the measures were too strict.  I had them on one hand, pulling out of me that way, while others told me that we were too lax altogether.  They gave out yards to me because they thought we were not being strict enough and they asked me why the Government was not doing a much bigger job of enforcement.  I remember getting frantic phone calls about people being on beaches in Connemara last year and being too close together.  I think the risk in that situation was slight and I always thought that was the case.  As I said to those people, if you got a can of air freshener and emptied it on such a beach, the contents would not last long in the wind on a Connemara beach on a winter's day.  The people who were ringing me about that aspect, though, were afraid.  </p> <p> Therefore, we must continue to try to get the balance right and we must continue to try to keep the people with us as we do so.  The majority of people have, I think, accepted the need for what was done to date.  I hope now that at the end of this week, we will go another step in a process and then take more such steps every two to three weeks from now on, as the vaccinations roll out.  The key to everything we are doing lies in how fast we can vaccinate people, and specifically regarding how quickly we are able to get not only one but two injections into all those eligible for them, namely, all adults over the age of 18.  We will free up the country not by changing the law, but by rolling out the vaccines ever faster.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="17:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600053#GGG00200"><p>I oppose the continuation of these emergency measures for the proposed six months.  I feel that time is excessive given that a sizeable proportion of the population is now being vaccinated, including the older cohort and those deemed vulnerable to the disease.  In fact, the majority of people contracting Covid-19 now are those in the younger age groups and, for the most part, are not experiencing significant health implications.  Many have no symptoms whatsoever.</p><p>While I am not suggesting that all restrictions be dropped or removed, I do not see the necessity of extending these provisions for six months.  These measures need to be reviewed and discussed monthly, perhaps, and restrictions removed as they are no longer needed.  In common with most people, I recognise that restrictions were needed to prevent the spread of the disease and death or serious illness befalling the more vulnerable members of our society.  That was especially the case when we did not know much about the disease.  It was also to control the numbers needing to attend hospitals.  Thankfully, those numbers are now low.  Society is opening again, albeit slowly, and we must continue this process and see things return to normal as quickly as possible, obviously in a safe way.</p><p>While encouraging people to continue with social distancing, washing their hands and avoiding crowds etc., businesses must be allowed to reopen.  People must be allowed to mix again, and that is essential for the mental well-being of our people, whether in the workforce or through sport or social activity.  I live in a Border area and that has meant that the faster reopening of society in the North has had an impact on many businesses and activities in the Border counties.  For example, swimming pools with group lessons are being allowed to resume before the end of this month in the North but to my knowledge, no date has been issued for the resumption of such swimming classes in the South.  That means that people in the Border area will book lessons in the North, to the detriment of those offering lessons in the South.  The same situation applies to gym membership, with gyms open in the North but not in the South or at least we have no dates for that yet.  Therefore, we need definitive dates for reopening all these activities.</p><p>I am also concerned about the ever-growing waiting list for hospital appointments and especially for further diagnosis of possible cancer symptoms.  A woman I know noticed a lump in her breast and she was referred to the BreastCheck clinic in a hospital in Dublin by her GP.  Her file was marked urgent.  Four weeks later, that woman has still not been called for an appointment and when she followed up on this situation she was told that she would be waiting for another 14 to 16 weeks, on top of the time she had been waiting already.  I am hearing reports that the waiting list for appointments for urgent cancer checks is now extending to about three to four months, whereas it normally would have been within one month.  We all know that early diagnosis regarding possible cases of cancer is vital.  Are provisions being made to deal with the backlog of people awaiting further checks for cancer symptoms?</p><p>  People in all walks of life need a clear timeline for the reopening of society.  People have had enough at this stage and their mental health is suffering.  Public waiting lists for hospital appointments are growing, and businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector, are also suffering.  Emergency payments must be extended until society has fully reopened.  I call on the Government to ensure that the short-time work support payment is extended for workers in industries which are still unable to reopen fully due to ongoing public health restrictions.  Many employees have been placed on reduced hours due to the impact of Covid-19 and as a result have been receiving this benefit.  However, I think it may be coming to an end, with no indication of it being continued.  Therefore, something needs to be done to protect those workers.  They cannot be allowed to just work those short-time hours without the benefit of the payment.  </p><p>In conclusion, a blanket extension of these restrictions is not necessary and especially not for six months.  These measures must be reviewed and then extended, with only those absolutely necessary remaining.  The D&aacute;il should be allowed to debate these measures and vote on them in future.  </p></speech>

Materialise they did, however.  With the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, every person in this country had to deal with the fear of the unknown virus, its effects, how transmissible it would be, how each of us could avoid contracting it, while also ensuring that our loved ones and those most vulnerable did not succumb to the disease.  Measures never before considered had to be taken and Sinn F&eacute;in was to the forefront in calling for the immediacy of the situation to be addressed through prompt, swift and concerted measures.</p>  <p>  These have been extraordinary times, and such extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.  Those measures included the restriction of our ability to go on with life as had been regarded as normal until then.  Our movements were restricted, the way we could socialise was restricted, the way we could interact with each other was restricted and our ability to avail of services was also curtailed.  Each and every one of those measures was to have an impact, and while the impacts, primary or secondary, were in some instances unavoidable, the existing legislation has given far too much discretion and emergency powers to the Minister for Health.  </p>  <p>  The extraordinary measures we have all been subject to for more than a year now can only work if those data which inform them and the reasons they are deemed necessary are fully transparent, properly analysed and openly debated.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in pushing this belief.  This was evident last October, when we tabled an amendment to limit the scope of the emergency legislation then being proposed.  We requested that the Government bring forward less discretionary legislation that could not avoid D&aacute;il scrutiny.  We continue to stand by that position, and that is why we are opposed to the continuing operation of emergency legislation with such broad discretionary powers that delegate what we believe should be Oireachtas responsibilities to the Minister for longer than is necessary.  </p>  <p>  When the Minister for Health and the Government were under great pressure to deal with what the pandemic brought to this country, we were there to give what support we could to measures informed by public health advice.  While we still do that, what we have also witnessed since is a Government which has been less than forthcoming in providing real clarity to members of the Opposition regarding changes to regulations.  This was unacceptable and to this day, I cannot accept that there was any valid reason for that level of secrecy to shut out representatives elected by the people.  This situation led to instances of total confusion concerning some of the measures introduced by the Government. </p>  <p>  The manner in which the hospitality sector was treated is one case in point.  Hotel, pub and restaurant workers across Tipperary contacted me regarding the inability of the Government to state when, or if, it would be possible for those establishments to reopen last year.  I have also had representations from people involved in the arts, dance and entertainment sector in Tipperary.  All they are seeking is clarity.  Families of children with special and complex needs were left to fend for themselves without the supports they need, childcare professionals were left with incomplete information and this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the complaints I have received. </p>  <p>  With these issues in mind, the Government must realise why I want continued engagement on emergency measures to take place in this House and not just at the Cabinet table.  The Government has proposed to extend these emergency powers until 9 November.  </p> <p>We do not believe that the long extension is warranted at this stage.  We are in a particular situation with the virus at the moment.  There are a number of variables, both positive and negative, of which account must be taken.  The vaccine roll-out is progressing.  The number of people who have been vaccinated is increasing all the time and society is reopening on a gradual basis.  It is our view, therefore, that it is not necessary to give the Minister full discretion until 9 November.  What is necessary is that provisions are made to deal with the emergence of new variants or other associated issues.</p> <p> That is why Sinn F&eacute;in is tabling a number of amendments seeking to limit the operation of the legislation to 9 July and ensure that restrictions will require the approval of the D&aacute;il going forward.  This approach would not remove restrictions.  Instead, it would ensure that new regulations are adequately scrutinised, debated and ultimately agreed by the D&aacute;il in the open.  Of course, provisions should remain for the Minister for Health to bring forward rational and reasonable measures which are appropriate and proportionate to the risk presented by the pandemic and in the event of a vaccine-resistant variant posing a serious threat to public health.  However, there is no excuse for avoiding further D&aacute;il scrutiny of measures which are likely to restrict personal freedoms.</p> <p> We have heard the term "draconian measures" quite often during the debate, both here and in the Seanad.  The vast majority of this people in this country have put every effort they can into abiding by those measures and protecting each other from the virus.  They deserve full transparency in how decisions are made in the event that further measures that will impact on their freedoms need to be considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-26a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="17:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600054#HHH00200"><p>It has been said by many in the House that the public and front-line care workers have done a huge amount of work to subdue case numbers.  It is not very long ago that the situation was different.  We all remember the dreadful figures and statistics.  We dreaded watching the news, particularly in December and January.  However, we have got the situation under control.  We also faced difficulties in this State and throughout the EU in the context of vaccine supplies.  A great deal of work has been done and a significant number of people have been vaccinated.  As a result, we are in a different place now.</p>  <p>  I concur with my party colleagues and a number of other Deputies spoke about the fact that we should really be seeking to review this legislation and these restrictions, possibly on a monthly basis.  I think that people would believe that to be a sensible course of action to take in this situation.</p>  <p>  I want to speak specifically about vaccinations.  There has been a huge ramping up in vaccinations throughout the State.  A major amount of work has been done.  We accept that that work has been done by the healthcare system and the HSE.  They have been put under brutal and unforgivable pressure due to the ransomware attack.  That is a piece of work that we need to deal with as a State.  Indeed, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications today, the members engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on the issue.  We also spoke to a number of cybersecurity experts.  Across the board, the State must ensure that a sufficient audit of all of our critical systems is carried out.  I am not saying that this kind of attack can be prevented.  However, from a best practice perspective, we must take action to avoid such attacks as much as possible into the future.  I wish to commend the public and front-line heatlhcare worker.  None of us would have anticipated that they would come through a pandemic and then have to deal with the actions of a criminal syndicate or conglomerate.</p>  <p>  On vaccines, we must consider that none of us is safe until all of us are safe.  We are aware of the issues in relation to variants.  That is why a number of restrictions were imposed and are still in place.  We must ensure that we do all that needs to be done with a view to ensuring that we have an exit from the pandemic on a global basis.</p>  <p>  There has been much conversation in respect of the trade related intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver.  We have also heard the alternative narrative.  I will be quite honest.  I am not overly concerned from an ideological perspective.  Obviously, my heart tells me that the TRIPS waiver is the way to do business.  It must be considered.  However, I have also heard that significant work has been done by pharmaceutical companies in engaging with one another and sharing skill sets and resources with a view to producing vaccines.  We must ensure that that work is done.  However, it must not be done at an unseemly cost that is to be borne by the developed world.  We must do all that we can.  Significant responsibility rests with the European Commission and others across the globe to ensure that it happens.  The western world, with most of the resources and the vaccines, has an absolute responsibility to deliver.  Indeed, if we do not deliver, we will be dealing with variants consistently and constantly.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise an issue in respect of vaccines more locally.  A number of people in the Louth area contacted me because they were worried about vaccines.  Generally, they were people in their early 60s who thought that they had been bypassed by the system.  They contacted me and told me that they were particularly worried that they would be overlooked and would not get the vaccination.  It is a good sign that people want to be given the vaccine and want a roadmap out of the situation in which we find ourselves.  In fairness, the HSE was forthcoming with information.  It stated that towards the end of this week, all of those aged between 60 and 69 within the Louth area will be vaccinated.  That is very welcome news.  Beyond that, it announced that those aged 50 to 59 would be vaccinated by early next week - hopefully by Tuesday or possibly Wednesday.  I know that there has been an extra supply of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine.  That is all very positive.</p>  <p>  I must put the following question to the Minister, however.  Have we ensured that we have all the capacity and resources that will be required for when we receive an even bigger delivery of vaccines into this State?  The numbers are increasing significantly.  There is talk of considerable amounts, like 400,000 doses and more, being delivered each week in June.  We must ensure, therefore, that, across the State, all the resources required in respect of vaccination staff, centres and supplies are in place.  Obviously, we must ensure that we get the right supplies to the right areas.  There are varying demographics, depending on the area of the State concerned.  As I said, it is vital that this work is done.  I would appreciate if the Minister could respond to me on that point.</p>  <p>  I am most content with the responses I have received from the HSE.  Most of those who were worried at the end of last week and the beginning of this week have received notification of a vaccine appointment.  Once again, that is work very well done by our healthcare workers.  It is all very positive.  I am just worried that we do not have the capacity that will be required when supplies increase.  We must ensure that that happens.  It is significant.  It will provide us with an opportunity in respect of taking the next steps.</p>  <p>  Beyond that, I wish to add my voice to what has been said earlier.  People need a greater level of clarity from the Government in respect of the roadmap towards reopening.  Obviously, like Deputy Tully, I represent a Border constituency.  There are issues around people accessing services in the North that still are not available in the South.  We are worried about people making potentially long-term choices that may impact upon businesses that have already been put under severe pressure during the pandemic.  We accept that we cannot open everything all at once.  It must be done safely and securely.  Precautions and health measures need to be considered.  However, we do need to provide people with timelines, as far as possible.  I am hoping that a greater level of detail will be provided on Friday.  That is before we get into the issue of anomalies.  I know that there are difficulties.  People are hearing talk of time limits being imposed when they thought that such issues had been tackled.  I refer, for example, to &euro;9 meals and such.  In the context of those anomalies that can really annoy people, if there are legitimate public health reasons for taking such measures, they must be explained.</p>  <p>  As I have stated, we are taking these steps in a different context.  We are doing taking them in the face of a huge vaccine roll-out that has been very successful and we need to ensure that we continue with it as much as possible.  None of us is calling for all restrictions to be lifted now.  We all know the damage that was done in December and January.</p> <p>We must do everything in stages and very carefully, but we are doing it in a completely different context.  Perhaps the Minister will provide some information on the capacity of the vaccine roll-out and any further information, if there is any, although I doubt that he will give us a sneak preview of what will happen on Friday.  However, we need that clarity, be it for individuals, gyms or sporting organisations.  In particular, there are issues with regard to hospitality.  Everybody accepts that it will not be exactly as people want, but clarity is required, particularly for those who will need to buy materials and goods to ensure they are ready to operate.</p> <p> There is a wider issue when we talk about signing up to the digital green certificate.  We are aware of the current difficulties with our IT systems so we must ensure we are doing all the work at this point to ensure we are ready to run when we need to run, and that we have the systems up and running.  I add my voice to the voices of previous speakers with regard to Professor Mark Ferguson's report on antigen testing.  Now is the time to introduce any pilot schemes that need to be carried out to see whether this can be operated to allow certain types of openings or in respect of helping aviation.  We must do the heavy lifting now.  The heavy lifting has been done to some degree already in the sense that we can get information from Britain, Spain, France or other states that have operated pilot schemes.  That is another job we need to do.  We must ensure that we do not leave it too late and that when we sign up to things such as the digital green certificate, we have the capacity to proceed when we decide to do so, and that there are no technical hitches.</p></speech>

I have often spoken in the House about Vera Twomey's situation during the Covid-19 crisis.  I often asked the Minister to liaise with her.  His staff have done so and they had a successful discussion.  I wish to put that on the record and to thank the Minister for it.  It is very important for Ms Twomey and for other people who are in that situation in respect of medicinal cannabis.  That is very much appreciated.</p>  <p>  I will oppose the extension of these severe restrictions.  I have received many emails and so much post that my postman is scratching the back of his head.  He does not know how many more letters I will get on this issue.  People are very upset and extremely worried about the restrictions.  Some of them were necessary, and I would not oppose commonsense restrictions at very serious times, but we want to see the light.  People can see the light in Northern Ireland and they would love to think that they could do the same here, but that is not happening.  People's businesses are suffering.  In Cork South-West, the constituency I represent, people's businesses have been severely affected.  Some people have not opened their business since the pandemic first struck in March and April 2020, such as public houses.  There was an announcement today of the new restrictions that will allow some of them to open, but most of them will not be able to open.  To hear of the PUP and other payments being dropped is putting severe pressure on their state of mind and mental health.  What has been forgotten in all the argument and the Covid-19 crisis is the mental health pressure put on people.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  The Rural Independent Group will put forward amendments providing for a sunset clause on 9 June, as well as other amendments.</p>  <p>  Light at the end of the tunnel is something many organisations, individuals, businesses and the country need - a clear guideline as to when things will reopen safely and properly.  There are many mixed messages and that is causing more confusion and fear.  That comes back to us, the politicians on the ground.  People are asking us what is happening, when their businesses can reopen and whether they will be compensated to try to continue the business after it has been closed.  We are unable to answer many of the questions.  People have been very careful.  Nobody wants to get this virus.  I saw that today in Cork.  I commend the fishermen of south-west Cork and the rest of the country who converged on the Port of Cork today in their hundreds.  They wore masks and tried to socially distance.  I commend all the fishermen, their wives and children who were there today on the safety with which they ran that protest.  The way it was carried out by the Irish South and West Fishermen's Organisation sent an incredibly strong message.  I am very disappointed that neither of our two senior Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Michael McGrath, nor the Taoiseach were able to present themselves to the fishermen.  However, that is another story.  The people of Castletownbere, Unionhall, Schull, Kinsale and Glandore were there in high numbers today, along with me, to support them.  I will continue to do that for as long as I am elected to the D&aacute;il.  It is time for a massive debate on fishing.</p>  <p>  However, today we are discussing the continuation of the restrictions.  I have been strongly opposed to many of the restrictions in the churches.  I attended church in Lowertown, Schull, last Saturday night.  I counted 49 people there, but that church could hold 300 people.  The nearest church in Goleen can hold more than 500, the church in Schull can perhaps hold 350 and the church in Ballydehob can hold over 400.  Then I go into a shop and I cannot understand for the life of me - I have no problems with the shops - how big shops in the cities, such as Tesco, can have hundreds of people shopping inside the same size buildings.  People are trying to do it safely, but no allowance is made for churches or for people holding funerals or weddings and the stress and upset that is causing, especially in the case of funerals.  People are not given time to respect their loved ones.  I urge the Minister to re-examine this.</p>  <p>  I also support the call made earlier by a previous speaker for us to return to Leinster House.  It is scandalous the amount of money that is being paid for us to stay in the Convention Centre Dublin each week, while the D&aacute;il building is sitting idle for many days.  The Seanad is only sitting for one day and a bit, and its Members do not want to upset themselves by coming down here.  We certainly must be brought back to the D&aacute;il in a safe manner.  We all have offices and all of us can adhere to laws, rules and regulations if that is required.  It would be a massive saving for the State and it must be considered.</p>  <p>  I am a little surprised, and I have heard it often recently, by the new tactic on the part of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party Deputies.  They go on television and radio to condemn every legislative measure that comes before the House and then they come in and vote for it the next day.  Everybody has to speak for himself or herself, but I heard Deputy McAuliffe of Fianna F&aacute;il completely opposing what is proposed in the Bill on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 when I was coming here today.  I am scratching the back of my head because he is with the Government.  Ultimately, he will still vote with the Government.  I do not understand.  Why are they talking out of two sides of the same mouth?  It cannot be allowed to continue.  The Minister needs to pull in his Deputies.  It is not just on this issue, but on many issues.  Senators and Deputies in my constituency in west Cork are condemning things.  Then they come here and vote for the same thing they are condemning.  I am a little surprised that those in the media give them the leverage to think they can spend as much time as they wish condemning Bills and motions they have brought in and fully supported in the House.</p></speech>
