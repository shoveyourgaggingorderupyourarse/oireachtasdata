The nurses' strike today is discommoding a far greater number of services than the last one.  Some 50,000 patients have had their elective procedures cancelled.  It is a cause for alarm that emergency departments will come and are coming under extreme pressure today.  We know of the comments from the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine.  The 50,000 patients, on top of those who were affected last week, amount to a lot of people across hospitals and community services across the country.  Respite care and rehabilitation services will also be severely affected as a result of today's action.  Disability services have also been brought within the scope of the strike.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, is escalating its overtime ban tomorrow and Thursday.  The ban will now operate for 24 hours and thereby include overnight rosters.  Therefore, mental health services will also be severely impacted on.</p>  <p>  The Government has known about this for a long time, but there has been an absence of substantive and meaningful engagement on its Government.  I put it to the Taoiseach that last night's initiative, the proposals that emanated from the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris, at the eleventh hour, has only served to compound the problem, make it worse and escalate it.  The proposals concern staff shortages, undergraduate education, future nursing needs and so on, but they were sent via a press release without any engagement with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, or the PNA.</p><p>The INMO's general secretary, Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, described it as "the most cynical move I have seen in a long time".  The unions have rejected it as Government spin and said it was massively disrespectful to the nurses and to patients.  The Taoiseach cannot solve industrial relations disputes with such cynical PR manoeuvres.  The approach that holds optics to be more important than substance will not cut it when it comes to an industrial dispute of this gravity and scale.  Meaningful steps are required to be taken.  Substance must replace spin in the resolution of this dispute.  Being seen to do something by rushing out a press release is not the approach.  Why not engage in mediation to create a meaningful process to set in train a process that would come within the aegis of the industrial relations machinery?  Why not deploy somebody of the calibre of Kieran Mulvey, for example, to engage with both sides to develop such a process that would bring the Government and the unions together under aegis of the industrial relations machinery to resolve this issue?  The resolution of this dispute will require creative approaches and solutions.  It has happened in the past in other similar disputes.  The Taoiseach has to engage substantively with the issue.  I ask him to take an initiative similar to that which I have just suggested.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500004#B00200"><p>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, we profoundly regret the disruption that has been caused to patients, users of our disability services and people with mental health problems who have been adversely affected by the strike action today and last week.  We will do all that we can once this dispute is resolved to catch up on the lost work that was done, as we did last year when a number of days' work was lost as a consequence of the storms.  I want to recognise that cover is still being provided in maternity hospitals, for palliative care, for most cancer care and in our emergency departments.  There has been considerable engagement in efforts to resolve this dispute before now.  For example, the whole issue of recruitment and retention was examined by an independent body, the Public Sector Pay Commission, which made recommendations for a &euro;20 million package of allowances and additional increments and career progression for nurses, at a cost of &euro;20 million a year.  That was rejected by the nursing unions, or at least by two of the three nursing unions.  There was an engagement at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  There was also an engagement at the Labour Court.  We are open to further engagement and will be happy to have it, either at the WRC or the Labour Court, should it decide to intervene.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the nurses' unions felt that the offer to engage in further talks at the WRC was discourteous as they heard it through a press release rather than through a letter or direct contact.  We will make sure that does not recur.  At the same time, though, we should not forget that tens of thousands of people found out through the media that their respite care was being cancelled this week and that their day care was being cancelled, too.</p></speech>

I do not want that to happen again.  I certainly would not like to see a repeat of 1999 when a strike went on for nine days.  I believe it can be resolved.  That requires engagement and the Government is open for engagement through the WRC.  However, it can only be resolved in a way that is affordable for taxpayers and fair to all public servants with whom we have a pay deal already.  We have to honour that deal.  We are not in a position to break it by doing a special deal with one group of staff and saying to the others that there is nothing for them.  That would not be right.  They are the parameters under which this can be resolved and I am sure that if all sides accept those parameters, we can resolve this dispute swiftly.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach mentioned that the Government will help patients catch up.  The only catching up that will be done will be done by nurses and doctors when this strike is over.  The Taoiseach and his colleagues will not have to play catch-up.  Did I hear the Taoiseach correctly when he said that he did not send any direct letter to the nursing unions in terms of last night's offer and that no direct contact was made?  The Taoiseach said he will make sure it will not happen again.  Is the Taoiseach serious?  This is a very grave dispute, and that is a pathetic response.  Has the Taoiseach reprimanded his Ministers?  What were they doing last night?  Was it just a cynical PR exercise?  It is not good enough to say that unions did not engage.  The unions have been engaged with the HSE about strike action for a long time.  It is appalling that the Taoiseach should come here today and effectively say that the Government engaged in optics over this issue last night and that it did not make any direct contact with the unions over the offer that was announced last night.  He clearly just wanted to be seen to be doing something.  It was all done for the optics.  That is appalling and a pathetic way to approach such a grave dispute.  The Taoiseach should read up on the issues and not remain in denial about the recruitment and retention crisis.  It is very real.  We are haemorrhaging so many graduates from our colleges to the UK and other countries.  I suggest that the Taoiseach should appoint someone of the calibre of Mr. Kieran Mulvey to engage in mediation and to create an environment in which both sides can get together.</p></speech>

The Government is also open to the possibility of a Labour Court intervention.  Of course we have had consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and others about the possibility of an intervention.  However, everyone feels that an intervention can only happen at the right time, when there is adequate space and adequate agreement so that we can proceed into a process.  As I have said before, the parameters that have to be agreed are twofold.  First, any agreement we reach has to be affordable for the taxpayer.  We are not in a position to engage in borrowing to fund pay increases, and it would not be responsible to do so, particularly at this time.  Second, any agreement we make, especially anything concerning pay, must be done under the existing Public Service Stability Agreement, with the involvement of ICTU.  It would not be fair to 300,000 other public servants, with whom we have a pay deal and who are not on strike, if we gave a special deal to one group and then say to others that we cannot do the same for them.  That would not be fair.</p></speech>

The failure of his Government to address the recruitment and retention crisis now gripping the health service and his inability to grasp this issue has led to a national crisis.  It is not good for taxpayers that nurses and midwives are on picket lines.  Has that occurred to the Taoiseach?  It is not good for citizens or anyone who relies on the services of the HSE, and it is certainly not good for the nurses and midwives themselves.  I spoke to many of them this morning at Holles Street and St. James's Hospital.  I was there to demonstrate solidarity, but more importantly to listen to what they have to say.  None of them wanted to be on the picket line.  They are very angry and upset, but they are very determined.  They want to be back at work and doing what they do best, which is caring for their patients.  We all agree that they are, after all, the backbone of the health service.  They work in very difficult and stressful circumstances and conditions.  The reality, no matter how the Taoiseach tries to spin it, is that their pay and working conditions have given rise to a recruitment and retention crisis within the system.</p>  <p>  I spoke to one midwife this morning who gave an example of just how broken the system is.  She works in Holles Street.  On one particular day she was the only midwife on a ward of 12 women.  There was a woman there who had just had a C-section who needed help.</p><p>The woman was in discomfort.  The midwife told the story that the woman would not press the bell or look for the midwife's attention because she could see just how stressed the midwife was and just how chaotic the scene was.  What kind of service is it when someone in need of assistance feels moved not to ask for help when lying in a hospital ward?  It is unacceptable.</p> <p> The Government's so-called approach to the unions was not only discourteous; it was also disrespectful, utterly inept and had all of the hallmarks of its mishandling of this scenario to date.  The Taoiseach has now conceded on the need for engagement and that is a start.  What he now needs to understand are the parameters of that engagement.  They must include no preconditions, direct engagement by the Taoiseach as Head of Government and direct engagement with the nurses, midwives and their unions.  Nothing short of this is going to work.  If the Taoiseach is interested in resolving this dispute in the public interest, he will engage directly and with no preconditions; he will step into the breach as Head of Government and respectfully listen to the proposals coming from the nurses and their representatives and weigh them up.  Then, if he is wise, he will act on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500006#D00200"><p>We have had a system for resolving industrial relations disputes for 20 or 30 years now, including the time of the last nursing strike that went on for nine days in 1999.  That is something I do not want to see repeated.  Under that system, we deal with these disputes through the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court as the final arbiter in such disputes.  That is the best way to manage industrial relations disputes.  It has worked for 20 or 30 years and I have no doubt that it will resolve this dispute also.  The Government and the various agencies of government are willing to engage through the WRC, as was offered yesterday, or the Labour Court, should it determine that an intervention is appropriate.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to recruitment and retention.  As I have said before, I acknowledge that this is a real issue.  It is a real issue in large parts of the public sector and the private sector as we approach full employment.  As the nursing unions have stated, when it comes to healthcare, we live in a very competitive environment where people with healthcare degrees can work in almost any part of the world.  Notwithstanding this, since we lifted the recruitment embargo four or five years ago, there are some 3,500 more nurses working in the health service.  That is a significant increase.  In the past year alone, excluding students, approximately 800 more nurses and midwives are working in the public service.  While there are plenty of people leaving, more are coming home or from other countries.  While there are plenty of people leaving the profession, there are more coming into it.  Our turnover rate of 5% is approximately one third of that in Australia, yet it is a struggle to recruit and retain.  Deputies will know that we pay more than Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and most of the United Kingdom, with the exception of London.  We pay more than most of Europe.  All of those places have recruitment and retention challenges.  Other places pay more.  Australia pays more, as does the United Arab Emirates.  Those areas and countries also struggle to recruit and need to recruit from all over the world.  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that an 8%, 9%, 10% or 12% pay rise will actually solve the recruitment and retention problem.  It has not solved the problem for Australia or the Middle East.</p></speech>

Nothing he has said has within it the seeds of resolving the dispute.  What can resolve it, as we have said to the Taoiseach consistently, is positive respectful direct engagement.  That means engagement with no threats or sabre rattling on pensions or pay, engagement with no preconditions, engagement not to carve up a special deal but such that nurses and their representative bodies will believe the dispute can be resolved within the strictures of the current public pay agreement.</p><p>I have said this to the Taoiseach several times in the D&aacute;il.  The nursing unions have said this to him publicly.  I have no doubt that anyone with an ounce of wit would give the Taoiseach the same advice privately, yet he was unwilling, as Head of Government, to make the very necessary move.  We are two days down and seven days of further action are planned.  If this strike continues, the fault lies with the Taoiseach.  The blame lies with his spectacular inertia and refusal to act.</p></speech>

We are willing to engage in talks in the Workplace Relations Commission.  We are willing to accept an intervention by the Labour Court if it determines that is advisable.  It can be resolved but it must be resolved within certain parameters which all sides should be able to accept.  First, it has to be affordable for the Exchequer.  We cannot fund pay increases with borrowed money, particularly given the uncertainty ahead.  Second, it must be fair to all other public servants, the 300,000 public servants who work very hard, with whom we have a deal and who are not on strike.  Any pay issues must be paid under the umbrella of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Public Service Stability Agreement.</p></speech>

Every major project was checked and scrutinised to control costs and deliver value for the people's money.  This Fine Gael Government seems to have adopted a Celtic Tiger attitude towards overspending.  Just ten months after telling us that the cost of the national children's hospital on the St. James's site was to be &euro;938 million, Fine Gael is now telling us that the final cost could be &euro;1.73 billion or more, nearly double the previous cost.  As the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has said, we are at the point of no return.  There is a vast crater in St. James's, and having dug themselves into this hole, the Government seems to have no choice but to keep digging to try to find a way out.</p><p>However, the Government's story does not stand up.  We have been told that the civil servant appointed to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was there in a personal capacity.  That is not true.  The Department of Finance Circular 12/2010 sets out in detail that civil servants appointed to non-commercial boards must inform if a matter of serious concern arises.  It is a requirement for civil servants on boards to ensure that their concerns are first raised at the board, noted in the minutes and actions agreed.  The circular is crystal clear:</p><blockquote>The Minister must be notified without delay where: (i) There are serious weakness in controls that have not been addressed despite being drawn to the attention of the board or the Chairman;<br /><br />(ii) There is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the body that is not being addressed.</blockquote><p>A Government circular overrides any confidentiality imposed by a board itself.  How is it possible that this did not occur in one of the State's largest developments?How is it plausible that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was unaware of cost overruns until November last, as he has asserted?  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has said that he was aware of some of the costs as early as last August.  Did it really take another three months for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to be informed?  Either he did not know what was going on and did nothing or else he did not know what was going on until November.  It is unimaginable that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was kept in complete ignorance of public expenditure.</p><p>Surely as the Minister overseeing public spending, he would have received monthly, if not weekly, updates on the progress of a project of this scale and significance.  Why apparently did it take three months for the Minister for Health to inform the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about major cost overruns in the flagship programme of the Department of Health?  How did the Government present a budget to this House at the end of last year that is already &euro;100 million short in its capital programme?</p></speech>

As somebody who sat on the Committee of Public Accounts Thursday last and listened to a complete litany of failure of governance, I find the Taoiseach's response intolerable but it is no doubt something we will return to later.</p>  <p>  We should not need the nurses to take to the streets on strike, for only the second time in 100 years, to tell us that the health system is not safe.  Prior to this strike action, which is being taken as a last resort, the nurses have repeatedly informed this Government and successive Governments, and the Minister for Health and his predecessors, including the Taoiseach, how precarious the situation was and remains given the absence of front-line staff.  In August last, for example, the INMO figures showed that that month was the worst on record for overcrowding in hospitals across the country.  Of course, we know the detrimental effects of this overcrowding.  Dr. Fergal Hickey repeatedly tells us that, in any given year, 300 to 350 premature deaths are directly related to the time spent on a trolley.  In response to these figures, the nurses took what action they could, stopping short of strike action at that point.  They went out and protested.  They were forced into this strike action.  I give that background.  Tomorrow, the GPs are going out on strike, telling us that their system is not working either.</p>  <p>  My question is in the context of that background in Galway city where, in 2017, two theatres closed in Merlin Park.  There was a high-level meeting in October following which we were told that serious action would be taken and modular theatres would be put in place.  It is interesting that the two theatres were put out of action by rain.  All the while, the Government is putting money into a rainy day fund, not for the health system, not for education or housing, but to bail out a financial crisis in the future.</p>  <p>  Two theatres closed because of rain.  I have a list here that I have not the time to go into.  This is where trust and confidence comes into the system, as is the case with the children's hospital.  Throughout 2018, other Deputies and I have repeatedly highlighted this.  I was told in responses to questions that tender documents had gone out.  I was told that contracts were to be signed.  Here we are, in 2019, and the two theatres are still closed.  The latest chapter in this saga is that a consultant has written to all Deputies in Galway in an unprecedented move on behalf of all his colleagues to tell us that the situation is exactly the same as it was in 2017.  What has happened?  When will the theatres be opened?</p><p>Almost one year ago the Taoiseach told me that he could not take a hands-on approach and that the people in charge were the Minister for Health and hospital management.  One year later, there has been no progress whatsoever.  It goes to the heart of the difficulty the Opposition has with the Taoiseach and his Government.  There has been absolute spin and lack of trust in the answers.  I want a clear answer today.  What inquiries have been made by the Taoiseach or the Minister regarding the two theatres and when will they open?</p></speech>

The review will also be asked to identify any areas where potential cost savings or reductions, which are consistent with the applicable contractual undertakings, may be found.</p>  <p>  Merlin Park University Hospital, MPUH, provides elective medical and surgical services, renal services and a haemodialysis unit, and two designated rehabilitation units, along with a number of number of specialist outpatient clinics.  In September 2017, leaks developed in the roof of the building in the hospital that houses the two orthopaedic theatres.  Managers temporarily suspended operations for one week to facilitate repairs.  Following the deferral of elective orthopaedic procedures in 2017, the hospital facilitated the transfer of elective sessions to University Hospital Galway on a limited basis with the support of Merlin Park staff and eight orthopaedic elective beds.  In addition, some minor procedures were undertaken in hospital one in Merlin Park and-----</p></speech>

In March 2018, remedial work facilitated the opening of one theatre in MPUH, which advised that it is working towards restoring the full elective orthopaedic service as quickly as possible.  A tender process was recently undertaken regarding the provision of two modular theatres for orthopaedics on the MPUH site.  A successful vendor was selected for the project and an enabling contract has been signed between the HSE and the modular provider.  Contracts have been exchanged between both parties and are currently with the HSE national estates division.  A planning application was submitted on 20 December 2018, and subject to a successful determination of that planning application, which I understand is outstanding, it is intended that the work will proceed as planned.</p></speech>

I have all of the documentation here.  I have raised this issue repeatedly.  The Taoiseach is telling me that contracted documents have been exchanged.  During last year, I was told twice that they had been exchanged.  We are now in receipt of a letter from the consultant orthopaedic surgeon telling us that 1,500 patients are waiting for complex joint replacements, spinal surgery, and foot, ankle and shoulder surgery, while the waiting list continues to expand exponentially.  That is the situation; chronic and acute pain is being suffered by these patients, yet the Taoiseach stands there telling me that contract documents are going to be exchanged.  At the very least I would have expected him to tell me what happened that they were not exchanged last February, which is when we were told they were being exchanged, and at the very least to learn from the children's hospital project and to give us the information having made the inquiries.  Last year, the Taoiseach told me that he was not aware of the question and that I had not notified him.  I notified him of today's question so that he would not come to the Chamber unprepared and he would have checked the situation.  This is unacceptable in a city where the main hospital is creaking at the seams on a congested site, but with a 150-acre site available in Merlin Park.  We are going piecemeal and piecemeal, and we cannot even provide modular theatres, which are not the answer.  The answer is a new hospital.  In the meantime, we would like a little bit of honesty about modular theatres.</p></speech>

An awful lot of people are  waiting a very long time for orthopaedic operations and procedures, and, often, to see a specialist in the first place.  It is important to acknowledge that the number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for operations and procedures, which is the Sl&aacute;intecare target, is now at a four or five-year low.  This includes hips and knees and other orthopaedic operations, so we are making a lot of progress in that area-----</p></speech>

We need a full debate precisely because of what the nurses are saying that nobody is actually talking about the issues that have led them out on strike.

Many significant issues arise from the advent of technology.  A Cybersafe Ireland survey published today presents worrying and interesting statistics that simply cannot be ignored by policymakers and Government.  It confirms that four out of five children own a smartphone and almost half of these children are in contact with adults they do not know and are playing games with people aged more than 18 years.  The games contain sex and violence.  A recent report by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, indicated that nine year olds who own a smartphone are potentially weaker at reading than their peers who do not.</p>  <p>  The Irish Primary Principals Network called last month for a national policy on smartphone ownership for schoolgoing children.  A White Paper on this issue will be published next month in the United Kingdom and there is already a commitment there to introduce a planned compulsory code of conduct.  There are issues there.  Will the Taoiseach outline the plans under the programme for Government for providing a digital commissioner?  Does the Government plan to introduce a code of conduct here to protect children as much as possible?</p></speech>

It was agreed there that I would seek legal advice on the definition of "harmful material" because there is a category the committee wants to identify, harmful but not unlawful.  There is no definition in the existing Bill and there are variants on this.  The challenge for us is to find a robust set of definitions of what is harmful for the purpose of setting up the code and an enforcement method for take down.  I am working with the Attorney General to develop proposals in that area to bring back to the committee.</p></speech>

On Monday, Amigo Loans &ndash; I kid you not &ndash; Amigo Loans, which I raised before with the Taoiseach, started lending here.  It is licensed by the Central Bank to charge interest rates of up to 49.9%.  It specifically targets people who have a poor credit history.  It is daylight robbery and highlights once more the urgent need to cap interest rates as part of wide-ranging reform of the regulation of moneylenders.</p><p>In December an Teachta Pearse Doherty introduced the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018 which would place a cap on the rates moneylenders could charge.  The Government opposed the Bill, which was disgraceful, despite the Taoiseach's assurance that he would examine any legislation brought forward.  The Bill passed Second Stage regardless.  Will the Taoiseach now accept that legislation is badly needed?  Will he move to get it on the Statute Book as soon as possible?</p></speech>

That is a very high interest rate, but it seems to be Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal.  The difficulty we have in setting any maximum interest rate, whether it be 36% or another figure, lies in the risk that doing so would drive people towards moneylenders.  We need to bear in mind that if people cannot access credit on the market, it is very likely they will find other moneylenders who will provide it illegally.</p></speech>

The main role of the Department is to assist the Taoiseach and the Government in developing a sustainable economy and successful society, pursue Ireland&rsquo;s interests abroad, implement the Government&rsquo;s programme and build a better future for all citizens.  </p>  <p>  The strategy statement is aligned with the Government's main priorities and policies and sets out the following six strategic priorities: providing excellent support services for the Taoiseach and the Government; ensuring Ireland has a sustainable economy; helping to ensure Government policies and services support a socially inclusive and fair society; ensuring Ireland maintains strong relationships in Europe and the world; ensuring the best possible outcomes for Ireland with regard to Brexit across all four priorities identified by the Government; and planning for the future in the context of all of the many uncertainties in the international environment.</p>  <p>  Priorities in the immediate period ahead which my Department will assist in progressing, together with other relevant Departments, include the Brexit negotiations and no-deal preparedness; ongoing reform of the justice sector, particularly in the area of policing reform; issues relating to health policy, particularly the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare; continuing to build economic resilience, including through the Future Jobs Ireland framework; tackling climate change; housing and homelessness; pensions reform; Northern Ireland; and doubling Ireland's global footprint.  Through these reforms and improvements, we will protect our growing economy and ensure Ireland is more equal society, which will create opportunities for all people to participate and share in its prosperity.</p></reply>

His analysis at the beginning was right.  It is correct to front-load the issue of the unique situation on the Border in Ireland and have it agreed to in advance of future trade talks.  One of the proposals which seems to be gaining traction in the United Kingdom Parliament involves the notion that the Article 50 implementation date could be extended and that the United Kingdom could move directly into trade talks, which would fundamentally alter the strategic approach of the European Union which has been to have the question of the Irish Border settled in advance of detailed discussions on long-term trade arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Will the Taoiseach give us his take on, and his understanding of, the views of the EU 27 on this matter?  In his view, what are the circumstances in which there would be agreement to extend the implementation date for Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty?  Is he of a similar mind in believing issues regarding the arrangements on the island of Ireland and the only external border between the United Kingdom and the European Union should be wound into the long-term trade talks with the United Kingdom?</p></speech>

The absence of such a scheme is delaying the delivery of affordable homes.  Following our brief exchange on the matter, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government heard from the ESRI, the Housing Agency and the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance on the issue.  The CEO of the Housing Agency, Mr. John O'Connor, said Government policy should strike a balance between the delivery of affordable homes for sale and rent and that the focus on home ownership must be tempered by the roll-out of affordable cost rental housing.  The CEO of the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, Mr. Hugh Brennan, stated his housing association had the capacity to deliver many more affordable homes for purchase and that it was actively looking at sites on which it could deliver such housing.  It is vital and ought to be a priority for the Taoiseach and the Government that the heel-dragging in the publication of an affordable housing scheme be stopped.  The Government should move on the issue.  It is badly needed because affordable homes are badly needed.  Will the Taoiseach clarify exactly when the scheme will be published?</p></speech>

Irrespective of the form Brexit will take, we will need a new approach to relations with Britain.  We also need a new approach to North-South relations.  Given the problems even before June 2016, does the Taoiseach agree that we have to take a serious look at how the Government operates with respect to North-South and east-west relations?  With the rapid decline in the level and quality of political leadership in these areas, does he accept that we need to ask whether we are approaching them in the right way?  This must surely have implications for how the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach operate.  A core function of the Department of the Taoiseach is to operate a system of Cabinet committees.  The committees are supposed to involve much greater levels of preparation and longer discussions than are possible at a full Cabinet meeting.  The committee dealing with European affairs used to meet regularly.  The meetings involved detailed cross-government discussion of measures before the European Council.  Last week it was revealed that the committee on Brexit and Europe had not met for seven months.  That means that there have been no meetings with senior officials, no advance circulation of detailed documents and no separate minutes.  The Taoiseach's claim that he prefers to discuss things at full Cabinet meetings suggests he prefers general discussions to getting into the level of detail which used to be involved in Cabinet sub-committee meetings.  </p>  <p>  Equally, it appears that the Cabinet committees on health and infrastructure have been sidelined on the vital issue of the massive overspend on the national children's hospital, which is quite extraordinary.  It is an unfolding saga.  The replies to Deputy Howlin's questions beggared belief and lacked credibility.  The overspend on the project will have implications for other capital projects across the board, not just this year but also in future years.  Will the Taoiseach outline how the background work which used to happen through the Cabinet committees is now done?

The infrastructure subcommittee met last week, for example.  The way preparation is done is that memos are prepared in the normal way, advisers meet at an advisory meeting and senior officials meet at the senior officials group, SOG, to prepare it.  There is a senior officials group dealing specifically with Brexit but when the matters come to politicians they are dealt with by the whole of Cabinet, pretty much every week at this stage.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee attends on occasion when relevant.  For example, there were two memos today at Cabinet on Brexit alone.  One was dealing with tax, getting into more detail on the legislative provisions on tax that will have to be in the Brexit omnibus Bill.  They particularly relate to corporation tax and VAT and how we can maintain the existing arrangements for a period in the event of a no-deal Brexit, until that gets clarified.  There was some time spent on that.  A little bit more time was spent today on the transport memo on Brexit, which related to the ports and airports, confirming that we will not need planning permission to make any of the necessary changes at Dublin Airport.  It is already covered under exempted development.  When it comes to Dublin Port and Rosslare, where we now control the land we need at those two ports, there are different scenarios for no-deal and in the event of a deal.  In a no-deal scenario we will be able to use emergency legislation and emergency powers that the Minister for Finance has to direct the OPW to carry out certain works.  That will be in the form of parking spaces for trucks and temporary buildings and portakabins to house officials.  That will be the no-deal scenario.  Obviously if we have a deal, we will have more time to put in place more permanent structures.  That memo obviously was prepared in the normal way, seen by officials, put up on eCabinet and discussed by advisers.  It is the same process we would use for a Cabinet subcommittee except there are 20 in the room rather than 50 or 60.</p>  <p>  Tomorrow I will visit Brussels and we will meet with President Juncker, President Tusk, Mr. Michel Barnier, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, MEP, and Commissioner Hogan to discuss the ongoing impasse in respect of Brexit and also to have an opportunity to discuss no-deal planning.  People will be aware that there is a Commission delegation in Dublin at the moment discussing no-deal planning.  They are going to every country.  We are the ninth country they have been to so far.  That is their main reason for being here.  On Friday, I will travel to Northern Ireland where I will meet with the political parties there.  When we travel to Northern Ireland, we should always listen to all of the parties and not just to any one party.  Certainly I will be listening to the major parties and to the smaller ones if time allows as well.  I also plan to speak to business and civil society in respect of Brexit.  However, I will not be carrying out any negotiations with any political parties in Northern Ireland because, as Deputy McDonald rightly points out, the negotiations are between the EU and the UK.  While we can certainly have discussions with the UK and with political parties or individual politicians, the negotiations can only happen with the EU and Ireland on one side of the table and the UK on the other.  We are in a much stronger position in that regard and will not be departing from it.  It is not just our strategy; it is also in the EU negotiating guidelines.</p>  <p>  In respect of the various proposals that Deputy Howlin mentions, there are myriad proposals at this stage emanating from the House of Commons and it is hard to keep track of them all.  There are no clear proposals yet from the UK Government other than a certain level of revisiting things that have already been rejected by the European Union.  Specifically, Deputy Howlin asked about extending Article 50.  Obviously, for Article 50 to be extended, the United Kingdom would have to request that, which it has not yet done.  The Prime Minister has indicated that she does not intend to do so but, as we have said on a number of occasions now, if Article 50 were extended it would have to be extended for a particular purpose and that purpose would need to be agreed.  We should never forget that the threat of no deal on 29 March is not a threat that Ireland or the European Union is making.  The deadline of 29 March was set by Britain in Britain and it is open to them at any time to take away that no-deal possibility either by revoking Article 50 or by seeking an extension to Article 50, either of which they can do.</p>  <p>  On affordable housing, Deputy English informs me that local authorities have already submitted seven or eight schemes for the construction of affordable housing.  Councils can now proceed with those schemes so houses are built and ready so that people can purchase them under the new scheme.  Cost rental is under way in Emmet Road.  That is the pilot project, as it were, for cost rental in Dublin city.  There is another project as well, I cannot remember exactly where, I think it is south Dublin somewhere in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The scheme is going to be one of shared equity similar to what was there before.  It will be published in a few weeks' time but there is already wide-scale awareness of how it will work.  It will work on a shared equity basis with the council retaining equity in the home which people can then redeem at a later point.  The affordable homes obviously have to be built before they can be purchased and there is no delay in allowing local authorities to proceed to build those houses.</p></speech>

This includes those working directly for me in my office, those working in the Government information service, staff working for the Independent Alliance and Independent Ministers, staff in the office of the Government Chief Whip and staff in the office of the Leader of the Seanad.  The ten staff working directly with me are my chief of staff, head of policy and programme implementation, five special advisers and three personal assistants.  In addition, the Government press secretary acts as a spokesperson for me and for the Government and is assisted by an assistant Government press secretary in co-ordinating the media relations of all Government Departments.  The deputy Government press secretary is also based in my Department and co-ordinates communications for all the Independents in government.  Also employed by my Department are the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for the Independent Ministers in government.</p>  <p>  In the office of the Government Chief Whip, which is also based in my Department, there are two special advisers and two civilian drivers.  My Department also employs two civilian drivers who are based in the office of the Leader of the Seanad in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Special advisers working with the Ministers of State, Deputies McEntee and Kehoe, are employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence respectively.</p></reply>

Has the Taoiseach given instructions to Ministers to hire journalists as political advisers?  There have been some raised eyebrows at the number of journalists who have now been hired to work for Ministers.  Is it something the Taoiseach recommends?  He has eight special advisers including the Government press secretary, plus a further two for the Independent Alliance and the deputy press secretary.  Is that right?  A large number of junior Ministers now also have special advisers.  I recall in the previous Government, of which the Taoiseach and I were both members, that only two junior Ministers who did not attend Cabinet had special advisers.  One was the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs and the other was a Minister of State in the Department of Health.  Now I understand the figure is up to five, with the latest ones to have special advisers being the Ministers of State, Deputies Halligan, McEntee, Jim Daly, Moran, and D'Arcy.  Can the Taoiseach confirm if Deputies Canney and Doyle have been granted special advisers?  What are the criteria to determine who gets a special adviser in the junior ministerial ranks?  What is the total cost of the political staff in the Department of the Taoiseach?  Based on a rough calculation it is at least &euro;1.5 million.  Am I in the ballpark with that?  Can the Taoiseach confirm the figure?</p></speech>

He makes sure that he always has at hand a political attack for when he is under pressure.  Equally, his political advisers are expected to be very active in looking for marketing opportunities.  What is incredibly surprising is that in spite of the sheer number of times he talked about the children's hospital in the first half of last year - he talked quite a lot about it, including using public money on social media promotion of his good self - for some reason it basically disappeared from his speeches as the year went on.  In his Ard-Fheis speech on 17 November he did not mention it or the health capital programme at all.  At the start of last August, the Government reappointed the entire board of the National Children's Hospital.  A few weeks later, information emerged about the significant scale of overspend and apparently this was accepted by the Government without any review and without calling for any heads to roll.</p><p>It was only when the overspend became public that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, began to say they were very concerned and that it was wrong.  They then made calls for the PricewaterhouseCoopers review.  One has to ask, given the extent of the political operation at the heart of government, whether the Taoiseach is surprised that the issue did not surface earlier.  Would it have been identified if the Cabinet committees had met more regularly?  Should the Cabinet committees on infrastructure and health have been receiving regular updates on the costings of such a major component of the national development plan as the national children's hospital?  Was it buried because the Taoiseach was planning a general election?  I listened to the answers he gave to Deputy Howlin.  He said the Minister of Health had become aware of the overspends in August.  I assume the Taoiseach is saying the Minister did the right thing by waiting until-----</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Harris, did not ask further questions between then and November.  That does not add up and it is not credible, particularly given the major issue of the overspend in the health service of some &euro;800 million.  While we were discussing it, the Minister and many others were aware of a massive overspend on a capital investment infrastructure site but did not mention it to anybody.  It is only because the news got out that the Government is racing to try to patch up and cover its tracks by announcing the PwC review.  The chairman of the hospital board has also resigned.  There was none of this between August and November.  The Government must give a meaningful and credible explanation as to why the Minister did not alert his Cabinet colleagues to the overspend of which he was aware in August.  We are talking about a massive overspend.  Furthermore, in September Deputy Cowen was told that the price might rise to &euro;1 billion.  I heard the Minister speak about this on the Sean O'Rourke radio show yesterday and was not happy with his response.  He seemed to suggest commercial sensitivities took precedent over telling the truth to the House.</p></speech>

On occasion, they will ask my opinion if they are going to hire someone.  They do not always do it, but they usually do.  It is true that a number of journalists have been hired by Ministers as their advisers.  One of my advisers is a former journalist.  It is particularly useful, if one is going to be a press adviser or work in a press role, that one have experience as a journalist.  I am surprised at the number of press officers and press advisers who have never actually worked as a journalist.</p></speech>

One only gets to that figure by including the &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million a Fianna F&aacute;il Government spent on the Mater hospital site on a hospital that was never built.

It will be all citizens because some citizens do not have a passport or cannot afford one or perhaps cannot travel.  We have taken the decision that this referendum could be contentious.  It will involve a good deal of planning, it needs a good campaign and we want to win it.  Given the uncertainty around Brexit at the moment and the fact that we have local and European elections and other referenda on 24 May, we want to have it in October instead to give us more time to prepare the ground and inform people.  This will give us a better chance, I believe, of getting it passed.  Of course the next presidential election is not scheduled until 2025, so we have a good deal of time yet to get it done.

The total salary cost is &euro;1.16 million and the average salary is a little under &euro;50,000.</p>  <p>  I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 14, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  I attended the 2019 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos from 23 to 25 January.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, also attended.  This annual event in Davos provides a unique opportunity to network informally with political leaders and senior decision-makers from civil society and the corporate world.  I had extensive opportunities, formal and informal, to convey important messages about the strength of Ireland's economy, our perspectives on Brexit and on the future of Europe, our ambition to expand the scope and impact of Ireland's international presence as well as our approach to international challenges like climate action, sustainable development, migration, international trade and taxation.</p>  <p>  I had numerous formal engagements.  I did several media interviews with Irish and international media, including Euronews, Reuters and Bloomberg.  I attended an event hosted by the Gates Foundation, which focused on international development issues.  I had the opportunity there to discuss Ireland's approach to international development with Bill Gates and others in attendance and to inform them of the Government's increase in its overseas development aid budget for 2019 as well as our plans to focus on the education of girls, nutrition and some other matters.  I participated in a plenary panel discussion on the future of Europe alongside the Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mr. Rutte, Poland's Prime Minister, Mr. Morawiecki, Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m and Ana Botin of Santander Group.  I participated in a young leaders session, where I discussed Ireland's perspectives on current European challenges.  I attended a lunchtime event with political, academic and business leaders where the challenges and opportunities of globalisation were discussed.</p>  <p>  I also had the opportunity to speak bilaterally with a number of my European Council colleagues, including Chancellor Kurz of Austria, the Croatian Prime Minister, Andrej Plenković, the Prime Minister of Poland, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Xavier Bettel, and the Prime Minister of Belgium, Mr. Charles Michel.  We discussed Brexit and other EU issues, including the multi-annual financial framework.  I also had meetings with UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Philip Hammond, briefly, with the UK Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, with the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol.  I did not meet any Chinese politicians or representatives of Chinese companies.</p>  <p>  I had meetings with senior executives from US multinationals with operations in Ireland, including Tim Cook of Apple, Andy Jassy of Amazon, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, as well as Nick Clegg, and Mike Nally of MSD.  My discussions focused on Ireland's perspectives on Brexit, trade and international taxation.  The companies updated me on their operations in Ireland and their plans for future expansion.</p>  <p>  I also spoke at the annual IDA Ireland Davos dinner event, which was attended by 50 senior executives of existing and prospective IDA Ireland client companies.  I emphasised the strengths that underpin Ireland's success in attracting foreign direct investment.  This is now a well-established feature of the annual Davos programme and an important element of IDA Ireland's client engagement strategy.</p></speech>

Despite this, in Davos, the Taoiseach not only said this but also went far further and started talking about the Army being sent to the Border and soldiers being at the Border.  We have no need for another around-the-houses self-justification for what was a clearly and deliberately chosen set of words.  I asked this last week.  I am seeking some basic clarity.</p>  <p>  Brexit is due to happen in 52 days unless the UK Parliament and the European Union adopt another legal mechanism to go into a transition period or delay Brexit.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly said that the absence of a transitional period and something like the permanent backstop would inevitably lead to cross-Border disruption.  No one is threatening Ireland with this.  This has been our Government's position from day one and it was on this basis that the Taoiseach asked the European Union to adopt a particular strategy.  This being so, it is well past time for a direct answer to the question.  What will happen at the Border in 52 days if there is no deal?  I asked the question last week and the week before and I received no answer.  I suggest every community and business in the Border area deserves clarity on this.  They need to know what they will be facing in 52 days if there is a no-deal scenario.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach held bilateral meetings with several EU Heads of Government.  Discordant words were uttered by the Polish foreign minister.  The Taoiseach tells us he held a bilateral meeting with the Polish Prime Minister.  Did he share the views of his foreign minister?  What was the nature of the discussions the Taoiseach had with him?  In the other discussions with other EU Heads of Government, was there complete solidarity with the united EU 27 position to date?  Did anyone share the concerns expressed by the Polish foreign minister publicly?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach made comments about Ireland closing tax loopholes.  Does the Taoiseach accept that Ireland is still perceived by many as a place where corporate tax is not fairly levied?  What was the nature of the Taoiseach's discussions on this?  Was he able to reassure people that the closure of loopholes that existed in the past has changed fundamentally the tax structure in Ireland?</p>  <p>  My last question relates to the entire experience and presence in Davos.  Several leading politicians stayed away from Davos this year.  What was the total cost of the Irish presence in Davos this year?</p></speech>

We famously remember how the Army was going to be guarding the ATMs such was the severity of the economic crisis.  The Taoiseach decided to emulate the rather bizarre comments of the former Taoiseach with the claims that we would have the Army deployed on the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  This is despite the fact that the Taoiseach comes into the House and repeats the same answer week after week when we ask him whether he is considering erecting a border to protect the EU Single Market in the event of a no-deal scenario.  The Taoiseach says "No" and claims it is not even being considered or dreamt of.  Then, the Taoiseach goes on international television at the Davos gathering and says that he is thinking of sending the Army up to the Border.  It is bizarre.</p><p>Could the Taoiseach please explain that?  Could he also explain the remarkable comment that we are "forever closing tax loopholes" when he was challenged about Ireland's tax haven status?  </p> <p> Can we just deal with facts instead of spin?  According to the last available figures, &euro;144 billion in pre-tax profits are declared in this country.  By the time the taxable profit is calculated it is half that at approximately &euro;70 billion.  There are, therefore, approximately &euro;70 billion worth of loopholes in the tax code.  There are research and development tax credits, inter-group transactions, group losses, and losses brought forward.  If one goes through the list, there are myriad tax loopholes, which allow the largest corporations in the world to write down their tax liability to almost nothing.  Everyone else in the world knows this and is saying it, yet the Taoiseach continues to claim it is untrue.  Precisely what tax loopholes has the Taoiseach closed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500021#T00200"><p>The British Prime Minister is in Belfast today.  The word is that she is still in the grip of delusion.  She is now saying that there will be no backstop but the Good Friday Agreement is entirely safe, and there will be no backstop but there will be no hard border.  It is reminiscent of the earlier position to which she has returned, namely one of, "Don't worry Ireland, we will look after everything but we are out of the Single Market and out of the Customs Union."  In over two years we have moved precisely nowhere with this Prime Minister or the government that she leads.</p>  <p>  Our job is not to help Mrs. May from her deluded state; she will wallow in that if she wishes.  Our collective job is to protect Irish interests.  That means holding firm on the backstop, not blinking and not budging.  The fact is that without an agreement or a backstop we will have a hard border unless there is an intervention and a contingency plan.  That raises the possibility of soldiers, not necessarily Irish but British, at such an infrastructure.  These are real possibilities.  However, it is not the Taoiseach's job to conjure up the worst-case scenario and leave it hang; it is his job to deal with the realities and facts and offer a plan for the Irish national interest, for the Irish State and to protect the peace agreements and to protect our economy, and I could go on.</p>  <p>  I have asked the Taoiseach consistently to identify for us the ultimate contingency in the event of no agreement, no backstop and the terrible vista which he has conjured into view.  The obvious answer is to reach for the Good Friday Agreement, the very agreement that everyone has vowed to protect, and to look to the provisions within it to address the issue of the Border.  If politics, the Tories or the negotiating process cannot mitigate or deal with the Border, it should be placed in the hands of the people through a democratic process to decide on the Border and to have the opportunity to remove it, which is the ultimate contingency plan, yet the Taoiseach has ducked and dived on this issue.</p>  <p>  I believe the Taoiseach has a responsibility as Head of Government to begin planning for that ultimate contingency.  We have said that he should convene a forum.  He should do that.  The Government must lead the conversation around Ireland post-Brexit and particularly Ireland post-crash Brexit.  There will be no hard border on this island.  It is not happening. </p></speech>

I have always argued this should not be done through the EU but should wait for the OECD.  There were attacks by the Polish Prime Minister and Spanish bankers but also comments by the head of the OECD which singled out the sweetheart deal which Ireland applied in the Apple tax case.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that this is a signal, as mentioned in today's newspapers, that we are facing a different corporate tax regime, where the OECD itself and possibly America look to new tax laws where the profits would accrue at point of sale rather than in the home city of the multinational, in this case Dublin?  Was there a shift this year in what the OECD said at Davos regarding corporate tax?  Have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, discussed the matter arising from what they heard there?</p></speech>

There was a delegation of five.  Accommodation costs were approximately &euro;7,000.  The Government jet was used so the only added cost was fuel and car transport from Zurich to Davos.</p>  <p>  I like broadcast media because anyone interested can get to hear the question and answer in full and, therefore, know the context.  In Davos, I was asked by an international journalist from Bloomberg to paint a picture of what a hard border could look like in a worst-case scenario.  I am often accused of spin but I am more likely to give a straight answer to a straight question, which is exactly what I did.  I painted a picture of what a hard border might look like in a worst-case scenario.  I painted a picture of what hard borders look like all over the world and what the hard border used to look like when we had one in Ireland 30 years ago, although I may have incorrectly said 20 years.</p></speech>

Ireland and Poland are much closer on Brexit than some people may believe.  Poland is very close to the UK and they have a very strong security relationship through NATO.  There are also many Polish citizens living in the UK.  Like us, they want the new relationship between the UK and the EU to be as close as possible after Brexit.  Their efforts to be helpful to the UK come from that desire rather than any lack of solidarity with Ireland.</p>  <p>  We have complete solidarity from all the other Prime Ministers whom I had the opportunity to meet in Davos.  There is a growing concern about what will happen at the end of March and a growing desire to find solutions because no one wants to be the situation whereby Europe fails to find a solution to this at the end of March and into the period thereafter.  </p>  <p>  International corporate tax law is a matter that arises at many international meetings.  It featured less at Davos this year than last year, probably because we are participating in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  The OECD does not designate Ireland as a tax haven.  We are not on the EU's grey list of tax havens and "everyone in the world", as Deputy Boyd Barrett put it, does not include the European Union or the OECD, which is the expert body in this matter.  </p><p>The Deputy's "everyone" does not include the two most relevant bodies in this regard, and it was probably less of a feature, in fact, this year precisely because we have collected the Apple tax claim in an escrow account and are now awaiting a judgment on that, we have abolished stateless corporations, we are phasing out the double Irish arrangement, and we are now one of the few countries that share revenue information with other revenue services so that we can compare how much tax different companies pay in different states.</p> <p> It is very much our view that profit taxes should be applied where the profits are created.  One applies a sales tax or VAT at the point of sale.  One applies a profit tax where the profits are generated, and that is one of our objections to the proposed digital tax.  Volkswagens are sold all over Europe, but the profit tax is paid in Germany.  It does not get divvied out across the European Union.  Airbuses are made in France and the profit is made in France, but they are sold all over the EU, and we do not get a cut of the profit taxes because Ryanair buys Airbus or because leasing companies buy Airbus.  The profits are paid where the company is based and generates those profits, not where the sales are made.</p></speech>

We were also told that while some of this was due to legacy administrative issues, some of it was because the doctors had not finished their consultant training.  This represents a serious patient safety issue.  Will the Minister issue an instruction to the HSE to the effect that any patient seeing a consultant who is not on the specialist register is informed of that and the reason for same?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500022#U00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  In March 2008, the HSE amended the qualifications specified for consultant posts to require membership of the specialist division of the register of medical practitioners.  The register is maintained by the Medical Council.  Notwithstanding that policy position, the HSE has been obliged in certain circumstances to appoint doctors who are not on the specialist division to consultant posts to ensure service delivery.  There are also limited circumstances where an experienced senior doctor not on the specialist register may cover for an absent consultant to ensure the provision of care.</p>  <p>  Importantly, any doctor who occupies a consultant post, even if he or she is not on the specialist register, would still hold a medical licence and be on a division of the Medical Council's register.  The doctor would, therefore, be fully qualified to practice medicine.  A total of 161 consultants have been identified working in the public health services who are not on the specialist register.  Nearly a third of these were appointed prior to the change in the HSE's requirements.</p>  <p>  The HSE has established a group to examine posts that are filled by doctors who are not on the specialist register as well as the issues of recruitment and retention challenges.  It is undertaking site visits and engaging with senior management at sites and with those not on the specialist division register who occupy consultant posts.  Its report and recommendations are to be finalised and will be provided to my Department next month.  Once received, officials in my Department will consider the HSE's findings and recommendations, in conjunction with legal advices on the matter.</p>  <p>  One of the areas for consideration may be, as suggested by the Deputy, mandating that patients be informed when their "treating consultant" is not on the specialist register.  However, this would have to be considered having regard to the legal position and the current guidance of the Medical Council on some of these matters.  Once I receive the report next month, I will be happy to brief the Deputy on its contents.  His suggestion on informing patients is an issue that will be considered at that point.</p></speech>

I am concerned by the lack of transparency for patients.  Last May, our committee was told that the number of doctors working in consultant posts but not on the specialist register was 149.  We were given assurances that the HSE would look into reducing that number.  However, I received information in recent days saying that the number had increased to 161.  Shockingly, my figures show that, in the midlands mental health service, 44% of doctors working in consultant posts are not on the specialist register.  In South Tipperary General Hospital, that figure is 31%.</p>  <p>  I am glad that a report is on the way to the Minister and I appreciate that some of the recommendations can wait for it, but does he agree that, regardless of what the report says, patients and their families have a right to know if the doctors they are seeing and who they have been told are consultants actually are consultants?</p></speech>

Given that it is imminent - it is due to be completed next month - I want to be guided by it.  The HSE is pursuing a range of initiatives to improve the recruitment process and support those who are not on the specialist register to pursue registration.  As the Deputy was good enough to acknowledge in his opening contribution, there may be people involved who are well entitled and have the qualifications to be on the register but have not applied to be so.  For example, those appointed properly prior to 2008 could be dealt with by deeming provision to be part of the definition of "consultant".  We can reduce the number and address some of these cases through that.</p>  <p>  I do not want to be lost in the debate the fact that, notwithstanding recruitment and retention challenges, the number of consultants working in the health service increased by 125 in the 12 months to the end of December 2018 and by 540 in the past five years.</p>  <p>  I am happy to revert to the Deputy when I receive the report.</p></speech>

First, it should be mandated that, if a patient is meeting a doctor whom he or she believes is a consultant and is in a consultant's post but who is not on the specialist register, he or she is told so and why.  Second, every patient who believes that he or she has been seen, assessed or treated by such a doctor should be informed that the person is not a consultant.  Third, I would like the Minister to instruct the HSE to conduct an analysis of this cohort to determine whether there is an unusual level of issues relating to patient safety, negligence and so forth.  There may be serious patient safety issues concerning people being treated by doctors who are not consultants but whom they believe are consultants.  I would like the Minister to take these suggestions under consideration.</p></speech>

However, the Medical Council is the regulator of our doctors.  It is important for our citizens and patients to know that there is no suggestion - the Deputy Donnelly has not suggested it - that these doctors who are not on the specialist register are not fully qualified in medicine.  This important point has been highlighted by the Medical Council.</p>  <p>  I will make a decision on the issue of mandating the HSE to inform patients based on the report that I will receive on the project being undertaken, which is due to conclude next month.</p><p>At that time, I will also take an opportunity to engage with the Medical Council.  The Joint Committee on Health might wish to engage with the HSE and the Medical Council as well to see how best we can square this circle.</p></speech>

I would be grateful if the Minister, in his reply, could concentrate on the measures taken to alleviate the backlog and the communication with those who were impacted because it came to my attention that a number of women found out that there was an issue via the media, which is not acceptable.

I interpret this question as her specifically referring to the issue that has arisen in respect of secondary HPV testing and she can tell me if she wishes me to talk more broadly.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to clarify this matter in the House.  Unfortunately, quite a bit of misinformation was put out, although not by the Deputy, for the sake of making political charges in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  Where low grade changes are detected on a cervical smear test, a second so-called "triage test", which looks for the HPV virus, is carried out by laboratories.  If HPV is found, women are recommended to attend for further testing.  If HPV is not found, women are recommended to attend for routine screening again in three to five years.  In the test used by the laboratory concerned, the manufacturer's recommendation is that the test for HPV should be carried out within 30 days of the sample having been given by a woman.</p>  <p>  The current issue first came to light due to ongoing improvement work across the screening programme, including strengthening of its quality assurance processes, as recommended in Dr. Scally's report.  The HSE was advised by Quest Diagnostics that there was a concern relating to secondary HPV testing within the recommended timeframe.  The HSE convened an expert clinical team to establish the facts with the company and review the situation.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, on 5 December I was informed by my Department that an issue had arisen and that the HSE was working to establish the facts and what action, if any, may be required, and received subsequent interim updates pending completion of the work of the expert clinical team and final confirmation of the position.</p>  <p>  My priority, exactly as the Deputy suggested, was to seek to ensure that women were the first to be communicated with on this issue, and to learn the lessons of the past regarding CervicalCheck.  I have heard patient advocates speak about this.  Indeed, I met the members of 221 Plus group for a number of hours last week and they also wanted to hear the information first.  It was always my priority, when all the facts were known, to make sure women hear directly or through their doctors.  I am advised that Quest Diagnostics has now provided details of all the samples it knows to be affected, and that the vast majority of letters to women affected have now been issued by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that clinical research shows that HPV tests remain effective - this is important - when they are performed outside the recommended timeframe and that there is little risk of inaccuracy.  In fact, it was defined as "exceedingly low risk" by the acting clinical director of the programme.  Nevertheless, this is a precautionary measure.  It is right and proper to do this.</p>  <p>  I will come back in on other matters in a moment.</p></speech>

Women should have confidence.  Screening saves lives.  I have seen it at close quarters.  I have great faith in this programme but all that has happened has knocked the confidence that women deserve to have in it.</p>  <p>  I refer to a letter that was sent to the Minister by Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail in August 2018.  It refers to the turnaround time for processing smears of up to 12 weeks being problematic.  He also states that he would request that this delay in the processing of smear samples be addressed as a matter of urgency.  He advises that his organisation's members will have to deal with women who have yet another repeat smear to face.  That is where the confidence slips.  It is where a woman keeps being told she must come back.  Women deserve to have confidence in the programme.  Could the Minister advise us exactly what was done on foot of receipt of that letter raising concerns because my understanding is no reply was received?</p></speech>

When raising this issue, she always has been.  However, a charge were made in this House  by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il on an occasion when Members knew I was not here to respond.  The charge was that I offered free repeat smear tests to women against official advice.  That is false.  That decision was made in conjunction with my officials, including the Chief Medical Officer, and it was supported by Opposition politicians, including those present, because women wanted that reassurance.  Many women took up that opportunity to have reassurance.  These were not the only women getting the reassurance.  In addition, there were also new women, who had never availed of the programme, taking up screening which we all believe is good.</p>  <p>  I accept that has caused a backlog, which cannot be easily fixed merely by resources.  If it could, I guarantee it would be done.  There is an issue in trying to identify more capacity in what is already a shortage of cytology.  The HSE is due to complete a capacity report in the next couple of weeks on how we can look at addressing this and I will act on that immediately.</p>  <p>  It is not true for Members to state in this House that the repeat smear test was offered against official advice.  That was not the case.  Of course, some doctors had views on this matter.  Many others welcomed it.  Many GPs also wanted to know what were they to do when women were coming to them looking for that reassurance and whether they were to charge them when they had done nothing wrong.</p></speech>

It details delays that were happening and the fact that its members were having to deal with women who were yet to have another test.  Neither I nor any member of my party made that charge and I am glad that the Minister made it clear.  Not putting the necessary resources in place before that offer was made, respecting the fact that it was right to do, caused this delay and this backlog.  Whatever about the advice the Minister received in June, which is a matter he needs to sort out with the person who said that as it was not me, I refer to the letter he received in August.  He has detailed actions that took place from December.  I want to know what was done in August when this letter was received because that is approximately the time the backlog started, according to my friends and family.</p>  <p>  I repeat it is important that women have confidence in this service because it should be a good service.</p></speech>

For example, my Department negotiated the provision of the repeat free smear test with the Irish Medical Organisation.  We agreed a fee with the organisation.  We paid GPs to provide this test and the Deputy agrees with me on this.  Had we not done that, we would have had a situation where women who could afford the repeat smear test would have got it and women who could not would not have been reassured.  This was one of the top queries coming in to the CervicalCheck helpline, with women stating they did not want to wait for their next date to come around and they would like the reassurance.  The Deputy is entirely correct.  That led to a significant number of additional women taking that test, many of whom got reassurance.  It also obviously added to a backlog.</p>  <p>  Long before we received that letter, and consistently, the HSE had been working to try to identify more capacity.  Its first priority was to ensure the continuation of the screening, which is not something we could take for granted.  We came within hours of not having laboratories provide screening.  Once that was done, the next focus was rightly on trying to find additional capacity.  They are working hard on that.  I hope they can make some progress on it.  I expect to receive the capacity report shortly.</p></speech>

Within the past year, the HSE has established services in south Tipperary, Wexford and Limerick, and a service in the midlands opened in September.</p><p>A review of the methadone treatment protocol was published in December 2010.  Arising from the review, the HSE implemented an opioid treatment protocol to provide appropriate and timely substance treatment and rehabilitation services tailored to individual needs.</p><p>In 2016, the HSE published clinical guidelines for opioid substitution treatment.  The guidelines are the first that specifically relate to opioid substitution treatment in HSE clinics and primary care settings.</p><p>Opioid substitution treatment supports patients to recover from drug dependence.

More than 6,000 have been on it for five years or more, while more than 4,000 are on methadone for ten years or more.  Since 2016, between 70 and 80 teenagers have been on a treatment programme.  I am concerned that some people seem to remain on a programme for a long time.  There must be better outcomes.  The Minister of State referred to a 2010 review.  In 2019, it is time we reviewed it again, knowing that people are on this programme indefinitely.  Are we suggesting to somebody who goes on such a programme when he or she is aged 17, 18 or 19 that he or she will still be on methadone treatment in ten or 15 years?  There has to be a better outcome and the figures indicate that some people are on the programme way too long.</p></speech>

As he said, people are on methadone over a long period.  Some of them have been on it for more than then ten years.  For many, it is an opportunity to remain stable and to continue their lives and work.  I know many of these people.  There are limitations, however, in the opportunities for GPs in areas with regard to methadone services.  A number of doctors are available for level 1 and level 2 GP services.  There are, however, problems recruiting doctors for level 2 GP services for methadone treatment.  We are succeeding around the State and with the funding made available through the HSE for services in primary and community care, I believe there will be an outcome into the future.</p>  <p>  Suboxone use has also been established as a treatment in Ireland.  To facilitate the increase in the use of Suboxone, &euro;750,000 was allocated in each of the years 2017 and 2018, giving us a sum of &euro;1.5 million for the full year costs.  Suboxone is a new initiative in Ireland to help some people, while others will never be on Suboxone because that treatment does not suit them.  We will continue to roll out the Suboxone treatment.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that it is a while since the 2010 review of the treatment programme and that we may need to look at it again.  People are, however, surviving on a daily basis, living out their lives, going to work and rearing families while they are on methadone.  We cannot forget the fact that it is also available.</p></speech>

When a person goes onto the programme, there needs to be personal plan for those who are suited to it to progress beyond a life on methadone.  For some of those people it is a life on methadone.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's comments on Suboxone.  Ireland, however, is a bit of an outlier in comparison with most European countries that have 20% or 30% of those on opioid substitution treatment, OST, using Suboxone.  We have a very small cohort.  This is not the same as in Europe.  Suboxone has a lot of benefits.  It is less addictive and easier to withdraw from, there is less chance of overdosing, and so on.  The roll-out of Suboxone in Ireland for those who could benefit from it has been slow.</p>  <p>  We often talk about the risks of taking somebody off methadone.  There are risks also for people who remain on methadone.  The drug-related death index shows there are some 700 drug-related deaths per annum, half of which are from poisonings.  Approximately 20% of those who are poisoned have been in receipt of methadone.  That means 1% of the population that receives methadone treatment per annum is dying.  The treatment programme needs to be reviewed with personal progression plans being considered and the alternative Suboxone being made more widely available.</p></speech>

We have had additional funding this year to roll it out further.  We will do that.  Under the new strategy it is very clear to me and my Department that we will have to evaluate some of the methadone treatment numbers to see what we can do in the future to help people to reduce the time they are on the programme.  We need more GPs to come on board, especially in level 2 GP services, to help with chronic people coming into clinics.  This can also be the first port of call for them.  We are approaching the issue in the right way.  We may differ in how quickly we can get through it but I agree there needs to be a review.  It has been a long time since the methadone treatment services were reviewed in 2010.  There are a lot of good services in the community, in pharmacies and GP practices, and they have made a significant difference to peoples' lives.  I know we are not knocking it, but I do not believe we should constantly target those people who are making a major recovery because they have been on methadone, even for a short time.</p></speech>

I am very much aware of the concerns that women in Northern Ireland have regarding access to termination of pregnancy, which are similar to those faced by women in the Republic prior to the recent change in the law here as a result of the referendum.  I hope that we arrive at a situation in the not too distant future where Northern Ireland makes its own decisions on this issue and moves in a direction where it can care for women in its health service.  As long as that remains not to be the case I want to make sure we can offer care.  I know that the Deputy and I share this view for women on the island of Ireland, regardless of whether a person lives North or South.</p>  <p>  I believe it is welcome and it is progress that women who live in Northern Ireland can now access termination services in this jurisdiction.   The Deputy will be aware, however, that under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for public health services is based on a person being ordinarily resident in the State.  This is the bedrock on which our eligibility system for health services, and many other public services, is founded.  The necessary provisions were made in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 to enable universal access for women living in the State to the services in question without charge.  Women who live in Northern Ireland can access termination services in this jurisdiction - which is an important message to send out - but would, in effect, be doing so not in the universal and free way that women in the Republic of Ireland can.</p>  <p>  To be very clear, I do not believe this is fair and I share the Deputy's wish to facilitate access without charge to termination of pregnancy services to women from Northern Ireland.  Such a proposal, however, raises a number of legal and policy issues.   I have had some initial discussion with the Attorney General about the matter.  He has indicated that as a proposition along these lines appears not to have been considered before, it would require a fair bit of work.  I, therefore, intend to undertake such an examination of the issues in conjunction with the Attorney General and other Government colleagues as necessary.  We had a good meeting when Deputy O'Reilly brought civic society groups that are campaigning on this matter in Northern Ireland to Leinster House.  I was pleased to have a chance to meet the Deputy and those groups.  I would very much welcome the chance to do that again and to see, together and on a cross-party basis, how we can rectify this.  My policy intention was clear; I want women in Northern Ireland to be able to access the services they can.  To make sure they can access the services in a universal and free way is something I am currently trying to find a solution to.  I remain absolutely committed to working to find one.</p></speech>

In 2017, just over 900 women from the North of Ireland travelled for an abortion.  The figure is low and I venture that the financial commitment is not huge, but I do not dispute that it is a financial commitment.  All of the circumstances that the Minister outlined in his reply were known to him when he made the commitment.</p><p>However, nothing has changed in the meantime.  All of the circumstances were known.  My colleague, Megan Fearon, MLA; Grainne Taggart of Amnesty International, the Alliance for Choice and other groups are working hard to do what they can for women in the North.  However, I put it to the Minister that it was he who made the commitment and that it is up to him to deliver on it.  I would welcome an opportunity to meet him again to discuss the matter.  As I have said before, I assure him that he will have my party's support in bringing this about, but for many, &euro;450 does not represent access but a barrier.</p></speech>

It means that people can access services on the island of Ireland without having to travel to another island and stay overnight in the United Kingdom or experience high air fares and so on.  It means being able to visit a GP in the Republic at an early stage of pregnancy to access services at primary care level.  However, the Deputy should not take this to suggest I think it is satisfactory.  My commitment was given in good faith.  My commitment that women would be able to access the service has been acted on.  The commitment on which I want to deliver, however, is that they can access it freely, like women living in the Republic.  I have outlined matters truthfully to the Deputy and the Amnesty International and other groups she brought to see me that day and we are trying to find a way through it.  What I am outlining in the D&aacute;il today is the fact that eligibility for public health services is based on a person being ordinarily resident in the State.  The work taking place is to find a legal way around this.  I am committed to working hard on the issue with the Office of the Attorney General and keeping the Deputy up to date.  It would be useful to meet her, any other interested colleague and the group to which she referred in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It is not as if we would have to reinvent the wheel because there are already circumstances in which health services in both jurisdictions are accessible from either side of the Border.  It is possible to do this.  I do not want to pour cold water on the Minister's commitment, but while we welcome the offer of a meeting, we are conscious of the fact that, albeit the numbers are small, women continue to travel.

I would also like to work with her and groups in Northern Ireland on the support the 24/7 helpline we now operate can provide for women, regardless of where they live on the island.  It ensures women can talk to qualified healthcare professionals and councillors and that all of their options can be signposted in terms of how they can access services.  While we are proactively promoting the existence of services in this jurisdiction, the helpline ensures there is knowledge and awareness of the existence of the services and information and support north of the Border also.  We do not disagree on where we want to get to, but I need to find a way to get there.  I am not the font of all wisdom on this issue and while I have access to the Office of the Attorney General and the like, I am also happy to hear the Opposition's ideas on how we can legislate in that regard.

The unprecedented demand for cervical screening in 2018 owing to understandable concerns of women, as well as an increased uptake of screening, has led to long and very regrettable delays in the reporting of results.  The fact that new women have opted into the programme for the first time is important.  The HSE has advised me that results are being reported on average within 22 weeks of the test being taken.  As with all averages, some case results are reported in a much shorter period, while in other cases, the period is longer.  Addressing these delays is a top priority for me, my Department and the HSE.  The HSE is working actively to manage the issue and identify additional capacity, where possible.  However, the global shortage of cytology capacity must be borne in mind as it means that this is very challenging.</p>  <p>  To provide the information the Deputy seeks, in particular, I note that, clinically, the HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer indicates that the disease will normally develop over a period of ten to 15 years.  Owing to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attend for cervical screening when she is invited to do so.  In that context, the current reporting time for cervical screening results, while absolutely undesirable and regrettable, poses a very low risk to women.  As the Deputy knows, false negatives are inherent in all cervical screening programmes and screening cannot prevent all cancers.  However, cervical screening saves lives.  Regular smear testing is the most important thing a woman can do to prevent cervical cancer, which is why my focus is on ensuring the continuation of the screening programme and that the current challenges in relation to smear test turnaround times are addressed.</p>  <p>  I am obviously not a medic, but the medical advice I have been given is that the delays pose a very low clinical risk to women.  Obviously, I want to see the delays continue to reduce.  I do not find the current delays acceptable, but I want the Deputy to know, as I think he does, having come to know a lot of the people working on this issue in the HSE very well in the last while, that they are doing everything possible to identify additional capacity.  I will certainly keep the Deputy and others informed as it comes on stream.</p></speech>

However, I must question the making of a decision like this without knowing whether we had the resources to meet demand.  The Minister is in a unique position which those of us in opposition are not.  As for the consequences, I was glad to hear in reply to a previous question that the Minister's chief medical officer supported him 100% and advocated that we do this.  We had not heard that before in the House.  Specifically I want to know the following.  In November I stated at the joint committee that women who were being referred for their triennial smear test or who were being referred for six-monthly or annual checks and needed greater priority could not be distinguished between.  Therefore, women have had to wait 24 weeks, whether they were seeking six-monthly smear tests due to significant issues of change or they were presenting for their triennial check.  I am not a clinician either, but that certainly creates risk.  Mr. McCallion said it to me at the time.  I seek an assurance that the lack of capacity to prioritise between the different women referred for checks does not create a risk to their health.</p></speech>

I do not know how the Deputy views it, but certainly the numbers would have been almost impossible to estimate.  What was very clear, however, was the need to provide the tests.  The Deputy and I do not differ on this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to state in the House that I did not act against official advice.  Such cheap political charges which the Deputy did not make only added to the unease.  I met the 221+ group of women and their partners who had been through cervical cancer and relatives of people who had died.  They get very annoyed when we start to play petty party politics by putting half-truths in the public domain.  I know the Deputy agrees.</p>  <p>  I have asked about triage which I think is what the Deputy is referring to.  He is asking whether, if we know that there is a greater risk, we can ensure those subject to it will be seen sooner.  I have been assured that work has been done on this issue.  I will be attending the Joint Committee on Health tomorrow and will answer questions about CervicalCheck in the House tomorrow.  I might provide the Deputy with a definitive answer on this issue in our next exchange in 24 hours' time.</p></speech>

I accept that some of the women concerned could have had false negatives.  Some could have issues related to the laboratories about which we do not yet know because we do not know about percentages in the RCOG review.  The issue is whether the Minister can guarantee that no woman's health has been affected because of the lack of prioritisation in a triage setting.</p><p>I have been contacted by some people who have deep concerns that this delay, possibly combined with other issues, has put their medical situation in a far worse position than it should be.  This is a big problem for the Minister.  A second tranche of women being affected could also have a financial impact on the State.  I need an assurance from the Minister today.  Given what I said at committee meetings in November, given the fact we now know of the 1,000 cases where the slides must be redone, and I understand the distinction between these and the 6,000 cases, and given the situation we know about with regard to false negatives, and we do not know the full details of potential issues with laboratories, is the Minister able to guarantee the delay has not had a negative impact on the health of these women?</p></speech>

As he has done so, and in the interest of completeness, I want to take this opportunity to inform him and the House that I am pleased to say slides have begun to transfer to the RCOG.  This was an issue causing concern and it is now under way.</p>  <p>  As the Minister for Health, I rely on clinical advice.  The clinical advice available to me is what I have stated on the record of the House.  The HSE has clinically advised me that the natural history of cervical cancer indicates it is a disease that would normally develop over a period of ten to 15 years.  Due to this fact, regular screening is very important in terms of reducing the risk.  Medically and clinically I am told that in this context, although the current reporting time of cervical screening results was absolutely undesirable and regrettable, it poses a very low clinical risk to women.</p></speech>

This affects every cohort of the population, including teenagers and older people, with conditions linked to obesity and diabetes.  What plans does the Minister have in place to address these waiting lists?  What is the current state of the dietician service in County Mayo?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500026#Y00500"><p>I thank Deputy Calleary for the question.  In line with the all-party vision set out under Sl&aacute;intecare, the Government is prioritising investment in the expansion of primary care services, including dietetics.  Overall funding for primary care increased by more than &euro;50 million, or 6.1%, in the HSE's national service plan for 2019.  Among other things, this will enable the recruitment of additional nurses, therapists and other health professionals such as dieticians.  I acknowledge the role of Deputy Calleary's party on this during the budgetary process.</p>  <p>  I understand that the dietician service in Mayo has been under particular pressure as some staff are on extended leave, while the number of referrals rose significantly during 2018 to 830 compared with 425 in 2017.  Nonetheless, despite these pressures, the number of individuals waiting for treatment fell from 700 at the end of 2017 to 523 at the end of 2018, a reduction of 25%.  I recognise a large number of people are still waiting, and although such progress is to be welcomed, the numbers waiting to access this important service are still too high.  I am very aware of the stress this can cause to families.</p>  <p>  With regard to measures now being taken specifically to improve access times further in County Mayo, I can inform the Deputy that community healthcare area west recently completed panel interviews for senior dietician posts, which will fill two dietetics vacancies in Mayo, and dieticians are adapting their working methods by using web texts and opt-in letters to enable them to plan clinics more effectively.  Although it is too early to determine the impact of these measures, it is anticipated that they will help to improve access times throughout the county during 2019.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to outline specifically the impact of these measures on waiting times for those seeking the service in County Mayo in 2019, and it has said it will revert to the Deputy directly.</p></speech>

Will the Minister confirm the timeline for these appointments?  When will they take up their positions?  Will they be assigned to cover the entire county?  How many of the 523 people on waiting lists in 2018 had been on it for more than one year and how many were under the age of 18?  I ask that particular emphasis be placed on the cohort aged under 18 so their treatment is prioritised.  This is causing concern to a number of my constituents, including parents of children with particular difficulties.  Given the focus we have as a nation on obesity, early intervention through this service is crucial to preventing conditions such as diabetes taking hold down the line.</p></speech>

The number of clients waiting for treatment at the end of 2018 was down to 523 from 700 in 2017.  Of these, the number waiting for more than 26 weeks was 216.  I will try to get the Deputy more information.  I do not have information in my briefing on those under the age of 18 but I will get it for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  At present, four dieticians work in County Mayo, with three other staff on extended leave, which has led to significant pressures.  We now have two additional appointments, which will bring the number back to six.  I am told the appointments are to be made shortly and I will get a specific timeframe for the Deputy.  I will ask the HSE to revert to him on this and ask that it pays particular attention to the cohort aged under 18.</p>  <p>  With regard to the other innovative developments that local staff have introduced in Mayo, which are to be welcomed, the opt-in letters are issued to those who have been waiting a long time to check whether they are still in need of the dietetic service in primary care.  This makes better use of the dieticians' time.  Web texts now issue approximately one to three days before an appointment reminding clients of the date, time and location of their clinic to help avoid issues of non-attendance.  I pay tribute to the local HSE Mayo staff for these innovations.</p></speech>

A review has been going on for more than a year.  There is concern about the provision of the laboratory and the provision of other capital projects in the region as a result of the children's hospital cost overrun.  Will the Minister outline a timeline for when it will be provided, particularly against the superior influence, it seems, that the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has over Deputy McLoughlin from the Minister's party in terms of the provision of a second cath lab in Waterford while we still wait for one in Sligo.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500026#Y01000"><p>Deputy McLoughlin has plenty of influence within the party structures and the Government structures.  I thank Deputy MacSharry for the question.  The Government is committed to ensuring that all citizens have access to safe, high-quality and evidence-based care, in line with international norms.  Sligo University Hospital, which I had the pleasure of visiting recently, provides high-quality healthcare to the people of Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan.  At present there are two cath labs based in Galway that service acute cardiac cases for Sligo and the north west.  For elective cases there is a mobile cath lab unit that operates two days per week in Sligo.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that specialist cardiac catheterisation laboratory services are provided in a small number of hospitals to ensure that the services provided achieve the required standards of safety, quality and sustainability in the interests of patients.  I want to check whether there is a fair distribution of these throughout the country because I have heard the concerns of Deputy MacSharry and others about how they are located.  For this reason, I established the national review of specialist cardiac services.  This is ongoing and it is expected that its work will be completed in June.  The aim of the review is to identify where we should have the cath labs to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level and an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.</p>  <p>  As set out in the national development plan, investment in such laboratories and other cardiac services nationally will be informed by the outcome of the national review.  This was sought by Deputies on all sides of the House.  It will provide us with the detailed information we need by June, and I will certainly act on it then.</p></speech>

Is the review that was commissioned and begun in January 2018 being prepared in Aramaic, hieroglyphics or some other ancient text or form of writing?  It does not take a year.  I do not mean any personal disrespect to the Minister, but increasingly Ministers are becoming commentators, and very expensive commentators at &euro;190,000 a year, telling us a review is taking place.  A five year old child looking at the map could tell us about the gaping wound in the north west with no cath lab while there are two in Waterford.  Before anyone from Waterford attacks me for saying Waterford is not entitled to them, I am not saying that.  I am saying it is clear what type of review is required.  Clearly, it is just a tactic to state it is under review.  When did the last meeting of the review group take place?  When is it reporting?  How much does it cost?  We must tell the truth to the people in the north west.</p><p>We do have to tell the truth but I would not have a five year old deciding where to locate our specialist cardiac services.</p></speech>

The national review of specialist cardiac services is independently chaired by the very eminent Professor Phillip Nolan who is president of Maynooth University.  He is an independent chair.  The aim of the national review is to achieve optimal patience outcomes at population levels.  The scope of the national review is broad and was welcomed by many in the Deputy's party.  It is badly needed.  The report will examine services for adults that address elective, urgent and emergency need for hospital-based diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease.  That will include diagnostic and interventional cardiac procedures and associated interdependent services.</p>  <p>  There are 15 members on the steering committee.  The Deputy will be pleased to know they include healthcare professionals and, crucially, patients.  Patient advocacy is important in this area.  Officials from the HSE and my Department are also on the steering committee.  The review will also consider responses gathered from public consultation.  There has been an opportunity for people, including those from the north west, to have an input into review and I believe a number of people from the Deputy's part of the country gave their views.  The steering committee will report in June.  It will recommend the best service configuration for a national adult cardiac service.  I understand how important and sensitive this matter is in the north west.  That was made clear to me on my recent visit to Sligo.  </p></speech>

There is no specific information on which projects will be affected yet but we are all concerned.  St. Patrick's Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon and Shiel Hospital in Ballyshannon are both new hospitals and have been announced, expected and celebrated in press releases and photocalls by the Minister and his colleagues.  Many capital developments are due to take place in Sligo University Hospital.  There were also lots of photocalls, etc., but the Government should show us the money and the building.  When are these projects going to happen?</p>  <p>  We are worried about the level of autopilot and commentary from the Government.  I do not mean that personally, but that is how this looks.  We want leadership from the Minister and the Taoiseach.  They should show us the money and tell us the facts.  We certainly do not want the kind of autopilot that seems to be at play in the context of the national children's hospital.  It appears that will have an adverse impact on the provision of a cath lab for the people of the north west.  There is none there at the moment.  Some 550 people a year, treated at the moment at a cost of &euro;10.6 million to the Exchequer, are being shipped to Galway for treatment.  The cost to rent the temporary truck that wheels in two days each week is &euro;3.6 million, as the Minister mentioned.  If that money was banked, it would make much more sense to finance a cath lab and put the staff in place as well.</p></speech>

We will make that decision on the cath lab in Sligo based on the clinical advice and the report that will be given to us by the national review group in June.   I do not think that is being a commentator; that is asking medics and patients to come together under an independent chair and look at the best and fairest way to distribute specialist services across our country.  While the national children's hospital will take up approximately 20% of my Department's capital budget- by the way 25% of our population comprises children - 80% of the budget will be spent on items that have nothing whatsoever to do with that hospital.  There will be significant increases in capital expenditure in health.  That is clear to see.  The budget for the next ten years is almost &euro;11 billion compared to just &euro;4 billion for the past ten years.  That will enable us to invest in furthering services in the north west, not just the cath lab but the additional bed block that is badly needed at Sligo University Hospital.  I will keep the Deputy informed as this review comes to a conclusion this summer.</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, visited the project this afternoon.  I am pleased to advise that construction is currently under way for the National Forensic Mental Health Service Hospital and is due to be completed at the end of the year.  It is anticipated this new facility will open in 2020, following its equipping and commissioning.  The new 170 single-bedroom National Forensic Mental Service Hospital is designed to facilitate segregated high and medium secure services.  It will include a number of shared facilities, which will comprise the 130-bedroom National Forensic Hospital to replace the existing 94-bed Central Mental Hospital complex at Dundrum.  It will also include a co-located ten-bedroom forensic child and adolescent mental health unit, CAMHS, and a 30-bedroom intensive care rehabilitation unit, ICRU.</p>  <p>  The new complex will position Ireland&rsquo;s forensic mental health service as a world leader in best clinical practice.  Developing mental health services remains a priority for the Government, as I know it is for the Deputy.  Budget 2019 provided an additional &euro;55 million for new developments in mental health, which brings overall HSE mental health funding to nearly &euro;1 billion this year.  This funding will help to make mental health services more person-centred, user-friendly, responsive to need, and recovery orientated.  Separate from the project team responsible for the construction and commissioning phases of the new facility, the HSE recently established a high-level governance group for the transition of the forensic mental health service from the old Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum to Portrane.</p></speech>

The difficulty with this project is similar to much of our healthcare and concerns whether it will be possible to access the services provided.  That provision will put us at approximately just two such beds per 100,000 people.  The international norm is between five and nine per 100,000.  We are significantly behind and this has led in the past to some significant criticisms from Professor Harry Kennedy.  He has been critical of the difficulty of getting people in our prisons with serious mental health issues into the Central Mental Hospital due to a lack of places.  Is this project is expected to finish on or under budget?</p></speech>

I was out there today and met with the team.  We have continued to engage with them.  I must also compliment the HSE which has been successful in this project.  It began clearing the site in 2017 and the keys will be handed over by the builder in October 2019.  The project is coming in within budget.  No issues are arising in that respect.  The completion date is ahead of schedule and it will be a state-of-the-art hospital.  From a capacity point of view, and to address the issue that the Deputy raised and the fears expressed by Professor Kennedy and others, we are going from 92 beds in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum to 170 beds in the new facility in Portrane.  That is almost a doubling of capacity when it comes to forensic mental health.  As the Minister said, there will be a ten-bed CAMHS unit and a 30-bed ICRU.  Capacity will be significantly improved as a result of this development.  It is a testament to the ability of the HSE to deal with and manage this project very well, thus far.  I acknowledge that.</p></speech>

He has been economical with the numbers in respect of 170 beds.  We are moving from 92 to 130 forensic beds.  The other beds are welcome, but ten are for children and 30 are for intensive rehabilitation.  They are additional beds, which are needed, but they are not replacement beds.  We are comparing the current 92 beds to 130 beds that will be provided.</p>  <p>  It was highlighted previously that about 28 people were waiting in prison last summer to get access to the Central Mental Hospital.  Does the Minister know how many are currently waiting to access to that hospital?  How many patients within the Prison Service are being serviced by inreach teams from the Central Mental Hospital?  </p></speech>

I accept that the ten CAMHS beds may not be an increase in capacity but the other 30 ICRU beds in that unit are intended to get people out of the system.  We are not just building a prison; we are building a hospital that is transformative, where there is care and from where people will progress.  That is why there will be an ICRU.  That is a progressive step and it will be ideally suited to many of the patients currently in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  That is, therefore, an increase in capacity.  We have 160 beds, so we will be going from 92 to 160.  I agree with the Deputy in respect of the prison population and the lack of opportunities for them.  That is especially the case with rehabilitation to improve their well-being and move them on from the system.  That is very much the focus.  An ICRU is a first for Ireland.  It is a progressive development and one to be acknowledged by all.</p></speech>

Many concerns have been raised with the Minister, particularly by the cohort of hospital pharmacists.  These issues include who is liable, the status of those pharmacists as HSE employees and not owners of the pharmacy, which is a major concern, staffing and IT requirements needed to implement this directive, technical problems that may occur which take precedent to the safety of the patient and a consultation regarding a statutory instrument.  Has that now been finalised and will it be in place prior to 9 February?</p></reply>

As Deputy Brassil noted, the safety features include a form of an anti-tamper device and unique identifiers embedded in a two-dimensional barcode on the pack.  The purpose of the regulation is to improve patient safety and maintain confidence in the safety of medicines supplied to patients.</p>  <p>  A statutory instrument will provide that the Irish legislative system is consistent with the requirements of the regulation.  Nothing in the new regulations seeks to alter the existing legal and regulatory responsibilities of persons authorised to place medicinal products on the market or supply them to the public.  It will apply to manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacy owners and pharmacists equally.</p>  <p>  The regulation provided for a three-year transition period, starting in 2016, to facilitate preparation for its introduction.  Details of the requirements of the delegated regulation have been communicated to all sectors during this period by the Irish Medicines Verification Organisation, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Pharmacy Union.</p>  <p>  I recognise the sincere concerns raised by stakeholders and articulated by the Deputies regarding the practical implementation of the regulation.  Above all, I want to ensure that the normal supply of medicines to patients is maintained.  I intend, therefore, to implement the system in a pragmatic manner and defer operating the offences provisions in the legislation for an initial period.  This will allow everyone involved to develop familiarity with the new arrangements and overcome any teething issues before we proceed to the introduction of the provisions that deal with offences.</p>  <p>  I considered the implementation issues and, on 25 January, decided that a pragmatic approach should be taken to the use of the system.  This approach will ensure there is no break in the supply of medicines to patients, which is crucial, until the new system is bedded in, alleviate the concerns of pharmacists as to whether the offences and enforcement provisions would be commenced on 9 February and ensure that the offence's commencement and the proposed pragmatic implementation period will be subject to ongoing review.  These three policy decisions, which I took at the end of January, were communicated by the implementation stakeholders to all parties concerned on Monday, 4 February in a co-ordinated manner, and have been well received by such stakeholders.  We are trying to do what we need to do under the regulation and achieve what we need to achieve, but in a pragmatic way that does not rush in offences until the new system is bedded in.</p></speech>

Forgive me for not being up to date with the matter but 4 February was only yesterday.  While many pharmacists who have contacted me, and Deputy O'Reilly and all the other Deputies will be delighted that a pragmatic approach is being taken, one or two issues arose.  I was in contact with a number of pharmacists who were partaking in a pilot project to see how it would be implemented.  On that pilot project, approximately 80% of the medicines put through the system were returned with a red flag, that is, if the medicine was operational at the time, the pharmacist would not have been able to dispense it even though he or she knew it was perfectly safe to do so.</p>  <p>  There is much work required, therefore, to get the system working and operational.  Particularly in the hospital setting, space, storage and IT systems are critical.  I submitted a parliamentary question about robotic dispensing, which some hospital pharmacies have but most do not.  There needs to be a levelling of the playing field in that area.</p></speech>

The directive places the responsibility on the corporate entity but the manner in which it will be implemented places much responsibility directly on the pharmacist but does not place enough emphasis on corporate responsibility.  The employer has no obligation, for example, to provide the infrastructure or resources for a worker to carry out his or her duty.  While it is all very well to defer the offences, if someone is guilty of an offence, regardless of when the offence might be introduced, there will be no allowance for the fact that it might not be his or her fault.  There should be some obligation on the employer, therefore, to ensure the pharmacist has the best chance of not falling foul of the law.</p></speech>

Similarly to the other Deputies, I have been approached by HSE hospital-based pharmacists who had concerns about the matter.  The Minister's comments are welcome and I hope we will continue to negotiate or, at least, that we will receive detailed updates from him.</p></speech>

I thank Deputies Brassil, O'Reilly and McLoughlin, along with other Deputies, for their advocacy on this issue and for highlighting people's concerns.  I will reflect on Deputy O'Reilly's comments and revert to her.</p>  <p>  We will adopt a pragmatic approach.  Once the new system becomes live on 9 February, it should be considered to be in a use-and-learn mode.  Pharmacists will be able to continue for a defined period to dispense packs unless they have an overriding concern that a falsified medicine is involved.  Within the defined period, which will possibly be between six months and a year, further intensive work can be carried out to devise and communicate a workable EU-wide process for the management of alerts and ensure that all parties affected by the regulation comply with its requirements and can join the new system.  There will be a review by regulators after three months to assess the initial implementation period and whether the pragmatic approach needs to be continued for a further period.  After 9 February, pharmacists will continue to carry out the professional product checks that they have carried out to date, which are important when dispensing any medicine to a patient.</p>  <p>  Some other EU member states have voiced concerns about implementation at a technical group meeting in Brussels last week.  While we cannot speak for them, it is likely that other member states, due to their size, will have similar implementation and alert problems and may well also operate a national pragmatic approach, such as that taken by Ireland.</p></speech>

It is clear that the Minister has read and listened to the concerns of the industry, but I reiterate the specific issue of hospital pharmacies.  In a public hospital, the pharmacist does not have the authority to determine the human resources, space, logistics and equipment necessary to comply with the directive.  All those factors must be taken into account to allow hospital pharmacists to carry out their duties without fear of being liable because they are not the hospital owner.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working with the Minister and his Department on the implementation of the directive.  Anything that improves safety of products is to be welcomed but must be done in the pragmatic manner we discussed.</p></speech>

They are practical points and are not made for any reason other than my belief that it is a little unfair to shift that level of responsibility onto an individual without placing the same level of responsibility on the employer to ensure compliance.</p>  <p>  Another issue that was raised and must be considered is what will happen in the event of an IT malfunction.  I welcome that the Minister will engage in some consultation and that there will be an opportunity to review.  I ask that the concerns I have raised be taken on board.</p></speech>

Pharmacists who are employees of a pharmacy owner or the HSE are concerned that if they were to dispense a medicine where the pharmacy was not connected to the new system through an omission of the employer or issue a medicine that failed in its alert, they could end up being prosecuted.  The concerns that were raised were valid and helped to inform the decision that while certain elements of the statutory instrument will be commenced before 9 February, the offences provision will not be commenced for a period afterwards to let the final registrations of the new system take place, the system be bedded down and a definitive alert system be developed.</p><p>There are some challenges remaining, including the impossibility of predicting the volume of alerts and identifying the percentage which are true alerts.  It would probably be a small percentage.  There is also the matter of possible medicine shortages while alerts are investigated and medicine supply must be a key priority.  We must also manage good communication between parties and queries from pharmacies about refunds for products with alerts.  Ireland will proceed to implement the regulation, but it will do so in a common sense and pragmatic way.  As I said, I do not expect that we will be alone in this with regard to the position of other EU member states.</p></speech>

The Minister made a political promise last May to extend free smear testing and it resulted in 84,000 additional and unscheduled smear tests being added to a system that was already overloaded.  He might have been aware at the time that this would put additional pressure on the system and the political promise he made was not resourced.</p></reply>

I hope the Deputy or Deputy Mich&eacute;al Martin will clarify the official advice I was not following because I clarified for the House this afternoon that I followed the advice of my officials, including the Chief Medical Officer, in providing this important reassurance for women.  It was welcomed by many members of the Deputy's party and across the House.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made an important point about resources, but it is an issue of capacity.  As I stated to Deputy Kelly, it was almost impossible to estimate how many would take up the offer of reassurance or how long the period of unease would be.  Almost 350,000 screening tests were submitted to CervicalCheck laboratories during 2018, of which approximately 82,000 are still being processed.  The increased workload has led to delays in the reporting of results.  Results are being reported, as I stated, on average within 22 weeks of the test being taken.  Owing to this processing backlog in the period April to December 2018, a proportion of cervical screening samples were not transferred to slides within the six-week timeframe.  Repeat testing was required in 550 cases or 0.25% of total samples.  This compares with a rate of 0.23% for the same period in 2017.  CervicalCheck contacted the women concerned and their GPs to inform them of this issue and invite them to attend for a repeat smear test in three months, as repeat tests can only be carried out three months after the last test to allow time for cells to grow back.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that there are two matters and I want to be clear on them.  As I indicated, Quest Diagnostics has advised of an issue related to a number of human papillomavirus, HPV, tests carried out outside of the manufacturer's recommended timeframe of 30 days.  The HSE advises that, subject to final confirmation, approximately 4,600 women will require a retest - the original estimate was 6,000 - and that the vast majority of letters to the women concerned have now issued.  The clinical risk is deemed to be exceedingly low.  I know that is a message all of us and patient advocates will want to get out.  The two separate issues are the backlog, with 550 women recalled for repeat smear tests through their GP, and HPV testing, which has resulted in 4,600 women being recalled on a precautionary basis for a retest, despite the clinical risk being exceedingly low.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500029#BB00600"><p>The Minister has said the Chief Medical Officer advised him to offer reassurance, but was he advised to offer repeat free smear tests to every woman in the country who wanted one?  Was that the clinical advice given to the Minister?  My information is that he was advised this would put additional stress on the system, that the capacity was not available and that he was repeatedly advised, month on month, to end the free smear tests because the backlog had started to build.  There has been an attempt to muddy the waters with references to tests in 2015 that had expired.  The focus is on the additional tests that took place from May to December last year, with 80,000 to 100,000 additional and unscheduled smear tests putting extra pressure on the system.  We do not know the clinical impact of that decision and the delays.  When will the backlog be cleared?  When a woman presents for a smear test today - she may have high-grade or low-grade changes - her test will not be read for six months.  If there is an interpretation of a smear slide that there are low-grade changes, the second part of the test - the HPV element - is necessary to decide if a colposcopy is required.   The impact of a delay meant that women were not reassured, but rather there was additional panic and anxiety because of the lack of results.  The six-month waiting time is an average and the wait is beyond six months for some women.  As the Minister has said not all women have yet been notified, is he saying some of the 4,600 women in question are waiting for a letter?  Another impact is delayed referral for a colposcopy and potentially delayed treatment.  When will the backlog be cleared and has everyone in question been contacted?</p></speech>

I ask her or her party leader to clarify who advised me to do that.  I have told her in this House that I worked hand in glove with the officials in my Department, including the Chief Medical Officer, at a very intense time.  I could reference some of the calls made by the Deputy's party colleagues who sought free repeat smear tests to be provided, but I will not.  They were making such calls for good reason, with members of my party and Members across the House.  It was one of the primary queries coming to the helpline.  I took the decision, but I did so with bipartisan support across the House.  GPs spoke about the importance of being able to provide a repeat smear test without being worried about whether a woman could afford it if she sat in front of them looking for it.</p>  <p>  As I indicated to Deputy Kelly in response to his similar question, the clinical advice given to me by the HSE is that the risk is very low, although I do not in any way suggest waiting does not cause worry and stress.  On the specifics of HPV testing, there were 4,600 women who would require a retest on a precautionary basis, despite the clinical risk being exceedingly low.  My briefing tells me that the vast majority of letters to the women concerned have been issued, but I will get the Deputy a very specific figure.</p></speech>

Why have some women in the group of 4,600 not yet been notified three months on?  When will the backlog be cleared?  If a woman presents for a smear test today, when will she receive her results?  My understanding is that, with current capacity, it will take in excess of one year to clear the backlog.  Will the Minister update the House on how he is getting on in securing extra capacity and resources, as it is my understanding he is finding it difficult to source the extra capacity?  Why are we still waiting to inform some of the women, as the Minister knew about this last November?  When will the backlog be cleared?  What is the update on increasing capacity and resources?</p></speech>

I did not know about this last November; I knew on 5 December that there was a potential issue highlighted by Quest Diagnostics that might or might not have required action, and that work was being done in that regard.  I understand that only as recently as this week did my Department finally receive the report from the HSE as it was a major body of work to, first, ascertain the exact women who needed to be recalled and if there was a need for the precautionary retest to take place.  I have been informed that there are 4,600 women who will need to be offered a retest as a precautionary measure arising from better quality assurance resulting from Dr. Scally's report.  I will check how many are outstanding and revert to the Deputy directly as, truthfully, I do not know the number.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is entirely correct that we are finding it extraordinarily challenging to find additional capacity because there is a cytology shortage globally.  The Deputy will accept that it is not an issue of writing a cheque or providing more funding.  The HSE - particularly Mr. Damien McCallion - is working extraordinarily hard and due to provide me with a capacity report in the coming weeks that I will be happy to share with the Oireachtas and relevant committees.  The HSE is working extremely hard in trying to find additional capacity which is vital to clear the backlog.</p></speech>

Currently, the average waiting time is 22 weeks, which is far too long for women, for whom I understand it is causing significant concern.  I want to see it reduced.  Extra capacity is key in that regard.  I should point out that not all of the backlog is due to repeat smear tests as other women entered the screening programme for the first time who had never been involved with it.  That is, of course, good.</p></speech>

In the past four years we have seen sustained investment in these services, with a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget, which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million this year.</p><p>The HSE's national service plan provides for a target of almost 18 million home support hours to be provided to 53,182 people.  This represents an increase of 800,000 hours and home support for 2,682 more people over last year's target.  In addition, 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  Despite this significant level of service provision, demand continues to rise.</p> <p> While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people throughout the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of people.  That is why we propose to establish a statutory scheme for home support which will improve access to the service and put it on an affordable and sustainable basis, while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence.  This is a significant and complex undertaking, and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy commits to the introduction of the statutory scheme in 2021.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the increase in figures he has outlined.  It is fair to say that last year was problematic.  It is an indication that we have an ageing population that is growing.  Most public representatives would have had an increased number of people presenting at their offices looking for support.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has indicated that there will be home support services for 53,000 people.  Last year the budget was for 50,500.  Most times we asked questions, there were 52,000 to 52,500 people in receipt of service.  At the same time, there were 6,000 to 7,000 on a waiting list.  If the 52,500 is added to 6,500, there were 59,000 people looking for home support services at any given time.  Making a service for 53,000 available does not seem sufficient to meet current need.  Will the Minister of State look at that in the context of the constant demand last year, where hours were being recycled or diminished, and in the context of the problem for elderly people in hospital in particular where they are trying to come home and that demand is not being met by the number of hours being made available?</p></speech>

We do not have an infinite budget and there are many competing demands that we discuss all day every day on the floor of this House such as more pay for the nurses, the drugs we want approved and so on.  There are so many competing budgets, and this is just one more cog in that wheel, but &euro;140 million over a four-year period is a very significant increase by any standard.  It has allowed for an increase of 800,000 home help hours this year.  I can categorically and regrettably state that we will not meet the demand for home help this year.  There is no point in my pretending to dress that up in any way.  I am sure the Deputy and I will have this conversation again during this year and that we will debate it many times during Leaders' Questions, but we have a finite budget and, as in all the other areas, the demands are increasing.  That is why we have undertaken to do a statutory home care scheme where we can provide to everybody.  That is our ambition for 2021 and significant work has been done, even by the Health Research Board, looking at Germany, Sweden, Scotland the Netherlands where they have similar schemes in operation.  We are trying to build a scheme along those lines.  That is complex challenge.</p></speech>

In that regard we need to consider how things are done.  For somebody who on a delayed discharge from hospital, there is an opportunity cost.  When I asked a parliamentary question and got a response from the HSE, I was told that the number of direct employees of the HSE providing home services is reducing.  The dependency on agencies to provide this type of service is increasing.  Does the Minister of State believe that is the best value for money rather than having direct employees?  Is there scope to examine that and increase capacity?</p>  <p>  Something peculiar has been going on in my area, which falls under community healthcare organisation, CHO 7, that needs to be addressed.  In March 2018, there were 724 people waiting for home support services, but by August that figure had gone up by over 50% to more than 1,100 people.  That is out of kilter with all of the other figures.  I do not expect the Minister of State to have the response here but I would like him to consider it directly.  In terms of cost saving, will an analysis be done between using agency staff with a diminishing number of HSE direct employees, which had been the previous model?  Would that be a way to provide additional hours?</p></speech>

While I have not focused on managing the existing system, neither have I directed many officials to spend time on that.  I could start tinkering around the edges of the existing system, but there are problems with training and regulation, supply and the postcode lotteries, as they are referred to.  There are myriad challenges in the existing system.  I have taken the political decision to move away from that and develop, from the ground up, a new system that is fit for purpose and that will address many of these issues collectively.</p>  <p>  I will certainly look into the disparity in the Deputy's area that he asked about.  It seems unusual for it to jump by 50%, particularly in those months.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has asked me to chair an implementation body on delayed discharges, so that is an area in which I have a particular interest.  I absolutely accept the financial point the Deputy makes that we can be penny wise and pound foolish, but there is a cost basis to this and we will be considering that.  I will focus keenly on that with a view to tackling the issue of delayed discharges in the acute hospital system, because I have responsibility for the home care service.  I will come back to the Deputy about his local query.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.459.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500030#CC00800"><p>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this matter.  It is quite timely because improving access to hospital appointments and procedures is a key commitment of Government and of hers.  As a result of some of the work we have done together in recent budgets I hope to publish the joint Department of Health, HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, scheduled care access plan 2019 shortly.  This will set out commitments aimed at improving access for patients waiting for hospital operations or procedures.  We have made a lot of progress on that side over recent months and years.  It will also set out commitments for patients waiting this year for a first outpatient appointment, in keeping with the HSE national service plan and the increased funding totalling &euro;75 million given to the NTPF this year.</p>  <p>  Access to outpatient services remains a significant challenge although we have seen significant reductions in the number of people waiting for an operation or procedure, but outpatients remain the big challenge.  That is what we need to focus on.  In 2019, more than 3.3 million patients will attend HSE outpatient clinics while the NTPF will fund an additional 40,000 first outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The outpatient waiting list figures for the end of December for University Hospital Galway show that there were more than 39,000 patients waiting for a first appointment, 71% of whom were waiting 12 months or less.  These numbers are still far too high.  There has been some stabilisation of the waiting list compared with December 2017.</p>  <p>  Last year I met the CEOs of all hospital groups, including the Saolta hospital group, which has responsibility for Galway, and asked them to come up with outpatient initiatives, including the use of virtual clinics to address outpatient waiting lists so that we can fund new initiatives this year.  Some progress has been made by the Saolta hospital group as a result of new initiatives, including an 11% reduction in the number of patients waiting in excess of nine months for an ear, nose and throat, ENT, appointment, a 30% reduction in those waiting over nine months for a rheumatology appointment, and a 42% reduction in the number of children waiting more than nine months for a paediatrics appointment.  The Deputy's question is timely because we are finalising the outpatients plan, and in light of her raising this issue, I will specifically and personally consider the issues at University Hospital Galway and make sure that Saolta is bringing forward plans to benefit from the additional outpatient funding available in 2019.</p></reply>

There are long waiting lists of 12 months or more in many outpatient departments: urology, orthopaedics, paediatrics, plastic surgery, respiratory, dermatology and gynaecology.  This comes up daily in my clinic as people try to get their first appointment.  People are very frustrated.  If the Minister could link with, and make a priority of, the Saolta group, we could put pressure on to ensure this is not put on the long finger but is delivered as quickly as possible.  That would bring great comfort to many in the west.  The hospital is a centre of excellence.  It is a level four hospital and covers Donegal, Roscommon and Mayo as well as Galway.  It is vital that the NTPF considers the outpatients department as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I assure her that we will do that.  I will take the opportunity to put some of the new measures to deal with outpatient waiting lists that are being tried in the University Hospital Galway on the record of the House.  There is a urology pathway pilot scheme which should result in significant progress on wait times.  The plastic surgery service in Galway has been running an innovative "see and treat" clinic.  This involves patients attending outpatient appointments and, where a minor surgical intervention is required, receiving it on the same day.  Approximately 220 patients were treated in this way last year.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, agreed to fund this initiative from September 2018 onward, with an additional 143 patients accessing the service.  Galway University Hospital has also put in place virtual clinics for ear, nose and throat, ENT, and vascular services.  This is only appropriate for certain conditions, but should result in an improvement.</p>  <p>  We have an issue with patients not attending and the hospital is working on this.  Some 8,494 new patients and 28,689 review patients did not turn up for their appointments in Galway University Hospital in 2018.  I am not blaming the patients but these figures show that there is a need to maximise attendance.  The hospital is looking at a text reminder service and at overbooking clinics so that, if some people do not turn up, another patient will be waiting to be seen.  Saolta is going to continue to work on that.  I will certainly reflect on the Deputy's comments.  We will make sure that Saolta and Galway benefit from the additional resources we have in place for outpatients and inpatients for 2019.</p></speech>

Perhaps he can come at it again.  This is an ongoing issue.  Patients have to go to Limerick or Dublin for some services.  It is an ongoing outpatient issue.  Perhaps it is due to hospital appointments or something like that - I do not know - but this issue, which affects children, is often raised in my office.  I welcome the fact that progress is being made in the area of ENT services.  Issues with the ears, nose and throat can affect everyone from the very young to older adults.  Everything the Minister has said today is welcome, but action on delivery is what we are really looking for.  The results will only be known when the figures come to hand.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500031#DD00800"><p>The electoral boundary committee was established by the Minister of State on 13 December 2017.  It was provided with its terms of reference, which were set out.  Its report on 13 June 2013 set out the boundaries in a clear and independent manner.  A boundary committee is an independent body charged with setting out the boundaries for elections.  For clarity, section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991 provides that "A boundary committee shall be independent in the performance of its functions."  Under section 32(2), the Act states: "The committee shall if so requested prepare and furnish to the Minister a report in writing which shall include its recommendations".  This was done.  The Act goes on to say "the Minister shall publish the report and shall have regard to it".  The word "regard" is not meaningless.</p>  <p>  The committee very helpfully pointed out by way of additional background that the last such local electoral area boundary committee was established in November 2012.  It reported on 29 May 2013, 12 months in advance of the 2014 local elections.  The recommendations of the report of that committee were accepted in full by the then Minister and statutory instruments giving them effect were made.</p>  <p>  On 11 January the Minister of State signed a statutory instrument in which he deliberately changed the boundaries recommended by the independent boundary committee for County Wexford in respect of the upcoming local elections.  This has created farcical situations in County Wexford.  For example, people from Oilgate, some of whom live only 4 km from Wexford town, will now have to drive 40 miles north, through Enniscorthy, to attend civic offices in Gorey for help.  People who only live 1.5 miles south of Enniscorthy town, who vote in the town, and who consider themselves to live in its suburbs are now being told that they are Gorey people.  They now have to go to Gorey rather than to the town where they do their shopping, where their families live, where their kids go to school and where they have spent their entire lives.</p>  <p>  Why did the Minister of State make these changes?  Why did he take the electoral area of Kilmuckridge, which an independent boundary committee recommended be an electoral area of Enniscorthy municipal district, and attach it to Gorey?  The committee was made up of experts and it spent time considering this.  I have no doubt that the committee wanted Gorey to have ten councillors, but it certainly would not have done it in this way.  The committee took the areas of Ferns and Kilbora out of the Gorey municipal district and put them into that of Enniscorthy.  These areas are halfway along the road between Enniscorthy and Gorey towns.  I have no doubt that if the committee wanted Gorey to have ten councillors, it would have left Ferns in Gorey.  It certainly would not have done it this way.</p>  <p>  I cannot express the level of disbelief and anger felt by people, especially people in the south of Kilmuckridge municipal district.  Glenbrien is pretty much a suburb of Enniscorthy.  The people of Glenbrien were bemused when I was out there two weeks ago trying to explain to them that they are now Gorey people.  The people in Oilgate are just laughing at the idea that they are part of a town they have no connections to.  There might have been some rationale for Oilgate to be put into Wexford town, because parts of it are closer to Wexford town, but most people in Oilgate do their business in Enniscorthy.  Putting Oilgate into Gorey, however, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.</p>  <p>  I want a clear explanation as to why the Minister of State did this, because it was a personal request of his rather than a recommendation of the Department.  I am curious as to why he sought this change.</p></speech>

The report conducted by one of the committees in respect of municipal districts recommended changes to nine or ten areas that were in conflict with stated Government policy.</p>  <p>  Changes to local electoral area boundaries may only be carried out following the completion of a review by an independent boundary committee.  As Deputy Browne pointed out, these committees are established under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991.  The Act states that the Minister must have regard to the report of a boundary committee before deciding on whether to make an order amending local electoral areas.  The key phrase there is "local electoral areas".  In this case I set out the terms of reference for the boundary committee myself.  Section 28 deals exclusively with local electoral areas.  In this instance the reports of both committees in respect of local electoral areas were adopted in full.  I established two independent groups, committee No. 1 and committee No. 2, in December 2017 to review and make recommendations on local electoral areas having regard to, among other things, the results of the census of 2016 as well as the commitment to consider reducing the size of territorially large local electoral areas and to ensure adequate levels of representation for towns and urban centres.</p>  <p>  Concerns had been raised by a number of local authority members across different areas and by the Association of Irish Local Government about the territorial size and configuration of some of the local electoral areas specified following the last boundary review.  The demands on councillors in territorially large areas are greater than those on councillors in more compact areas, even when member to population ratios are broadly similar.  This can arise due to distance, travel time and the difficulty in keeping abreast of local issues.  A further concern which had been raised was the perceived loss of focus on some of the large urban centres by virtue of their inclusion in territorially large local electoral areas.</p><p> A further concern raised is the perceived loss of focus on some large urban centres by virtue of their inclusion in territorially large local electoral areas.  The report on local government, Municipal Governance - Districts, Towns and Local Electoral Areas, submitted to the Government last year, builds on these concerns and makes several recommendations, including a distinct municipal district to be designated for each of the former boroughs and towns with a population of 30,000 or more within the relevant county, each with a minimum of five members and one or more local electoral areas; and distinct town based or urban electoral areas to be created specifically for the 24 largest urban centres with a population of 15,000 or more.</p> <p> In the case of Wexford, the commitment to consider reducing the size of territorially large electoral areas, together with the requirement to assign no more than seven councillors to each electoral area, has led to the recommendations in the report that would see the creation of six local electoral areas, LEAs, formed, with a focus on the centres of Enniscorthy, Gorey, Kilmore, Kilmuckridge, New Ross and Wexford.  The recommendations made in the local electoral area boundary committee reports in respect of LEAs were accepted in full.  This is reflected in the statutory instruments which I signed on 19 December 2018.  The overall policy objectives have, in the main, been met, particularly in respect of the creation of distinct town based or urban electoral areas for large urban areas with a population in excess of 15,000.</p> <p> In respect of the Gorey-Kilmuckridge issue, it is an area that I do not know as well as the Deputy.  Geographically, more than half of what is now the Kilmuckridge electoral area was previously in the Gorey district.  The view was taken that the east coast part of Wexford was more associated with Gorey than with any other town in County Wexford.  I have today written to the chairman of Wexford County Council asking for consideration to be given by him and the members and executive of the council to changing the statutory instrument if there is a recommendation that it be changed.  We were limited in respect of the boundary review that the old Enniscorthy area of eight seats and the old Gorey area of eight seats meant that there had to be changes in the district.  I emphasise that the local electoral area as drawn up by the committee has not been changed by this.  It is an administrative issue and if Wexford County Council believes there is an economic, social or political reason it should be reversed, I am more than open to considering it.</p></speech>

He might clarify whether he is talking about the county manager or the councillors making that decision.  We did have a freedom of information request and it was clear that it had come from the Minister of State as opposed to anybody within the Department.  We still have had no reason or explanation as to why he made the recommendation that Kilmuckridge be taken from the Enniscorthy municipal district as recommended by an independent boundary committee and that it was suddenly whipped into the Gorey area.  We talk about town centres being the focus, yet we have an area one mile and a half south of Enniscorthy bridge that is now part of Gorey which is 35 km further north.  People's minds there are completely boggled by it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will understand people are asking questions.  The independence and integrity of the electoral system are sacrosanct.  On this island we have a very murky past in boundaries being changed for political reasons and I certainly hope that was not the case in this instance.  At the same time, no explanation or reason has been given for this almost random decision.  I assure the Minister of State that the idea of a contiguous coastline is flawed.  Only a little further south, the eastern coastline was split into two separate municipal districts against the recommendation of the municipal district.  There is an explanation for it in terms of Wexford being a stand-alone town, but Enniscorthy is the second biggest town in the county.  It has a population of 12,000 and an historical town, with ties to the events of 1798 and 1916 and the first unfurling of the tricolour, although we share it with Waterford.  I cannot describe the outrage felt there.  There were mistakes.  What we wanted in Wexford, the ideal that was working perfectly well, was three eights and a ten, but the independent boundary commission made its decision for its reasons.  However, it was totally unacceptable for it to have been changed after that.</p></speech>

More than half of the new Kilmuckridge area was previously in the Gorey district and there have been nine or ten changes to municipal districts across the country.  Most of them are in respect of former boroughs, but, for instance, in County Kerry the Castleisland area and the Dingle area have been brought into one municipal district because of geographical factors similar to what was considered in Wexford.  I am not disputing my role in ensuring we will have municipal districts that, rightly or wrongly, are more reflective of the lie of the land.  The Deputy will know the villages and towns that anyone could list off in the northern part of the Kilmuckridge area that are far closer to Gorey.  The process is that if there are strong reasons for a change in Wexford, I will have no difficulty in accepting them.  However, I absolutely refute and believe it is disingenuous of the Deputy to bring into the House the argument about the independence of the electoral committee.  We are not talking about an electoral boundary.  The local electoral areas report was adopted in full.  This is an administrative linking of two separate local electoral areas, whether it be Gorey and Kilmuckridge or Enniscorthy and Kilmuckridge.  The independence of the committee's actions and the preserving of people's support for the independence of the committee's report should not be called into question.  As I said, we are not talking about an electoral boundary.  Any murky past about electoral boundaries, Tullymandering and everything else that happened has no bearing on this issue.  It is about administering County Wexford.  More than half of the new Kilmuckridge district was previously in the Gorey area.  That is from where the decision came.  That east coast part of Wexford, north of the town, is more associated with Gorey than any other town in County Wexford.  If the Wexford local authority and its members and management have a strong view that it should be changed, it will be.  I reiterate that the report of the committee on the electoral areas was adopted in full.</p></speech>

By and large, it works pretty well.  It sees sixth class students list nine schools in order of their preference and they are usually offered a place in one of these schools.  I understand the system is unique to Limerick and tries to do away with the class-based issues that unfortunately still arise, particularly in the city.  However, it clearly does not work for everyone.  Every applicant has to list nine schools in order of preference.  Often, many of the nine schools included in the application will be totally unsuitable due to their location or other reasons, but pupils still have to list nine schools.  </p>  <p>  One family got in touch with me last week in a highly distressed state about the situation in which they found themselves.  The child in question had submitted his application for a secondary school place like all of his friends, but last Wednesday he received a total of nine rejection letters from all of the schools included in his application form.  I have copies of the letters before me and can count them from one to nine.  He also received a letter telling him that there was no place for him in any of the schools and asking him to apply to two schools he had not put on his list which were not in the area.  One is 30 km away and the other 27.  He was the only child in his class who did not receive a school place acceptance letter.  He was very distraught and did not know what to tell his friends when they asked him what school place he had received.  He could not answer because he had been offered no school place.  The Minister must imagine a 12 year old child receiving nine rejection letters and no offer of a school place.</p><p>His mother, as one can imagine, was really upset and distressed about it and did not know what to tell her son.  They also received a letter which was very distressing to them from the Limerick Education Centre which referred to their "son-ward", meaning ward of court.  That is totally unacceptable; it added to the family's stress.  It is simply not acceptable and I ask that the Minister contacts the Limerick Education Centre directly to ensure that no letters using the word "ward" are sent to families to which that word does not apply.</p> <p> The rejection letters received included the child's first choice school, which his family can literally see from the front door of his house.  I know that well, because I know the family and know exactly where they live and I know the school in question.  The primary school he attends is a feeder school of that school, so he should not have been refused.  No young child should ever get nine rejection letters and no offer of a place and be left to search frantically for a solution.</p> <p> I am raising this Topical Issue in the hope that changes will be made to ensure that this will not happen again.  It is a problem that students have to put down nine schools in the first place: some of these schools are 30 to 40 minutes outside of Limerick city.  If a child is offered a place in one of those schools he or she will have major difficulties in getting to and from the schools.  It places a burden on parents who have to get their children out and back to those schools while trying to go to work themselves.  I have been working closely with the family and the child's primary school.  Both were very anxious that this be brought to the attention of the Minister as soon as possible.  I hope that something can be done for this child and his family to ensure that he can access one of the schools he has chosen.  I appreciate that not every child will be accepted into his or her first choice school, but to receive nine rejection letters and no offer of a place in secondary school is disgraceful and should never be allowed to happen again.</p> <p> To clarify, I do not want to see the system abolished.  It was brought in for good reason and usually it works well.  However, something has to be done to ensure this does not happen again.  No child should experience this ever again.  Can the Minister clarify if he is aware of these issues in the system and outline what he can do to ensure that something like this does not happen again?</p></speech>

I appreciate that and I am happy to take their details from Deputy Quinlivan later and follow up directly on this matter.  I want to give a little bit of background on the system, for the record.  Overall it is a very good system and I agree with the Deputy on its overall benefits and co-ordination.  However, we are open to improving it.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position in relation to the common application system, CAS, for children entering secondary school in Limerick.  The Deputy will be aware that a CAS was agreed between the post-primary schools in the Limerick area.  This system has been in place since 2005.  The CAS is the process by which the admission process for sixth class primary school children wishing to enrol in the participating post-primary schools is managed locally.  There are currently 17 post-primary schools participating in the system.  This administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to the enrolment processes of the schools in the area.</p>  <p>  This system is facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre on behalf of the Limerick Principals and Deputy Principals&rsquo; Association with support from my Department and to date has been working very well.  The Limerick Education Centre meets with the Limerick Principals and Deputy Principals Association twice annually to review the system.  On average, the centre manages between 1,750 and 1,900 applications annually and liaises with 17 post-primary schools and over 140 primary schools.  Data from the system indicates that 97.5% of children received their first, second or third choice of school for the 2019-20 school year.  Over 95% of pupils received their first choice.</p>  <p>  Whilst this administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to enrolment processes in the area, each school authority involved in the Limerick CAS has, in accordance with the Education Act 1998, autonomy in relation to its own enrolment policy and the specific selection criteria it applies.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.</p>  <p>  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Education and Training Board, ETB, school to the ETB in the first instance, where a board of management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the board, refuses to enrol a student in a school.  An appeal should be made within 42 calendar days of receipt of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This appeals process is also available to any applicant using the Limerick CAS who has been refused enrolment to a school.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act was signed into law in 2018.  The Act, on commencement of the relevant sections, will require schools to enrol a child where the school has places.  The Act will help to support the admission processes in schools and provide greater transparency, which will help parents with their understanding of how they will work.  My Department has begun the process of consultation with the education partners on the regulations that will be put in place alongside the commencement of sections of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p></speech>

I am almost sure that the system is unique to Limerick and that no similar schools application system operates in other parts of the country, but if they do perhaps those systems should be investigated as well.  I agree that the system works pretty well, but I am concerned that another child next year might receive nine rejection letters.  That should not happen.  It is important that the Minister's Department engages with the Limerick Education Centre to ensure it has the resources it requires to administer the CAS, and perhaps the Department can help to iron out these problems.</p>  <p>  Finishing primary school and going into secondary school should be an exciting time for children.  It should not be as stressful as it has been for this child.  The outcome of this must be that no child gets nine rejection letters and is subsequently left frantically searching for somewhere to go for secondary school.  I thank the Minister again for coming here to listen to the concerns of parents and schools in Limerick.  I hope he can introduce some of the small changes required to ensure this does not happen again.</p></speech>

The transition from primary school to secondary school is hard enough in itself.  It is a big step up and receiving nine letters of rejection is not in keeping with the idea of a smooth flow from primary to secondary level.  I reassure the Deputy that once I receive the details I will follow up directly with my officials.  The Deputy mentioned the uniqueness of this system.  From my own research into it I can see that it is an incredible system, where 17 post-primary schools and 140 primary schools are co-ordinated in an attempt to get the correct fit for pupils.  The percentage returns, where 95% of students get their first choice, is incredible.  We must also be careful that the 4%, 5% or 1%, even if it is only one person, is catered for.  Perhaps with further inspection we can find a way through this issue.  I am confident we can do that.</p></speech>

Tens of thousands of people consume these products weekly.  The directive defines foodstuffs as those products "the purpose of which is to supplement the normal diet and which are concentrated sources of nutrients or other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, alone or in combination, marketed in dose form" and so on.</p>  <p>  Let us consider what is happening in England.  In 2016 the actual amount of food supplements sold in the United Kingdom was almost &euro;700 million.  It is estimated that one person in every three in the United Kingdom takes a food supplement weekly.  In Ireland the sector is worth approximately &euro;60 million per year.  The Minister of State can correct me on the matter, if necessary.  Tens of thousands of people take supplements.</p>  <p>  Many people have come to my office recently.  In many cases they are older people, people on pensions or who are in reasonably good health but who are concerned.  In many cases they believe, or their doctors or chemists will say, additives such as glucose for joint health, probiotics to help the digestive system or fish oil for good health are useful and beneficial.  They believe the proposal by Revenue to increase taxes on all of these products from 1 March by 23% is an imposition that is unacceptable, given their income and health needs.  The people who come to me are elderly or have limited income.  They are concerned that they will be unable to take the supplement they have been taking for the past ten, 15 or 20 years.  That is at the core of the problem.</p>  <p>  I do not have the figures, but I am told that the tax take proposed could be approximately &euro;8 million per annum.  That may be what the taxpayer will get out of it.  However, it will have the effect of discommoding elderly people, women who are pregnant and parents with young children and it is not good enough for them.  I have read the Food Safety Authority advice on vitamins and supplements and what the authority states is clear.  I am not going to second-guess it on medical advice.  Nevertheless, it is of crucial importance that the existing arrangements continue.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that if there is a hard Brexit, these products will increase in cost and be more difficult to obtain.  That will drive more and more people towards the online business.  People buying online from such places as Guernsey in the Channel Islands will be buying products that are unregulated, of unknown composition and with unknown health affects.  There are no ethics involved in an online sale of these products, whereas in the sector in Ireland which employs over 1,800 people nationally, there is a code of ethics.  It is entirely acceptable for a person to go from his or her doctor to his or her health food shop to buy the nutrient supplement that will be of benefit to him or her.  It is entirely unacceptable that we will drive the people concerned into an unregulated market to buy products, especially if they do not know what they will be consuming.  It is important for the Minister for Finance to consult business and other interest groups, as well as health bodies, and report back to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

However, there is a Revenue concession that allows the zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplement such as vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  The practice of zero-rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT in November 1972.  At the time, the marketplace for food supplements was small and the concession meant that vitamins, minerals and fish oil supplements were treated the same as food for VAT purposes.</p>  <p>  Since the 1970s there has been significant growth in the number and complexity of food supplement products on the market, most of which are not covered by the zero-rate concession.  They include supplements containing botanicals and bioactive substances.  While the new products apply at the standard rate of VAT, the growing variety of products in the market led to diverging views between Revenue and the industry on which food supplement should be at the zero rate versus the 23% rate.  Revenue issued e-briefs in 2011 and 2013 in an effort to clarify that only basic vitamins, minerals and fish oil would qualify for the zero rate, but disagreement on the applicable VAT rate and queries on specific products has continued.  The operation of the current concession has become problematic owing to efforts by some businesses in the industry to exploit the concession to extend zero-rating beyond the scope permitted by Revenue.  These businesses have challenged the Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products, giving rise to serious concern about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  The issue was raised during debates on last year's Finance Bill.  Deputies and Senators looked for clarity for the industry on the VAT treatment of food supplements and sought the retention of the zero rate for certain categories of food supplements.  On Committee Stage the Minister agreed to ask his officials to address the matter in the context of the next tax strategy group and also stated he would not interfere in any decision made by Revenue on the matter in the interim.  Revenue published new guidance on 27 December on the rate of VAT that applied to food supplements, announcing the intention to apply the 23% VAT rate to most food supplements with effect from 1 March 2019.  It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  It is possible to retain these products at the zero rate because they qualify as oral medicines which are charged to VAT at the zero rate in Ireland under an historical derogation from EU VAT law.  In addition, infant foods and food products such as yoghurts that contain probiotic ingredients will also continue to be zero-rated.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of the industry on this matter.  That is why, independent of Revenue's decisions on interpretation, the Minister agreed to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 tax strategy group paper to examine some of the policy choices in the VAT treatment of food supplements.</p></speech>

He has said the Minister for Finance understands the concerns of the industry on the matter, as well as the concerns of the public and those who consume these products weekly and daily.  It is welcome that he has agreed to put in place a process that will ensure the 2019 tax strategy group paper will examine some of the policy choices in the VAT treatment of food supplements.  Does the Minister intend to delay the introduction of VAT from 1 March unless the tax strategy group reports in the interim?  It is important that the Minister reconsider a decision to commence the increase on food additives from 1 March.  It would genuinely, truthfully and honestly help many people, including those people who come into my office and that of the Minister of State.  Are we to tell them that they will have to pay it?  They may say their health is bad or that they have a problem with arthritis.  It means a great deal to people that their disposable income has been preserved.  It is particularly important for pensioners not have to pay the additional increase in VAT.  The experience in other countries such as the United Kingdom and the unregulated access on the Internet to products that are not defined raise questions.  Such products could very well harm the individuals concerned or certainly do them no good.  Obviously, that is not what we want to see happen.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to take on board the views of the people who talk to him and me.  The tax strategy group paper should be published and the Minister should decide on how he intends to act before he introduces this high VAT rate.</p></speech>

However, I will relay the Deputy's concern to the Minister when I meet him tomorrow.</p> <p> I have met representatives from the health food sector.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe and I will give the sector a very fair hearing.  However, there is a challenge created by the hundreds of food supplement products on the market.  For some of these, the correct rate of VAT is 23% and others are zero rated.  This is unhelpful.  As the e-note from Revenue states, products which were zero rated for VAT in 2011 and 2013 will remain at zero rated, however some products are VAT chargeable due to European VAT law.  The challenges to continue rating all these products at zero percent is not helpful.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, gave an undertaking that the tax strategy group would consider the matter, which it will, and the Minister and I will give the matter a fair hearing. </p></speech>

This was part of the UN peacekeeping operation in the province of Katanga which had broken away from the rest of the Congo and had declared independence.</p>  <p>  A Company, consisting of 155 men, were sent to the UN post at Jadotville, 80 miles from Elizabethville, on 3 September 1961.  On 9 September, a large force of Kantangese gendarmes surrounded them and early on the morning of 13 September A Company came under attack and endured almost continuous attack until 17 September.  During this battle 3,500 enemy soldiers were in action against the 155 Irish troops.  The Irish troops, who had never been in battle before, were pitted against a well-trained enemy that had greater firepower, heavier artillery weapons and led by mercenary officers who had fought in the Second World War and the Korean War.  The average age of the Irish troops was 18.5 years.  Two of the men were 15 years old and approximately 12 of them were 16 years old.  At the end of the battle the Irish Company suffered five wounded while the enemy had 300 dead and 750 wounded.  A Company ran out of food, water and ammunition and they were taken into captivity on 17 September and remained so until their release on 25 October 1961.</p>  <p>  Arising from this battle, Commandant Pat Quinlan recommended 29 of his men for distinguished service medals and military medals for gallantry.  Last week a parliamentary question was tabled by 14 Deputies including myself calling on the Taoiseach and Minister for Defence to explain the reason why these medals committed to previously, have not been presented.  I hope we can bring this matter to its logical and fair conclusion.  Veterans and their families have been fighting for closure for nearly 60 years.  Deceased veterans who were recommended for awards should receive their medals posthumously.</p>  <p>  The medal insignia that is linked with the unit citation does not bring closure to the issue, nor does the issuing of the Jadotville Medal by the Department of Defence in December 2017 to all veterans and next of kin of deceased veterans.  The Jadotville Medal cannot be compared to the military medal for gallantry or the distinguished service medal, as recommended by Commandant Pat Quinlan.</p>  <p>  The Jadotville action is recognised worldwide and one of the best perimeter defensive battles in history and is the single biggest military engagement the Irish Army has been involved in alone against a foreign enemy since the formation of the State.</p>  <p>  Presentations on this battle have been given by Commandant Leo Quinlan, son of Commandant Pat Quinlan, and campaigner for the award of these medaIs.  A unit citation was awarded to A Company in September 2016.  This made history as it is the first and only unit citation to be awarded in the Irish Army.  As in other armies a unit citation is something that is recorded in military history and each member of the unit then receives a medal insignia that he or she can wear on his uniform.</p>  <p>  However, the medals that Commandant Pat Quinlan recommended for his men for bravery in action have yet to be awarded.  In 2017 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met Commandant Leo Quinlan and some of the Jadotville veterans in Leinster House.  He was briefed on exactly what medals were being requested and on his last day as Taoiseach he announced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that medals will be awarded for Jadotville.</p>  <p>  An official Army list of all the Jadotville soldiers who were recommended for medals was recently provided to Commandant Leo Quinlan.  Five men were recommended for the military medal for gallantry as well as the distinguished service medal, that is two awards each.  Another 27 men were also recommended for the distinguished service medal.  This means a total of 32 men were recommended for awards arising from their bravery, courage and service in Jadotville.</p>  <p>  None of the men recommended for the Jadotville action received their awards.  Currently seven of these men are still alive and living in Ireland.  A number of them were totally unaware that they had been recommended for awards until recently.  In fact many men passed away without knowing that they had been recommended for awards for bravery in action.</p>  <p>  The Army has recently stated that as the Statute of Limitations has passed in relation to the award of medals.  Therefore it is down to the Taoiseach and Minister of State to take action on this matter.</p></speech>

The siege of Jadotville was a prominent event that occurred during Ireland&rsquo;s peacekeeping mission in the Congo in September 1961.  A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3 September 1961.  On 9 September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of 13 September A Company came under attack.  From 13 to 17 September they endured almost continuous attack.  They were taken into captivity on 17 September and remained in captivity until finally released on 25 October 1961.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations, the award of medals for bravery is time bound.  They may not be awarded, in any case, unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff not later than two years in the case of the military medal for gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the distinguished service medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made.  Such awards are made on the recommendation of a military board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted medals board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff.  He forwarded the letter to the original medals board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision.  The board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of A Company.  All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.</p>  <p>  The issue of honouring the actions of these men has been revisited a number of times over the years and steps have been taken to recognise their bravery.  In 2004 the then Minister for Defence initiated a re-examination of the Jadotville case on foot of a request from a retired Army officer.  The resulting report was prepared by a board of military officers who fully exonerated the actions of A Company.  The board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.  In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of A Company, and of the 35th Battalion as a whole, to the UN peace support mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include a presentation of scrolls to them in 2006 by the then Minister of State for Defence, Deputy Noel Tracey.  Subsequently, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, directed that portraits of Lieutenant Colonel McNamee, 35th Battalion Commander, and Commandant Quinlan, Company Commander A Company, be commissioned.  On 23 February 2007 these portraits were unveiled at the Military College and now hang in the Congo Room in the United Nations Training School in the Curragh.</p><p>In July 2010, the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  A Congo photographic book was also produced for the occasion, a section of which was dedicated to the events at Jadotville in 1961.</p> <p> A nominal roll of A Company, printed in copper, has been affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a unit citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of A Company.  This was the first time a unit citation had been awarded to individuals within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to recognise the brave actions of these men formally.  Furthermore, the Government committed on 13 June 2017, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as An Bonn Jadotville, or the Jadotville Medal, to each member of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion, and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the siege of Jadotville.  This specially commissioned medal was procured to give full and due recognition in honour of the courageous actions of these men during the siege.  The words inscribed on the medals were carefully chosen to pay tribute to their actions.  I was delighted to present the medals at a ceremony that took place on 2 December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of A Company and it is from there that the company assembled in advance of its fateful deployment to the Congo.</p> <p> I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour these men.</p></speech>

Five were recommended for the Military Medal for Gallantry, which is equivalent to the Victoria Cross in the UK and the Congressional Medal of Honour in the USA.  The Jadotville Medal issued by the Department of Defence in December 2017 to the veterans and next of kin of deceased veterans was simply an acknowledgement that those men were in Jadotville.  While it was a significant medal to receive, it was in no way comparable to the Military Medal for Gallantry or the Distinguished Service Medal, as recommended by then commandant, Pat Quinlan.</p>  <p>  Medals were given to three Jadotville men for action in Elisabethville two months later.  In addition, other medals were awarded to soldiers from other companies of the same battalion in the Congo for other actions in Elisabethville and elsewhere.  However, no medals were awarded for the Jadotville action, which remains the largest battle that the Irish Army has ever been involved in with a foreign enemy since the formation of the State.</p>  <p>  On his final full day as Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny announced that medals would be awarded in respect of Jadotville.  The medals referred to by him were those that Commandant Leo Quinlan had clearly identified to him a few months earlier in Leinster House.  The current Taoiseach and Minister for Defence must now instruct the Army to award these medals as soon as possible, given the soldiers' ages.  A number of them are still alive - Corporal Tadhg Quinn, Lieutenant Noel Carey, Corporal John Foley, Private Joe O'Kane, Private Tom Gunne, Private Charles Cooley, Private Michael Tighe and Private Noel Stanley.  As the battle took place in the early 1960s, these are now old men.  A commitment was given by the then Taoiseach that they would get the medals they justly deserved.  It is disgraceful that that commitment has not been honoured.</p></speech>

This had been an issue for a long number of years, and it was only right and proper that the Government of the day recognised their bravery.  The commitment given at the time, which was for medals to be presented to those involved, was met.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I have sent significant correspondence to many people regarding this issue.  The Chief of Staff has written to some of those who are campaigning for these medals to be awarded.  The medal board made its decision having considered and reflected on the issue not once, but twice.  I have asked people for further evidence as to why medals should be presented, but I do not believe any has come forward since the medal board made its original decision.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to have made the decision.  The Deputy stated that a number of people had still not received An Bonn Jadotville.  If he is aware of people who were part of that mission but have not received the medal, I would welcome him passing their names on to me to ensure they get their medals.  For various reasons, we could not track down a number of people and award them their medals on the day.</p></speech>

I appeared before that committee on 24 January to discuss the motion further.  I thank Deputies for their input to date.  I acknowledge the views expressed and hope that this debate can provide any further clarity that may be required.</p><p>A status of forces agreement, SOFA, is designed to regulate the legal and administrative arrangements applied to members of foreign forces operating within the state where they are deployed.  SOFAs provide for immunities and privileges extended to members of our Defence Forces when serving on overseas missions.  SOFAs also relate to the immunities and privileges extended to members of the Defence Forces when engaged in exercises in EU or NATO and Partnership for Peace, PfP, member states, or when on standby for the EU battle groups.  All international organisations, including the UN, EU and NATO, have concluded SOFAs with the states where they have deployed forces or engaged in training missions.  The SOFAs deal with matters such as jurisdiction, claims and applicable law between the sending organisation or state and the host state where these personnel are deployed.</p><p>Approval of this motion will allow Ireland to become party to the EU and PfP SOFAs.  This will ensure that our Defence Forces enjoy the same immunities, rights and privileges as their military colleagues while serving overseas on peacekeeping and crisis management operations or engaged in exercises where these SOFAs apply.  They will acquire these immunities and privileges as a matter of right rather than having to rely on a complicated procedure of exchange of letters between jurisdictions, which may or may not be concluded on their behalf.  We cannot continue to operate on that basis.  Our Defence Forces should be protected in the same manner as all other military personnel with whom they operate on missions and exercises when deployed outside the State.</p><p>In the past, issues have unnecessarily arisen in the completion of an exchange of letters through no fault of either party concerned.  The resolution of such issues requires that Ireland depends on the goodwill of our EU or other partners.  Ultimately, situations have arisen where no exchange of letters has been agreed and our Defence Forces have been restricted in their participation or operate without the relevant protections.</p> <p> In 2016, as part of Ireland's participation in the German-led battle group, Germany advised that it could not facilitate the exchange of letters arrangement in the time required due to legal, constitutional and parliamentary requirements.  In the case of this battle group, the immunities and privileges afforded to foreign militaries could only be extended through the PfP SOFA.  As a result Ireland could not participate in the field exercises undertaken by all other battle group participants in the German battle group.  This is unsatisfactory from a training and inter-operability perspective.  We also had to rely on the goodwill of partners and members of the Defence Forces in respect of the deployment of a number of personnel to the battle group operational headquarters for the standby period.  Another example is the case of the three month deployment to Operation Artemis, the EU mission in the Congo in 2003.  For this mission, while the terms of the exchange of letters was fully agreed in advance, with France as lead nation, the formal process had not been concluded before the troops had completed the mission.</p> <p> I was asked in committee why I was bringing forward the ratification of these agreements now.  My answer is simply that I would like to get these matters resolved before our proposed participation in the German-led battle group in 2020.  We need to have the SOFA in place so that the Defence Forces can participate in the full battle group exercise before the standby period.</p> <p> The EU SOFA has been ratified by all EU member states except Ireland.  It can only come into force upon ratification by Ireland.  All other non-aligned or neutral EU member states, including Finland, Sweden and Austria, have ratified the EU SOFA.</p> <p> In relation to the PfP SOFA, it is important to note that EU crisis management operations and battle groups have operated under this agreement where there has been third state participation in operations.  Often Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, missions and operations also involve third state participation from non-EU member states.  These third states are usually parties to the PfP SOFA but not party to the EU SOFA, therefore making it more appropriate to apply the PfP SOFA in such context.</p> <p> In response to questions raised in previous debates, I assure Deputies that these SOFAs will not apply within the State.  Article 15.6.2&deg; of the Constitution states that "No military or armed force, other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas, shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever."  Taking account of the Attorney General's advice on this provision of the Constitution and the application of the SOFAs in Ireland as well as the policy advice that I received from my Department, I have decided to include reservations to both agreements.  The reservations make it clear that Ireland will not be a receiving state for the purposes of the SOFAs.  As a result of these reservations, there is no situation in which the rights, immunities and privileges can have application in Ireland, including in relation to forces in transit or visiting personnel.  These reservations will be associated with Ireland's instrument of ratification in respect of each of the SOFAs should this motion be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p> In response to other concerns raised by Deputies, I cannot stress enough that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is not diminished, circumvented or reduced by our ratification of the SOFAs.  If anything, our national position is more strongly discernible following this process, given the reservations we are attaching to our instruments of ratification.  The reservations, as I have stated, do not allow for any ambiguity.</p> <p> Let me be clear that my sole purpose in bringing forward the ratification of the SOFAs is to ensure that our Defence Forces personnel are protected in the same manner as all other military personnel with whom they operate on missions and exercises when deployed outside the State, all the while making an invaluable contribution to international peace and security, and conflict resolution.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.496" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500037#KK00200"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the proposals to ratify the status of force agreement that will facilitate the participation of Ireland in the EU battle groups.  When I last was in the House speaking about this matter a few weeks ago, I set out our reasons and rationale for supporting this.  It will provide the immunities, privileges and process for the joint co-operation that, as I stated previously, has been happening anyway.  The letters of exchange were an exception that went on for many years.  It is important we facilitate this.  In ratifying the agreement, we are providing for and protecting Irish men and women who serve abroad.  It will enhance their training and also their protection while on any foreign mission.</p>  <p>  When Ireland plays a role in crisis management, it is important that we provide for the legal certainty for members of our Defence Forces.  As the Minister of State stated, in 2016, the Germans questioned the letters of exchange regarding the German-led battle group and for the 2020 battle group.</p>  <p>  I also welcome that there is democratic legitimacy to this motion being provided in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that it was discussed at committee and that it has been referred back here even though it is currently covered within present treaty law.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was last in Government, we supported the development of the EU's rapid response capability in support of the United Nations.  This is in keeping with the State's long tradition and policy of support for the United Nations' multilateralism and for the Security Council as the lead authority for the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>  <p>  Among the operations in respect of which a battle group could be deployed are those of a humanitarian nature involving assisting, if requested, the authorities in a state that has been devastated by a natural or man-made disaster where there is unlikely to be a UN Security Council resolution because the situation may not involve any security issues.  In 2006, Ireland was involved with the Nordic battle group with the EU and this provided for a response.  In the context of this agreement, it is important to note that the SOFA protects Irish troops who are abroad.  I welcome that.</p>  <p>  It is also important that we put on the record that this is part of Ireland having an approach that reflects an active neutrality.  An active neutrality reflects the fact that our sovereignty is secure, our democracy is functioning well and Ireland is one of the most established democracies in the world.</p>  <p>  It also reflects the fact that we are at a juncture in our development where we have an enhanced opportunity to focus on what we have to offer other members of the international community.  An active neutrality says that we have a duty to share the lessons of our experience of peace building on this island and peacekeeping on the international stage with others who may benefit from them.  As part of the triple lock and maintaining our status of neutrality, we can offer an independent role on that basis, but we have to be involved to play a positive role.  Ignoring the EU SOFA and ignoring co-operation does not achieve that.</p>  <p>  It is important that we are a bridge between the developed and the developing world, a global leader in the fight against poverty, disease and underdevelopment and an intermediary and facilitator in peace processes.  In that regard it is important that we should never abandon the triple lock, specifically the requirement in the 1954, 1960 and 1993 Defence Acts that there would be a UN mandate when sending a contingent of 12 or more armed Irish troops overseas.  It is important that we reflect that Ireland's position of neutrality is a positive policy.  We need to ensure that we continue a multilateral approach and continue the triple lock but that we also co-operate with others so that we can defend our country and others against the threats of the 21st century.  Our participation in the agreement allows that.</p>  <p>  My party will be supporting this motion.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose this motion and will vote against it.</p>  <p>  We heard from the Minister of State about SOFAs.  Basically, SOFAs grant immunities to soldiers in the face of prosecution and give them protection from local courts and local justice systems in order that they be returned to their home countries and face prosecution in some cases.  In what they do, that is fair enough.  However, it is worth noting at this juncture of the debate that SOFAs have also been used controversially by the military of some other states over recent years.  I refer, for example, to US and British soldiers who committed crimes in Iraq.</p>  <p>  We already have SOFAs in place with the UN for Irish soldiers operating under UN-mandated missions.  The key point, from my party's perspective, is that this is already in place.</p><p>The Irish soldiers are already protected under UN missions and for other missions when the exchange of letters takes place to deal with the legal issue.  The question we need to ask ourselves as a Parliament and as a people is why is the Government bringing forward two status of forces agreements, SOFAs, to deal with the EU and NATO now.  Why, at this time?  Is it a tidying up of some side issues to prepare us for more intense or greater links with the EU army being proposed by many of the Government's partners in Europe?  When this motion was discussed in the committee, and again today, the Minister of State clearly said the Department was told that the Defence Forces would not be able to participate in the German-led battle group in 2020 if Ireland did not have the SOFA in place.  There it is: this is a vote on Ireland's participation in an EU battle group.  That is what the Minister of State has said in the committee and again repeated here today: that and our participation in the NATO so-called Partnership for Peace, PfP.  The Partnership for Peace is basically a stepping stone to full NATO membership.  For Ireland to have any link at all with NATO is contrary to our neutrality no matter what way Deputies try to dress up that issue.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is emphatically opposed to this motion.  It is a disgrace to see Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael continuing to work together to undermine Irish neutrality and lay the groundwork for an EU army.  Every step that has been taken on defence issues in the EU since has moved us further along the path of the creation of an EU army.  This was seen in the Treaty of Lisbon and the creation of EU battle groups.  Sinn F&eacute;in rightly told the Irish people that the Lisbon treaty would be a betrayal of Irish neutrality and lay the foundations for the creation of an EU army.  We were proven right and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael continue to lie to the Irish people about the true extent of what lies behind this.  Those parties know how popular neutrality is here.  That is why on three occasions in the last 13 years they have refused to support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s legislation to hold a referendum on enshrining neutrality in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  If they really believed in Irish neutrality and if they had no problem with Irish neutrality then they should have backed our motion, not once, not twice, but three times to make sure it was locked in tight and enshrined in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  But no, time and again Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have voted against that.  We know the direction these two parties, along with their sister parties in Europe, are trying to take the European project.  These parties know the Irish people would support inserting such neutrality into the Constitution and neutrality is something that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael want to do away with.  That is the long and the short of it.  This explains why they have been slowly eroding and chipping away at it since the 1990s.  I believe that they cannot hide and pull the wool over peoples' eyes anymore.</p> <p> An EU army is coming if the EU masters get their way.  Do not just take my word for it or the word of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Let us look at what some of those so-called European masters are saying.  Let us put on the record of the House what they are declaring to the EU citizens and to the world.  Jean-Claude Juncker has said that creating an army is one of the main goals of the EU.  Or take the words of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and French President, Emmanuel Macron, who recently signed the Treaty of Aachen.  They both explained how important the treaty was for their military co-operation and how it contributes to the creation of an EU army.  The Minister of State could even listen to his own colleague and Dublin MEP who along with other Fine Gael&rsquo;s MEPs produced a paper calling for a complete disbanding of Irish neutrality and full integration into the EU military apparatus and NATO itself.  It is in black and white in a position policy paper published by that same MEP.</p> <p> We could also listen to what is being said in Madrid.  Fianna F&aacute;iI&rsquo;s group in the EU, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, has adopted a European election manifesto that says the party welcomes greater European co-operation in defence spending and agreement of PESCO, and encourages member states to increase defence co-operation further in areas of mutual advantage, in greater co-operation with and to "complement...NATO as NATO remains the backbone of military co-operation and guarantor of collective defence for Europe."  Well, not on our watch.  The leader of the ALDE group, which is Fianna F&aacute;il's sister party, has openly called for an EU army and European defence union.  He has said that Europe is only spending 40% to 45% of the US military spending and three times more than Russia.  To booming applause from his liberal audience he quoted Macron saying that having 28 armies is a waste and that the EU needed only one army and Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s EU leader spoke of it being their project.</p> <p> Let us be clear about where they are trying to take the European project with regard to defence.  So far the lack of SOFAs on the level that the Government now wants us to operate has not in the main hampered Irish Defence Forces in doing incredible work on United Nations mandated peacekeeping missions.  That has happened and will continue to happen with or without these SOFAs before us.</p> <p> What we really have before us is a change to how we deploy the Defence Forces overseas.  We do not have to pass these two SOFAs today or at any stage when we already have quite an effective operating SOFA which deals with what is laudable and acceptable to the Irish people, which is participation in UN missions abroad.  That is where it should start and where it should end.  The motion is about making it easier for different countries to amalgamate their militaries and to have joint operations.  This is about dragging Irish soldiers in the EU and NATO military apparatus and sending them off on missions.  What should be before us is a motion extracting ourselves from these military organisations that compromise our neutrality.  What should be before us is a Bill that Sinn F&eacute;in put forward to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution.  That would be the right thing to do and what the vast majority of Irish people want.  Instead we have a very similar situation to that of permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, where there was very little understanding or public debate on this huge change to our neutrality.  Then all of a sudden it is foisted on us out of the blue.  This is the common tactic of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in their attempts to undermine our neutrality, in that gradual and bit-by-bit erosion, piece by piece, along with their sister parties in the EU.</p> <p> We have not heard a demand from anyone within the Defence Forces looking for these SOFAs.  I put it to the Minister of State that there are sufficient protections available, such as the SOFA for UN missions.  Instead this is joining us up to the EU&rsquo;s continued militarisation project.  The people have repeatedly taken stands to demand that we respect neutrality.  That is what this Parliament should be doing.  This is why Sinn F&eacute;in will call a vote on this issue.  The motion before us is totally contrary to the idea of Irish neutrality.  Sinn F&eacute;in rejects it and we will continue to reject all attempts to erode Irish neutrality and to immerse Ireland in the EU military apparatus and the EU militarisation project, which is gaining momentum across Europe.  We will oppose any attempt to bring Ireland closer to or into any NATO project associated with that.</p></speech>

Our Defence Forces historically and currently have done us proud in making peace and keeping peace all over the world.  Diplomatically, our stance of neutrality has informed our approach to nuclear disarmament, which has seen us act as a world leader in this area since the late 1950s.  It was our resolutions that led to the creation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which has held as a bulwark against mass nuclearisation over the past six decades.  In 2009 Ireland hosted a conference to ban cluster munitions and we have strong positions against chemical and biological weapons.</p>  <p>  As a State we seek to protect and help the most vulnerable against the most belligerent.  Our membership of the European Union and its Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, and within that the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP,  places our neutrality in a constant state of discussion, and in some quarters uncertainty.  When motions like this appear on the Order Paper they can bring us into somewhat confusing waters.</p>  <p>  During the course of the evolution of the EU&rsquo;s CSDP, our EU partners have always fully respected Ireland&rsquo;s sovereignty, independence and neutrality.  The legal guarantees given by the European Council in June 2009 confirmed that the EU&rsquo;s security and defence policy does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality and Irish troops will not be deployed to any conflict zone or CSDP mission, without the triple lock of UN authorisation, Government approval and D&aacute;il approval.  Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign right to decide to deploy, maintain or withdraw troops on the initiative of the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as provided for in the Defence Acts is fully protected.</p>  <p>  Defining our neutrality in the early 20th century and during the Second World War was quite simple.  The Cold War added some shades of grey but in essence our neutral stance was clear.  The post-Cold War world with the evolution of the European Union with its Common Security and Defence Policy has created different challenges to our historic position of neutrality.</p><p>As an ever evolving body, however, with complex arrangements among what are soon to be 27 member states, the European Union makes matters a little more tricky.  Arrangements are more complicated and multilateral and have different goals and objectives.  It is through this complicated view that we need to discern what is a real threat to our deeply held position of neutrality and what measures benefit our own standing professional defence forces, of which we are very proud and wish to support.</p> <p> The European Union's status of forces agreement is designed to regulate the legal and administrative arrangements in respect of particular privileges and immunities applicable to members of foreign forces operating within the state where they are deployed.  I understand certain aspects of status of forces agreements might sound distasteful, providing as they do for immunities in relation to the nature of military equipment involved and the potential use of lethal force.  Such wording makes those of us of the neutrality tradition instinctively recoil.  However, we need to pause and realise our troops operate in dangerous environments when peacekeeping and such wording in legal texts is understandable and at times necessary.  It does not mean that Defence Forces personnel will be given licence to operate with lethal force in an act of military aggression or crime.  Some Deputies raised the issue of SOFAs in relation to the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq war and the protections they provided for US military personnel.  I am 100% confident that the men and women of the Defence Forces would never need to test those particular limits of SOFAs.</p> <p> We spend a lot of our time debating the pay and conditions of Defence Forces personnel.  We talk about supporting our soldiers and ensuring they have dignity at work.  In all of those debates we say how proud we are of the exemplary role they play on the global stage.  We are and should be proud.  However, if we do not ratify the SOFA, we will make it more difficult for the Defence Forces to practise professionally.  This has been proved in recent years with our personnel excluded from some training operations.  I support the Defence Forces at all levels and want to ensure they are able to participate in training exercises with our EU partner states.  Motions like this are intermittent reminders to some in this House that our neutrality operates in a more complex multilateral environment.  Ratifying the SOFA does not equate to a creep towards an EU army of aggression.  It does not compromise the triple lock arrangements.  It does not compromise our neutrality.  Perhaps it is worth reminding the House that it has been signed by the other neutral and non-aligned countries in the European Union.  The SOFA will make it easier for the Defence Forces to operate in the current environment and engage in multilateral and peacekeeping operations with our EU partners.  It will give them legal certainty in situations which can be most uncertain.</p> <p> Yesterday 67 Army cadets and one Air Corps cadet were commissioned at a ceremony in Dublin Castle.  We all were excited to see the class graduate and enter the Defence Forces as officers.  We want them to be proud to wear the uniform and know that we are proud of them, too.  Issues of pay and conditions are recognised on the Opposition benches as ones that need to be resolved.  We have Defence Forces personnel who have nowhere to call home as their housing arrangements are so insecure.  In recognising the realities of individual soldiers we must also be mature and recognise the realities in which the Defence Forces operate on the international stage.  We do not want our women and men to be stuck in dilapidated old barracks, from commissioning to retirement, awaiting an invasion by some foreign army.  Our women and men want to be out in the world, improving their skills, keeping the peace, rescuing vulnerable migrants and making the world safer and better.  Splendid isolation and blind eye neutrality are not the reality in the Ireland in 2019.  Ours is a mature, sovereign state which has deep relationships with our EU partners.  We have ensured during the years that the core tenets of our neutrality are protected, but, with that, we must recognise that our relationships require complex legal agreements to protect the men and women of the Defence Forces.  The SOFA is one of them.</p></speech>

The phrase &quot;Partnership for Peace-NATO&quot; is Orwellian, too.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a military alliance dominated by some of the most aggressive military and imperial powers in the world.  As an organisation, it should not exist.  One could have claimed a rationale for it during the Cold War, albeit I would not have.  Both sides in the Cold War were aggressive imperial blocks competing for influence around the world, with devastating consequences in huge numbers of places, including South America, Vietnam, Africa and the Middle East.  One can go through the list of the consequences of that geopolitical competition between NATO and the Soviet bloc.  Whatever rationale there might have been for NATO before the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet bloc, there is no justification for it now.  It should not exist, yet it does because the imperial ambitions of the major powers continue.  They are the United States of America, Britain, France and so on.  Europe is progressively aligning itself with these imperial ambitions and the expansionist and interventionist military machines.</p><p>I note some recent examples of what NATO has done.  The NATO chief has lauded the bombing in Syria and commented on how wonderful it was to bomb the hell out of it.  The people concerned have complimented themselves on the NATO operation in Libya.  It is incredible that they could compliment themselves on it.  If ever there was a disaster, it was NATO's military intervention in Libya which virtually destroyed the country.  We now have a situation where desperate people fleeing parts of North Africa are being herded like slaves, abused and exploited by militias operating in the mess NATO left behind in Libya.  We are co-operating with them to prevent the people in question from crossing the Mediterranean as they flee in desperation to seek a better life here.  This is the mess NATO created, yet the Minister of State wants us to align with it.  The Government is going to drag Ireland into Europe's moves to align itself with that alliance, while claiming that doing so somehow does not infringe our neutrality.  It is preposterous and ridiculous to even make that claim.  It is equally ridiculous for the Minister of State to suggest that because the immunities and so on included in the status of forces agreement between NATO and Partnership for Peace will not operate here, our neutrality will not be infringed in that manner either.  Give us a break.</p><p>We have seen 2 million US soldiers pass through Shannon Airport to prosecute a war in Iraq which has completely destroyed that country.  We have participated in it by allowing these troops to pass through Shannon Airport.  The consequences for Iraq and the entire region have been a disaster, just as those of us who mobilised for the protest in 2003 warned.  Our worst case estimates of what the war would cost Iraq were, in fact, dwarfed by its murderous reality.  I remember writing an article <i>i</i>in<i>The Irish Times </i>prior to the war in which I included estimates from some groups that up to 50,000 people would die in Iraq if the war went ahead.</p><p>Credible estimates now put the death toll in Iraq as a result of the war at in excess of 1 million people.  The greatest refugee crisis in the modern history of the world resulted from it, with approximately 4 million people displaced.  Iraqi society was absolutely devastated and will probably never recover.  Depleted uranium munitions are all over Iraq, poisoning and deforming children not even born and will do so for generations, munitions used by the very powers the Minister of State wants to align us with.  The mess in Syria today would not have happened if it was not for that military intervention in Iraq.  It is a direct consequence.  The growth of ISIS and everything else is a direct consequence of the Iraq war, and the Minister of State wants us to align with these people and claims it does not infringe on our neutrality.  It is dishonest nonsense.</p> <p> If the evidence of what NATO and the powers central to it have done, and I could give many more examples but I do not have time, is not enough in and of itself, what are the European promoters of European militarisation saying about their project?  They are saying they are developing a European army.  Merkel said it explicitly in the European Parliament in recent weeks.  Macron says we are developing a European army.  Tusk says we are developing a European army.  Mogherini says we are developing a European army.  Every major promoter of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, and what was inserted into the various treaties to institutionalise this evolving military structure has said it is about developing a European army, but the Minister of State comes in here and says it will have no impact on Irish neutrality and everything is fine.  It is ridiculous.  He knows it is ridiculous.  Everybody knows it is ridiculous.  Opinion polls have shown the population thinks it is ridiculous because they believed it was wrong for us to facilitate US troops in the Iraq war, and the majority believe these measures are infringing on our neutrality.</p> <p> The Minister of State resists properly defining neutrality because the fact it is not properly defined allows him to claim this ridiculous Orwellian suggestion that we are not eroding or destroying our neutrality.  The Hague Convention's definition of neutrality when applied to what we did at Shannon would clearly put us outside any meaningful definition of neutrality because we allowed forces engaged in conducting a war, aggressive military action, to use our territory to do that, providing logistical support for it.  That breaches neutrality.  It is only because the Minister of State resists defining it that it is not clearly set out in the Constitution and law.  Therefore he can make these ridiculous claims.</p> <p> It will not make any difference, and I know the Minister of State will get up and just repeat again and again that this will not impact on our neutrality and Fianna F&aacute;il will do the same.  Let us tell the truth.  What is the dirty secret of all of this?  We are afraid to say "boo" to the US.  That is the truth.  Everybody knows it is the truth.  We would not dare suggest to the US it should remove its troops from Shannon or in any way question its right to act as a global policeman.  That is the reality.  At least it would be honest if the Minister of State just said this is the real reason we are shredding our neutrality.  On the 100th anniversary of the D&aacute;il, this is poignant.  Among other things, the Irish revolution was against empires.  That is what it was about.  Fundamentally, it was against empires, but what the Minister of State is doing is progressively dragging us into the imperial project that is NATO and, frankly, it is quite shameful.</p></speech>

We disagree very strongly with what is going on.  As Deputies Boyd Barrett and Pearse Doherty have said, our neutrality is growing into a myth and has not really existed for a long time.  The motion has been presented as a completely necessary formality that Ireland should agree to for Irish forces to take part in peacekeeping and training missions throughout the world, protected by the same legal structures as the armed forces of other nations, and that as a result of passing the motion, no armed force from another country will be stationed in Ireland or transit through Ireland.  I will repeat "or transit through Ireland".  The manner in which we can ignore the fact we have let a couple of million US troops pass through here on the way to causing untold damage in other regions beggars belief, as does the manner in which the Government deals with it from a legal perspective.  Previously I have touched on the cable exposed by WikiLeaks from 2009, which highlighted the facts the Government is hiding.  The Minister of State states foreign troops will not transit through Ireland and what is happening in Shannon with the US is an informal arrangement.  I repeat: "an informal arrangement".  I just hope that, whatever parties form the next Government, if there is anybody new apart from the three neoliberal parties, namely, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party, which are in favour of this, they insist on Shannon Airport being closed as a US military base.</p>  <p>  It is as if our world leaders and their advisers and our intellectual elites find it easier to imagine another world exists than finding a way to stop imperialism, war, plunder and the other drivers of instability, such as global warming and extractive industries.  The motion is presented as a common-sense legal formality.  There is stuff about the status of the forces and the privileges, facilities and immunities that will apply to them when they are present on the territory of another state, while the larger debate is ignored, which is why are we integrating our forces further and further into NATO structures, taking part in ten PESCO training missions and the European defence fund, and presenting these moves as if it is business as usual for Ireland.  Things are changing and I do not understand why this is happening now.  The Minister of State has said that all of the other countries in Europe have signed up to this.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, just about everybody in Europe at this stage is afraid of the US.  This is why European countries are jumping at supporting the ludicrous idea that the US would accept a member of the opposition as the new President of Venezuela.  All of the western European countries bar Italy are toeing the line and behaving like lapdogs to the US.</p>  <p>  The Government is at pains to stress it is all about peacekeeping, learning new skills and getting group buying deals on expensive new hardware for our underpaid forces to use.  The message in Europe is dramatically different.  Jean-Claude Juncker has stated that by 2025 we need a fully fledged European defence union.  He has stated we need it and NATO wants it.  Damned right it does.  Last month, Germany's defence minister stated that Europe's army is already taking shape and Europe needs to improve its ability to act on behalf of its own security.  Not many politicians, particularly not our own, are very clear on from whom or what Europe needs to defend itself.  Different bogeyman are hinted at.  Russia is still thrown up as the big threat.  Maybe if the US and NATO stopped impinging on the territory around Russia's border there would be a little bit more peace in the region.  Maybe if the US, with the help of the EU, had not engaged in a coup in Ukraine, which has caused untold turmoil there since, there would be a bit more peace in the region.  Where in God's name are we going with this stuff?  Can we imagine the Russians getting involved in Mexico or Canada?</p><p>That is what is happening on the other side.  Immigrants are invoked to make this argument.  Where are those people coming from?  We have facilitated the creation of immigrants.  A minimum of 36 million people have been displaced by war.  We helped to bomb those people and now we want to put up walls to stop them coming into Europe because we have destroyed the communities in which they lived.  It is horrific.</p> <p> All of the rationales fail to register the policies that have given rise to all of this.  I refer to all of the efforts at regime change.  What has that all been for?  More than anything else, that has been to further the economic interests of the United States all over the world.  Europe tags along because of its economic, political and now, sadly, military ties with America.  Looking at what has happened in the world in the past 100 years - and this goes back to the situation in Venezuela - the Americans have interfered in 41 elections in Latin America.  It is called democracy.  </p> <p> Why are we attaching ourselves to this nonsense?  God help us.  The anthropologist, Dr. Jason Hickel, pointed out recently that the most recent data show that more money flows from poor countries to rich countries than the other way around.  That includes everything - aid, loans, foreign investment and remittances.  Net outflows from poor countries amount to $2 trillion each year.  Developing countries, or the global south, are enriching the developed world in the West.  Those countries are already rich.  We are penalising developing countries morning, noon and night and still raping the place like we are colonialists.  </p> <p> There is no sense to this.  We throw aid at those developing countries as if that is a substitute for the fact we rob them blind.  This free market extremism creates corruption, impossible economic climates and destabilises all of these regions.  We should not be a part of all of this.   When we talk about PESCO, the European Defence Fund and the NATO PfP, which should be called the NATO partnership for war, we are really speaking of pulling up the drawbridges to Europe and denying compassion to the people we have helped to bomb, starve and disenfranchise through our support for all of this imperialist activity and economic exploitation.  </p> <p> When we take part in training missions and operations to enhance our ability to police the borders of Europe, we are showing we agree with the nationalist xenophobic far-right ideologies this neoliberal philosophy has brought forth.  That is what we are buying into.  I am as fond of Europe as anybody but I am seriously worried about where it is going.  I am also seriously worried about the role Ireland is playing and the way we are allowing ourselves to be dragged into these military alliances.  It does not make any sense.  Only 104 MEPs from a total of 751 MEPs voted to oppose regime change in Venezuela in the European Parliament last week.  God help and save us.  Where are we going?</p> <p>  The Government can cod people all it likes by twisting the language but the Irish people want to be neutral.  They do not want to take part in war efforts.  They do not want to take part in economic exploitation and impoverishing communities that have suffered long enough.  There is no logic to this.  It is not what the people want.  I would love if the Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour parties took a serious look at where their political philosophy is taking Ireland.  I am referring to this neoliberal hawkish approach and slavish adoration and subservience to the US which is continuing to destroy so many parts of the world and keep billions of people in poverty.</p></speech>

I am delighted to make some comments on the ratification of the EU and NATO SOFAs.  I listened carefully to the previous debate we had on this issue in January, only a few weeks ago.  It raised more questions than answers.  I heard what the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, had to say on how a SOFA regulates the legal and administrative arrangements applied to members of foreign forces operating within the state where they are deployed.</p>  <p>  I also noted the apparent purpose of this motion is to have immunities and privileges extended to members of the Defence Forces when serving on overseas missions as part of UN-mandated forces.  Ireland, and Tipperary, has a proud record of soldiers serving in the UN over many decades.  Those were years when we were a very impoverished country with weak armed forces and not long established as an independent State.  My colleague, Deputy Grealish, is trying to have some of the personnel of the Defence Forces who fought in the Congo recognised.  We all are trying to do that and we all know some of those people.  I am being written to regularly by people who served and they are not getting their due recognition.  They should get that recognition and the Minister of State is dragging his feet.</p>  <p>  Immunity is one thing but extending privileges is another.  In the case of the EU and the NATO PfP, the SOFA also relates to the immunities and privileges extended to members of the Defence Forces when engaged in exercises in the EU, NATO or PfP member states or on standby for EU battle groups.  That reference to EU battlegroups should be enough for us.  If we are neutral, we cannot be going into battle.  That statement should be enough for the Minister of State and for his colleagues in government.  We are not in any battle with anyone.  </p>  <p>  The Government is, however, in a financial battle with the citizens of this country.  It is also in a health battle with the nurses.  We are not, however, battling any other country in wars.  The Minister of State has referenced in this motion being on standby for EU battlegroups.  It would be better for the Government to look after the nurses, the people who are homeless and those who are being made homeless by the merciless banks.   That is who the Government should be on standby to battle but it will not touch them at all.  On one hand, this motion is all very well and good.  We need our soldiers to have legal protections on a par with other member states. </p>  <p>  We had a barracks in Clonmel.  I was very proud of those soldiers and I am still proud of the ones that have been shunted off to Kilkenny thanks to former Deputy and Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, "Phil the Enforcer".  More of our soldiers have been shunted off to Cork and we have been devastated.  The Minister of State and his Government has done more damage to Clonmel and south Tipperary than Oliver Cromwell did.  We kept him out of Clonmel but we could not keep "Phil the Destroyer" out of the town.  The Government has destroyed the town.  The Minister of State has relations in Carrick-on-Suir and he should know better about what happened in Clonmel.  </p>  <p>  We must certainly have protection for our Defence Forces personnel when they go abroad.  We need to have legal protection on a par with other member states.  That is needed when we are on peacekeeping missions saving lives.  I salute the work of the Naval Service in the Mediterranean Sea.  It has plucked many unfortunate people from the sea, including youngsters, mothers and people of all ages.  I agree with Deputy Wallace.  Having created the mayhem, we now have to send forces to try solve the problem.  This is like a situation where a person out selling sweets makes the concoction sweeter to get people to buy them.  It is farcical.  The Minister of State needs to pinch himself, see what he has signed up to and where this is going. </p>  <p>  This motion appears to do nothing to diminish the clear concerns that exist regarding how instruments such as these continue to impact on, and undermine, our neutrality.  It is as plain as the nose on the Minister of State's face.</p><p>They run entirely contrary to what our neutrality stands for.  That is my opinion but it is also the opinion of many other Deputies, although not the Deputies in the major parties.  The Government is welded so closely to Europe that it cannot see the nose on its face.</p> <p> We either take our neutrality seriously or we do not.  There is no halfway house.  If we take actions that remove that neutrality, the Government needs to be upfront about it.  It is not upfront about anything, however, and will hardly be upfront about this.  It is not upfront about cosying up to the banks and giving them immunity to do what they like.  Yesterday, the Central Bank announced that hundreds of millions of euro more were swindled from ordinary mortgage account holders.</p> <p> I noted what Deputy Clare Daly said about the previous motion regarding the issue in January.  She said any decisions involving a closer association with NATO or the western European Union would represent a substantial change in our defence policy and would have long-term, if not immediate, implications for our policy on neutrality.  She went on to state that any such proposals must be put to the people in a referendum before a decision is taken.  Is the Government considering a referendum on the weather?  There is one on nearly everything now.  More referendums are planned and the Government is trying to bamboozle and cod the people.  It thinks that it can feed them with social issues and whatever, that there will be voting on the issues and that it will be great craic.  Keep the ordinary peasants occupied, let them eat cake, to quote the famous woman, and the Government can do what it likes.  I agree with Deputy Daly that we need a referendum.</p> <p> There is an increasing sense that we are not getting the full picture of the gradual erosion of our constitutional position on neutrality.  I do not know whether it is gradual, however, because it was quite fast with motions earlier in the year to celebrate an Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il, or na ch&eacute;ad bliana since the First D&aacute;il, and here we are, rushing through this kind of legislation and these debates.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh pointed out, the tone of the motion before us is similar to PESCO, or "presto" as I called it at the time.  We used to feed that to hens but the Government wants to feed all kinds of nonsense to the people.  Deputy Healy-Rae and, I am sure, the Ceann Comhairle will remember presto.  With PESCO, there was no understanding or preparation to say whether we need to go down the road and, all of a sudden, it was foisted on us out of the blue.  </p> <p> For these reasons and because we need to tread far more carefully, slowly and seriously in this area, I will oppose the motion.  The Government should consider what is happening in the Middle East.  We cannot have a debate on the Middle East because it is not feasible for the Government's friends, given the persecution of Christians and minority Muslims.  On PESCO, there was no debate in the House - only a Topical Issue matter accommodated by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

I listened carefully from my office to the earlier speakers such as Deputy Wallace and others, who made good statements, because I wanted to follow exactly what was said.</p>  <p>  I congratulate our Defence Forces on the efforts they make.  While I acknowledge the Minister of State also respects their efforts very much, I would like the Government to reward them more.  The people who go abroad on peacekeeping missions and who have done so for many years deserve our respect, gratitude and, while we are at it, proper pay.  Similarly, the members of the Defence Forces who remain in the country and who play an important role, especially when they are called upon in emergencies from time to time, are treated as second-class citizens, with which I do not agree.  They play an important role and those who go on peacekeeping missions have always had a respectable name, whether at home or abroad.  They should be treated better than they have been.</p>  <p>  To return to the motion, I listened with interest to Deputy Wallace's contribution on US politics.  Whenever I think about America, my first thought is of the gratitude for all the people, including many from my family, who left here, went to America and were damn glad to land there.  They were damn glad to find work there, have a way of life and get on with rearing their families, and they appreciated it very much.  While we can all have our differences of opinion on politics and the way the United States operates around the world, it is not right for us as a country to criticise in the House a place that has been good to us.  We greatly appreciate the jobs that have been created here by Americans and the contributions they make to our society.  As the saying goes, I would rather be looking at them than looking for them, any day of the week.  Likewise, in the case of the jobs our families got when they went to America, I would rather be looking at them than looking for them.  As a neutral country, we must be careful to protect and enhance our role as a neutral country, and we cannot have it both ways, as Deputy Mattie McGrath noted.  Our neutrality is acknowledged in Europe and around the world.  We have a respectable reputation and, in considering the motion, we must be conscious of such issues.</p></speech>

The co-operation with Malta is an example of the way we can work in co-operation with the rest of the world.  It was very moving, and one can tell that those young men and women will do us proud.  In some cases that might be due to knowing them or their families, but the sense of them as a team together suggested that they will do our country proud, as the Army, the navy and the air force have done over the years.</p><p>The cadets swore allegiance to the State, the Constitution and the Republic - as well as to the House, in a way, because it gives the Defences Forces their direction and sets their strategic missions.  It gives us such a sense of responsibility that we must get things right and ensure that we do right by them, which includes ensuring we pay them properly.  The disorganisation in our armed forces, through the mix-up of battalions and so on a few years ago, must be reversed in order that we get our organisational structures right.  More importantly, the average age of those young men and women is 23.  Let us consider the next 20 or 30 years when they will fulfil the promise they made yesterday, and the world into which they are going.  Any dispassionate assessment of our situation would raise a sense of caution about what is happening in both European and global contexts.  </p><p>While it is true that we are involved in <i>realpolitik </i>and the larger states have a strong influence, the French President clearly stated that he wants a true European army to handle the Russian threat and reduce our reliance on the US, and the German Chancellor backed him up.  Is that how we see ourselves?  Is that the strategic military direction we need to take in the world?  The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in his State of the Union speech a couple of years ago, stated, &quot;A strong, competitive and innovative defence industrial base is what will give us strategic autonomy.&quot;  Are we satisfied that is the strategic direction that will best serve those young officers, soldiers, seamen and women and aviators over the years?  Will our buying-in to that sort of vision of a strong industrial base serve them?  We live in a world with all sorts of complications involving military technology; the use of drawing technology, which we seem to fete in our European statements; and the advancement of robotics, which create various ethical dilemmas in the use of military force.  That is what makes me think we will not serve those officers well if we just buy into that narrative and think it is the future security that will work best for the Irish people, the European people or the wider world.</p><p> We have heard it time and again with the launch of the European Defence Fund.  European Commission Vice President Jyrki Kaitanen has said the fund will act as a catalyst for a strong European defence industry in developing cutting edge and fully interoperable technologies and equipment.  The Minister of State has come to us and told us to fear not, as all we are talking about is interoperability in order that our soldiers can do their best job.  Nobody would want to deny them that opportunity.  We are not blind or deaf and can speak English and read documents from the Commission and elsewhere.  We can read the background analysis of PESCO, and other interoperability mechanisms we are to enter, including NATO partnerships.  It is all about increasing military spending on hardware and advancing robotics, drone and other technologies.  I do not trust us or, I am afraid to say, Europe to best deploy them in a way that will suit our armed services in the tradition in which they have excelled.  I have heard the story of Irish Army officer heroes who stood in a difficult position in a Lebanese village when somebody was about to be beaten up and killed.  They stopped it and protected people with the power of a pencil in just having the bravery to stand in a square and say they were writing everything down.  They were willing to protect the people concerned by standing as soldiers who were not just bringing in big weapons or technology but bravery and a presence on the ground.  In so doing they averted that death.  All of the officers I met would fill us with a sense of pride.  I have met Irish intelligence officers behind certain operations in which we participated in Africa and they realised there were complexities in European engagements in Africa that required a diplomatic approach, rather than focusing on the industrial military and its technology.</p> <p> Somebody told me that the American army had learned about what we had done in Liberia when we went to a village to give computers to a local community, thereby winning the hearts of the community we were protecting in order that we could work with them in a really effective way.  I have heard of Irish Army bases that were not industrial with a high technology spend but which had open fortifications in a sense.  Although they were still secure, they kept the area open in order that there was not a sense of massive walls acting as a break between the Irish Army and the people the soldiers were there to defend.  They would not send their big and fancy vehicles along the small country roads in the middle of the rainy season for fear that if they did, local farmers would not be able to use them to get their food to the market, thereby exacerbating a tense position.  That is our skill and what we are brilliant at.  It is what we bring to peacekeeping.</p> <p> Unfortunately, in everything I read there is mention of interoperability.  In a sense, these status of forces agreements, SOFAs, are a metaphor for interoperability.  We are told that with interoperability we could see an average saving of 30% if we were to bring all of our helicopters and drone equipment together.  That does not lead to a saving in budgets but rather an expansion.  It is very explicit as it is a &euro;500 million increase this year, with a view to having ever-increasing budgets.  As I indicated, some people will see this ending with a true European army as an ideal or full interoperability.  The agreement between NATO and Europe argues that having a stronger NATO and Europe is mutually reinforcing.  I am not too sure we are serving our young men and women if we think that is our particular place in the world today.  We are living in a world that is complex and difficult, with the West in decline.  As the former UK Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, said, ten years ago, the West accounted for 60% of economic activity, but that is now down to 40%.  Europe will have to manage what will be a relative decline by protecting our civilisation, looking after citizens and ensuring we will manage our borders, although not in a way that will lead to "fortress Europe" or bring massive investment in an industrial armaments base in an attempt to restore or hold on to what we sense we are losing.  Europe will be great and we should be great within it when we have a slightly different version of where we are going from here.  The young men and women who will serve us would be better served by an Oireachtas that would signal such intent, rather than one that is behind growth in industrial armaments expenditure as the way forward.  Although we very much want to look after our soldiers, that is why we cannot agree to the motion.  It is part of an overall movement in which the Minister of State seems to be taking the country's armed forces.  It is not secure.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett appeared very calm this evening in comparison with his other contributions to debates and I wondered about the reason for it.  As I remember it is his birthday tomorrow, that is why he is saving all of his energy for tomorrow and I have no doubt that we will all receive an invitation in the post.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Jack Chambers for supporting the motion and Members across the House for their comments.  Deputies have correctly highlighted the importance of our reputation for peacekeeping.  In peacekeeping and crisis management operations the status of forces agreements will offer the Defence Forces equal protection and immunities as colleagues from other countries with which they work in a large number of missions across the world.  We also want our personnel to benefit fully from the training available in exercising with peacekeeping partners and contributing states where such opportunities are available.  We are facing increasingly complex crisis management operations and such exercises contribute extensively to the capacity and capabilities of any mission.  Ratification of SOFAs can ensure the Defence Forces can participate fully in such training exercises without in any way compromising or diminishing our traditional policy on neutrality.</p>  <p>  Since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for defence, at both committee level and here in the D&aacute;il we have debated a large number of matters.  We will always have differences of opinion and I respect everybody's opinion, but the question of whether Ireland is joining a European army is always to the fore.  Deputies Boyd Barrett, Wallace and Pearse Doherty raised that query, but their concerns could not be further from the truth.  The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or conscription to any military formation.  Any change to this position would require a treaty change, but no such change is proposed.  The Treaty of Lisbon explicitly states it does not provide for the creation of a European army or conscription to any military formation and it does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy on military neutrality.  Deputies mentioned Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, the German Prime Minister, Mrs. Merkel, and many others, but I encourage everybody to look at the Lisbon treaty and the protocols around it.  It expressly protects our military neutrality against the idea of a European army.</p>  <p>  Another question highlighted concerns about Ireland being part of the NATO PfP.  There is a principal benefit of participation in the programme.</p><p>It has allowed us to enhance the Defence Forces' capabilities and interoperability with other professional military forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates. We have been a member of PfP since 1999 and there is no plan whatsoever to join NATO.  Participation in PfP is in no way a stepping stone to NATO membership but I can safely say it enhances our capability, interoperability and it helps that we are able to work alongside like-minded states. </p> <p> The discussion paper launched by the Fine Gael MEP, Brian Hayes some months ago was raised.  It was in no way a political policy from my party.  This was a discussion paper and it is important that we have people who are interested in defence issues and policy who put out discussion papers that we are able to debate openly and honestly.  </p> <p> In no way did PESCO come out of the blue.  I was discussing it at committee level for 18 months before the motion was passed in the House.</p> <p> I commend the motion to the House.  I thank Deputies Jack Chambers and Eamon Ryan for their support.  I ask other Members to consider supporting it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500044#RR00500"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s participation in a European Defence Agency Project in relation to Military Search Capability Building pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, be referred to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(3)(<i>b</i>), which, not later than 19th February, 2019, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.</blockquote><p>In commending the motion, I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and the background to the project that Ireland wishes to participate in.  The agency was established by a Joint Action of the Council of the European Union in 2004 &quot;&ldquo;to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future&quot;.  On 6 July 2004, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the EDA.  Ireland contributes to the annual costs of running the agency including its annual work programme.  The agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development, in obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research, technology and procurement of defence capabilities.</p><p>The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 prescribes that participation in EDA projects or programmes is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.  Capability development projects within the EDA are classified as a category A project where all member states join unless they specifically opt out or a category B project where two or more member states come together to pursue a particular initiative.  The proposal put forward by me today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in a category B project in relation to military search capability building.  The Defence Forces engage extensively in specialist military search activities, dealing with unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices and ensuring a safe and secure operating environment for military operations.  The Defence Forces engineer specialist search and clearance teams are regularly deployed on home and overseas operations.</p><p>There are two specialist search teams operating overseas in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and they predominantly conduct route searches and area clearances in advance of vehicle or foot patrols.  The Defence Forces have also provided this capability to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in support of aid-to-civil power operations during high profile visits by foreign VIPs and for searches for bodies and weapons.  The Defence Forces corps of engineers does not have search teams at an advanced search capability level.  Advanced search personnel are capable of conducting hazardous environment search, working in confined space and operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  Participation in this project addresses this capability gap.  The aim of the project is to develop common processes, techniques and procedures for military search for contributing member states.  The overall cost of the project is &euro;2.8 million over six years and will be funded by the eight participating member states.  Funding comprises financial contributions and contributions in kind.  Ireland's contribution over the lifetime of the project is &euro;157,500.  This comprises &euro;102,500 contributions in kind associated with hosting an international seminar and a number of training events, and a direct financial contribution of &euro;55,000.  Costs will be met from within existing resources.</p><p>The eight member states planning to join the project are Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Ireland.  The anticipated benefits of the Defence Forces participation in this project are: it addresses a current deficiency at the advanced level of engineer specialist search and clearance capability; the training to instructor level that will be achieved from this project will ensure that ongoing training requirements can be met in-house into the future; the project provides an efficient and cost effective means of qualifying teams to advanced searcher level and maintaining their currency, which would otherwise be prohibitive if it had to be procured in the market.  Additional benefits also arise from interaction with other forces and the sharing of tactics, techniques, procedures and experiences.  Ireland's participation in this project affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations in a cost effective manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-05a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020500044#RR00600"><p>Ireland has a proud tradition of peacekeeping and the motion allows us to further develop our role as a nation committed to promoting peace and understanding across Europe and further afield.  It is equally important that the men and women of our Defence Forces have access to the very best in training, expertise and modern technology so that they are properly equipped in their duties.  Our participation in the EDA is not a new development and we have been participating in and benefitting from programmes under the agency for the past decade.  Participation in the EDA allows us an opportunity to develop new peacekeeping skills and to better foster relationships with fellow member states.  Ireland's involvement in the EDA dates back to 2009 when the then Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government oversaw the passing of legislation following the Lisbon treaty referendum.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 underpins our participation in the EDA projects.  Crucially the legislation states that any participation in European-wide projects such as the EDA can only be for the purpose of enhancing capabilities for UN sanctioned and mandated missions, which have a stated aim of strengthening security at an international level in accordance with the stated principles of the UN Charter.</p><p>Our involvement is also contingent on the UN missions having the stated aim of peacekeeping, crisis management and conflict prevention.  The project being debated today, military search capability building, fits under all of these key headings.  In addition, it is worth pointing out that any decision we take to participate in the project of the EDA is fully and completely within Ireland's control.  We do not have to answer to anyone in this regard.  We are in control and there is a democratic mandate from this House.  Indeed, this is true in the case of all defence matters within the European Union.</p> <p> It is also important to point out that participation in EDA exercises is also underpinned by the triple lock mechanism which was introduced and which was reinforced in the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Members will know that this means approval must be secured from the Government and the D&aacute;il prior to any participation in UN peacekeeping missions.  This mechanism further strengthens our right to opt in to and out of any missions as we deem appropriate, worthwhile or beneficial.  Furthermore, involvement in this framework does not impose any minimum defence spending requirements on Ireland.  All member states retain full control over defence budgets.</p> <p> Along with all of this, we should consider the benefits of our participation in these peacekeeping operations.  As the Minister of State has stated, eight member states intend to participate in this project.  These include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.  We should be very proud of our 60 years of peacekeeping tradition and we should not dismiss it in this House when discussing matters of defence.  In this sense Ireland is embracing and embodying the active neutrality approach I set out earlier today.  Our position as a nation that is serious about playing an active peacekeeping role also provides us with opportunities to benefit ourselves.  The EDA plays a key part in this aspect of our peacekeeping.  It means we get to keep track of the most up-to-date and best practices in peacekeeping in the 21st century.  It also gives us access to research and information on developing and maintaining professional capabilities from which we would not otherwise be able to benefit.  All of this is vital in ensuring that the men and women of our Defence Forces are as prepared as they can be when partaking in these peacekeeping operations.</p> <p> On the specific project being considered today, military search capability building, I am happy that it is another important peacekeeping exercise that can offer a lot of expertise to us and from which we can gain a great amount.  Both at home and abroad our Defence Forces are already involved in this type of activity through engineer specialist search and clearance, ESSC, teams.  Domestically, these teams are regularly deployed to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during visits from high profile foreign leaders and international dignitaries.  There are two teams operating overseas, one on a UN mission in Syria and another on a UNIFIL mission in Lebanon.  On these missions they conduct route searches and clearance duties in advance of patrols.  These teams are not capable of conducting searches in a variety of settings including in hazardous environments, in confined areas and in chemical, biological or nuclear environments.  Participation in this training would equip our Defence Forces with the necessary skills to operate in these challenging environments and would thus address the capability gap.  Our involvement in this project would also mean that those who participate in the training would be developed to instructor level, meaning that future training in this area could be managed in-house within the Defence Forces.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this motion in keeping with Ireland's commitment to peacekeeping as a UN nation.</p></speech>

The other aims are to increase interoperability, to make national armies indistinct from and dependent on each other and to enhance military capabilities above what is required to defend the EU, even in an armageddon scenario.  Every step that further aligns us with the EU military project further erodes our neutrality and further undermines our reputation, built on UN duties which have resulted in the loss of 86 Irish soldiers since 1960.</p><p>Nobody is denying that the threat level is greater in today's world and that armies and armed groups around the world are becoming more sophisticated.  There is a need to afford the soldiers of the Defence Forces the greatest level of protection possible and a need for their skills to be increasingly honed and their equipment adequate not only to protect themselves, but also those they seek to protect.  This can be done without eroding our national interests or our neutrality.  The State's neutrality should not be sacrificed on the altar of interoperability and greater efficiencies.  It is amazing to see Fine Gael's headlong rush into the EU-led military agenda, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Independent Alliance, while it still will not pay members of the Defence Forces a decent wage or, in some cases, even a living wage.</p><p>We are also no closer to protecting our soldiers abroad or at home from Lariam, despite a D&aacute;il motion instructing the Minister and military to do so.  We are also way behind other EU militaries in admitting the failures of the past and the legacy of very sick serving and former members of the Air Corps.  None of these issues, however, gets the Government's attention in the same way as EU militarisation.  The last two years have witnessed a rapid advance in the militarisation of the EU.  In 2017 Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the EU Commission, proclaimed:</p><blockquote>By 2025 we need a fully-fledged European Defence Union.  We need it.  And NATO wants it.</blockquote><p>This development is facilitated by the Lisbon treaty.  Sinn F&eacute;in repeatedly stated that the treaty would lead to a militarisation of the EU and the creation of an EU army.  This is what we are now seeing in real time.  If this motion passes today our spokesperson on defence, an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh, will explain in detail his deep concerns about it and this development directly with the Minister of State in committee.</p></speech>

I will certainly be supporting that proposal.  I will not spend too long speaking on the motion.  As I have said in other fora, if an issue has to be referred to committee for greater scrutiny we do not need an in-depth debate on it at the point of referral.  We need consistency on these matters irrespective of the topic of the matter for referral.  The first Members to discuss matters such as these should be the members of the relevant committee.  Be that as it may, I will say a few words on the matter.</p>  <p>  Military searches are an essential part of the work of our Defence Forces.  It is crucial that every peacekeeper is trained in detecting any form of improvised explosive device that may be in his or her path.  The purpose of Ireland's participation in this project is to increase the proficiency of the Defence Forces corps of engineers by bringing its teams to an advanced level of search capability.  These teams are required to develop certain skills for overseas missions mandated by the United Nations and this project would assist the Defence Forces in meeting these requirements.</p>  <p>  Without advanced search capability, personnel are put at risk because they are not trained to conduct all forms of military searches.  There must be consistency across peacekeeping forces because when forces from different nations are working alongside one another they must be confident that every individual is trained to the most advanced level.  By not joining this project the Defence Forces corps of engineers would be left out of important training exercises and would struggle to maintain its reputation as an exemplary peacekeeping force.  Currently there is a deficiency within the Defence Forces because none of the individuals is trained to the advanced level of ESSC capability.  These forces have yet to be trained to conduct searches in hazardous environments, in confined spaces, or in chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear environments.  Military search capability building would rectify this problem and bring the force back to a proper standard.</p>  <p>  I look forward to this being discussed and teased out further in committee before returning for a wider debate open to all Members in this Chamber at a later date.</p></speech>

Under the headline &quot;Yemen: inquiry finds Saudis diverting arms to factions loyal to their cause&quot; the article reads &quot;An investigation into weapons being used in the war in Yemen has shown numerous examples of arms supplied by the UK and the US, among others, ending up in the hands of militias including those linked to al-Qaida and Isis.&quot;  That says it all.  The purpose of the EDA is to develop the European arms industry.  We are involving ourselves in the EDA and PESCO, whose specific objective is to monitor closely that all states that are signed up to it are upgrading their military capabilities on a progressive basis.</p></speech>
