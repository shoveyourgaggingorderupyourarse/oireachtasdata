In the current school year, more than 114,000 children, including more than 14,700 children with special educational needs, SEN, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, at a cost of more than &euro;224.7 million in 2020.  All children who are eligible for school transport, and who complete the application and payment process on time, are accommodated in school transport services, where such services are in operation.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only.  They may be offered seats where capacity exists and after all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  The Department recently commenced a review of the school transport scheme.  Following commencement of this review in February 2021, in a detailed analysis and a report conducted by the technical working group in the interim period, the steering group recently presented me with its initial interim report, a report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next-nearest school.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of this report, I have approved the recommendation to maintain the scheme as it currently operates, pending the outcome of the full review, but with temporary alleviation measures to continue on post-primary transport scheme services.  These temporary alleviation measures allow for post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but who are attending their second-nearest school, who apply and pay on time, to access school transport.  This will result in transport being provided for an estimated additional 1,800 post-primary pupils in the 2021-2022 school year, who otherwise would not be accommodated under the scheme.  This arrangement will be in place for the coming school year pending completion of the full review of the school transport scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Department has engaged intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of school transport services for the 2020-2021 school year.  Based on public health advice, the Department provided for school transport scheme services for the 2020-2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services, as required, to provide physical distancing using 50% of passenger capacity-----</p></speech>

It is fair to say the scheme is popular, but it is over-subscribed.  The question arises in terms of who is eligible and who is excluded.  I would like to know the Minister's assessment of those who are excluded.  What percentage of people are on concessionary tickets?  What number of people who apply for the scheme are neither eligible nor get a concessionary ticket?  The issue of unmet need is important.  The suggestion that we will increase the number by 1,800 by next year is unambitious.  It is out of kilter with the ambition in the climate Bill and with other obligations.  Bus &Eacute;ireann aims to get to 139,000 by 2030.  That in and of itself is not enough, and the Minister&rsquo;s ambition is half of that.</p></speech>

As a consequence of that, he will be aware that there is a full review of the school transport system, which I have instigated.  In the shortest term possible, we have asked for the interim report.  The interim report looks at issues of eligibility in terms of nearest school and next-nearest school.  I am pleased to say that in the short term, we have made those changes.  There are many other changes and additions that will come on foot of the larger report, when it comes out.</p>  <p>  Concessionary tickets are available to children who are not eligible for school transport, because they are not attending their nearest school, or because they reside less than the residency distance.  Transport on a concessionary basis is subject to a number of conditions which are detailed in the school transport scheme, for example, the existence of spare seats on a bus, after all eligible children have been catered for and payment of the school transport charge, regardless of whether the child holds a medical card.  As a consequence of the change was announced in 2011, the evidence is there that a growing number of children have availed of school transport on a concessionary basis since 2011, rising from 4,000 on 20 November 2012 to more than 30,000 in the 2019-2020 school year.  This is an increase of more than 25,000.  That will increase again as-----</p></speech>

In the last 20 years, we have seen a 6% decrease in the number of people who avail of school bus transport, and a 31% increase in the number of children travelling to school by car.  That is inconsistent with where we need to be going in terms of our modal shift.  There are many compelling reasons to move people from the private car to the school bus.  If this is the first year in a ten-year programme, it is not anywhere near where it needs to be.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister about an area that is almost neglected in terms of school bus transport, namely, the private operators who operate outside the school bus transport system in many towns and villages around this country.  How many people do they carry?  Is there any assessment from the Minister&rsquo;s Department in terms of the private sector and how many children it carries to school on a daily basis?</p></speech>

We recognise there are considerable issues with school transport.  A review of the entire school transport scheme is under way at this point in time.  To facilitate accommodations that could be made in the short term, there was an announcement of an initial finding of review, which will now accommodate an additional 1,800 pupils.  In this very short space of time, to be able to produce a report of that nature that facilitates students who wish to attend their second-nearest school is a welcome, progressive, positive and, indeed, proactive approach to take.  I am conscious that the fuller report, when it is completed, will address many more issues.  It will provide us with opportunities to amend and introduce new measures and accommodations.  There is no shortage of ambition, as the Deputy refers to it.  There is no shortage of determination to address the issues of school transport.</p></speech>

In recognition of this role, I have put special arrangements in place for the coming school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid cannot work on the school premises.  I have also extended the employee assistance service to all school staff including secretaries and caretakers.</p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes.  Where a school employs a staff member to support these functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a chairman&rsquo;s note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator.  The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019, and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department.  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers.  For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has, from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour, which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement.  Officials from the Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim.  On 27 October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues.  Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals.  The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC with the next meeting scheduled for 30 July and I support at all times meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.</p></speech>

A commitment in this regard is contained in the programme for Government.  This commitment was made by the Minister&rsquo;s party when it was in opposition and by the T&aacute;naiste last October.  I welcome the engagement but school secretaries and their representatives are frustrated by the pace of progress regarding these matters.  What is the timeline in this regard?  How quickly will this engagement conclude?  When can school secretaries expect these issues to be addressed and to get a fair deal and their entitlements?</p></speech>

I have been very clear on this.  I am also very clear, as I am sure is the Deputy, that there is a process of engagement via the WRC.  I also acknowledge that since October 2020 the process has moved apace and there has been significant engagement and meetings have been held between the parties under the auspices of the WRC.  There have also been bilateral engagements in that regard.  Therefore, there is a clear commitment to progress these complex issues that form part of the pay claim.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that detailed work is being carried out between the parties in phase 1 of the talks.  To consider the remaining elements of the claim, further data are required.  These data are now forthcoming as the Department recently completed a necessary data gathering process across the primary and post-primary sector.  The returns from this exercise are now being analysed and this work will help to inform the next approaches to be taken regarding these issues.  It remains the intention of all parties to reach agreement on the regularisation of pay, conditions of employment and pension provision, which is, as the Deputy said, set out in the roadmap document.</p></speech>

It is important to state there are issues of equality and fairness and regarding the rights of workers.  In addition, there are also real issues of potential hardship.  Therefore, time is important and of the essence.  I reiterate the frustration - and it is frustration - felt by school secretaries and their representatives regarding the rate and speed of progress, or lack thereof.  I ask again what the Minister sees as being a realistic timeframe.  How quickly can these negotiations and discussions be concluded?  I know that extensive work has been done on collecting data, which concluded on 21 May.  We are now in July so this work concluded six weeks ago.  Time is of the essence.  I ask again, therefore, what is the realistic timeframe, with complete focus on this issue, to get a resolution.</p></speech>

I reiterate that since October there has been consistent engagement via the WRC, and this includes bilateral engagements.  The engagement has been very fruitful in that it has been consistently helpful to the process to chart a way forward.  As outlined previously, the Deputy is quite correct that a significant body of data was requested.  It was gathered by the Department, which was a significant undertaking.  These data are now available.  The process will be progressed at speed.  It is a necessary element of the work.  Everybody would wish that the process could be concluded with the click of fingers, but this is not possible given that several parties are involved via the WRC.  It is very important that all parties are given the time and latitude to bring to the table what needs to be brought to the table, and to bring the information required to progress matters.</p></speech>

In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p><p>Investment and expenditure on GP rooms and PE halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the school building programme.  The provision of GP rooms, PE halls and outdoor hard play areas, such as basketball courts, form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered  for an existing school.</p><p>The main focus of resources over the past decade and for the coming period is on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, particularly at post-primary level, and for special needs provision.  Under the national development plan, NDP, increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.  This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in post-primary schools.  At present, this investment is targeted to the latter half of the NDP programme. </p><p>Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme, including in respect of Mayo, may be viewed on the Department's website, <i>education.ie</i>, and this information is updated on a regular basis.  In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p></speech>

Recently, I had discussions on the sports capital and equipment programme with the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and I know this scheme has been opened up to schools and education and training boards, provided that they make a joint application for local sports organisations.</p> <p>That is welcome but does not go far enough to address the infrastructural deficits in some of our schools, which are in desperate need of facilities.  There is an opportunity to better highlight the availability of funding pathways within the Department and ensure that boards of management and principals are fully aware of the available funding opportunities.  While the sports capital programme will be good for sporting needs such as multisport facilities, there is a need for funding to be prioritised for non-sporting facilities, such as general purpose rooms and assembly or PE halls, as some schools have no such facility.  I ask the Minister to give some consideration to providing dedicated funding streams for general, multipurpose PE halls in primary school.  I know of the case of Derrywash National School, the representatives of which have been continuously in contact with me on this matter.</p></speech>

As I have previously outlined, they are part of funding via the NDP but we are looking towards the latter half of the timeframe of the plan for allocation.  It is something of which I am conscious.  I must also point out there is an enormous budgetary constraint in terms of provision.  A GP room, for example, for a four-classroom primary school comes in at around &euro;684,000.  For an eight- to 16-classroom primary school, the cost is more than &euro;900,00.  A GP room for a 24-classroom primary school costs &euro;1.8 million.  A PE hall costs in excess of &euro;3 million.  I am conscious of the need, particularly from a health and fitness point of view and also on the basis of the additional resource that it provides to a school.  I will do all that I can to advance that as quickly as possible, given the financial constraints we face.</p></speech>

I understand that Project Ireland 2040 commits to spending &euro;8.8 billion on primary and post-primary school buildings.  It is welcome that this ensures students in all post-primary schools will have access to appropriate facilities, such as PE halls.  It is hugely important that we ensure PE halls and the modernisation programmes are rolled out as quickly as possible and that we have upgrades and refurbishments to the existing school stock.  Those should be prioritised in coming years.</p>  <p>  I listened to a recent Joe Molloy interview with the Taoiseach on the idea of a dedicated PE teacher in primary schools to help Ireland fight childhood obesity.  The structure of PE at primary level needs a focus.  It has been historically problematic and in order to tackle childhood obesity, I would like to see the Department take the lead on this.</p></speech>

I again say that I am wholly in agreement with him.  I know from personal experience the importance of PE departments and all they achieve at second level.  The provision of halls and a general purpose room at primary school level is important.  The multipurpose nature of accommodations of that nature speaks to health and fitness while also allowing for enormous creative endeavour.  It also facilitates school gatherings and events.  There are enormous benefits.  That is unquestionable.  The commitment is there, as the Deputy has referenced, in the vision we have for schools, going forward.  It would be my intention, if at all possible, to draw the funding sooner rather than when it is projected to be available.  I will consider the Deputy's point about the provision of teachers specifically dedicated to the work of PE in primary school, going forward.</p></speech>

As we know, this model is designed to give the necessary and appropriate supports to students with special needs within the school setting.  It is a best practice model and offers the best option for inclusion, both inside and outside the school.</p></reply>

I note what she has said about the school inclusion model.  It does give the appropriate supports to children with additional needs and it is best practice.  It is based on the principle of providing the right educational, care and therapeutic supports at the right time for children with special education needs.  Its purpose is to help these students achieve better education and life outcomes.  The policy is based on evidence-based advice provided by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  Independent evaluation is critical to the development of this new model of service and its extension to other schools.</p>  <p>  The school inclusion model includes the provision of in-school therapies, such as: speech and language and occupational therapies; the allocation of special needs assistants on a front-loaded basis, thereby removing the need for a diagnosis in order to access care support; additional professional supports for schools, including psychology, behavioural and professional development; and the training of special needs assistants.  The model has been developed in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the NCSE and the HSE.</p>  <p>  In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the model for the 2019-2020 school year.  Initially designed as a one-year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, comprising west Wicklow, Kildare and south west Dublin, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid-related work.  It was then extended to the 2020-2021 school year which was been interrupted by Covid.  Progress has been made on aspects of the model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.</p></speech>

The reason I asked for the CHO 1 region, comprising Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan, to be included in the next phase of the pilot scheme is the unbelievable situation in the Sligo-Leitrim area regarding children who are awaiting initial assessment, treatment and further speech and language therapy.  It is not just unacceptably high, it is far beyond the limits of what any health service could defend.</p>  <p>  I submitted a parliamentary question in April this year and was informed that, in Sligo-Leitrim, there are currently 385 children awaiting initial assessment, 84 awaiting initial therapy and 444 awaiting further treatment with the speech and language therapy service.  Those figures are unacceptable and that is why I am asking for the inclusion of CHO 1.</p></speech>

I am working on the assessments and waiting times for those assessments with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.</p><p>The Deputy has referred to the selection of a region and specifically mentioned Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan.  To know what the working group will take into account in terms of criteria, it may be helpful for the Deputy if I outline some of those.  For an in-school therapy model in an urban and rural location, the area should be able to provide for a broad representative sample of schools and the region should be accessible to be supported from management services.  There must also be capacity to recruit sufficient speech and language and occupational therapists.  There must be a minimisation of travel time and clusters of schools can be established within a defined region.</p></speech>

I am making such a strong case for that region to be included because the services there are virtually non-existent.  I mentioned the waiting lists, but that was not my only question.  I also asked about the positions allocated and filled.  Looking at the area of occupational therapy, only 84% of the positions allocated have been filled.  For physiotherapy, the figure is 90%.  For speech and language therapy, however, only 59% of the positions allocated were filled in the Sligo-Leitrim region.  I got those figures in an answer to a parliamentary question in March this year.  Those figures are heartbreaking.  Each statistic represents a child and a family.  The Minister of State does not have a magic wand, but this pilot programme can make a significant difference and I ask her to strongly consider this region.</p></speech>

This school inclusion model will make a significant difference.  I will bring the Deputy's comments and contribution on the availability of therapists to the attention of the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Rabbitte.  Returning to the criteria for this region, it is important that there should be no overlap with existing in-school speech and language pilot projects.  There should be capacity to co-ordinate with existing HSE services and to bring all schools together for continuing professional training, CPD, events.  They should, if possible, be in an area which has been reconfigured in respect of progressing services for people with disabilities.  These similar criteria could form a basis for a future roll-out.  We are aware, obviously, that extra funding was provided to us in the budget, through the NCSE to recruit extra therapists, behavioural practitioners, etc., so that we can expand the school inclusion model from this September and in the years to come.  That will revolutionise the experience for children with additional needs, as the Deputy stated.</p></speech>

I want to be clear that this project is a priority for the Department.  The permanent location for the school will be on a greenfield site in the Department&rsquo;s ownership at Maryborough, Douglas, Cork.  The school when complete will provide accommodation for 600 pupils and a special education needs unit with three classrooms.  The timeline for the delivery of this project has been impacted by difficulties in obtaining planning permission.  An application for planning permission was previously refused by the local authority.   The Department appealed this decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but it was upheld.</p>  <p>  Due to a change in the local government boundary arrangements in Cork, the site for this Douglas ETSS is now within the environs of Cork City Council.  In that regard, the Department has engaged with the council in advance of a new application for planning permission that can take account of concerns raised about traffic management.  A pre-planning meeting was held on 16 April with Cork City Council.  The Department&rsquo;s project manager is actively working with Cork City Council's roads department to agree various traffic requirements in advance of lodging the planning application.  A planning consultant has also been appointed to assist in the planning process and it is anticipated that the planning application will be lodged in quarter 3 of 2021. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide a timeframe for the progression of the project to tender and construction stages until such time as the necessary statutory approvals have been secured.  The Department will continue to address the interim accommodation requirements for the school and keep the patron body and school updated regarding the progress of the application.  The Deputy will be familiar with this matter and I am sure he will appreciate that there was an issue with the original application for planning permission.  However, the determination, tenacity and focus of the Department in this regard is demonstrated by the fact that we are moving towards a second application.</p></speech>

Cork Educate Together Secondary School was founded in 2016.  This situation has been ongoing for five years now.  In September, the children who started secondary school in the school's first year will be sitting their leaving certificate examinations.  Overall, there are 360 students, or approximately 60 students in each year.  However, approximately 200 children apply to go to the school every year.  There is a great need for this school to be delivered as quickly as possible.  The dedicated catchment area for the school is Douglas.  The school was originally set up in Nagel Community College for a year before moving to Griffith College.  Completing this school is a major issue for children in the Douglas area.  It is also a major issue for people who wish to have their children educated in an Educate Together school.</p></speech>

I understand the impact on the entire school community, including the staff of the school, the board of management, the parents and, as I said, the students themselves.  The Deputy will also appreciate, however, that, as with any application for planning permission, there is always the risk of refusal.  In this case, the planning application was made and, unfortunately, that was the outcome.  To reduce the associated risks the Department has engaged the services of a planning consultant to assist with the planning process.  Discussions have also taken place with the planners and engineers of Cork City Council, which is important, and also with representatives of the roads and transport division of the council, which is significant as that is where there is an issue.  A formal pre-planning meeting has also taken place.  The application will aim to address any concerns raised by the previous refusal of planning permission by Cork County Council and we are moving this forward at pace.</p></speech>

We have to consider what the children are going through.  Only half a class can do art, high-tech teaching or science at any one time.  There are no physical education, PE, facilities in the school, so the students are being bussed to other facilities to do their PE.  A great deal of time is lost from education because of the time spent travelling on buses.  I appreciate that the Minister and Department are making serious efforts regarding this project.  Some children at the school will never see this new school.  The new building is needed urgently.</p></speech>

Certainly we hit a block in terms of the planning but we have reconfigured and reassessed and are doing all we can to ensure the next application will succeed.  </p> <p> I appreciate the points made by the Deputy.  The Department has also approved the rental of additional rooms to provide sufficient accommodation for the 2021-22 academic year and is continuing to work with the patron body.  I can confirm to the Deputy that there will be sufficient interim accommodation for September 2021.

Yesterday, following a meeting of the advisory group on planning for State examinations, I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied to the assessment arrangements for leaving certificate examinations 2021, as announced in December 2020.  I also announced that the State Examinations Commission, SEC, will run an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations in 2022 shortly following the main set of examinations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that a review of Ireland's senior cycle is under way.  I recognise that while the present senior cycle has its strengths, it also has a number of shortcomings that must be addressed.  In this regard, I believe we must examine key issues at senior cycle delivery such as the timing of assessments and assessment components and broader issues of curriculum.  I am committed to the review of the senior cycle.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has undertaken an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways.  It is important to highlight that this goes beyond the established leaving certificate but includes transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme.  The NCCA has recently submitted the senior cycle review advisory report to the Department.  The advisory report is being considered at the moment and will be published in due course.  This work will be advanced as quickly as possible.  </p></speech>

There is to be additional choice for the students regarding leaving certificate 2022, there is to be additional time for leaving certificate students in 2022 and the choice and additional time take account of the time lost.  I wish to underline the serious amount of time lost as a result of the pandemic last year, which comprised January, February, March and part of April.  Those students lost more than three months of direct teaching time.  There is also the possibility of complications in September if what the  National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, said the other day is anywhere near the mark.  Yesterday's statement indicated that the details will be published this month.  Can the Minister be more precise and give us a date by which those changes will be made public?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of the advisory group.  When I reference the advisory group, I want to be clear about who is involved in that.  As the students, parents, teachers, joint managerial bodies and the Department are at the heart of that, it is a representative and rounded group of people who have engaged over a long time to address a variety of issues - in this instance, making provision for the leaving certificate of 2022.  The accommodations that have been announced take account of that loss of in-person teaching and learning.  The conclusion of that process took place yesterday.  It is my intention that the detail in that regard will be sent to the schools as a matter of priority.  It will be there in a very short space of time.</p></speech>

Will they have these cleaning supports again next year and to what extent will they have them?  Last year, they found out at the last minute.  There was a lot of pressure and stress.  The pressure and stress would be relieved if it could be announced sooner rather than later that schools will get Covid-19 cleaning support grants.

The Deputy will appreciate that the situation is always in flux for both the education sector and society as we deal with the pandemic.  Notwithstanding that, considerable planning has gone into provision not just for this year but for the new school year as it begins in September.  Schools have already been informed that all provisions in terms of PPE, hand sanitiser and other mitigation measures required for schools in September will be in place and provided for by the Department, as they were previously.  We engage with public health on an ongoing basis every step of the way and should there be any additional requirements, they will be put in place and provided for and resourced by the Department.</p></speech>

In October 2017, following consultation with the relevant school authorities, my Department published guidelines on the use of school buildings outside of school hours.  These guidelines can be viewed on my Department's website.  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance for schools relating to the use of school buildings outside of school hours and for those schools that are considering putting such arrangements in place.</p>  <p>  Any decision to make school facilities available lies with the relevant trustees or property owners having regard to the requirements of the school, staff and students.  Schools are often the centre of sustainable communities and there can be mutual benefits in building links with the local community.  Many schools recognise this and play an important role in their wider communities and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of different uses at a variety of different times throughout the year.</p>  <p>  During the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, a school in considering applications should carry out a risk assessment to ensure that any organisation intending to use the school's facilities can guarantee the school that all public health requirements will be adhered to.  This is something of which we are particularly conscious as we journey through the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p> <p>I want to acknowledge that in the vast majority of schools there is a very strong alignment between local communities and local schools.  I acknowledge that for many communities the school is at the heart and very centre of many community activities as they operate within a local community.  That is something I would welcome.  It is important that schools within communities continue to build, grow and nurture links.</p></speech>

I read the document on the guidance on the use of school buildings outside of school hours to which the Minister referred.  It considers the issues surrounding insurance, risk assessments, health and safety, security and those types of situations.  I am talking about opening schools for full community use.  Nothing has the potential to bring people together more effectively than our schools.  We know that communities benefit from strong schools and students benefit from strong communities.  Schools do not simply provide a place to educate our children; they anchor students in their communities and provide additional amenities to communities and shared spaces for recreational activities.  Communities where schools are appropriately sited and whose accessibility is enhanced can support good health, with children and users able to walk or cycle to school which encourages greater physical activity.</p>  <p>  Like the Minister, I have spent a considerable period of my life in a classroom and school environment.  I have worked in schools that have been lucky enough to have brand new state-of-the-art facilities on greenfield sites and in schools where they do their best within the confines of their four walls.  We need a greater opening up of schools for communities.</p></speech>

I appreciate the sincerity with which he has put forward his views.  I want to confirm that the Department has no issue with schools making arrangements with local communities, provided that does not in any way impinge upon the needs of the school at any given time.  Therefore, it is important that negotiations around that are at a local level and, as I have outlined, with the property owners, trustees or whatever the case might be.</p>  <p>  To be fair, and to the credit of schools across the country, an extraordinarily high number of schools are willing to do that and have engaged positively and proactively with local communities to ensure there is a sharing of resources that might be in the ownership of the school.  As I said, specific guidelines are available to schools which might wish to consider doing that in the future.</p></speech>

I am talking about schools with state-of-the-art AstroTurf pitches, swimming pools, tennis courts, sports halls, meeting rooms, libraries, gyms and so on.  All of those amenities should be made available.  The Department should open up schools.  Many buildings are on public land and most are publicly funded.  They should all be open and available for community use.  I ask that the Minister and her Department devise a policy or scrutinise the possibility of opening up schools to the public and in all new builds, in particular, to be fully conscious and aware of the potential to have community accessibility built into our planning.  People should have access to schools after hours for community meetings, avail of the books sitting on school library shelves, access IT equipment and use all of our sports facilities.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that we are not too far apart in what he is saying.  I want to acknowledge that the Department has no issue.  As we previously outlined, it has made guidelines available as to how best practice would work in terms of ensuring how this would operate.  As I said, I want to be clear because I do not want the impression to go abroad that this is not happening with school communities.  I am aware of an enormous number of schools which are making their facilities available for a variety of different functions, gatherings, meetings or whatever initiatives might be required within a local community.  I will reiterate that is very positive.  As the Deputy said, there are considerations from a school's point of view.  Obviously, we would want to build and nurture links with communities.  Many schools have already achieved that.  We welcome other schools taking on board what needs to be taken on board so those that wish to create links can do so.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, in the case of most of these options the land could not be acquired from the landowner or the site was ultimately considered unfeasible to develop for a variety of technical reasons.  However, two potential site options have been identified and negotiations are currently under way.  These site options include potential campus arrangements with Gaelscoil An Chaisle&aacute;in.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing active engagement with Cork City Council, including with its planners in the context of the ongoing development plan review process.

I would like to see that happen as quickly as possible.  It is a key priority for the Department, given the Bill's potential to enhance school relations and communications.</p>  <p>  I support the overall aim of this legislation, which is to improve the level of engagement between the school community by inviting feedback, comment and observations from students and parents and by further developing a listening culture in our schools and stronger liaison within school communities.  The legislation will help ensure that schools, students and parents continue to work in partnership effectively together and will provide greater clarity for students and their parents on what they can expect from schools.  One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities. The detail on the manner in which schools will consult with, seek feedback from and respond to students and their parents will be set out in the charter guidelines, to be published following consultation with education stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Once the legislation is enacted, detailed work will be undertaken on developing the national charter guidelines in consultation with the education partners.  The consultation process will be an important element in ensuring that the guidelines achieve their objective in a manner that is as straightforward and effective as possible, both for schools and for students and their parents.  My officials within the Department will continue to work on progressing this important legislation.</p></speech>

She put the voice of the student at the heart of all those discussions.  They were at the table, they were listened to and they were consulted with.  At the end of the day, the Minister listened and acted on what they felt was best for their cohort.  That is to the Minister's credit and we have had a better leaving certificate process as a result of that and the Minister's open-mindedness.

I strongly believe in the partnership approach in education.  I also want to acknowledge that we see that work very effectively in many schools.  As the Deputy has referenced the pandemic, we have seen extraordinary examples of that working so well and significantly to facilitate schools and school communities to journey through the pandemic.  From my experience I know that a school community is strongest when it works together and when all voices are at the table.  I want to give the Deputy an absolute commitment that it is a key priority for my Department and for myself to move this as quickly as we possibly can.

We share the ambition of putting the child and the student at the heart of the education discussion.  Schools have broken up for the summer.  Yesterday would have been the last day for many primary schoolchildren.  They are moving on to the next stage of their education and some of them are moving into second level.  Can I ask the Minister about the commitment she gave a month ago on a catch-up fund?  I was appreciative of the Minister's comments that Senator Bacik and I have been campaigning on this since last February and the Minister made a commitment on 3 June that a catch-up fund would be announced to enable children, not just in terms of a summer programme but over the course of the next year, to repair some of the damage that has been caused by the lack of in-school teaching.  There was teaching and learning going on but as the Minister knows, much of it was outside of school and done remotely.

From the point of view of school staff I want to acknowledge that this was notwithstanding the remote learning that was provided by schools.  I am conscious of the importance of in-person teaching and learning.  I am also conscious of the need to make provision for supports for the new school year and that is a priority.  I am pleased to say that we have made significant advancement in it.  It is a body of work that requires resourcing and that demands imagination and appreciation of where the specifics are to make resources available to schools.  I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on it shortly.  I acknowledge that the Deputy has referenced the summer provision plan.  For the first time that is open to all schools with a budget of &euro;40 million and there has been an enormously positive uptake in it.  I look forward to being in a position to be able to make an announcement shortly on the broader plan for school return.  I cannot give the Deputy the specific date but it is on its way.</p></speech>

I have had numerous schools, special needs assistants, SNAs, teachers and parents contact me who will benefit from that and it is wonderful to see.  I want to ask about a particular student, namely, Aoibhinn O'Reilly.  She is a student at St. Mary's National School, Crosserlough, who is awaiting assistive technology for her education.  She applied last October and I wonder if the Minister could give us an update.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100010#H00100"><p>I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for the question.  One of my stated action priorities is to support and develop the assistive technology scheme to ensure it is of most benefit to those who need it.  This is something I am considering as the Minister of State responsible.  As we know, specialist equipment is required by some children with more complex special educational needs to access the curriculum properly and to participate in school learning activities.  For this purpose, funding was provided to schools under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of computers and specialist equipment, where students do not have access to such equipment for teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  The type of equipment we provide under the scheme is varied.  It includes audiological supports for students who have hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.  The NCSE is responsible, through its network of special education needs organisers, SENOs, for processing these applications from schools for assistive technology support.  Schools make their applications directly to their local SENO or visiting teacher and provide the details of the student's special education needs, including the details of the approach taken by the school in making the relevant intervention.  The SENOs will review applications.  I understand that in the case of the pupil referred to by Deputy Smyth, it was not possible to approve the application because it did not confirm a diagnosed disability or medical condition in line with the criteria of the scheme.  It is open to the school to appeal that decision and the appeals process is outlined on the Department's website.</p></speech>

I have been in a classroom and have seen how assistive technology can have an enormous positive impact on the needs of students in participating in mainstream education.  For teachers, it is an extra piece of work to do when they have assistive technology but for the students, the benefits are significant and should be embraced.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State is aware, Aoibhinn's application was made last October.  I am glad to hear there is an appeals process and that door is not closed on her.  She is a student whose mobility is debilitating in terms of her capacity to participate in school.  She suffers from joint hypermobility and the assistive technology she needs would be most important in helping with her reading and writing.  After 16 months of going in and out of school, between homeschooling and schooling in the classroom, we know how important technology is for everybody.  I appeal to the Minister of State, if it is possible, to ensure that this student gets the assistive technology requested.</p></speech>

It is simply a matter of meeting the criteria demanded and required of this application process.  The original application stated that her handwriting was good, for example.  There was an element about her experiencing tiredness and issues in respect of carrying her school bag.  If the criteria specifically relating to the physical or communicative disability are outlined with recommendations from a professional assessment, including the fact that the school cannot provide the technology the applicant badly needs, the appeal should be successful.  Obviously, I cannot guarantee that but the appeal will be fully reviewed, once the criteria are set out in that application.  At the end of the day, we want to support children with additional needs who have difficulty assessing knowledge and learning adequately and who require the assistive technology to do that.</p></speech>

This is an issue which has been ongoing for the student since October 2020.  During the pandemic, it has been highlighted that technology is extremely important.  The Minister of State has said that there is another opportunity for this student to have her application looked at again and that the appeals process is there.  That would be most helpful to her and her parents, who have been in contact with me and are very concerned that she receive extra help in school.  For any student who has additional learning needs or mobility problems, if there is anything we can do to assist them and embrace their educational opportunities, we need to do that.  I welcome the response from the Minister of State this morning.</p></speech>

While I have not named the child, I am aware of the application.  Once the criteria are set out, the appeal will be fully reviewed by the NCSE and the Department.  Ultimately, the purpose of the scheme is to provide grant aid to schools to allow them to prioritise the type of specialist equipment recommended by the NCSE as being essential for those who have a physical, sensory or communicative disability, to the extent that the ability to communicate through the medium of speech or writing is materially curtailed and where it is clear that the existing equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs without unduly depriving other children of access to the equipment or where, without such equipment, it would not be possible for such children to access the school curriculum.</p></speech>

As the Deputy's previous question demonstrated, there undoubtedly is a strong role for digital devices and the use of digital technology in teaching and learning within our education system, and we must support its continued development.</p>  <p>  Under the digital strategy, ICT funding is issued directly to schools as they are best placed to identify and meet the requirements of their school and school cohort.  This funding can be used to buy devices for use by students and teachers, including learning platforms, software and the overall ICT infrastructure development in the school.  Extensive support for schools to develop digital learning plans is provided through the digital learning framework alongside a suite of teacher professional learning delivered through the Department-funded teacher support service, the professional development service for teachers.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I announced the development of a new digital strategy for schools accompanied by a wide-ranging consultation process.  A consultative group has also been established comprising all key stakeholders, that is, the widest possible reach within the education sector, including education partners, parent groups and student representatives to ensure a meaningful and effective engagement with all key stakeholders.  In addition, consultation is under way as part of the process.  I want the new strategy to build on the progress achieved to date and to ensure that young people gain the necessary digital skills as part of their education.  The new strategy will take account of the findings from the consultation process, the experience gained through the implementation of the current strategy and national and international experience in this area.  It also will seek to address and incorporate new and emerging issues and trends in digital technology in education.  I look forward to working towards a new digital strategy for our schools in the coming months on the back of all this consultation.</p></speech>

Not unlike my previous question, we have learned that it will be most useful to students in every guise in education.  It is clear that digital online learning has played a crucial role in school and college life over the past year and it must be acknowledged that the reliance on online learning has, at times, placed a significant burden on teachers, students and many parents, who bore the cost of devices and connections.  Lessons must be learned from the experience of the past 16 months in terms of good practice, as well as to know how better to meet identified needs.</p> <p>What measures are being put in place to enable stakeholder consultation in the new digital strategy for schools to ensure the needs and experience of those most affected, both adults and students, are heard, including those most at risk of educational disadvantage?</p></speech>

We have also learned of the flexibility, adaptability and resilience of schools in meeting challenges as they are presented.  I want to be very clear that with the resourcing of schools, more than &euro;100 million has been made available to them during the pandemic, specifically with regard to digital technology, and this afforded schools the opportunity to purchase equipment and loan equipment to students where necessary.  I have seen good practice in many schools where it was not possible for a student to have equipment that the required equipment was loaned and students could draw on that resource.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to who would be involved with the consultation, etc.  I have indicated that this was an open call consultation and it is important that the voices of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies and wider society is heard.  It is important as there is no monopoly of wisdom in any subject.  The consultation process included and was open to everyone.</p></speech>

I know she is looking at a number of initiatives, including a &euro;210 million investment programme underpinning the implementation of the digital strategy for schools, which will be tailored to allow schools to get what they need most in support to embed digital technologies in the school setting.  This could be in the format of desktop PCs or tablets, and that is just how education is going.  I am delighted to see how the Department is embracing all that for our schools and, more importantly, the students.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister give us an expected timeline and status for the new digital strategy for schools?  Looking to future measures, what plans have been identified or may already be in place for future supports and digital and online learning for both primary and secondary schools?</p></speech>

There have been and will continue to be bilateral engagements with a variety of different stakeholders and partners in education on the formulation of a new policy.  It is my intention that we will be in a position to launch this new policy within the next number of months.</p>  <p>  I am under no illusions about the significant and beneficial resource that digital technology provides to our schools and, as I said, we have seen that during the pandemic.  I acknowledge that digital technology is an additional tool within schools.  We have also learned through this pandemic the value of in-person experiences in education as well.  We are looking to broaden the resources we have in education and this is a vital example.  We hope to be in a position to launch the new strategy in the coming months.</p></speech>

From 11 January 2021, all students engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools and I express appreciation to schools for managing that.</p>  <p>  Students who have just completed fifth year and who are due to take leaving certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.  In these circumstances, it was considered that some level of adjustment to the normal leaving certificate assessment arrangements should be made for them that would be proportionate to their experience and be educationally appropriate.  Given where these students were at in their studies at the time of each school lockdown period, the impact of the loss of tuition time is less than that experienced by those students who sat the leaving certificate this year.  To be fair to the class of 2022, there has been a loss of in-person teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that yesterday, the advisory group on planning for State examinations received an update on the 2022 leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations.  I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the assessment arrangements for leaving certificate examinations for 2021, as set in December 2020.  These arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures.  Additional changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific the 2022 examinations.  The revised document will be published later this month.</p>  <p>  I also announced yesterday that the SEC will run an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, Covid-19 illness etc. during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness to be clearly and strictly delineated.  The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice, which is a key priority.  There will be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.</p></speech>

Nobody expects that to be an eventuality but it has still been brought into the conversation.  Would it not be a cleaner or better for the Minister to decide now to roll out leaving certificate 2022 exactly as the leaving certificate for 2021 has been rolled out, with a choice for students?  Fifth year students have lost quite a number of months of in-school tuition in this calendar year.  Would it not make more sense for the Minister to make the decision now that students going into sixth year next year would have the exact same experience as those who did the leaving certificate last month?  We are not yet out of the pandemic and we cannot make any predictions about what will happen with variants.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the contribution of the advisory group, as I outlined, which is representative of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies and the wider spectrum of education partners.  It is positive that we can now indicate to students what will be before them as they return to school at the end of August and early September.  Advance notice is important not just to students but to teachers as well.</p>  <p>  We are constantly engaging with public health officials about mitigation measures and the operation of our schools.  That engagement continues and any mitigation measures required, as I indicated earlier, are being and will be put in place.  As I have said, we have made provision for a second running of leaving certificate examinations for the 2022 cohort.  That is very important and students should be aware that the provision is there for them.</p></speech>

A number of months of in-school tuition have been lost to that fifth year cohort now going into sixth year.  The July plans have already been delayed and NPHET is suggesting the potential, if everything went badly wrong, for a question mark over the reopening of schools in September.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot make a definite decision on the floor of the House.</p> <p>Can we not keep within our decision-making parameters the potential for the exact same scenario to happen in 2022 as happened in 2021?  Were the Minister to make an early decision in that regard, it would be greatly appreciated as we would not have to go through six months of campaigning to get to the very same point we reached six months ago.</p></speech>

It is proportionate.  It is the accommodation that was made available originally in August, with a further modification in December in terms of the assessment of the exam.  We have gone a step further in June by announcing to students in advance of June 2022 that we are in a position and it is our intention to run a second diet or operation of leaving certificate 2022 to accommodate and make way for students who might, unfortunately, suffer a bereavement, an illness, an impact brought on by Covid-19 or whatever other issue might arise in that context.  There has been considerable planning.  Obviously, we keep everything under review and we engage with public health.  It is a significant achievement that we are in a position to make this announcement one year in advance for the benefit of students.</p></speech>

As she will be aware, most of the contracts for local employment services have been in place since the 1990s and have simply been rolled over on an annual basis.  Good governance and public procurement rules require that my Department does not continue the existing process of simply rolling over contracts for employment services.  As a first step in moving to a procurement approach that complies with all of the necessary standards, the Department recently issued a request for tender expanding employment services into seven counties across the north-west and midlands where a local employment service, LES, does not currently exist.  It is wrong to look at this tender as a move away from a not-for-profit model to a payment-by-results model.  It is absolutely client-focused, with a strong focus on local services, community linkages and client service levels and outcomes.  As I have said, it is expanding service provision into seven counties that currently do not have a local employment service.  Approximately 90% of the fees to be paid under the contract are based on client service rather than outcomes.  The outcome fee is an additional payment.</p>  <p>  The request for tender published on 26 May is the product of an extensive process involving lengthy consultation with the sector and the engagement of external consultants.  I am satisfied that the approach being taken balances the need for high standards of procurement with our shared concern to ensure the service delivers for our clients.  I believe the Department's current providers, such as the LESs and job clubs, are well positioned to respond to the tender.  Tenders will be evaluated on the basis of quality and the ability of an organisation to access a wide range of supports and services to best meet the specific needs of their clients.  There is a limited cost element in the request for tender but it is within defined parameters.  The vast majority of the awarding criteria will be determined by the quality of service design, as well as links to the relevant local partners and stakeholders.</p></speech>

The Minister can say it as many times as she wants, but it is a fact that the current model is not for profit.  Money is not a factor when a person comes through the door of the services for referral, but it is moving to a payment-by-results model.  That is a fact.</p>  <p>  As regards consultation, I acknowledge it took place but I very much doubt that job clubs or LESs sought a model change or a change to payment by results during any of the consultation periods.  Of course, this will be particularly difficult in rural counties where the jobs just are not there to place a person in straight away.  How much money is required by the likes of an LES or a job club even coming together to go into this tender?  Although quality might be important, they cannot enter the process without money.  How much will it cost them?</p></speech>

The vast majority of marks in the request for tender, that is, more than 75% of them, are based on the quality of the service and the experience and track record of the tenderers in providing supports to those furthest from the labour market.  I have spoken to several local providers that have seen the request for tender and think it is fair.  What is more, they are confident in their ability to put together good bids for these contracts.  Those providing a good service should be confident.</p>  <p>  As regards consultation, my Department has engaged with all the relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, and has briefed them on our procurement plans.  All concerned have known for some time that this was coming.  My predecessor as Minister, Senator Regina Doherty, met the ILDN at its annual meeting in 2018 and told it the contracts were in breach of procurement rules and would have to go to tender.  I have no choice but to put this out to tender.</p></speech>

How much money will an LES or job club need in order to bid for the tender?  What I am hearing is that it is a significant tender and the organisations will need some kind of tendering consultant to try to match it and put in an application in the first place.  I am really concerned about this.  It is fine to say they are well positioned to apply for it but it will be very interesting to see how many do so because what the Minister has outlined is not what I am hearing on the ground.  I have met many LES staff and job clubs throughout the country in recent weeks and they believe they are not in a position to tender.  To me, that is very serious.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the end of walk-ins.  All present should be concerned about that.  As regards the payment-by-results model, I ask the Minister to consider JobPath, with more than &euro;93 million of taxpayers' money paid to Turas Nua and Seetec in referral fees just for getting a person to sign on.  They received individual payments of &euro;311, totalling &euro;93 million.  That is a significant amount of money.  Today, 24,000 people out of nearly 300,000 people referred have maintained a job for more than a year.  It has not worked.</p></speech>

We are now expanding this service.  This is the first phase of that.  We went through it with the providers before the request for tender went out.  There has been a lot of explanation and I do not understand why the providers will have to employ a person to put in the requests for tender because they should have a good idea as to what they need to do at this stage.  They should be confident in terms of the service delivery they provide.  We are considering the quality of the local service.  A significant amount of work has gone into this.  As the Deputy is aware, I do not have a choice and I have to put this out for tender.  We have put a strong focus on local service and the providers' connections with the local community.  There is no reason providers cannot be successful in the tender.</p></speech>

Up to now, all contracts for local employment services were issued for a single 12-month period and rolled over on an annual basis.</p> <p>Many of these contracts have been in place with very little change since the early 1990s.  Good governance and national and EU procurement rules require that my Department does not continue this practice of simply rolling over contracts for employment services.  For this reason, in order to ensure service continuity and enhance the provision of employment services, my Department is undertaking a two-phase procurement of employment services on a multi-annual basis.</p> <p> As a first step, a tender has already been issued to procure services across seven counties in the north west and midlands that are currently without a local employment scheme.  This request for tender was published on 26 May 2021 with a deadline of 7 July.  Rather than replacing existing contracts, the tender will see the services expand into new areas and therefore provides a good basis on which to apply the new procurement approach.  The tender is specifically designed to attract providers with strong local and community links to deliver high-quality employment advice services to people who are long-term unemployed.  </p> <p> As part of this approach, we intend to move away from single annual contracts that involve the financial micromanagement of the local employment service providers.  Up to now, local employment services were paid a fixed annual fee, regardless of the number of clients they saw or the outcomes they achieved, and were subject to audit against expenses incurred.  This was inefficient and did not place the client, the unemployed jobseeker, at the centre of the contractual relationship.  Under the new model, the Department will guarantee a minimum number of clients and make payments based primarily on the number of clients referred, with additional payments for outcomes achieved.</p></speech>

One person I know has been working in the system for over 25 years.  I share the concerns raised.  It has been expressed to me that if a person who is a client of the service does not reach a certain metric or if there is not a certain output in that person's case, perhaps the attainment of a full-time or part-time job or whatever that output might be, a punitive economic measure or sanction could be levied against the person or client.  That is a concern that people have.  They are concerned that the net effect of the creation of a new service will be that a set of metrics will be put in place which specifies that the client has to reach certain milestones and if they do not reach those milestones, payments or other services will be cut off from the client.</p></speech>

The focus here is on the client, the unemployed person.  That is the number one priority.  When a person is referred to the local employment service, it is done through the Intreo services.  They will decide the best pathway.  It is all about client-focused services and delivering the best outcome for the client.  Under this contract, the local employment service will receive 45% of the payment up-front upon the referral of a person to the service.  That has been put in place because I knew there could be some problems around cash flow, etc.  When the client signs up to a plan, the local employment service receives another 45%.  As such, the service receives 90% of the cost.  We have also included a minimum cost in the tender, so applicants cannot bid below a certain price.  This has all been done to ensure the client is the number one person in all of this.  The final 10% is paid when a job is secured.</p></speech>

I say that respectfully.</p>  <p>  The Minister has acknowledged that her predecessor attended the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, conference in 2018.  I request that the Minister consider meeting the ILDN and trade union representatives following the outcome of the first request for tender process and before the second request for tender process begins.  I am making that request because I believe there will be learnings from the first request for tender process.  The Minister stated previously to Deputy Kerrane that her officials had met various representative groups.  If the Minister would consider personally meeting trade union representatives and the ILDN, that would be welcome.  The employers and unions are on the same page, in this instance.</p></speech>

We are not reducing any services.  However, there will be learnings from the first request for tender process.  If tweaks or changes are needed for the second request for tender, I will be happy to make those.  I am also happy to engage with the Deputies on the matter.</p>  <p>  At the end of the day, I want to ensure we provide the best possible service for people who are long-term unemployed.  Many people have been out of work since the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, was first introduced in March 2020.  I am sure they are feeling a certain trepidation about returning to the workforce.  Their jobs may no longer be there for them.  They need support and encouragement.  I want to ensure they get all the supports they can to help them back into the workplace.  I will be happy to talk to the stakeholders once we have completed the request for tender process.  I assure the Deputies that the officials in my Department have genuinely engaged with every single provider to which the contract has been issued.</p></speech>

Is the Minister of State aware of the difficulties that arise when these people have to leave the community employment schemes because their time is up?  Services and organisations are under pressure to replace the people leaving the schemes and in some cases, services can be lost.

I appreciate that the challenges caused by the Covid-19 public health restrictions have impacted on CE schemes.  They have impacted on referrals to CE schemes and the services they provide.  I met representatives of a number of CE and T&uacute;s schemes on 11 June last.  We had a constructive exchange of views on the very real challenges facing the unemployment support schemes and how the Department can support schemes over the coming months as they resume more normal levels of service.</p>  <p>  I expect that as the economy reopens, we will be able to restore normal participant levels.  In fact, we are making provision for an extra 3,000 participant places on CE and T&uacute;s schemes over the coming 12 months.  In the meantime, the Minister for Social Protection and I recently announced that the existing CE participant contract extension date will be further extended until 20 October 2021 and that the conclusion of these places will be undertaken on a co-ordinated and phased basis.</p>  <p>  Over 11,000 CE and T&uacute;s participants are benefiting from the latest contract extension up to the end of October.  This approach will give participants time to complete training and work experience, while also supporting the delivery of important community services.  While the extension of placements helps to alleviate immediate pressures, it is important to note that CE placements are intended to be temporary and subject to time limits.  That is to ensure the continued availability of places on CE schemes for other candidates.  </p>  <p>  As the economy reopens, we hope that we can return to a normal level of throughput in order that places will be available to new candidates, including the significant numbers displaced from employment due to Covid-19.  I will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services, while ensuring that places are available for those who are long-term unemployed.</p></speech>

I welcome the engagement he has had with CE schemes.  I imagine that the matters raised in that engagement included the issues concerning the over 55s, specifically people leaving schemes and services not receiving the referrals they need to fill places.  It is probably a good few months since I last checked but as of now, there are 2,406 vacancies on CE schemes advertised on the website.  That is a huge number of vacancies.</p> <p>I met a disability group in County Roscommon a couple of weeks ago.  It has 26 CE posts and can fill only 18.  It said the reason is that it is not getting the referrals.  The service is a crucial disability service for County Roscommon and it serves people beyond that county.  There were 34,000 CE participants in 2015 and there are 21,492 in 2021.  There is a problem here.</p></speech>

I hope we are coming to the end of a period and it is looking good for coming out of Covid.  There has been very little movement in the labour market during the pandemic.  That is a large part of the reason places are currently empty.  There were no places for people to go until recent months.  It is temporary and circumstances are about to change.</p>  <p>  We are considering a much larger cohort who will potentially be eligible for CE.  The Deputy mentioned that there are 2,000 vacancies.  I have a figure of 1,705 for June 2021.  There is work to be done, however, and we are going to have to fill a large number of vacancies as participants exit over the six months.  The activation services have geared up significantly, with over 800 additional staff in recent months.</p></speech>

The jobs website indicates the number of CE vacancies today is 2,406.  It is a great shame that we have disability services with 26 posts they cannot fill.  They can fill only 18.  They tell me it is because they are not getting the referrals.  Alarm bells should be ringing when this is happening.  They should be ringing over the fact that we have over 2,000 vacancies.  It is important that we acknowledge referrals to CE were reducing long before Covid.  They were reducing all the time.  JobPath was ramping up and CE was not getting a look in.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the scheme has been extended for current participants but, after Covid, we should consider the position of the over-55s.  It is such a shame that when they finish their time, a service could be lost.  They are doing a really good job, particularly in rural areas, where they cannot be replaced.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the issue of the over-55s in time.</p></speech>

The operational forum recommenced on 11 June.  We will be having other meetings in September and some months after that to determine how we can get through these challenges over time.  It came up during the proceedings of the forum that many schemes were not aware of the service support stream.  I want to share information on this because it is useful.  CE employment participants over the age of 62 can participate on CE continuously until they reach the State pension age via the CE service support stream.  Participation is subject to availability of places, satisfactory performance on the CE scheme and annual approval by the Department.  The number of places available for service support scheme participants within each CE scheme is subject to limitation criteria.  In seven of the eight divisions, there are free places on the service support scheme.  That is worth noting and spreading the word about.</p></speech>

My Department commissioned Indecon International Economic Consultants to carry out research into the cost of disability in Ireland.  The report has now been received by my Department and it is considering it in detail.  This matter is significantly wider than the income support system and it is clear that it will not be addressed through income support alone.  This is why a whole-of-government perspective is being taken.</p>  <p>  The level of engagement with individuals living with disabilities through the survey undertaken and the level of the response from those people provided vital inputs to the research.  To Indecon's knowledge, this survey was by far the largest such survey of individuals living with disabilities in Ireland.  While this may have delayed the finalisation of the report, the quality of the report is going to be enhanced by the scale of the survey and the subsequent analysis.</p>  <p>  Due consideration will have to be given to the findings of the report by the relevant Departments, namely, the Departments of Health, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Public Expenditure and Reform, all of which have a role to play in the delivery of disability services.  As a first step, we will be sharing the report with and seeking the views of these Departments.  Once this process is complete, I intend to submit the report to the Government.  I then intend to host a forum of interested stakeholders to discuss the report and receive inputs on how we might best address issues raised in it.  I plan for this to take place in the autumn.</p>  <p>  Separately, the supports and services for people with a disability are continually reviewed by my Department.  In budget 2021, I introduced several improvements, including an increase of &euro;20 in the earnings disregard for recipients of disability allowance, a &euro;1,000 training grant to help people with disabilities who are seeking employment, and an increase of &euro;150 to the carer's support grant.</p></speech>

There was a much higher response rate than expected, and that has delayed the project.  I accept that; it is understandable.  There were 4,700 responses from people with disabilities received whereas the target was 1,000.  I saw the survey and acknowledge the time that went into each submission, and I agree that the substantial information and insight gained will be invaluable.  As the Minister stated, the survey was one of the most detailed ever undertaken in Ireland of individuals with disabilities.  However, it is precisely because of how valuable the information in the report is that we need to publish it as soon as possible.  I did not glean from the Minister's answer that the report would be ready in time to inform budget 2022.  If that is the case, it is quite disappointing.  Could the Minister confirm whether the report will be finished and inform the outcomes of budget 2022 across Departments?</p></speech>

As he said, this is a major piece of work.  Indecon believes it is the largest survey of people living with disabilities ever undertaken in Ireland.  I will be engaging with the disability representative groups as part of my Department's pre-budget forum on 14 July.  As I outlined in my initial reply, we took several positive steps in last year's budget.  Of course we want to do more but, before taking the next step, I have to get feedback from the other Departments.  I want to take the report the Government.  It has implications for other Departments so I need to have their input.  I want them to consider the report.  It has taken a good deal of time to put it together.  There have been unprecedented levels of consultation.  Once the report is approved by the Government, I want there to be full, open and frank engagement with the disability sector on its findings.  I look forward to engaging with the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

While I fully appreciate that the delays understandable, can the Minister, if possible, provide assurances that the report will be available before the budget to inform it?  Furthermore, if the report is not completed, could the Government commit, as an interim measure on foot of what is committed to in the programme for Government, to an increase of &euro;20 per week in the disability allowance in the budget?  I accept that it is not all about income but people with disabilities are living in poverty, which does come down to income.  In the absence of an approved report, and taking from the Minister's contribution that the report may not be approved in time to inform budget 2022, could we at least commit to an increase to the disability allowance of &euro;20?</p></speech>

It is a bit early to have a discussion on it.  We want to do more this year but we will consider everything.  We have the benefit of the report.  We will be talking to the other Departments and bring the report to the Government.  I will be consulting on 14 July.  I am holding a pre-budget forum and I will be consulting the various organisations, including the disability representative groups, which I have already met this year.  I will continue to engage closely with the sector and my Government colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, with whom I work extremely well.  She is doing wonderful work in this area.</p>  <p>This is not just my Department alone but a number of Departments are involved here and we will certainly be taking on board the recommendations of this report.</p></speech>

Approximately 227,980 people received a pandemic unemployment payment this week, representing a drop of 254,000, or almost 53%, since February when approximately 482,000 people were in receipt of the payment.  We expect many more people to close their PUP over the coming period.  The Government has throughout the pandemic done its best to support workers affected by job losses and will continue to do so.  That is why, in order to allow as much time as possible for employment to recover, it has been decided to phase the return to normal jobseeker arrangements over an extended period.  Accordingly, the PUP rates of payment will remain unchanged until September when they will commence a gradual, phased reduction over six months back to standard jobseeker terms.</p><p>We will of course keep this timeline under review as we have always done in the light of the evolving nature of the pandemic.  That is why I have announced that the PUP scheme will close to new entrants from 8 July 2021, which is a week later than was previously agreed.  This will allow people who may have returned to work this week in preparation for a re-opening next week to access the PUP if they need it.  </p><p>Where an employee closes their pandemic unemployment payment to return to work but has been temporarily placed on a shorter working week they may be entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment or short-time work support.</p><p>Short-time work support is a social insurance income support payment provided under jobseeker's benefit.  An individual&rsquo;s eligibility for short-time work support is dependent on the extent to which their working days are reduced.  They must be temporarily working a standard reduced weekly work pattern, working three days or less per week, having previously worked full time.  The payment is made in respect of the days of work that have been lost and is not taxable.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Where a person is working part-time, up to three days per week, and does not have a standard work pattern he or she may be eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for the days he or she is unemployed and is not being paid.</p><p>In addition a self-employed person may undertake limited self-employment and retain eligibility for the PUP.  Self-employed persons can earn up to &euro;960 over an eight-week rolling period, while retaining their full entitlement to the PUP.</p><p>I would advise any person to engage with their Intreo centre to discuss his or her entitlement according to his or her particular circumstances.  Separately, under the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, an employer can receive State support to fund the wages of their staff including in situations of reduced hours of work.</p></speech>

We do not know what is happening with regard to the Delta variant of the virus.  We are told we will have to wait two and a half weeks or so to see what is happening in Scotland, in the UK, how it is impacting on hospitalisations and that type of thing.  It is the responsibility of the Government to extend the application period beyond 8 July until at least the end of the month, mid-August or the end of that month.  We do not know what will happen and the situation is more precarious than we had anticipated.  It is now the Minister's responsibility to extend that period beyond what has been announced to give workers that peace of mind.</p></speech>

Throughout the pandemic we have had to adapt our approach in line with the public health advice.  We have kept the PUP open for applications for an extra week until 8 July.  That means that any staff who may have gone back to work in the expectation of indoor hospitality reopening next week will have the opportunity to reapply for the PUP if they need to do that.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and others have welcomed that we have extended it.  As I said at the outset we keep everything under review but the decision, which is a fair one, is to leave this application period open until 8 July.</p></speech>

I am aware, from having spoken to people in the trade union movement, that they want workers to go back to work to a safe environment.  That is the key issue for them but they also want people to get back to work.</p>  <p>  On the second part of my question on which I will speak briefly, I have been hearing anecdotal evidence that workers have been brought back to the workplace under different terms and conditions where they may have been previously working for 30 hours and these have now been reduced to 20 hours.  In some cases wages have also been reduced.  Workers who were on &euro;12 an hour have been reduced down to the minimum wage.  There is a concern there.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, I have been hearing that workers have been brought back in for 50 hours a week because the employers cannot get staff in some areas.  Very significant anecdotal messaging is going on in the workplace.  Workers who potentially are going back to work for fewer hours than they were before in March 2020 should be kept on the level of the PUP that they were on to protect them.  That is the easier way to do it, rather than the jobseeker's payment or short-time working week option.</p></speech>

There have been many anecdotal reports in the media about people staying on PUP and not returning to work, which we have all heard.  The fact is that the numbers on the PUP fell by a quarter of a million since February.  This clearly tells me that people want to get back to work as their sectors reopen and do not want to be sitting at home.  I am strongly of this view.</p>  <p>  For people who are going back to work and may only have three days per week, they can apply under the short-time work scheme and receive jobseeker's payment in respect of the days that they do not work.  If a person, for example, works for less than 24 hours per week he or she can receive support under the part-time job incentive scheme.  A number of options are available to people and the best thing I would say to people is to engage with their local Intreo office to see what supports are there and what alternatives can be looked at.</p></speech>

Will such people be allowed to return to the payment following the completion of that work or, if not, will they be required to apply for jobseeker's allowance?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister also comment on whether she would consider that this would be a disincentive for people in that industry?</p></reply>

It has been an important support for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families through Covid-19.  To date, over &euro;8 billion has been paid out on the PUP to nearly 900,000 recipients.</p><p>As part of the national economic recovery plan, the Government announced the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment until February 2022, meaning that a payment that was originally intended to be in place for just 12 weeks will run for almost two years. </p><p>In light of the Government decision to defer the lifting of certain public health restrictions on 5 July, I have announced that the PUP scheme will remain open for new applications until 8 July 2021, which is a week later than previously announced.  This will ensure staff who may have returned to work this week in anticipation of indoor hospitality reopening on 5 July will have the opportunity to re-apply for the PUP if they need to.</p><p>From 8 July people who are laid off should apply online for a standard jobseeker's payment, including the increases for adult and child dependants, as appropriate.  In most cases, given people were granted paid social insurance contributions while in receipt of the PUP, people who take up employment from PUP will qualify for jobseeker's benefit in the event that they need to claim a jobseeker's payment in the future. </p><p>Given its exceptional nature, there will undoubtedly be some cases where the transition from PUP into employment or onto another welfare payment will give rise to some questions.  However, I am pleased to say that our experience has shown that people are willing to return to work as restrictions are eased.  This confirms research by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that indicates that the vast majority of people choose to take up work rather than remain on welfare even in situations where the financial benefit of working is low or in some cases even when it is negative.  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>I also note that in a recent budget perspectives paper the ESRI pointed out that for most people income from employment will exceed the value of the PUP payment.  I would also advise the Deputy that where an employee closes their pandemic unemployment payment to return to work but has been temporarily placed on a shorter working week they may be entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment or short-time work support.  As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the position with regard to the PUP will be kept under review as the public health advice evolves.</p></speech>

I am referring in particular to the music industry and to the large cohort of people who work in that sector in the sound, power and production areas.</p> <p>Where they may be offered gigs throughout the summer, there might be two or three days of work, and that is through other Government supports for live music events through the Department of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  People taking up that work know it will be for only two or three days.  They know their industry is not open fully.  Will they be able to return onto the PUP at the end of that two-day or three-day gig they might get or a series of gigs throughout the summer?  We know that that industry will not open up fully for some time.  For example, I know of a sound engineer down in Wicklow who is at the top of his game and in high demand, but there is no work out there for him at the moment.  If he gets offered a couple of days' work, he has to weigh up whether he will be back on jobseeker's at the end of that work.  It is important he keeps his talent active and keeps his craft and his skills alive, but he has to weigh up the benefits of taking on that work.</p></speech>

I wish to make that clear because I have been misquoted here before, not by the Deputy but by others.  All my Department is doing is making people on the PUP aware of the various supports available to them.  The Deputy mentioned people on the PUP.  I have worked very closely with them.  They can earn up to &euro;960 over an eight-week period and still maintain their payments.  I am also working very closely with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, on a basic income guarantee scheme for artists.  That is something we want to introduce.  We have worked with the sector.  There is the part-time job incentive scheme for people who come off the PUP, so maybe the people to whom the Deputy refers could look at that scheme.  There are a number of schemes available, but I cannot introduce sector-specific social welfare schemes.  I will just be straight up about that.  It is not possible.  In fairness, though, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has put a lot of supports and a lot of investment into the music and entertainment sector.</p></speech>

As the Minister has pointed out, there has been unprecedented support for welfare payments and employment supports across the past 15 months and I think everybody recognises that, but we have to look at these cases and allow for flexibility where we want these people to return to work and they want to return to work.  This is their job.  It is what they love doing.  They want to be out there entertaining and putting on these shows.  I am not just talking about the artists or the person on the stage; behind every lighting rig and every sound desk is a highly qualified, skilled engineer working away.  We want to allow them to work.  We do not want them to have to take two gigs during the summer and then go back onto a lesser payment because their industry is not open.  We have to address that.</p></speech>

As I said, I cannot have sector-specific social welfare payments.  That has always been the case.  To be fair, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has worked very closely with this sector and a good deal of supports have been made available through the Government.  I am happy to engage with the sector, as always, but I have been very clear that I cannot have a specific support that looks at just one sector and not at another.  Anything we do in social welfare is across the board.  These payments have been available for a year and a half, as I said, and they will continue until next February, which will be almost two years from their introduction.</p></speech>

I also want to ascertain the Department's plans in this regard.</p></reply>

This claim creates some difficulties because the State is not the direct employer of the supervisors.  Within this context, officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress and to resolve this complex issue while having regard to the wider budgetary framework.  Officials from my Department also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.</p>  <p>  At the start of April agreement was reached with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on proposals to resolve the long-standing issue.  These proposals include a financial package.  I am confident these proposals are a solid basis for progressing and resolving this complex issue.  Discussions on these proposals are ongoing between my Department and the unions representing CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The unions have made some observations and these are now being examined by my officials in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My officials continue to progress this matter as a priority, and I hope these discussions can reach a conclusion in the near future.</p></speech>

The Minister of State knows an incredible amount about the schemes and we have discussed them this morning.  Every scheme is dependent on the commitment, dedication, talent and skills of the supervisor and the assistant supervisor.  Without those, CE would not be the very successful scheme it has been.  As the Minister of State said, the proposals were put forward in April.  Today is 1 July.  What timeline has the Minister of State in mind for resolving the issue?  The proposal, as he said, is a solid basis for progression, but there are a lot of concerns about the detail within it, the fact that it relates only to service since 2008 and the fact that it is taxable.  Many of the supervisors and assistant supervisors I have spoken to have said the offer is so small after tax that they would have been as well off not having done anything over the past 20 years of their lives, never mind the commitment they have given to communities.</p>  <p>  I ask for urgency on this.  It has been going on for far too long.  Unfortunately, many who started the campaign have passed on.  We owe it to all these supervisors and the assistant supervisors to resolve this issue fairly for once and for all.</p></speech>

The Government should not at the end of this process be levelled with the charge that it was a token process.  The process has to be such that the amount of moneys that will be awarded to people will be commensurate with their years of service and meaningful for those people.  I accept the bona fides of the Ministers in the Department and accept the fact that there is a process to be gone through in respect of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the moneys that are paid at the end of the day will be meaningful given the supervisors' years of service.</p></speech>

I expect they appreciate that there is a negotiation process ongoing and that I would be very slow to impact that adversely, so I will not comment on the details except to reiterate and to acknowledge the work of CE supervisors, assistant supervisors and participants across the country.  I have met supervisors and participants from Newmarket, Ballina, Killinarden and Churchfield in the past four or five weeks.</p> <p>The work they do is astonishing and their embeddedness in communities is remarkable.  They are not looking for thanks from me this morning.  It would be remiss of me to go into too much detail on what is happening in the negotiations, other than to say we are examining the counterproposal from the unions and we hope to respond to it in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

That is important but the Minister of State should be under no illusions about the frustration and anger of the supervisors and assistant supervisors with the proposal on the table.  Many have told me they feel that they have been boxed into a corner, that this offer will be put on the table and if they do not take it, they will be told they were made an offer and did not take it.  That is adding to their anger and their frustration with the manner in which this issue has evolved in recent years.  The Minister of State's tributes are noted but tributes and good wishes do not put butter on the potatoes or pay the bills.  This has been going on far too long.  I am conscious that other areas of the public service are watching this process.  However, there is a Labour Court recommendation and the Government cannot lecture people on taking the Labour Court seriously if it does not take it seriously.</p></speech>

They live within our communities and we know the work they do.  We deal with them every day of the week.  They are of us and our neighbours.  The work they do cannot be measured easily in metrics but we all know instinctively its value, sometimes over decades in the case of some supervisors.  I reiterate the call that has been made that the process and outcome have to be meaningful in terms of financial recognition of that service.  All of us in the political landscape openly acknowledge the role of community employment schemes.  We recognise the value that they have brought to the public realm and otherwise.  It would be very unfortunate if the outcome of this process was such that people felt their personal dignity, as workers, was undermined by a derisory package.  I implore the Minister of State, and I know he will take this into account, to reflect that work in a package that is commensurate with years of service.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of the Minister and Minister of State in trying to resolve this matter but I agree with everything the two Deputies have said.  This issue needs to be resolved now.  I call on the Ministers to listen to the counterproposal put forward by the unions.  This issue has been going on for far too long.  It is frustrating and disheartening for people who play a pivotal role in all our communities.  I appeal for progress and urgency in the approach to resolve this matter once and for all.  I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to contribute briefly.</p></speech>

Running in parallel with CE schemes is the rural social scheme, RSS.  While I acknowledge that the cases highlighted focused on the CE scheme, the RSS engages in similar activity in rural areas.  I seek clarification on whether the work towards a solution will also address the case for RSS supervisors who are effectively in the same situation or if that is possible.</p></speech>

I will give some points of information in response to Deputy Moynihan's question.  The 2008 Labour Court recommendation deals with the CE supervisor and assistant supervisor pension issue solely.  It related to these two categories of employees and did not deal with job initiative scheme or T&uacute;s employees or the RSS, which is a different type of scheme.  It is in this context that officials in my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing the community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors held discussions to progress this issue.</p>  <p>  Another Deputy made the point that some CE supervisors had passed on.  My understanding is that should an agreement be reached, the estate of a former supervisor could apply to whatever scheme is agreed upon.  The Deputies will appreciate that I do not want to go into too much detail and that my officials are working on a response.</p></speech>

That will alleviate the anxiety of many people.  Partial capacity benefit was introduced in 2012 when there were 700 recipients.  That number increased moderately over the years and now stands at 3,172 recipients.  Partial capacity benefit aims to extend illness benefit or invalidity pensions.  However, when the entitlement to illness benefit expires, the recipient of PCB is sometimes left without any social welfare payment for 13 weeks while waiting to requalify.  This fear of losing eligibility for payment may be the cause of the modest increase in the numbers on the scheme over the years.  This was highlighted in the internal review of the scheme by the Department.  Implementation of all the recommendations from this report, including the 13-week requalification anomaly, was part of the report, Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities, submitted to the Government in 2012.  Is the Minister still committed to recommendation 12 of that report and will she provide an update on the work on the 13-week requalification period that sees people lose their payment while waiting to be requalified?</p></speech>

However, the Department now contacts customers 13 weeks in advance of the end date of the payment duration period and the correspondence issued outlines the options for the customer to consider prior to the payment ceasing.  Where a person completes the allowed period on partial capacity benefit, a new application can be made.</p> <p>The application must meet all the eligibility criteria including, in the case of persons in receipt of illness benefit, the requirement to have completed 26 weeks in receipt of the payment.  My officials contact them 13 weeks in advance of the payment being due to finish.</p></speech>

It is important that we examine whether that is happening on the ground.  It is also important to say that Ireland has the unenviable title of having the lowest employment rate for people with disabilities in the EU.  Poverty and social exclusion among people with disabilities is almost 20% lower than the EU average at 50.8%.  This is a small scheme, but it is important that we fix the anomalies that we know exist within it.</p></speech>

I worked very closely with the group and with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, to find a solution.  The group is doing some very good work on the ground in terms of helping people who have disabilities to get back into the workforce.  That is just one support and there are other supports available.  We continue to review them all the time.  I work very closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on how we can improve the outcome for people with disabilities who wish to return to the workforce.</p></speech>

For these people, many of whom are self-employed, the PUP continues to be an important income support.  Rather than seeking to move people off this payment, I was pleased to work with the sector and to make changes to the scheme so that self-employed artists and performers can earn &euro;960 over an eight-week period while continuing to receive the PUP.</p>  <p>  The Government also set up the arts and culture task force and recovery oversight groups.  In response to the task force recommendations, I am working very closely with my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, to develop a basic income guarantee scheme for artists.</p>  <p>  Separately, my Department is developing and rolling out a range of supports to help all people displaced from employment as a result of the pandemic to return to employment.  My Department is now engaging with people in receipt of the PUP for a prolonged duration to check in with them and, where appropriate, advise them of the range of supports and services available to retrain and reskill.  As an initial phase of this engagement, the Department has started to make contact with people who have been in continuous receipt of the PUP since it was first introduced in March 2020.  These contacts do not target any sector, nor do they exclude any sector.  They are designed to be supportive and informative.  The response to date has been very positive and it is heartening that many of the people contacted are confident that their jobs should return over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  To be absolutely clear, we do not expect artists or musicians, who are obviously still waiting for their sector to reopen, to engage in retraining.  My Department is making people aware of the supports that are available across the board and it is up to individuals to decide on a voluntary basis if they want to take up those supports.  The Deputy will appreciate that this initial engagement with PUP recipients is an essential first step to ensure persons whose employment has been most affected by Covid are aware of the options available to them.</p></speech>

I am aware of her recent response to Deputy Cannon on the matter.  The Minister was clear that she does not expect musicians or artists to retrain.</p>  <p>  As I indicated in my question, there is a cohort of workers engaged in work which supports that of artists and musicians who we do not expect to retrain because they will be going back to work when we reopen.  We will continue to support those in the industry to perform as much as possible in the coming months.

What we have done is tried to support the people involved in every way we can.  When I engaged with them, they were very pleased that they can earn up to &euro;960 and still keep the pandemic unemployment payment.  That meant they could do the occasional gig and it did not affect their payment.  I understand that they are in a very difficult situation.</p>  <p>  To be fair, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media has put many supports in place for them.

Some 15 months ago the Department had to react to give payments to people across society who had never been in receipt of payments before and to make the process as easy and straightforward as possible.  I welcome the Minister's commitment that we will continue to do that where necessary.  When those phone calls are being made, could it be made clear that it is advice and guidance that are offered not encouragement to move to a different payment, because that can have a detrimental impact on somebody who is waiting to get back to work, who can see light on the horizon in that regard?  It can be quite upsetting to receive a phone call like that.</p></speech>

There are a lot of supports and there is no point in the Government putting them in place if we do not tell people about them.  It is all voluntary.  If a person is confident that his or her job is coming back, that is fine, but if someone needs help, we are here to help.  That is the one message I always want to get out: social protection is there to help people when they need it.  That is what we do.  What we are saying is that people should have a look at what is available and if there are supports we can provide, we want to help.</p>  <p>  The staff in the Department of Social Protection have been absolutely amazing during the pandemic.  We paid out &euro;8 billion.  More than 24 million individual payments have been issued and almost 900,000 people have received support under the scheme.

I share the concern that employees should be correctly classified for social insurance, taxation and employment rights purposes and that they should be entitled to protection against victimisation if they challenge how an employer classifies them.  While this latter question is primarily one for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact it is a criminal offence under section 252 of the Social Welfare Acts for an employer to knowingly and falsely classify a person as self-employed, subject to a penalty on conviction of up to three years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  I note the publication of the June 2021 report on this issue of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  I am sure the Deputy knows that my officials provided information and assistance to both the previous and the current committees in their deliberations on this matter and that my Department's response to the committee's draft report is appended to its final report.</p>  <p>  From the material provided, the Deputy will know that my Department takes the issue of false self-employment very seriously indeed.  That is why it has established a dedicated investigation team, called the employment status investigation unit, to investigate employment arrangements across all sectors.</p>  <p>  With regard to the committee's recommendations, they will require detailed and careful analysis and, as they issued just two weeks ago, it will take some time to form a view, to receive legal advice on their implications and, in addition, to consult affected stakeholders.  I note the specific recommendation referred to by the Deputy crosses my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Any legislation arising will then need to be drafted and accommodated within what is already a busy legislative agenda.</p></speech>

These are anti-victimisation measures that will allow workers to make a complaint to the WRC if they are victimised by employers because they sought a determination from scope section. </blockquote>  <p>When he was pressed, he said:</p> <blockquote> 	There are some small difficulties with it, as the Senator highlighted earlier, but we are seeking to address them.  That is definitively on the roadmap to progress that early in the new year. </blockquote>  <p>Therefore, we were told by the assistant secretary in December 2019 that this was being progressed and was to come to the D&aacute;il in 2020.  I am asking for clarification.  What is the current position?</p></speech>

I intend to publish a code of practice on employment status.  The purpose of the code of practice on determining employment status is to explain, in as clear and as user-friendly a way as possible, what the courts have decided constitutes an employment relationship.  It is an explanatory guide and it sets out and explains the legal obligations that already exist.  Workers and employers are entirely bound by these legal obligations and, even if the code did not exist, they would be bound by these legal obligations because they have been set down by the courts through case law.</p>  <p>  The code is an important awareness-raising tool in the effort to combat false self-employment in the economy.  It was first drafted in 2001 and revised in 2007.  However, as the labour market and relevant case law have developed since then, a revision is now needed.  The work of revising the code was undertaken by my Department, Revenue and the Workplace Relations Commission, so there are three players in this.  The Deputy referred to a meeting of the joint committee.  Putting this into legislation is tricky and is not as straightforward as it might appear.</p></speech>

It is now June 2021.  The reason we put a period of six months in the report was to give a bit of impetus to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, we hoped, the Department of Social Protection.  We know from the committee, where we heard from various employee representatives and groups, that many workers fear engaging with the scope section for fear they will be blacklisted and denied work in their respective industries in the future.  I know from people in the film industry that they have been blacklisted because they have challenged the way they work in the context of bogus self-employment.  Can the Minister confirm that we will get legislation in the next six months?</p></speech>

False self-employment is a problem that the Department of Social Protection takes very seriously.  We want to make sure that employees receive their proper PRSI contributions so they get their entitlements, and that is our focused role.  Revenue looks at it from a tax perspective and the Workplace Relations Commission looks at it in terms of workers&rsquo; rights.</p>  <p>  The scale of false self-employment is probably exaggerated by some commentators.  Research and statistics over the past 20 years indicate that levels of self-employment in the State have remained more or less constant and are not rising.  We have an inspection unit which goes on-site and we have had a number of inspections.  In fact, it is my plan to increase the resources of the inspection unit so we see what is happening on the ground.  If it is taking place, we want it to stop.  There are fines in place and we will implement them.</p>  <p>  With regard to legislation or the suggestions that came from the committee, we will certainly look at those.  However, bringing legislation into this space could actually create more problems than it solves.  I am treading cautiously, to be honest with the Deputy.</p></speech>

The current rates of welfare payments for young people were constructed to incentivise young jobseekers aged 18 to 24 years to access further education and training, with the aim of improving employment outcomes.  A young person who takes up a place on a training, education or employment programme qualifies for the full adult rate of payment.  In this way, the State is seeking to address the issue raised in the EU and elsewhere of the so-called NEETs, that is, young people who are not in employment, education or training.  A number of countries have similarly reduced unemployment payments for young jobseekers.</p>  <p>  The initial evidence in Ireland in a report by Maynooth University was that the age-related rates had a positive impact, with a reduction of over 50% in average unemployment durations for people aged 18.  Of course, one of the consequences of this approach is that young people who do not take up an employment, education or training programme receive a lower payment.  It is important, therefore, that we balance the incentive or progression effect against the income impact on people who do not take up employment, education or training.  Accordingly, in order to inform future policy direction, my Department undertook a poverty impact assessment on the reduced rates of jobseeker's payments for young people.  The outcome of this assessment is currently under consideration and I intend to publish the report shortly.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, young people were among the first to lose their jobs due to the fact the sectors that traditionally employ young people, such as retail and hospitality, were particularly badly affected.  To address this issue, the PUP was made available to students, who would not normally receive an unemployment payment.  Many of the sectors that traditionally employed young people are now reopening and actively hiring new staff.  A key priority for the Government is to get young people back to work.  I plan to launch Pathways to Work in July.</p></speech>

That is more difficult now and has been during Covid.  The majority of young people receiving jobseeker's payments are on reduced rates.  It is not just due to age.  Many of these people live at home and the whole household income is taken into account with regard to means, which can see them get less or nothing at all in some cases.  The report about poverty and its impact is important.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled an amendment to the Social Welfare Act in 2019.  The report was due to be published within three months, which was a short timeframe, but it is now more than a year and a half later.  I received an answer to a parliamentary question last July which stated that the report was being finalised.  It is now a year later and we still have not seen that report.  Will the Minister guarantee that it will be published before the summer recess?</p></speech>

I know the Deputy appreciates that.  Some 24 million individual payments have been issued to almost 900,000 people.  Our priority has been to get these payments to people.  If we had not done that, we would rightly be criticised here.  I assure the Deputy that I will consider the poverty impact assessment and publish it afterwards.  I am happy to have a further conversation with the Deputy at that stage.  I will see what the report says and will certainly look at this issue.  The programme for Government commits to looking at improvements to jobseeker's supports for young people, which I am committed to examining.  I will also engage with representatives from various youth representative groups as part of my Department's pre-budget forum.  I want to hear what they have to say about this.</p></speech>

It should never have been the case.  It has caused poverty in many cases.  I look forward to seeing that report.  I hope that it will be published before the summer recess and well before the budget, because as the Minister said, the programme for Government contains a commitment to restore those payments to a single level.  That should happen and I hope we will see steps towards it in the budget.</p>  <p>  The youth employment support scheme, YESS, has 1,000 participants after being launched in October 2018.  That number is low.  Have we looked at the issues with that scheme?  Perhaps employers were not willing to engage with it.  It is a shame because it was a good scheme.  Will the new work experience scheme that the Minister is working to launch shortly replace the YESS or will both remain?</p></speech>

The best way that we can help young people is by helping them to get back into employment so that has to be the priority.  I will outline the different schemes at that stage.  There will be intensive work to assist people to get back into employment because it has been a difficult time.  I was keen to support young people during the pandemic.  Students received the pandemic unemployment support because I was aware that students lost their jobs as everybody else did.  I was glad that we were able to do that.  Approximately 47,000 students received the pandemic unemployment payment.  As the economy has reopened, that has decreased by about 20,000.  That leaves many young people and students who may have finished college and we want to give them all of the support that we can to get them back to work.</p></speech>

It is wrong to look at the tender published on 26 May as profit-focused.  It is absolutely client-focused with a strong focus on local services, community linkages and client service levels and outcomes.  It is expanding service provision into seven counties that currently do not have a local employment service.  About 90% of the fees to be paid under the contract are based on client service rather than outcomes.  The outcome fee is an additional payment and is about 10%.  The evaluation criteria are heavily weighted towards client service and community linkages.  The request for tender published on 26 May is the product of an extensive process involving lengthy consultation with the sector and the engagement of external consultants.</p>  <p>  The current cost met funding approach, used with existing local employment services and job club contracts, involves scrutiny of all day-to-day expenditure, placing an undue administrative burden on both the provider and my Department.  This approach diverts valuable resources away from supporting clients.  It does not enhance employment outcomes for the clients of the service and it does not recognise or reward in any way high-quality innovative providers.  We have some good providers and others which are not so good.</p>  <p>  Moving to a new funding approach, which pays for each client referred, coupled with a strong emphasis on community linkages, linking with all the other services in the area, and quality of service provision, will reduce the administrative burden, encourage innovation and is more likely to deliver enhanced outcomes for those availing of the service.</p>  <p>  The procurement process now under way invites tenderers to demonstrate how they can best provide a quality employment service, giving them the scope to demonstrate their expertise, which we know they have, their professionalism and their commitment, which is not in doubt.</p></speech>

It is a public document and was the basis for the decision that was to be made here.  I believe that there is an alternative to this decision-making, despite what has been said about the EU directive.  We have to question the data and the statistical information.  I believe the data are inaccurate.  In Mayo, for example, it was stated that there were 65 Pathways to Work referrals in 2016 when there were actually 650.  Why is it only based on one year when most of the decisions would be based on multiple years?  The referrals quadrupled in recent times.  It was said that there was 5% attendance when there was 80% to 90% attendance in the Mayo region.  I question the basis for the decisions that are being made.  How much will providers be required to have as reserves?  What is the financial capacity required by the companies for tendering?</p></speech>

I reiterate we are expanding these services under the first phrase of the request for tender.  We are putting it into areas that do not currently have this employment service.  When a customer or client is referred to the local employment services from the Intreo office, the service immediately gets a 45% payment.  That means that it has the money to focus on the client.  When the client signs up to a plan, the service gets the next 45% of the payment upfront and has that money to help the client to look for a job and provide support in every way that it can.  The final 10% is paid when the client gets a job.  These are upfront payments that are totally focused on the clients.  That is the most important issue here.</p></speech>

Will those currently employed in local employment services be affected once new contracts are in place?  If a group of local employment services misses out on this contract in the tendering process, will they be protected?</p> <p>Will there be a transfer of undertakings for existing staff to ensure job security for them?  What plans are in place for any redundancies that have to be made, any lease agreements that have to be broken and any contracts with service providers, including the disposal of assets around that?  Technically, those assets belong to the Department.  What plans does the Minister have in place for that?  </p> <p> I am absolutely appalled by the treatment of centres for the unemployed.  Two centres for the unemployed have been operating in Mayo for 35 years with enormous voluntary work being done in them.  They are being closed down and it is the wrong time to do so.</p></speech>

However, the difficulty is that the document out as part of the current process reflects many of the fears we expressed that the request for tender will not capture the very unique and holistic nature of the local employment service.  Are there plans to change the next request for tender in light of that feedback?</p></speech>

There is a strong emphasis on that in the request for tender.  I have spoken to a number of the providers.  I understand the Deputies' concerns, but we have taken them on board.  There has been significant engagement with the particular group for whom we are expanding the service.  I am satisfied that, at the end of the day, we will make sure that clients are number one throughout this process and will get the service they need to get back to work.</p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh raised the issue of redundancies.  It is the case that the local development company is the employer.  I hope that providers can come together and work collaboratively.  As I said, the client is the number one person who needs the support to get back to work.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100021#T00600"><p>In response to the shameful practice of institutional investors, or cuckoo funds, buying up family homes in bulk and pushing ordinary home buyers out of the market, the Government chose to introduce an inadequate increase in stamp duty in respect of houses.  Not alone did the Government fail to tackle the issue in relation to houses, it decided to take no action whatsoever on apartments.  It is important for us to remember that half of all homes built in Dublin last year were apartments.  Six out of seven homes in Dublin city are apartments.  The vast majority of these homes are being snapped up by funds, which do not pay even a single cent of tax on rental income.  In fact, last year, one of them made &euro;75 million in rental income and paid no tax on it whatsoever.  The Government has taken no action on this.  It is little wonder the funds' share price increased following the Government's announcement last month.  Clearly, the Government's message to those who want to buy a home that is affordable is, "Sorry, not on our watch", because it is actively facilitating a free-for-all for these institutional funds.</p>  <p>  It was not just Sinn F&eacute;in that called this out and stated the Government's measures were inadequate.  Others did likewise, not least senior officials within the Department of Finance.  Through freedom of information, we can now clearly see that, in early May, the Government was warned that no extra stamp duty on bulk purchases of apartments means individual purchasers are potentially driven out of the market due to the lack of availability.  That is what the Government was told by its own officials, yet it ignored their advice and proceeded with a policy it knows will not address the issue in respect of apartments. </p>  <p>  Let me spell it out for the T&aacute;naiste.  Apartments are homes just like houses.  People want to live in these homes in our cities.  They should not be forced to fork out unaffordable rents in perpetuity to do so.  The policy choice the T&aacute;naiste and his Government made says to workers and families that this Government is not on their side, but on the side of the funds, developers and banks.  That is the reality.  Yesterday, we saw other evidence of this, when it was reported that 398 homes across three locations in this city, Santry, Finglas and Clongriffin, were snapped up by these funds.  Not one of these homes will come on to the market for first-time buyers and not one of the funds has to pay the increased stamp duty. </p>  <p>  Why did the Minister for Finance ignore the warnings from his own Department officials that the decision taken on apartments would continue to see first-time buyers blocked and locked out of the market?  Will the Government, once and for all, end the sweetheart tax deals that these funds enjoy?  We need to stop these funds snapping up homes, apartments and houses that should, and must, go to ordinary workers and families.  Further to this, just a couple of weeks ago, the D&aacute;il was emphatically told by the Taoiseach that the message that should "go out loud and clear" was that "No local authority should be on the other side of this, engaging in a long lease with these institutional investors".  However, we learned just this morning that the Minister for Finance intends to do exactly the opposite.  He intends to exempt these funds from paying the higher stamp duty if they lease these houses back to the local authorities.  How the hell can this stand?  How can this be facilitated, given the Taoiseach's comments in the D&aacute;il just a couple of weeks ago?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100021#T00700"><p>It is important, once again, to be aware of the facts.  We know from the most recent statistics produced that approximately 10% of new homes in Ireland were bought by investment funds.  Some 20% were bought by the State, through local authorities and affordable housing bodies.  I have said previously we also need to take into account that first-time buyers, and people who want to upgrade or downsize, are sometimes not just competing with investment funds but with the State.  In fact, they are more likely to be competing with the State than with investment funds.  We need to bear that in mind.  The figure is 10% for the year gone by but it will be less this year and in future years because of the action we took, which was to impose a very high stamp duty rate on any fund that buys more than ten houses anywhere in Ireland in a given year.  They cannot buy ten in every estate; it is ten anywhere in Ireland in any one year.  We believe that will significantly reduce, or eliminate, the practice of investment funds buying up new houses.</p>  <p>  As we explained at the time, we took a decision not to apply that to apartments, having taken advice widely and having heard, in particular, from builders who build apartments, who very clearly said to us that if we did this we would see reduced supply.  Builders are simply not in a position to build apartments if they do not have the assurance of a forward buyer.  They cannot get the finance to build in those circumstances.  As we said at the time, this is something we will keep under review.  If we have to alter that policy, we are open to doing so, but we do not want to do anything that is counterproductive and only results in fewer apartments being built.  If fewer apartments are built, that means less places for people to rent and, therefore, rents go up for everyone else.  That is something we obviously want to avoid.</p>  <p>  By the way, I totally agree with the Deputy's earlier statement.  I agree that apartments are homes too.  I have lived in an apartment for 14 years.  I know that apartments are homes too.  It might be the case that around the world, including Ireland, the vast majority of people in apartments are renting but there are those of us who are owner-occupiers as well.  I happen to be one of them.  It is why I was surprised to hear Senator Lynn Boylan, on two occasions, refer to people who live in apartments as "transients".  Those of us who live in apartments are not transients.  Senator Boylan should not have said that.  Perhaps she did not mean it, but she should withdraw it.  I am pretty sure that if anyone in Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael referred to apartment livers as "transients", we would be attacked and savaged online.  Senator Boylan is a Sinn F&eacute;in representative and she got away with it.  I hope the Deputy does not stand over that remark and will address it in his reply.</p>  <p>  As a Government, we are trying to help.  We are in a housing crisis but we are trying to help renters.  The Deputy knows the decision we took in the last few days, which was a necessary change of policy, to link rents to the consumer price index and inflation.  This is so people who are now renting will not see their rent increase by any more than the rate of inflation, probably 1% or 2%, or maybe even less in the coming years.  We will leave that in place until rents fall and become more affordable again.</p> <p>We are helping home buyers as well, particularly through the help-to-buy scheme.  Tens of thousands of people have been helped to get their deposit through the help-to-buy scheme, something the Deputy's party has consistently opposed.</p></speech>

He lives in this city and he should understand what is happening.  Six of seven homes in this city are apartments, 95% of which have been bought up by institutional funds.  They are able to do that because the T&aacute;naiste, when Taoiseach, along with the then Government, introduced sweetheart deals that allow the sky high rents of &euro;2,500 per month, which they are charging ordinary, hard-pressed families, to go tax-free.  That is why they are able to do it.  The Government has now exempted them from the higher level of stamp duty despite the most senior official in the Department charged with drafting this legislation saying it could potentially drive individual purchasers out of the market due to the lack of availability.  This is eyes wide open stuff.  The T&aacute;naiste and his party are deliberately locking out individuals from home ownership in relation to apartments.  The opportunity the T&aacute;naiste had will not be available to people in Dublin at this point in time because the investors are snapping them up.</p>  <p>  I will give another example.  There are three sites across Dublin on which there will be 400 homes, not one of which will come on the market.  We will see more of this.  To make things worse-----</p></speech>

Everyone knows that.  Let us have a rational grown up conversation about housing policy and about what are the right and the wrong things to do.  As a Government, we have displayed on a number of occasions that we have been willing to change our policy where we think it needs to be changed.  That is why we changed the law in relation to stamp duty to stop investment funds buying up houses and housing estates in the way they were doing so.  It is why we are now changing the law to bring rent controls so that people living in rent pressure zones will see their rent increases linked to the consumer price index, CPI.  Let us have a grown up conversation about policy.  Let us talk about the pros and cons.</p></speech>

I know what it is like to be in government.  I have been on both sides of the fence in this House.  I know issues arise, but on behalf of the Irish people what happened was embarrassing.  It was chaos and it was unacceptable.  Ministers at Cabinet either did not understand what was in front of them or they were misled.  It was one or the other.  They are saying quite forcefully that they did not know that the modelling put in front of them by NPHET did not include the new national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, advice in regard to two vaccine types.  That is a fact.  I will not have an argy-bargy on it because I do not have time, but it is embarrassing.  It should not happen.  We need a level of competency from the Government that will deliver for the people.</p>  <p>  The decision was made based on data from 23 June.  It did not include the following figures.  We know about Pfizer and Moderna and how many vaccines are due over the next quarter.  In the case of Pfizer, it is 2.3 million and for Modern, it is 850,000.  The modelling did not include the expected approximately 900,000 single dose Janssen vaccines and approximately 2 million AstraZeneca vaccines which can inoculate 1 million people.  Therefore, an additional 1.9 million people could be inoculated.  As we know, there have been changes in regard to the AstraZeneca as regards the four weeks.  We all know we are in a race of variant versus vaccines.  The Government often asks Members of the Opposition what they would do.  For a change, I will offer what I would do.</p>  <p>  First, from Monday next, I would roll out the Janssen vaccine to all 18 to 29 year olds who will take it.  There would be queues out the door for it.  A pharmacist we both know has had 60 Janssen vaccines for two weeks.  Only ten of those 60 vaccines have been administered.  I would ask NIAC to endorse the study about mRNA vaccines providing five times more protection for the over 60s who have been already administered the AstraZeneca vaccine and who are most vulnerable.  I would gather two weeks data from the UK and ensure that we have explored all avenues in relation to the reopening of the hospitality industry so that they can protect people - rushing out ventilation systems.  Finally, I would use the next two weeks to ensure that the travel certificate launched today, which Ireland is the only country in Europe not to have proceeded with yet, is used in some way or mirrored in relation to the hospitality industry.  In doing all of that, the Government should remodel all of the data so that we get a true picture of where we are going for the Irish people. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100022#U01900"><p>The modelling presented by NPHET to the Cabinet on Tuesday did not take account of the changes that NIAC has now permitted in relation to vaccines, nor could it have.  We still do not know for sure what the changes that NIAC is now permitting will do in terms of the vaccination programme.  We knew that the vaccination programme would slow down in July because we could not use the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines on young people.  We now know that we can do that, but we do not yet know how much it will allow us to speed up the vaccination programme in July, or when.  That work is being done today.  There are still some uncertainties.  There is uncertainty around the supply of AstraZeneca and uncertainty, for example, as to what uptake will be if we change to a different model such as a walk-in type model.  All of those things have to be worked out.  It is only when they are worked out that the data can be input into the modelling.  The Deputy will understand why that is.</p>  <p>  In terms of the ideas put forward by the Deputy, the Government is considering a proposal regarding use of the Janssen vaccine.  We do have some surplus stocks.  We may get more, but we do not know that for sure.  We are certainly considering the possibility of opening that up to be people under 50, who could go to the 750 community pharmacists providing this service and avail of that vaccine.  What the Deputy said was very prescient.  He said that if we announce this, there will be queues outside the pharmacies.  There might be, but will there be the stocks?  That is the type of work the HSE has to do: talk with pharmacists, ask them whether they can do this, what level of stock they would need, and whether we have them.  In fairness, this decision from NIAC was only made on Monday.  Today, is only Thursday.  In fairness, to the HSE it will take a couple of days to operationalise this and to work out what the implications are.  I want to extend my thanks and respect to the HSE as there have been so many changes to the vaccine programme.  Where we are is, perhaps, where we should have been at the start.  All of the vaccines work and they can be used on all age groups.  Two doses of AstraZeneca is as good as two doses of Pfizer as makes no difference.  In all case there are size effects and in all cases the benefits outweigh the risks.  We are now in that place.  Perhaps, if we had been there from the start we would have got more done more quickly.</p>  <p>  On the digital Covid cert, again, what the Deputy suggested is exactly what we are doing.  We are working out whether we can use the digital Covid cert to apply it domestically.  We do expect that within the next three weeks hundreds of thousands of people will receive their digital Covid cert, electronically or by post.  We are working out now whether we can use that domestically.  It was only ever intended for international travel.  Border check control staff checking these passes is a very different thing to staff in the local pub or restaurant doing it.  That needs to be worked out.</p>  <p>  In terms of remodelling the data, that is exactly what we are going to do.  We will remodel the models.  That will be done in advance of 19 July as I said yesterday on "Morning Ireland" and it will take into account two things: the experience from Britain, Scotland and England in particular, and how bad the Delta variant really is.  We will have a better idea in two or three weeks and we will certainly know what changes to the vaccination programme will mean.  We can then make decisions again.</p></speech>

I appreciate that but I would ask him to do one more thing.  It relates to young people.  The T&aacute;naiste will know that there was an Economic and Social Research Institution, ESRI, report showing that the impact of this on young people over the last couple of years has been disproportionate.  Economically, they are poorer than any younger generation for decades.  Whatever we proceed with, we are all in this together.  We cannot leave one group behind.  We cannot say that the unvaccinated have to serve the vaccinated.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please give a commitment in that regard?  I believe in the use of antigen testing.  I was the first person to raise the matter here last October.  Regardless of the mix of measures taken, which may potentially involve testing, I ask that the T&aacute;naiste ensures that whatever certificate is to be used includes everybody, no matter their age, so that we can continue bringing everyone along together rather than discriminating against young people.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give us that commitment this morning?</p></speech>

Older people have borne the brunt of the pandemic by quite a distance with regard to illness, hospitalisation and deaths.  Younger people have borne the brunt economically with regard to the impact on their incomes and on their freedoms.  At the start of this pandemic, we told older people that they were the most vulnerable and asked them to please cocoon, to stay inside and not to go out.  They did that.  It was unfair but it was the right thing to do.  We are now telling people who are not vaccinated, who are mostly, although not only, younger people, that they are now the most vulnerable and we are asking them to avoid socialising and congregating indoors for the next couple of weeks until we get them vaccinated.  That is what we are saying.  We are doing it for a good reason, backed by public health advice and science.</p></speech>

However, in giving that consideration, we also need to be honest with people.  Nobody will ever say that any test, whether a PCR test or an antigen test, is as good as vaccination or immunity from exposure.  We could do that in order to address the unfairness and inequality issues the Deputy has raised but it would make things less safe.  We need to be honest about that.</p></speech>

Having kept workers on the payroll throughout 16 months of the pandemic, Aer Lingus has announced plans to temporarily lay off 200 workers for the duration of the repair work.  Other airport employers may take similar actions.  The workers are opposed to this plan.  They want to be kept on the company books and I support them in this aim.  This issue is already prominent in Cork.  If left unresolved for much longer, it will become an issue of quite major significance and profile locally, including in the constituency of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Aer Lingus and other employers at the airport are in receipt of considerable State supports related to the pandemic.  For example, Aer Lingus is in talks with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, having secured &euro;150 million in debt funding to date.  According to last Sunday's <i>Business Post</i>, the airports at Cork, Dublin and Shannon are to receive a combined &euro;20 million in funding before 19 July.  </p><p>There is also the question of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Last week, the CEO of Aer Lingus, Lynne Embleton, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications that, at the time the lay-offs were announced, there had been no work in Cork Airport for a period and that this is what lay-offs and closures are there to accommodate.  She also said that, at the time of the decision to announce the lay-offs, there was uncertainty around the EWSS, its continuation and what form any continuation would take.  There is no uncertainty around the EWSS now.  There is no uncertainty about its continuance or what form that continuance will take.  The EWSS will continue until 31 December and will be in place for the entirety of the period for which Cork Airport is to be shut.</p><p>Does the T&aacute;naiste believe it is appropriate for an employer which has been in receipt of the EWSS since its inception, in addition to other State supports, to take workers off the company books while continuing to be part of the scheme and continuing to negotiate for other supports?  As a representative of the State that is providing these supports, is the T&aacute;naiste prepared to voice support for these workers and to indicate support for their very modest and reasonable ask that they be kept on the company books while these repairs take place?</p></speech>

This is a necessary investment in the airport.  For obvious reasons, it is probably the right time to do it given that the level of air travel has reduced so much because of the pandemic.  It is welcome that this work is taking place.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy pointed out, the aviation sector has received a lot of financial support from the Government and the taxpayer.  It is now running close to &euro;500 million.  This includes employment wage subsidies to the airlines, loans, wage subsidies for the airport, direct grants to all of the airports except Dublin Airport and funding for marketing supports.  Anything that is happening with regard to Aer Lingus's employees in Cork Airport is an industrial relations matter and, therefore, principally a matter for the employer and its staff.  It is a matter for the company and the unions and it is for them to engage.</p>  <p>  I do not know enough about the dispute to comment on it definitively.  That is why I need to be limited in what I say.  However, if it is possible for Aer Lingus to keep those staff members on the payroll using the wage subsidy scheme, it would certainly make sense to do so.  They might be on a reduced income but at least they would still be on the payroll and would still be connected to the company.  It might not be that simple.  The Deputy will now what happened with the base at Shannon, for example.  When we discussed this with Aer Lingus and when it spoke publicly to others, the company made it very clear that it would have closed the base in any case, even if there had not been a pandemic.  There were other reasons.  It needed to restructure, reform and modernise the business.  I do not know if that is a factor here or not.  I encourage the employer to engage with the employees.  I encourage Aer Lingus to talk to the union and see what can be worked out.</p></speech>

Today, 1 July, is when the official closure and associated redundancies kick in.  Within Aer Lingus nationally, workers are facing the threat of a five-year pay freeze, pay cuts, cuts to starting rates, deep cuts to the sick pay scheme and to duty allowances, and so on.  This is clearly a reason for workers not wanting to be taken off the books.  The company cannot legally change the terms and conditions while they are off the books but it can use the fact that workers are off the books to strengthen its bargaining position and to try to push through changes of that kind.  Workers in Cork Airport, not only Aer Lingus workers but all workers at the airport, find it incredible that Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin, Coveney and Michael McGrath, and the T&aacute;naiste as a representative of the Government, are not prepared to go beyond a pious wish and apply pressure to the airport employers on this issue.  This issue is not going to go away.  If anything, it is going to grow louder as we move towards September.</p></speech>

It was booming before the pandemic but that has fundamentally changed.  The pandemic has led to a dramatic reduction in air travel.  It may be a very long time before it recovers because this pandemic will affect parts of the world for years.  That will have an impact on air travel.  I also believe that the adoption of new technologies such as videoconferencing will mean that there will be much less business travel in the years ahead.  Business travel is the most profitable area of air travel.  This means that we may see fewer routes and fewer people travelling for quite some time.</p>  <p>  There is also the impact of climate change, to which aviation contributes.  I understand that it is the policy of Deputy Barry's party, or, if not his, one of the other far-left parties, to nationalise the airlines again and wind them down as part of the response to climate change.  I am not sure the Deputy tells that to the workers in Shannon or Cork but that is the policy of some on the far left and some who describe themselves as eco-socialists.</p> <p>On this issue, it is important that engagement happens between the company and the union.</p></speech>

While it is understood that the cost of premiums is related to the level of risk, there seems to be a sweeping view taken when calculating that risk.  Practicalities determine there is seldom, if ever, an individual assessment of risk carried out, which results in some businesses being penalised for the failings of others.</p>  <p>  The Alliance for Insurance Reform recently made a presentation to Department of Finance, which outlined that as many as 35 sectors are either struggling to get insurance or cannot obtain it at all.  Those who have managed to get insurance cover have done so at a high cost and are left with a limited number of insurers who will engage with them.  Those who fail to get a quote for insurance are left with no alternative but to cease their operations and abandon their plans.  The denial of access to insurance cover is an immediate threat.  We are in danger of losing thousands of small businesses and voluntary organisations, including adventure centres for children, caravan and camping parks, bike hire shops, equestrian sports, home care providers, festivals and events.  For example, a popular, long-established attraction, Aqua Splash, Dromineer, County Tipperary, reopened in May when restrictions were eased.  In exhaustive efforts to renew their insurance, it contacted numerous insurers in Ireland and the UK and not one would insure the business.  Unfortunately, it is not alone in this dilemma.  It appears anything to do with water sports or child play centres has become a taboo for insurance companies.  This prevailing attitude impacts on a wide range of activities and services. </p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has established an office for insurance competition to encourage greater competition in the insurance sector.  It is up and running since last December.  There appears to be little progress.  We have no reports of insurers contacted or new deals done.  There are no announcements of new underwriters setting up in Ireland to take advantage of reforms that have happened and are due to happen.  There is no sign of the expected new entrants to the insurance market.  Where are the specialists in underwriting areas such as child-oriented enterprises, hospitality and tourism, leisure and the creative and sports sectors?  The number of sectors that cannot get cover gives an indication of the scale and urgency of the supply issue.  The market will take time to respond to reforms.  In the interim, the Government must intervene with a sense of urgency on behalf of the sectors I have identified.</p></speech>

I share his concerns about it, as Minister responsible for employment and enterprise.  I assure the House that insurance reform is a priority for the Government.  We established a Cabinet committee sub-group on insurance reform, which I chair.  It met yesterday and is overseeing the implementation of the action plan for insurance.  That is all about bringing down costs for consumers and businesses, introducing more competition to the market, preventing fraud and reducing the burden and cost on businesses and community and voluntary organisations.  We will publish our six-monthly update report in the next week.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made since we started implementing the action plan, for example, the introduction of new personal injury guidelines.  The latest data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, indicate that payouts on claims made through that board have gone down 50% since the guidelines were introduced.  We expect to see that reflected in the courts and in lower premiums, though not 50% lower, as the guidelines begin to take effect.</p>  <p>  We have established an office to promote competition in the insurance market chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  It talks to insurance companies and underwriters and asks them to look again at Ireland and to enter our insurance market.  The Deputy will be aware that one large underwriter, Berkshire Hathaway, has expressed an interest in coming back into Ireland in relation to professional indemnity insurance, which is an important issue.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill has now been enacted and will help us to crack down on insurance fraud and exaggerated claims.  That Act will be commenced in the next few weeks by the Minister.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is developing proposals to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in order that more claims are settled there, thereby significantly reducing legal costs.</p>  <p>  It may be particularly relevant to what the Deputy mentioned that the Department of Justice has recently completed its review of the Occupiers' Liability Act, including the issue of the duty of care and notices and waivers.  That is there to increase protections for consumers, businesses, sporting clubs and community groups.  The Minister of State is working on formal proposals that can be brought to Government for legislative change to rebalance the expectations in businesses versus those who use those businesses as to who gets injured and why.</p></speech>

This appears to be gaining prevalence and should be highlighted in this House.  The Garda has in the past issued warnings to motorists about ghost broking, which is an insurance scam to which many people have fallen victim.</p>  <p>  This scam sees motorists being charged for fake insurance policies which give them the impression they are fully covered when, in reality, no cover has been provided.  The vast majority of fraudulent companies offering such policies are to be found online.  They typically state they represent legitimate insurers.  The policies they sell are obtained from insurance companies using false information and changed before being sold to customers.  The obvious impact of this is that the purchaser does not hold a valid certificate of insurance and there is no cover in place.  This leaves them liable for any damage caused or offence committed as a result of having no motor insurance.  We should have a buyer beware campaign to educate the public and stamp out such activity.</p></speech>

It is illegal but it is often difficult to enforce the law against an Internet entity that may not be based in the State.  I will take up the Deputy's suggestion of an information campaign to warn consumers about this scam so they might be able to avoid being ripped off in this way.  I will speak to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission about that, or perhaps the Central Bank, whichever relevant body could run such a campaign.</p></speech>

Instead of offering apologies on my behalf in a patronising way, maybe he would consider an apology to the tens of thousands of people locked out of the housing market after his Government of ten years, or to the hundreds of thousands paying eye-watering rent as a result of his policy.</p>  <p>  I will focus on what the Chief Medical Officer said yesterday in confirming that the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, advice on changes to the vaccine roll-out for younger people was not factored into NPHET's modelling.  It is reported the Taoiseach advised the Cabinet that this was factored into the modelling when the Cabinet was making the decision.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm which one it is?</p>  <p>  The key ingredient to reopening society is an accelerated vaccine roll-out and we need to see a plan.  When will we see the new modelling which builds on the NIAC recommendations?  When we will get sight of the revised timelines and targets for the vaccine roll-out?  This is a race between the variants and the vaccine roll-out but one would think, looking at the Government response, that it is a bicycle race.  There was no contingency planning.  When will we see these plans?</p></speech>

It constitutes workplace bullying in pretty much any other scenario and when the Deputy does it, he should apologise for it.  Perhaps he does not think so and perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not think so but I do.  The standards we uphold in this House are what people follow and if the Deputy behaves in the way he does in a workplace, he sends a signal to other people that it is okay for them to behave in that way.  I do not think he should do that and we will come back to this another time.</p></speech>

The chief scientific officer, Professor Mark Ferguson, did the report.  It was never implemented because of issues in relation to NPHET.  He suggested serial testing was very effective in respect of opening up society, particularly for travel, but obviously, we are now dealing with issues relating to hospitality and other industries.</p> <p>According to the Minister for Health, there is now another expert rapid test group, as it is called, to be headed up by the very eminent Professor Mary Horgan.  What are the timelines for this group, what are its terms of reference and how is it differentiated from Professor Ferguson's group?</p></speech>

The group Professor Horgan is now chairing is that implementation group.  It follows on from the Ferguson report.  We have very advanced plans for antigen testing in third level institutions in September and October.  That is part of this initiative.  I have guidance on antigen testing in the workplace, which we are encouraging employers to do, and a lot of them are.  We will be carrying out antigen testing at a pilot concert quite soon.  It is all that kind of work.</p></speech>

We met peacefully and in a socially distanced way at the Garden of Remembrance and walked to Store Street Garda station.  I was there not only to support a family I have known since I was a child, although that certainly was one of the reasons, and in recognition of the collective trauma that still exists in the north inner city arising out of the events that led to Terence's death 16 years ago, I was also there because, as a public representative, a Member of this House and a person who grew up in the community, I want to highlight the many questions that remain about his death.  The T&aacute;naiste will probably tell me that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, carried out an investigation into the death more than ten years ago, and I accept that.  What is the purpose of an investigation, however, when so many questions remain?  I am asking again for a new inquiry, preferably a full, independent inquiry, into the death of Terence Wheelock.  I will continue asking for it until the truth is established.  In the absence of that, we cannot have healing in the north inner city.</p></speech>

Does the T&aacute;naiste agree this is not good enough given the already unsustainable rents people are paying?  In the rent pressure zones, we have seen 20% increases over the past four years, with people paying &euro;2,000, &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000 a month, which is completely unaffordable.  Is it not time to ensure that no further rent increases are allowed?  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that we already have backdated, suspended rent reviews from the Covid period.  Do we not need to institute a complete rent freeze for the foreseeable future and bring in rent controls that will set rents at affordable levels?  By the way, from what I can see, the proposed amendments will do nothing for the setting of new rents on build-to-rent apartments and so on-----</p></speech>

We are going to change that now so that prices are linked to the harmonised index of consumer prices - inflation, essentially - and that will mean rent increases, depending on inflation, of probably no more than 0.7% or just above 1%, which is where inflation is running at the moment.  I think that will be welcomed by most people who are renting.  One thing we need to bear in mind, and it may not be popular to say it but it is the truth, is that the vast majority of people who are landlords - I am not one of them, by the way - are not investment funds or wealthy people.  One person's rent is another person's mortgage.  There are many people who own houses or apartments and the rent they receive for them barely covers their mortgages.  For some people, that rental income is their pension and it is the only pension they have.</p></speech>

However, it now appears that, for many, this was a false dawn.  Many young people across County Tipperary have contacted my office in frustration and anger due to unacceptable delays.  Applicants who applied in February will not be offered an appointment until October.  In one particular case, a young woman from Tipperary who needs to complete her test was given no fewer than seven different dates, ranging from April 2020 to July of this year.  All seven appointments were cancelled and she has now been given an appointment for 23 December, which is one year and eight months after her first appointment.  This is not tolerable for young motorists.  Young people are missing opportunities for apprenticeships, work experience, education and agricultural work.  What plans does the Government have to urgently address these delays?</p></speech>

A gradual reopening of in-person driver theory test centres commenced on 8 June.  Essential driver training for essential workers who have not completed their training recommended on 10 May.  Driving tests for essential workers are being prioritised.  There will be a gradual reopening of driver testing for non-essential workers, which has commenced already.  Forty new temporary driving testers have been hired and should begin work at the end of June.  Sanction has been granted to recruit a further 40 testers.  I absolutely acknowledge that there is a backlog, which is very frustrating for people who need to get on the road and need the freedom that brings, such as being able to get to work or college and do all the things they need to do.  We are working to try to get through that backlog over the next couple of months.</p></speech>

What he said about the theory test shows that the situation is a shambles.  Apprenticeship schemes are also unable to function.  You need two things for an apprenticeship, namely, a good employer who will give people the opportunity and colleges to provide the courses.  People cannot get into the colleges because they are not functioning.  I had a young man on to me this morning who, even though he is in an apprenticeship scheme for six months, has to wait until February 2022 to get his college place.  That mean he cannot move on and his employer will have issues as well.  It also means he cannot get a mortgage because of his rate of pay and everything else.  He cannot make progress.  Apprenticeships are vital to this economy.  The situation was bad enough before Covid and it is ten times worse now.  This delay is unacceptable because employers will not be anxious to take on apprentices, and one cannot blame them, when they cannot get them into training and there is no structure around it.  We need to deal with the apprenticeship schemes.  As I said, the system was bad even before Covid.  We need to deal with the colleges that are not taking in apprentices.  They must play their part.</p></speech>

As he knows, we have a very ambitious plan in regard to apprenticeships, which involves getting up to 10,000 apprentices a year by 2025.  It is being led by the Minister, Deputy Harris.  We are now providing incentives and grant aid to employers to take on apprentices and that is showing some positive effects.  In the context of the particular case the Deputy raised, if he want to pass on the details to me or the Minister, we will see if there is anything we can do to help.</p></speech>

That is borne out by data from Public Health England.  The bottom line is that even if - and it is a big if - the vaccination targets are met, Covid-19 variants, and perhaps new variants of it, will still be in circulation and still being transmitted next winter.  Last February and March, an expert group on the role of ventilation in reducing transmission of Covid-19 reported to the Department of Health.  Nothing much has happened since then.  It is a year since I met with people from a small company in Shannon, CW Applied Technology, which is looking at air sterilisation measures.  It is one of many companies doing this, but the Government does not seem to be advancing the issue.  Whatever about an outdoor summer, we are not going to have an outdoor winter.</p></speech>

It is a really beautiful place to be, particularly along the beach when the sun is shining.</p> <p>However, I know what Ireland is like in winter, as does the Deputy.  We are all increasingly aware and cognisant of the importance of good ventilation in indoor settings.  It is actually something that is specifically provided for in the return to work safely protocol and there is a requirement under the health and safety Act that employers ensure workplaces are adequately ventilated.  There are many ways of doing that but I think the Deputy puts his finger on the fact that it is something on which we will have to do more work between now and the winter.</p></speech>

This is part of a broad vision and network of greenways that will link counties Kerry, Clare, Tipperary and Limerick, with Limerick city as the hub.  We hope to bring the greenway back into Limerick city and be able to extend it through east Clare up to Scarriff and, in the long run, down to Cahir in Tipperary.  These greenways will serve community transport in terms of people being able to get from village to village.  There is a significant case for them in the context of rural regeneration and, of course, they will be biodiversity corridors as well.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and the Government support continued investment in rural sustainable infrastructure such as greenways and will he ensure that small and medium enterprises in rural areas are in a position to take advantage of the economic opportunities?</p></speech>

I am a huge fan of greenways.  All Members have seen the enormous success the Great Western Greenway has been in Mayo, as has the D&eacute;ise greenway in Waterford.   I have been on the great southern trail with Deputy Griffin and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, on a few occasions and I was delighted to hear that it is now being opened and extended.  It is a long time since I was fully across the project.  I dealt with it while I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Like the Deputy, I am a huge supporter of greenways.  We need to make sure we get them to go ahead and that we work with landowners and so on to make sure there are no missing links between them.  Of course, a wonderful greenway yet to be developed is the one in south Kerry.  I look forward to seeing it being developed soon.</p></speech>

Thankfully, many of them are now exiting the PUP support because they no longer need to avail of it.  However, there are thousands in the entertainment sector who will find themselves on a very rocky road back to work.  It is not a sector that can be switched on or off overnight; doing so will take a considerable period.  The way it is now proposed to shape the remaining months of the PUP is very problematic for those who work in that sector.  Ultimately, they will transition to what has been described as a jobseeker's payment.  These people already have jobs and they are very anxious to get back to those jobs, which they love.  They are prevented from doing so.  I ask that the Government urgently consider the criteria attaching to the PUP to ensure those who have jobs but are prevented from returning to them can continue to have access to adequate payment to support them and their families.</p></speech>

I appreciate the dilemma that exists.  We did take a look at phasing out PUP on a sectoral basis but it is not as straightforward as that either.  While retail may be open, many people formerly employed in the sector in the airport have not yet returned to work.  While a handful of sandwich shops have re-opened, there are sandwich shops all over the city centre that are still closed because office workers are not back yet.  Doing it on a sectoral basis is difficult but it is not something we are ruling out.  One thing we should try to do and want to try to do is to get music, entertainment and the arts going again.  I know there has been a very negative reaction to the idea of using corona passes to get things going again but I hope people will not rule that out without giving it full consideration because it might actually be the pathway or the ticket to reopening live events such as live music without social distancing for people who are fully vaccinated, immune or maybe even tested.  It might actually be the way we can reopen, not just in the Delta wave but also in future waves.</p></speech>

The Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and NPHET have said they did not cancel them.  This is no way to treat people.  One cannot be surprised by everything.  A few days before confirmations and first communions were due to happen in Ringsend, they were cancelled.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  These are a significant days for children and their parents.  They are very expensive days and they are days for families.  People can get married and celebrate that.  Up to 50 people can gather in a church.  People can go to the cinema.  The children who were due to have their first communion or confirmation have been in class together every day for months, yet first communions and confirmations are banned in Ringsend.  This has all gone too far and young people are paying the price.  Will the T&aacute;naiste see sense and allow communions and confirmations to go ahead?</p></speech>

It was not an off-the-cuff remark, by the way; it was an on-the-record response to a question I was asked at a press conference.  Those are the facts.  What the CMO said yesterday is that NPHET did not recommend the cancellation of communions and confirmations because, in the view of NPHET, they were not supposed to be taking place anyway.  We had hoped it would be possible for them to resume after 5 July but that is not the case.  The advice from NPHET and the public health doctors and scientists is clear and is that people who are not vaccinated should not gather indoors.  Unfortunately, that is what communions and confirmations inevitably involve, namely, people who are not vaccinated gathering indoors and, on some occasions, having family gatherings and parties thereafter and that results in clusters and the spread of Covid.  That is the rationale behind the decision but I appreciate it is a big disappointment for a lot of people.</p></speech>

Ireland is the only country that was not in compliance with the regulations.  We have missed this deadline, although it was not a deadline for us.  There are many who are concerned we will miss the deadline of 19 July.   We are told we will be emailed our vaccine record but nobody submitted their email address when they applied for the vaccine and there is concern in that regard.  Can the T&aacute;naiste guarantee that the system will be live and operational by 19 July?  In terms of the potential for an expanded role for a certificate, will antigen testing be incorporated in the system if it is used domestically, but also in terms of international travel?</p></speech>

We are the only country in the EU that has not done so but the regulation does allow countries six weeks to comply.  As we stated from the outset, we intend to have that in place for 19 July.  That is being worked on at the moment.  I understand there are some significant difficulties but we are still confident that we will have the digital Covid certificate out to most people who are entitled to one before 19 July.  There will be some teething and adjustment problems and issues as we try to implement it through the airports but we are pressing ahead with it.</p></speech>

The tourism and hospitality sector and young people feel particularly left behind.  All Members share the frustration that is out there.  We all know that Covid-19 has not been fair on anyone and we all want to be on the far side of this pandemic.  The vaccine is our best way out of it.  I, like so many others, have not been offered a vaccine yet and I am really encouraged by the national immunisation advisory council, NIAC, advice that the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines can be given to young people because the benefits outweigh the risks.  I will take any vaccine I am given, as will most people my age.  Can the T&aacute;naiste give us 30-something-year-olds and the 20-somethings clarity on what an accelerated vaccine programme will look like for us?  Will we be able to get vaccinated in our local pharmacy?  How quickly will the roll-out ramp up?</p></speech>

It allows us to speed up delivery of a second dose for people waiting for one, particularly those who had the AstraZeneca vaccine.  That will be done in a matter of two to three weeks at the most.  For younger people, that is, those under 40 who have not been vaccinated yet, it will speed that up as well.  We are just working out the logistics and implications of that.  One thing at which we are looking is making the Janssen vaccine available through pharmacies to younger people.  It is available to the over-50s now.  We are also looking at speeding up the online registration process because we now have a bigger number of vaccine to offer people in their 30s and, subsequently, those in their 20s.  However, what I cannot do at the moment is give exact dates because we do not yet have exact volumes.</p> <p>We need to talk to the pharmacists and the HSE needs to talk to its staff.</p></speech>

Col&aacute;iste Eoin in Hacketstown is a growing school with a large rural catchment area.  It will have 280 students in the next school year.  During the Covid pandemic, the principal managed to get an extra bus service for the school, which picked up students living in rural areas.  He has been told that the service will be discontinued in the new school year.  That is unacceptable.  The service was in place and the school needs it.  I ask that the service be continued.</p>  <p>  I have also recently been contacted by parents who want to renew school transport tickets for their children with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  If the child has a valid medical card, parents can renew the ticket online.  However, when parents have visited the website to do this, they have received error messages.  One lady contacted Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of the matter and was told that because of the cyberattack on the HSE, the company is asking parents to pay the price of the ticket for the first school term on the basis that they will receive a refund later.  The cost for the ticket for the first school term is &euro;175.  That particular lady does not have &euro;175.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  We must sort it out to enable people to visit the Bus &Eacute;ireann website to apply for tickets with their child's medical card.  I ask that the matter be looked into urgently.</p></speech>

This is completely unacceptable, disheartening and, quite simply, not good enough.  It has taken 12 years to get to this point for those affected in Mayo and Donegal.  I know, as does the T&aacute;naiste, that people in County Clare will not tolerate the continued attitude of the Government of burying its head in the sand.

The centre provides day and residential services to 111 service users with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities.  Since 2018, it has been in discussions with the HSE to enable it to provide urgent respite and residential care services.  The centre is now in a position to provide residential care infrastructure but it needs the HSE to grant funding of &euro;506,000 per annum to enable it to provide a 24-7 respite service.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, it is great for the development of service users to get a break from home.  Access to respite care and facilities are also of huge benefit to ageing parents.  MooreHaven urgently needs to be able to provide this respite service.  I ask the Tanaiste to press the HSE to put the funding in place.</p></speech>

Since the Government took the decision in this regard, a number of things have changed.  First, the figures the Government received on Monday night, imperfect though they may be, clearly show that this pandemic is not over.  Therefore, rigorous infection control measures in nursing homes are essential.  Second, from today, the HSE has restricted visiting in certain nursing homes in Donegal.  That clearly shows the need for these measures.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ask the Minister to look again at continuing this funding to ensure that there are control measures in our nursing homes for our most vulnerable residents?</p></speech>

Like all temporary schemes, it has to come to an end.  The big change that has happened in nursing homes is that the residents and staff are now almost all fully vaccinated.  Thankfully, the number of cases and outbreaks has been, and continues to be, very small.  However, infection control is always a good thing, particularly in nursing homes.  What probably needs to happen is an engagement involving the sector, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Department of Health and the HSE with a view to enhancing the existing scheme and taking account of the increased costs that have arisen as a result of the need to improve infection control into the future.</p></speech>

Following the publication of the report by Dr. John Bradley, the Government needs to stop prevaricating and deliver on the western rail corridor as part of the national development plan.  Is it in the national development plan?  Does the Government recognise that it is a key piece of infrastructure for the development of the west of Ireland?</p></speech>

Builders are unable to stand over quotations for anything more than a few days.  While it is an issue for all those involved in construction, from big road projects down to individual house construction, it is particularly difficult for older people who are building extensions for bathrooms, including the installation of walk-in showers and so on.  These people are dealing with their local councils in respect of the grant.  No matter how fast councils approve grants and even when they max out on them, older people are getting hit with the impact of increased prices.  What action can be taken to address this issue?  Have Departmental officials met with representative of the industry to discuss dealing with the issue of dramatically increasing price of construction materials?</p></speech>

Previous Governments have paid lip service to this issue.  So much so, that thousands of people would still be alive had it not been for the lip service that Governments have paid to this issue.  We have to take a different approach.  The current approach does not work.  Criminalising people for drug use simply does not work and is completely to the person and to society as a whole.  The programme for Government states that a citizens' assembly should be convened to consider the matter.  That is good.  However, we need to go beyond that.  We need to take action to save lives.  We must take a different approach to drug misuse, because the current approach does not work.  It costs lives.  If the Government does not change its approach, it will cost more lives.</p></speech>

Of course, as the Deputy is aware, other reports have been produced on the issue, such as the Jasper Consulting report, which came to different conclusions.</p>  <p>  The Government is very aware of the problems being created by the increase in the cost of building materials.  A lot of is down to international commodity prices not entirely under our control.  However, we are engaging with the industry on it to see what we can do.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Gino Kenny, the Government has invested a lot in addiction services in recent years.  They have been expanded significantly, including in my own constituency.  We are trying to move ahead with the plan for the supervised injecting centre at Merchant's Quay, but we have run into difficulties on that.</p>  <p>  I am of a similar view to the Deputy on the issue of decriminalisation.  I do not believe the criminalisation model works.  It leaves people with convictions and makes it harder for them to get on with their lives and to engage with services in order to get the help they need.  Drug dealing and drug gangs are very different from what the Deputy is referring to.  We both agree on that.  As Taoiseach, I set up an expert group to consider the issue.  It came to a different conclusion.  However, the matter is not one on which the Government has closed its mind.  Perhaps the convening of a citizens&rsquo; assembly is a better way to tease it out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100028#EE00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>We are here today to discuss the legislation that will give effect to some of the decisions announced on 1 June as part of the Government's economic plan, which sets out a new phase of supports for this next stage of recovery as businesses reopen.  In the past few weeks, it has been possible to ease restrictions as more and more citizens, including the most vulnerable, are vaccinated.  A more cautious approach is being taken for the next phase of reopening following the most recent public health advice.  The Government recognises this is difficult for many sectors, and particularly for so many businesses that believed they would be able to open next week.</p><p>We are seeing significant reductions in the number in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, as employees go back to work.  According to Department of Social Protection data, nearly 90,000 people came off the PUP in the four weeks leading to 22 June, and a further decrease, of 16,000, occurred in the week to 29 June.</p><p>This Bill is relatively short but it provides certainty to businesses as public health restrictions are eased.  It allows them to plan as they reopen and resume trading at a normal level.  This is urgent legislation since two of the Government support schemes, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme, CRSS, were both due to expire on 30 June.  However, the Revenue Commissioners may operate these schemes for a short period under care and management provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act so payments can continue.</p><p>I pay tribute to the Revenue Commissioners and staff who operated the various schemes, including the EWSS and the CRSS, that provided much-needed support to businesses in a very responsive way.  The Minister for Finance has asked me to inform the House that he requested the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to agree to waive pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill in recognition of its urgent objective of providing necessary supports to businesses.  The committee has agreed to this waiver.</p><p>The Bill will provide a legislative basis for the actions agreed by the Government at the start of June to support businesses.  Let me outline these measures.  The EWSS will be extended to 31 December 2021.  The CRSS will be extended and enhanced to provide additional supports to businesses upon reopening and give certainty to businesses still directly affected by public health restrictions.  A new additional business support scheme, to be called the business resumption support scheme, BRSS, will be for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions, and it will be implemented in September 2021.  The tax debt warehousing scheme will be extended.  This is to allow the period in which liabilities arising can be warehoused to be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest-free period during 2022 and to include overpayments under the EWSS in the scheme.  The reduced rate of VAT, 9%, applying temporarily to hospitality and tourism-related goods and services will be extended until 31 August 2022.</p><p>The Bill will also put the financial resolutions of 19 May, which introduced the 10% stamp duty charge on multiple purchases of houses, on a permanent statutory footing.  In addition, on the advice of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Bill will provide for an exemption from the 10% stamp duty charge for the provision of the mortgage-to-rent scheme by private sector participants.  Mortgage to rent is an important part of the broader social and affordable housing agenda.  Members should note the Minister's intention, again on the advice of the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage, to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to facilitate an exemption from the 10% stamp duty charge in circumstances where houses are bought by investors for leasing to local authorities.</p><p>The Bill is relatively short and contains 15 sections.  I will run through them in brief.  The first 12 deal with the various business supports and the remaining ones deal with the stamp duty issue and the financial resolutions passed by the D&aacute;il on 19 May.</p><p>Section 1 is a definitions section.</p><p>Section 2 provides for the extension of the EWSS to 31 September 2021 and the retention of the current enhanced subsidy rates until 30 September 2021.  It does thi<b>s</b>by amending section 28B, inserted by the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  It also provides for the retention of the 30% reduction in turnover or orders threshold and a modification to widen the reference period to assess eligibility for the scheme, with effect from 1 July 2021.  The EWSS is a central pillar of our response to this pandemic, supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the links between employers and employees.  As of today, direct subsidy payments of over &euro;3.75 billion have been made, with an additional &euro;611 million given in PRSI relief to over 50,300 employers in respect of 600,000 workers.</p><p>Sections 3 and 4 make several changes in relation to the CRSS.  They provide for the extension of the scheme to September 2021.  The power of the Minister for Finance to extend the scheme further, to 31 December 2021, by order, is not changed.  I will undertake an assessment in September to consider the extension of the scheme to the end of December 2021.</p><p>In addition, section 4 provides for enhanced restart week payments under the scheme for businesses reopening after a period of restriction.  Under the amended provisions, the level of restart week payment a business may claim will depend on the date on which it reopens.  I will go into detail on that.  Where the business reopened between 29 April and 1 June 2021, it may claim for a restart payment equal to two weeks at double the normal rate for the CRSS, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000.  Where the business reopens between 2 June 2021 and 31 December 2021, it may claim for a restart payment equal to three weeks at double the normal rate for the CRSS, and that is subject to a maximum weekly amount of &euro;10,000.  In all other cases, the standard restart week payment will apply, which is one week at the standard rate for the CRSS, subject to a maximum weekly amount of &euro;5,000.  A business may qualify once for either the double restart week payment or the triple restart week payment.  The scheme has been very effective in providing targeted support to businesses that were forced to close or restrict access to their premises on foot of public health restrictions.  There are currently 22,800 businesses, with 26,800 premises, registered for the CRSS with the Revenue Commissioners.  In total, &euro;636 million has been claimed by businesses under the scheme, with over 11,000 premises claiming restart payments as restrictions have eased in some sectors.</p><p>Following the announcement on Tuesday, 29 June 2021 that the reopening of indoor dining will not proceed next Monday, as planned, the Government agreed that the CRSS would be amended to allow for a double week payment to businesses that remain closed or are significantly restricted under the public health restrictions from the week commencing 5 July for two weeks, subject to the statutory cap of &euro;5,000 per week.  The Minister intends to make an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to provide for these additional payments.</p><p>Section 5 provides for the BRSS, which gives a new support to businesses that have been significantly impacted throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  It inserts a new section, section 485A, into the Taxes Consolidation Act that makes provision for the BRSS.  I will now outline the scheme's key features.</p> <p>First, the scheme is first available to affected self-employed individuals and companies who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are "chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D".  It is also available to persons who carry on a trade in partnership and any trading activity carried on by charities and sporting bodies.  To qualify under this scheme, a business must be able to demonstrate that its turnover under the defined specified period of 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 will be no more than 25% of their turnover in 2019.  Additional provisions are made in respect of businesses that commenced trading later than the end of 2019.  Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim for payment calculated on the basis of three weeks of 10% of the first &euro;20,000 weekly turnover and 5% thereafter.  This is based on average turnover for 2019 and will be subject to a maximum payment of &euro;15,000.  Payments made under the scheme will be treated as an advance credit for trading expenses.</p> <p> To make a claim under the scheme a number of other conditions must be satisfied including that the person has an up-to-date tax clearance certificate, that he or she has complied with their value-added tax obligations, that he or she is not entitled to make a claim for the CRSS on 1 September 2021 and that the business is actively carrying on its trade and has an intention to continue to do so.  The person must register the claim on the Revenue online service and must make a declaration that the person satisfies the conditions to make a claim under this section.  Provision is made for the publication of the name of claimants of BRSS on the Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p> <p> This new scheme is designed to support some of the worst affected businesses during the pandemic and especially those that continue to be significantly impacted, even after the easing of public health restrictions.  The scheme is designed to be as inclusive as possible.  It is subject to the key requirement that turnover is significantly impacted and will apply first to businesses that qualified for CRSS but no longer do so on 1 September.  Second, it will apply to businesses that qualify for supports provided to employers under the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Third, it will apply to businesses that may have qualified for other sectoral supports such as the small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism business continuity scheme.</p> <p> As I have said, the intention of the scheme is to assist businesses which were significantly impacted throughout the pandemic and to be as inclusive as possible.  Anchors necessarily included in the CRSS, such as that to have a fixed business premises and that access to this premises was restricted or prohibited, are not included in the BRSS.  In addition, the scheme will be open to sectors that did not qualify for CRSS because of specific tax requirements, such as charities and sporting bodies.  It is intended that the registration for the BRSS will open from 1 September.</p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, the Finance Act 2020 provided that a temporarily reduced rate of value added tax of 9% applies from 1 November 2022 to 31 December 2021 to the supply of restaurant and catering services, guest and holiday accommodation, and entertainment services such as admission to cinemas, theatres, museums, fairgrounds, amusement park and sporting facilities, as well as to hairdressers and the use of certain printed matter such as brochures, maps and programmes.  Section 6 extends the application of the 9% VAT rate to these supplies to continue until 31 August 2022.</p> <p> I mentioned earlier the ability of the Revenue Commissioners to provide much-needed and timely support to businesses.  Debt warehousing has provided over 86,000 individual businesses with vital liquidity support.  This includes 2,600 large cases and medium enterprise division taxpayers, which has significant employment implications.</p> <p> At the end of May some &euro;2.4 billion of tax debt had been warehoused.  The main components were VAT at &euro;1.3 billion and employer PAYE at &euro;1.1 billion.  </p> <p> The next sections of the Bill, sections 7 to 12, make further provision for warehousing.  In all cases the warehousing scheme will have three phases or periods.  Period 1 will be extended until 31 December 2021; period 2, called the zero interest phase, will run from 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2022, during which time no interest will be charged on warehoused relevant tax from period 1; and period 3, the reduced interest phase, will run from 1 January 2023 until the relevant tax is repaid to Revenue.  During Period 3, interest will be charged at approximately 3% per annum on warehoused relevant tax from period 1.</p> <p> Warehousing is available to businesses which, as a consequence of Covid-19, are unable to pay their relevant tax and which have filed all relevant PAYE and EWSS returns.  The extension of the scheme and streamlining of the dates of each period will give clarity and certainty to businesses as to their tax liabilities for the remainder of 2021 and will assist them with their cash flow as they seek to recover from such a difficult trading period.  Section 7 provides for the warehousing of EWSS overpayments received by employers which must be refunded to Revenue.  Section 8 deals with refunds of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, payments.  Section 9 deals with PAYE, section 10 deals with certain income tax, section 11 deals with VAT and section 12 deals with PRSI.</p> <p> Deputies will recall that a financial resolution was approved by the D&aacute;il on 19 May 2021 in order to amend the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 through the insertion of a new section 31E titled &ldquo;Stamp duty on certain acquisitions of residential property&rdquo;.  The purpose of this new section is to impose a higher stamp duty on multiple purchases of residential units, and the financial resolution allowed it to have immediate effect.  It forms part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the recent phenomenon of the purchasing in bulk by commercial institutional investors of homes at or near completion in competition with the owner-occupier market.</p> <p> Section 13 of this Bill places Section 31E of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 on a permanent statutory footing.   As the Members will recall, this section imposes a 10% rate of stamp duty on the acquisition, on or after 20 May 2021, of certain types of residential units where an aggregate of ten or more such units is acquired during a rolling 12-month period.  This is a significant increase on the standard stamp duty rates that apply to the acquisition of residential property, which is 1% of the value of property up to &euro;1 million and 2% of the value that exceeds &euro;1 million.  The 10% rate applies in respect of the acquisition of residential units, such as houses and duplexes but not apartments.  The measure is intended to disincentivise the purchase of multiple residential units by a single corporate entity or individual.  The section also contains a number of anti-avoidance provisions.</p> <p> Turning to section 14, a key area in the broader social housing agenda is the mortgage to rent, MTR, scheme.  Approved housing bodies, which are exempt from the 10% stamp duty, are an integral part of the MTR scheme and their participation in the scheme has enabled a significant number of borrowers to remain in their home as social housing tenants.  In an effort to increase the potential of the scheme to meet the needs of more borrowers, the Government has provided for non-approved housing body entities, that is, private sector participants, to purchase properties under the scheme to increase the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  However, as things stand, these private sector participants are not exempt from the higher stamp duty rate.  The Government has agreed that an exemption from the 10% stamp duty would be provided for them and section 14 of this Bill is drafted to facilitate this.</p> <p> Finally, section 15 is the usual section with the Short Title of the Bill.</p> <p> In conclusion, the Government has kept its promise that there will be no cliff-edge to supports for businesses and it is extending and enhancing supports to business as they reopen.  The new business resumption support scheme will provide additional support to the businesses worst affected by the restrictions imposed due to the pandemic.  The EWSS and CRSS will be extended.  The tax debt warehousing scheme will be extended to the end of this year, with no interest charged throughout 2022.</p> <p> On 19 May, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, informed the House of his intention to place the financial resolution agreed that evening on a permanent legislative footing.  This Bill will do that, as well as taking care of certain other aspects of the stamp duty for multiple purchases of houses and I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

For the third time, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the financial provisions which will support our economy and ensure that it is in a position to recover strongly from the impact of this pandemic.</p>  <p> In this regard I draw attention to recent comments made by the Minister for Finance during his election campaign in Dublin Bay South, during which it is reported that he said that Sinn F&eacute;in are against all of the measures that laid the foundations for us to be able to help our country during the pandemic. This is such nonsense from the Minister.  It seems that the Minister has truly lost the run of himself and has chosen to respond to the fact the Government is not getting the reception that it expected by making groundless accusations.</p> <p>As the Minister knows, my party supported the previous two financial provisions Bills in response to Covid-19.  Indeed, we sought to improve that legislation and the schemes it introduced.  For example, we sought to ensure that women returning from maternity leave would not be excluded from the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  Such changes subsequently came to pass.  In a similar vein, Sinn F&eacute;in will support this legislation for the very reason that it will support our economy and businesses while protecting the jobs and incomes of workers and families.  That is what we have sought to do.  We will also engage with this legislation and seek to improve it where it falls short, in our opinion.  In that regard we will submit amendments to sections 13 and 14 of the Bill, which give investment funds free rein in the housing market to price struggling buyers out of homeownership.  Before that, however, I wish to speak about the earlier provisions of the Bill and the background against which they are being introduced.</p> <p> As public health measures and restrictions have been eased, the economy has rebounded strongly.  With the continued roll-out of the vaccine, a return to regular consumer spending and supportive policy measures, we are in a strong position to see a recovery in jobs and economic activity.  This view has been given by both the ESRI in recent weeks and the Central Bank today.  The pandemic and the public health restrictions to suppress its spread were always a temporary and Government-imposed pause on economic activity, different from any economic shock we have experienced thus far.  The responsibility of the State is to respond to that shock and that was the clear objective.  The clear objective was to protect incomes and to support businesses while preventing any long-term scarring of the economy.  A refusal to act quickly and to do whatever it takes would have undermined recovery and magnified the impact and duration of the economic damage that has been done.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in played a constructive role in ensuring that that objective was met.  In March of last year I wrote to the Minister outlining a set of principles and policies that should underpin the State's response to the economic impact of the pandemic at a time when we were just learning of the potential impact of that same pandemic.  In that correspondence I argued for a suite of measures ranging from a wage subsidy scheme to direct fiscal supports for businesses.  Throughout this period, Sinn F&eacute;in has supported and facilitated the introduction of measures that have offset and cushioned the economic shock of the past 16 months.  This has been done through the accelerated passage of legislation, which is definitely not the norm and should not be the norm in these Houses.</p> <p> As the vaccination roll-out gathers pace and restrictions ease, the broader economy is expected to recover in headline terms.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has projected economic growth of 11.1% this year and 6.9% next year.  While the Central Bank's projections are less optimistic than those of the ESRI, they still point to robust growth this year and next year.  We know the growth is largely driven - and we will not be fooled by the numbers - by a strong performance not only in the export of pharmaceutical goods and ICT services but also in contract manufacturing.  However, those figures fail to reflect the uneven impact of the pandemic and the level of damage still felt in the domestic economy, in particular in sectors such as tourism and hospitality, which we have spoken so much of in the past.</p> <p> The pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme have been crucial in protecting incomes, supporting businesses and maintaining the link between employers and workers to ensure a successful return to employment for as many as possible.  Before the easing of restrictions in May, almost a third of the workforce was in receipt of a payment or subsidy through either the PUP or the EWSS.  Last year Sinn F&eacute;in called on the Government to reverse its planned decision to cut the pandemic unemployment payment, a call that was heard and implemented by the Government, albeit late in the day.  Sinn F&eacute;in engaged with the Minister and the Government on all iterations of the wage subsidy scheme, successfully arguing for changes that provided greater support for workers and employers.  These included provision for those returning from maternity leave, an increase in the bottom rate of payment so as to ensure that workers were not provided with less support through the scheme than they would have had through the PUP, and an increase in rates under the employment wage subsidy scheme, which were subsequently acted on by the Government in October 2020.  We will continue to engage to improve and to amend these schemes and to make sure they are fit for purpose for the times we live in.</p> <p> The majority of provisions in this Bill give legislative effect to a number of actions recently announced as part of the economic recovery plan.  Section 2 provides for the extension of the EWSS until the end of the year, with the current rates of subsidy under the scheme remaining until 30 September.  The legislation also modifies the reference period for the assessment of eligibility.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this extension, which offers critical support for employers and workers in the retention of jobs.  With the wage subsidy scheme to be extended until the end of the year, Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for the introduction on a permanent basis of a short-time working scheme that could act as an automatic stabiliser in response to downturns as a means to retain employment and stave off the threat of long-term unemployment.  Such a scheme has served other countries such as Germany well as a countercyclical tool to reduce unemployment when the business cycle would do otherwise.  I encourage the Government to look at our proposals and to take them on board.</p> <p> Sections 3 and 4 would provide for the extension and enhancement of the Covid restrictions support scheme for consumer-facing businesses impacted by the public health restrictions.  I note that this legislation does not provide for the double week payment from 5 July for a period of two weeks in response to the delay in the reopening of indoor dining.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether it is necessary to amend the legislation to provide for this double payment or whether it can be provided through other means.  Since the introduction of the Covid restrictions support scheme, Sinn F&eacute;in has been critical of the number and types of businesses that have been excluded from the scheme despite the impact of public health measures on their trading, including those with non-rateable premises and suppliers.  We have made that point time and time again.  We therefore welcomed the Government's introduction of the small business assistance scheme in March, despite its late introduction.</p> <p> Section 5 of the Bill introduces a new scheme, the business resumption support scheme, which will provide support for businesses that continue to be impacted by the pandemic - and we know that many will - and is set to be introduced in September.  It is crucial that the eligibility criteria for this scheme do not exclude affected businesses as the CRSS did.</p> <p> Section 6 of the Bill extends the reduced 9% rate of VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector until 31 August 2022, a measure my party and I welcome.  Sinn F&eacute;in argued for the introduction of the 9% rate for the hospitality and tourism sector in our submission to the July stimulus programme last year.  The Government ignored this and did not implement the rate then but did so on 1 November of that year.  Again, delay is better than inaction.  The reduced rate will allow businesses in the sector to absorb the reduction on their balance sheets and support their cash margins.</p> <p> Sections 7 to 12, inclusive, provide for the extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme, allowing for the period in which tax liabilities can be warehoused to be extended until the end of the year, with an interest-free period in 2022.  I note also that section 7 allows for overpayments under the EWSS to be warehoused in a similar manner.  On a related issue, I ask the Minister of State and Revenue to ensure that efforts to claw back overpayments under the scheme, through either accident or abuse of the scheme, are adequately resourced and funded.  Any attempt by certain employers to receive payments under the scheme with the consequence of reduced pay for their workers where there was no entitlement to the scheme should be thoroughly investigated, with appropriate repercussions following.  I reiterate that my party welcomes the extension of these supports, which are crucial to protect jobs and to avoid any long-term scarring of the economy or undermining of the recovery.</p> <p> Sections 13 and 14 provide for different measures entirely and are in response to the scandal of investment funds snapping up homes under the noses of struggling homebuyers.  This is a system that has been facilitated and encouraged by Government policy through tax advantages and exemptions which Sinn F&eacute;in have opposed for years.  Sections 13 and 14 of the Bill give legislative effect to the financial resolutions passed by the D&aacute;il last month.</p> <p>I reiterate that in response to the measures announced in the context of that financial resolution, the share price of leading institutional investors in the Irish housing market rose.  That speaks volumes.  These measures were introduced in response to public outrage at something that is neither new nor accidental, namely, the block purchase of homes, during a housing crisis.  It has been taking place for a number of years and is a direct result of Government policy.  The block purchase of homes in Maynooth was simply the straw that broke the camel's back.<br/><br/>The Government has since scrambled to introduce measures that give the appearance of action.  The tax status enjoyed by these funds for several years has given them financial firepower against which struggling home buyers could never compete, with no corporation tax on their rental profits, no capital gains tax on disposals and minimal stamp duty.  That is what allowed investment funds to price struggling home buyers out of the housing market and led to increases in house prices and the amounts paid by struggling renters.  It allowed them to make combined operating profits of &euro;3 billion from 2017 to 2019.  Year after year, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for these tax advantages to be ended and has tabled amendments to successive Finance Bills to facilitate this.  Every year, those amendments were opposed by Fine Gael.  Only last year, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party opposed our amendment suggesting the introduction of a stamp duty surcharge on these investment funds, acting against the interests of struggling home buyers and in favour of investment funds and private developers.<br/><br/>This legislation is the Minister's response.  It is the bare minimum.  He takes those in the D&aacute;il and the public for fools.  The Minister has set a stamp duty charge so low that it cannot act as an effective deterrent.  Such a charge will only reduce the rental yield for these funds by 10%, a hit they can easily absorb, and will either lead to them increasing rents over a period by 10% or splitting the difference.  The charge is too low and Sinn F&eacute;in will be tabling amendments to have it increased.<br/><br/>Worse still, the provisions of this legislation are littered with gaps and exemptions.  Forward purchase agreements that have already been made between funds and developers will avoid the stamp duty charge, despite the residential units having not yet been built.  The Minister cannot even tell us how many homes bought up by investment funds will avoid this stamp duty charge as a result.  Under section 31E(7), the Minister has ensured that apartments are excluded from the charge, ignoring the advice of a senior official in his own Department who warned that &quot;by having no extra stamp duty on the bulk purchase of apartments, you potentially drive the individual home purchaser out of that market&quot;.  That is exactly what will happen.  The same official argued for a proposal that would ensure that these funds could not buy up full apartment blocks but the Government ignored  this advice and took the side of institutional investor against the interests of struggling home buyers.  There is no surprise here.<br/><br/>The Government has simply put a sign over Dublin city, where the majority of new builds are apartments, which says &ldquo;Aspiring homeowners need not enter&rdquo;.  The reality is that the Government has waved the white flag.  It has surrendered this city to the vulture funds by not imposing that surcharge on apartments to this funds.  Worse, the Minister of State has come before the House to say that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, rather than the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who is bringing forward an amendment to the legislation on Committee Stage which will exempt the funds that buy houses from the increased stamp duty if they lease them back to local authorities.  Let me put on record what the Taoiseach said in the House just three weeks ago in response to the scandal in Maynooth where an investment fund bought up these homes under the noses of aspiring house purchasers.  He said:</p><blockquote>	Let [the] message go out loud and clear from Government.  No local authority should be on the other side of this, engaging in a long lease with these institutional investors... </blockquote> <p>Now we are told that the Government is going to do the exact opposite of what the Taoiseach said.  The Minister is going to exempt these funds from buying homes if they sell them to local authorities.  You could not make this up.<br/><br/>The Bill is riddled with holes.  It is pro-investment funds legislation because the Government has exempted apartments and created another loophole through which funds will drive a horse and carriage.  Anyone who understands what is happening in the market knows this is why they are piling into Ireland.  It is because there is a scheme whereby they can buy this stock, push up the prices and then sell the homes involved back to local authorities through a long-term scheme which the Taoiseach said does not offer value for money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100031#HH00200"><p>The Labour Party and I are happy to support the continuation of the schemes as outlined in the Bill.  The scale of the support provided to businesses and to working people who may have lost their work through no fault of their own in the last 16 to 17 months is unprecedented.  We all agree that there should be no cliff edge facing any business or worker with the removal of any of these critical supports at a very sensitive time in the pandemic and our economic recovery.  This week has told us how unpredictable the virus is and will continue to be, and we have to be very careful how we proceed.  We are still far from the shore and there may still be choppy waters ahead.</p>  <p>  While there may be no cliff edge for many businesses and many thousands of workers with the maintenance of the EWSS, the CRSS and the extension of the tax warehousing scheme, which is very generous indeed, the same really cannot be said for those who may have to continue to have a decent floor of social protection through the PUP.  In light of what we know about the impact of the Delta variant and what public health experts tell us may be coming down the tracks, I would ask the Government to review the position in respect of to the PUP and any possible reductions.  There are sectors like the arts and entertainment that are most unlikely to come back strongly as soon as we would all like.  A decent safety net has to be continued for those workers and others who are likely to be the last to get back to anything close to normal operating levels any time soon.</p>  <p>  While we welcome its extension, this is another missed opportunity to reform the EWSS into a German-style short-time work and  training scheme and make it a permanent feature of our labour market.  I note that recently, Sinn F&eacute;in has started to be supportive of the position originally enunciated by the Labour Party in 2019 in the context of Brexit and business unemployment supports that we believed were required then.  Likewise, with the ever-growing challenge of climate change, a permanent wage-subsidy scheme with an appropriate retraining element will be a crucial tool for ensuring a just transition, ensuring that workers are upskilled and remain productive and our businesses remain competitive in uncertain times as our industrial and economic model changes.</p>  <p>  Labour has consistently called for a training element to be incorporated into the wage subsidy scheme like other equivalent EU schemes.  The Central Bank and OECD and other august think tanks are on the same page.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State, and maybe on another occasion from the Minister for Finance, on the current thinking on the introduction of a training element, conditional on access to any reform of the wage subsidy scheme, that maybe under consideration.</p>  <p>  Time and again, I have raised the obstacles faced by some mortgage applicants whose employers are accessing the EWSS, even though the applicants may not be paid through it themselves.  I note the growing numbers of mortgage drawdowns for first time buyers but I think that masks the very real and worrying problems faced by some mortgage applicants who are now being put to the back of the queue because some lenders are now making calls not only on their personal circumstances but also on the viability of the firms where they work because the company has made an appearance on the Revenue&rsquo;s wage subsidy scheme list.</p> <p>I do not expect the Minister to make an intervention but I know the Minister of State would agree with me, and the Minister for Finance and other Ministers are on record as saying, that banks must treat people fairly during the pandemic.  That is the position of the Central Bank too, but in my experience the evidence of this is scant, certainly in regard to the obstacles being placed in the way of those who are working with companies that may be dependent on the wage subsidy scheme, even though the owners are not being paid through the scheme.</p> <p> I ask that the Minister examine, as a once-off gesture, scrapping the tax bills associated with the TWSS from last year and the PUP.  This has been dismissed previously by some who should know better as something of a populist move.  It is nothing of the kind.  It makes economic sense and can act as a form of stimulus for towns across the country.  It would cost less than what the Government allocated to the doomed stay-and-spend scheme.  By and large, those who are on the TWSS and PUP are most unlikely to have been among the group who managed to save &euro;12 billion in exceptional savings that we hope will be unleashed into the economy in the short to medium term.  This is something worth revisiting.  It would be a gesture of solidarity to a lot of younger workers in particular.</p> <p> I will now turn to the section dealing with the CRSS.  There is an anomaly for the likes of travel agents which are caught in a real trap.  Travel agents in Louth and elsewhere have been advised by Revenue that under the reopening of non-essential retail, they no longer qualify for the CRSS.  This is nonsensical given the particular set of circumstances in which they find themselves.  Many have seen turnover plummet by up to 95% compared with 2019, and they are still not trading to any great degree.  Even when forward bookings are made for 2022, the agents will not necessarily get any real income from the bookings until eight weeks before clients are due to travel.  That is my understanding of how the industry operates.  These businesses are in a desperate situation.  Technically, they are open for business, but from what I can see, their work mostly involves advising existing customers on previous bookings, organising refunds and changing travel plans.  Although they are open, they are not generating much income.  They are servicing the needs of existing customers and not generating much by way of income or turnover.  Could a discrete support be designed to assist them in what is a fairly unique situation?</p> <p> I strongly welcome the move on the new business resumption support scheme, BRSS.  Those businesses that do not pay rates and do not operate bricks and mortar premises have been neglected for too long.  I made the case for a scheme such as this months ago and it is very welcome.</p> <p> I will move now to the extension of the 9% VAT rate cut.  I do not question the motivation because I know we all want to do everything we possibly can to help a bruised and battered sector that has been through the mill in the past 15 or 16 months.  However, this is a very expensive subsidy for a sector that, in truth, has been hampered by a public health problem, not one of demand.  Will the Minister of State provide a figure for the anticipated cost of this extension?  Does he or do his Government colleagues have any concerns in respect of the deadweight effect experienced the last time such a cut was introduced after two years of operation of the previous scheme?</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste keeps telling us he wants to see pay and workers' rights improved as a consequence of the pandemic.  He says he wants to focus his priorities on the needs of private sector workers, many of whom are not members of trade unions, where trade unions may not be recognised and where the pay and conditions of workers need to be improved.  I take that with a very liberal pinch of salt.  He should insist on the hospitality sector engaging in the joint labour committee, JLC, provided for in law since 2012, as a condition of this support going forward in order to provide improved collectively bargained pay and conditions for hospitality workers.  Until he does that, I take issue with his commitment to the interests of younger workers in the hospitality sector and elsewhere.  He could make a decision on that overnight and encourage the actors in the sector to come together under the sectoral bargaining system that is robust and constitutionally sound.  That would achieve the kinds of outcomes the T&aacute;naiste says he wants.</p> <p> In respect of the provision of the 10% stamp duty on bulk purchases of homes, I agree that it is a mistake not to include apartments.  As I have said before, I am pleased that the exemption will also be provided to approved housing bodies, AHBs, that are active in the mortgage-to-rent space.  There was consternation when they were not included in the initial instrument and I am pleased that they are now.  I was in contact with both the Department of Finance and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in this regard in recent weeks.  Mortgage-to-rent is a viable, good and sustainable solution for many who have distressed mortgages and the move to exclude mortgage-to-rent providers from the charge of 10% makes sense.</p> <p> There was a strong focus this week at the national economic dialogue, NED, on the need to avoid a procyclical stance.  I understand that.  There is much talk about medium-term targets for the deficit and how permanent increases in spending might be funded in a sustainable way.  We need to have a serious debate about the utility of the current EU fiscal rules framework.  I have no doubt that this is a hot topic of discussion in EU capitals and within the Eurogroup over which the Minister for Finance currently presides.  As we know, these rules were agreed at another time entirely and they need to be reviewed.  It appears that the low interest rate environment will be maintained for some time.  I am reassured by recent comments made by the head of the NTMA when, to paraphrase him, he said he is not overly worried about borrowing costs in the near and medium-term future.  Mr. Philip Lane of the ECB also recently said "there is no risk of a new period of exceptionally high price growth" when addressing concerns expressed across Europe on the potential for inflation.</p> <p> We are not certain when the EU fiscal rules will kick in again.  Mr. Klaas Knot of the ECB said at the start of June that "fiscal flexibility is needed and has to be an integral feature of the framework".  I agree with him, as do my Labour Party colleagues.  In saying all of that, we will have to avoid an overly procyclical stance.  Everybody accepts that.  Growth looks set to be strong, but as the Central Bank stated in its review today, it will be uneven.  Nobody is saying that we should spend too much of what we do not have on current spending, but now is the time to use the propitious environment we are in to borrow a bit more to crack housing, health, climate and childcare.</p> <p> Before Covid, Ireland had the lowest level of general government expenditure of our peer countries.  We can and should invest wisely and strategically to address the deficits we have.  It is not just me saying that.  IBEC, the American Chamber of Commerce and others are making this case too.  Our debt levels are high, but so are everyone else's.  There is much concern in Merrion Street about this level of debt and how and when we might address it.  There is not much wrong with running a modest budget deficit for a little longer than some would like, if we decide to use borrowing, for example, to double investment in housing.  The ESRI made a very cogent case for that only two or three weeks ago.  Nobody in their right mind is saying that we should not concern ourselves with the deficit, and its size.  However, it would be irresponsible if we did not concern ourselves with it.  That said, balancing the budget should not be a policy end in itself.  Nor should any of us be ideologically blinded or too dogmatic about this.  We are in a different set of circumstances now than we were in 2008 and 2009.  It is not a mortal sin to run a modest, medium-sized and serviceable budget deficit if it is being done for the right reasons and not to run up current spending in an irresponsible way.</p> <p> The ESRI and the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, have done important work and the latter has shown how we can, to a large degree, grow our way out of our current indebtedness.  That is provided responsible public investment decisions are taken.  By all means, let us get the deficit down, but we should do it in a gradual and structured way that does not kill the patient or damage the recovery or our plans to invest sensibly in the future.</p> <p> Before Covid-19 struck, Ireland had the lowest general government expenditure in the league of rich nations.  Now is the time to get rid of the innate conservatism that has dominated Irish politics and economic thinking and take advantage of the circumstances, build homes and tackle the infrastructural bottlenecks that are holding our economy and progress back.</p> <p> If we look at our demographics, the issues that will be facing us for years are clear.  The population is getting older.  There will be fewer workers to provide the tax euro we need.  We need to use the current climate to do the things we may not be able to do in 20 years, and it will be too late then in any case. </p> <p> I look forward to a debate on the summer economic statement, which will no doubt seek to address some of these very live issues.  I hope the summer economic statement is published before the D&aacute;il's summer recess because it is important, at this pivotal time for our economy, that this House has the opportunity to hold the Government to account and to provide our own input into the future direction of this economy.  Another live debate is the question of how we, as a State, can fund the permanent increases in spending that Covid has ushered in, and this is a perspective that dominated the national economic dialogue this week.  When we are discussing this Bill, Government supports and so on, we cannot be immune to that.  We need to figure out how to resource the additional spending that most of us in this House agree needs to occur over the next few years.</p> <p> The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and others see, in terms of health spending and other big spending areas, additional expenditure of approximately &euro;5 billion a year.  That is in the base and it is not going away.  Of course, the Government was rebuked by IFAC only a matter of weeks ago and its spending plans and economic forecasts were dismissed.  IFAC does not see the plans as credible; I do not either and I do not think the public do either.</p> <p> The Covid experience has seen a greater understanding of the role of the State and how it is ultimately the State that we expect to deliver for us.  I hope we are all agreed that the State has delivered - with all its expertise and its mandate and authority, it has delivered in our hour of extreme need.  This is very clear in the context of the supports provided, which will be renewed and refreshed when this Bill passes all stages.  We should credit people with understanding that a better healthcare system has to be funded, that better welfare supports will mean additional asks of the PRSI system and that if councils are to provide the amenities, then we will need to pay for them through a modest charge on residential property.  We cannot be Boston and Berlin at the same time.  A tax cutting agenda and a narrowing of the tax base, bizarrely advocated by some who claim to be of the left, will not mean better public services and most people will not be conned into believing that that trick can be pulled off.  We need a serious conversation about tax and services in this country.  We need to decide on what we want and how the services we say we want ought to be resourced.</p> <p> I commend the Minister for Finance and the Government more generally on the setting up of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, which is an important innovation.  The one criticism I have is that it has not been placed on a permanent statutory footing.  Pretty average workers on pretty average pay in this country have to pay similar amounts of income tax and other taxes to peers in analogous countries.  It is not actually a high tax country, despite the rhetoric of some who do not believe in taxes at all, it seems to me, but who then cannot tell us where we are going to get the money to run the public services on which we all depend.  Most wealth, as we know, is held not in income but in assets.  Taxes on wealth and a very serious top-down review of very costly and poorly targeted reliefs and exemptions can, I believe, have the potential to help us fund a new direction for the country as we emerge from this great disruption - this great public health crisis but also economic crisis - and, I hope, help us on our way to forging a new social contract for the Irish people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100033#KK00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I believe this legislation is to be welcomed and that it forms an important part of the economic recovery plan.  It is crucial that we support businesses as public health restrictions are eased.  Local businesses are the lifeblood of our communities.  From speaking to businesses in my own county of Carlow, I know they have gone through a massively demanding time since March of last year.  Nobody could have foreseen the fallout from Covid-19 or the way in which our lives were turned upside down by the health emergencies.  However, we have adapted and we have learned to live with this disease.  I strongly believe that, as a people, we will come out stronger from this.</p>  <p>  I have been heartened by the way local businesses in Carlow have adapted to these trying times.  It has been inspirational to see how people have come together and worked through this pandemic.  One thing that has come out of Covid is that people have got such a big sense of community, and businesses are working together and helping each other, which is crucial.  We have seen this happen, although it has been very hard.</p>  <p>  To turn to the Bill, I am fully supportive of the extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme until the end of 2021.  The extension and enhancement of the Covid restrictions support scheme is also welcome and provides additional supports to businesses upon reopening.  It also gives certainty to businesses that are still affected by public health restrictions and certainty is something we definitely need in these most uncertain times.  The new and additional business resumption support scheme that will be implemented in September 2021 is a welcome initiative.</p>  <p>  Businesses will need all the help they can get as they get back on their feet following the unprecedented time we have all gone through.  This legislation acknowledges the frail nature of firms in certain sectors as they emerge from the impact of public health restrictions.  It is also about giving business a hand up, not just a handout.  I welcome the announcement that businesses that remain closed or that are heavily restricted under the public health restrictions may make a claim for additional CRSS support.  Initiatives such as the business resumption support scheme show that this Government understands what businesses have gone through since March of last year.  We are all in this together and it is only by working together and looking after each other that we will get through these most challenging times.</p>  <p>  The extension of the reduced 9% rate of VAT for hospitality and tourism until the end of August 2022 will provide continued support to the hospitality sector, which has been particularly affected by the public health measures introduced to tackle the pandemic.  I hope it will help.  It is a fact that many businesses have not yet been able to reopen and the extension of the reduced rate will provide for a long period to assist recovery in this sector.  The reduced rate of 9% will apply to areas such as catering, restaurant supplies, tourism accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks and hairdressers.  All of these activities are part of everyday life in our country but they all came to a shuddering stop because of Covid.  This legislation will help these businesses in a practical way as they try to get back on their feet.</p>  <p>  One thing we have all learned through this pandemic is that we took things for granted in our lives.  I believe we have been able to gain a newfound appreciation for what we have.  We are now seeing our world through new eyes.  Never again will we take for granted activities such as meeting friends for dinner or visiting museums or parks.  It is probably part of our culture but, like everything else, it is something people take for granted, for example, being able to give their mother or sister a hug, which was not possible when things were really bad.  We have come a long way with the vaccine but the supports will be crucial.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has disrupted all of our lives.  I spoke to a constituent today and I was taken aback by what she said.  This woman was highly driven and ambitious and, having taken time off work to look after her sick mother, she sought to return to the workforce.  She was interviewed for a role in the community employment scheme at the beginning of this year and, thankfully, she was successful in getting a position in Carlow.  She went through all of the relevant stages for the role, including Garda vetting, and was looking forward to resuming employment.  However, due to the pandemic, her starting date has been postponed, not once, not twice, but three times.  In the meantime, her contributions to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit ran out and she was no longer eligible for the payment.  As this woman is no longer receiving a social welfare payment, she is no longer eligible for employment through the CE scheme.  The role in Carlow is still available for her but she is no longer eligible to take it up.  She could have taken up other positions in the meantime, but this was the one she wanted and now, through no fault of her own, she is no longer eligible for it.  As she told me today on the phone, she has been left in limbo by Covid.  These are people who we should not forget as we try to get our country back on its feet.  That example involves a woman I know well.</p> <p>She is my neighbour and through no fault of her own, she has lost access to that scheme due to Covid.  When I submitted an appeal about this to the Department, it told me that nothing could be done.  Many small things are being forgotten.  It is unacceptable.  If we do not look after workers on the community employment schemes and others, they will have been forgotten due to the pandemic through no fault of their own.</p> <p> Part of the Bill addresses housing.  I firmly believe that everybody deserves a home.  People in the Minister of State's constituency might come in, looking for housing.  We need to finance housing and to have affordable housing.  We need to make sure that everyone who meets the criteria to buy a home is able to buy one.  When we pass these Bills, we need to make sure that we look after the most vulnerable people in society.  They are sometimes forgotten.</p> <p> As the country opens, we must be mindful of lessons learned.  We must continue to look out for and value one another.  I welcome this legislation.  It will assist our businesses in a practical way as they seek to return to what they do best.</p></speech>

We need to do more for small business owners where businesses are closed due to the pandemic in order that they will have a business to reopen when it is safe to do so.  Every day, I am contacted by small business owners, mostly in the hospitality sector.  They are genuinely worried that they will not have a business to reopen if the Government does not listen to their concerns.  Every single one of them is critical of this Government and of the red tape involved in business supports.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme was developed in haste.  As the old saying goes, act in haste, repent in leisure.  The frequently asked questions section on Revenue's website about the temporary wage subsidy scheme has been revised nearly 20 times and stretches to 79 pages.  We saw significant tax bills being sent to workers, which is exactly what they do not need at this time.  Workers cannot take much more of this.</p><p>Business owners need certainty to enable them to plan and to help them to keep their businesses alive.  We do not need the haphazard approach of this Government in recent days.  Business owners who have contacted me have also been critical of the Government's deafness to their plight.  A deaf ear has been turned to businesses that do not fit the narrow definition of businesses covered by legislative change.  The Government has been too slow to react.</p><p>The Bill also gives statutory effect to the financial resolution passed by the D&aacute;il relating to the rate of stamp duty applying to the bulk purchase of housing.  The decision to exclude apartments from this legislation has been criticised by many.  Even the Secretary General at the Department of Finance has been critical of this decision.  In reality, this change is just a speed bump for vulture funds instead of the roadblock that it should be.  They will continue to plunder housing stock but they will do it in groups of ten now instead of groups of 100.  The Government's housing policy must favour ordinary workers and their families, not the <i>status quo</i>of favouring developers and vulture funds.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will ensure that it does this.  The last speaker said that we are all in this together.  I do not think so.</p></speech>

We supported this absolute necessity, whether through the pandemic wage subsidy scheme, replaced by the employment wage subsidy scheme, and the pandemic unemployment payment.  We need to ensure that we have these protections.  As much as we thought in recent weeks that we were moving to a better place, which we might still be overall, it has stalled.  As we have had the dreaded Delta variant, we need Government action to deal with the variant versus the vaccination scenario.  There are new guidelines from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, regarding young people and use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines.  We need to ensure that the timelines are sped up as soon as possible to facilitate this.</p>  <p>  While we all welcomed the Covid restrictions support scheme, at the time a significant number of businesses fell between stools and missed out on those necessary supports.  We knew there were issues with those people who did not necessarily pay rates and may have had non-rateable offices but still had significant overheads.  I think in particular of companies with substantial numbers of vehicles, insurance and other costs.  Many were lucky and were close to going to the wall.  I had considerable interaction with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and I brought examples to him, the T&aacute;naiste and others of firms in Dundalk and throughout County Louth that were impacted in this way.  The small business assistance scheme and the business resumption support scheme could be the solution for many of these businesses.  We need to ensure that that happens.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty and a number of other Members from Sinn F&eacute;in have pointed out the elephant in the room, which is the fact that we are still dealing with a housing crisis.  We are not dealing with the issue of investment funds pricing regular people out of business.  We have a stamp duty percentage that just does not cut the mustard.  We need the Government to get real but we need to ensure that we have an adequate response for those businesses, families and people who need the supports as we continue through this period.</p></speech>

The circus sector has been left behind.  It has been thrown from Billy to Jack, told to go to the Arts Council, and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which has sent it back to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.  It has achieved nothing so far.  These organisations have functioned for maybe 150 years.  It is one of the most successful performance art sectors that exists in the country.  It washes its face economically, while most others do not manage that.  It is phenomenal with regard to regional delivery since it goes to every single town in the country.  There is probably not a child or anybody here who has not been able to attend that sort of performance art at some stage in their lives.  On a rainy day on holidays in Waterville, County Kerry, it is a godsend to be able to bring kids to such an event.</p>  <p>  I hope that the Minister of State has some influence to achieve change with this.  I mean this sincerely.  They have been left to rot on the vine.  They are selling their materials, big tops, tents, and trucks, all necessary things.  There is a significant chance that this sector will not be able to survive and that this 150- or 200-year-old heritage will not be able to survive unless it gets financial help.  It has received bits and pieces but it is window dressing instead of the finances that it needs.</p>  <p>  Regarding enterprise supports, it is impossible for me to convey the level of anger, frustration and complete disbelief at what is happening with small businesses.  The science that has been accepted by every single other European country is being completely ignored in this State.  We are not operating under the same science as any other European country.  As of tomorrow, every single other European country will allow for legal indoor dining.  Ireland will be alone, isolated, insular and inward-looking with its decision to prevent restaurants and pub owners from allowing indoor dining to function.</p> <p>That is an incredible and extraordinarily damaging situation.  The Government has now said it is looking for a solution, an extremely controversial one, which is some kind of vaccine passport to operate that.  Nobody believes the Government will get that together within the next two weeks.  Nobody in this country believes the Government will get that together before September, in truth. </p></speech>

There has to be a solution brought forward.  That solution has to follow what the likes of Denmark and Finland did in their countries.  They looked at the science, made decisions and have opened up safely for more than two months now.</p>  <p>  Hospitality workers are a sector of society significantly targeted by this Bill.  Hospitality workers are being massively stuffed.  It is interesting there is a by-election on 8 July.  In many ways, that by-election was timed to take place just two or three days after hospitality was meant to open up.  We have a crisis in small to medium-sized enterprises in hospitality.  The Dublin Bay South constituency, for example, has hundreds of pubs, restaurants, clubs and hotels and thousands of workers who should be working in those areas but are not at the moment.  The reason they are not is the Government cannot make a decision.</p>  <p>  It is absolutely the job of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to give advice on this issue, but it has very tight terms of reference.  Its terms of reference are purely related to Covid and nothing else.  It does not take cancer care or any other healthcare into consideration.  It does not even touch on enterprise, small business or finance, which we are discussing.  The Government has the terms of reference to look at those particular issues and the broader terms of reference to make sure that everything is balanced within society, but it has now outsourced complete decision-making on this issue to NPHET.  I do not mean this in a personal way, but Miche&aacute;l Martin has a track record, politically, of not wanting to make hard decisions.  He has a track record, going back many years, of setting up committees and having reports written.  That information stands for itself.  However, as a result of that inability to make a decision, we have whole sectors of the economy and society that are stuffed, economically.</p>  <p>  The truth of the matter is that cases of Covid will rise again when we come to September and October.  There is no doubt about that.  This is a coronavirus, which has a seasonal profile and we will see increased cases in the second half of this year.  To a business, a week in July is worth seven weeks in November and December.  Many of these businesses will only make their money at this time of the year.  It is very sad to hear of Government backbenchers kicking up a storm at the moment, but people need to stand up and put their votes where their mouths are.  Just a couple of weeks ago, legislation on emergency powers went through this D&aacute;il and all those Deputies voted for the Government's legislation.  Those same Deputies are now kicking up having voted for that legislation.</p>  <p>  The main Opposition party has sat on the fence for the last number of months on this issue.  SF should stand for "sitting on a fence" when it comes to this key issue for people throughout the country.  People who advocated zero-Covid are now hopping to the other side of the fence very quickly.  There are unbelievable situations where political parties such as the Social Democrats, Labour Party and others are sticking their fingers in the air, finding out which way the wind is blowing and changing on this and, all the while, a sector of society is absolutely busted.</p>  <p>  I heard today the Government is putting antigen testing in place.  The organisation now in place to work out an antigen test system in this country has not got its terms of reference.  This is six months, or more, after the EU gave the go-ahead for it.  It is around 12 months since many countries, and some private companies, got it together to do antigen testing.  Antigen testing could be run to help these small businesses that are in this desperate situation at the moment.  I welcome the financial supports for these small businesses but, in many ways, they are now zombie businesses.  If many of these businesses do not get to function this summer, and they still have not properly opened by October, supports or no supports they are toast and are going down the drain.  Once those supports are pulled away from these zombie businesses they, and the people who work for them, will fall.</p>  <p>  Workers in the hospitality sector used to be the people People Before Profit and Solidarity stood for, but not any more.  These workers are allowed to swing for themselves.  We have a situation where they have been pushed into poverty and debt and are having significant difficulties keeping roofs over their heads at the moment.  I welcome the supports we are providing for them but one thing that would actually support them so they, and aviation industry workers, could go back to work, is to have antigen testing available and functioning now.  It is incredible that they have been marching on the streets and yet antigen testing still remains in the future tense.  Why does antigen testing remain in the future tense for this Government?  How can it be, after so long and when so much damage has been wrought in these small businesses throughout the country, that the word "antigen" only exists in the future tense in this country?  If I hear another Minister going on the radio to say, "We are looking into antigen testing", my brain may explode, along with the rest of the country.  It is just so hard to believe.</p>  <p>  My sister, Mair&eacute;ad T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, is a pharmacist.  She says the pharmacists of this country could run antigen testing on behalf of people.  People could go to a pharmacist on the day they want to go for a pint, or a feed, get their antigen test done, get a stamp from the pharmacist and away they would go.  There seems to be a complete lack of practicality and urgency from this Government at this moment in time.  I have good regard for the Minister.  I know he has a strong interest in doing the right thing for his constituency and the country, but I am still shocked that nobody is cracking the whip, the pressure is not coming on and anger is not translating into action by the Government.</p>  <p>  The cost of this Bill is another aspect of it.  It has not been discussed at all.  Right now, we are running up to approximately &euro;40 billion in costs as regards all the extra Government expenditure over the last 15 months.  Some &euro;40 billion starts to put this crisis in the same ballpark as the banking crisis.  It puts it in the same space as the banking crisis, as a cost to the State.  It is different at this moment in time in that there is access to credit to allow the flow of money to go where it is needed and, do not get me wrong, I am not arguing for one second that any of these supports are pulled because I am not.  I am saying this debt will have repercussions and is not cost free.  It will steal from future investment.  Mark my words, we will watch cuts to investment in housing, health, infrastructure and the environment over the next ten years on the back of this debt.  As true as night follows day, debt equals a reduction in spending.  Typically, under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael's political logic, it also includes an increase in taxation for those who are most vulnerable and cannot afford it.</p>  <p>  My instinct on this is very simple.  One of the ways we can stop this debt from further increasing is to allow people go back to work.  People want to go back to work and they can do safely.  Aont&uacute; has councillors in the North of Ireland.  Our councillor in Derry, Emmet Doyle, came down to help us recently with our election campaign and was dumbfounded that indoor dining and pubs were closed.  They have been open for two months in the North of Ireland and not a bother on them if truth be told.  While much of the focus is, rightly, on extra supports and their extension to people throughout the country, we cannot ignore the logic of getting people back to work.  It is the elephant in the room in all these discussions.  Keeping people away from work leads to poverty and debt, while getting people back to work leads to them getting on with their lives.  Do not get me wrong, I am not saying for one second that restrictions may not be necessary in future.  All I am saying is that, today, conditions do not exist in this country for the restrictions the Government is interested in.</p>  <p>There are 44 people with Covid in hospital in this State.  All of those people could fit into any house in this country.  There are plenty of hospitals with no Covid cases, yet cancer, mental health, heart disease and stroke services are not fully operational.  It is an incredible situation.  </p> <p> Let us keep the antennae of cautiousness well up, operational and focused and let us listen to the science, but let us operate under the same science as the rest of Europe.  There is only one science.  There is not a European version of it and an Irish version of it.  There is one science and the rest of Europe has managed to plug into the logic of it, that is, to be careful but to live as well.  </p></speech>

I know the Ceann Comhairle does not disagree with this because we have discussed it, but it further underlines the point about the change of the speaking order enforced by the Government, which guarantees this sort of uncertainty.  The Government insists that it has multiple slots before some of us get to speak and then no one from the Government side bothers to turn up.  It is further confirmation of the sabotage of debate in this House.</p>  <p>  We will support this Bill because it provides for an extension of supports for those who have been hit as a result of the pandemic and whose incomes or livelihoods have been affected by public health measures.  It goes without saying that we would support that, as we have done in the past.  We will not try to block the passage of this Bill in any way because we want to see those supports extended.  However, there are many things that should be in this Bill that are not.  I will come to the stamp duty issue later.  The measures in this Bill to prevent the cuckoo funds swooping in and buying large amounts of property and pricing ordinary people out of the market are tokenistic.  I am not even sure they are actually designed to achieve what the Government says they are designed to achieve.  I think they are designed to appease public opinion.  </p>  <p>  I will first speak to the income supports.  The Minister of State might provide clarity on the following issue in his closing remarks.  On multiple occasions, I have highlighted the need for support for particular groups that have been most hard hit or extremely hard hit by the pandemic and the public health measures, that is, musicians, performers, people in events and entertainment and taxi drivers.  That is not an exhaustive list.  I heard other Deputies mention travel agents and so on, but I know more about the musicians, events and performance side and taxi drivers. </p>  <p>  I want to ask a straight question, but on the basis of past experience, I pretty much know the answer.  Are the approximately 26,000 taxi drivers in this country and their families who depend on their income, which is a large cohort of people, once again excluded from the business supports under the small business assistance scheme for Covid and the Covid restrictions support scheme or will that change under the new business resumption support scheme?  I had a look at the application form and information on the SBASC on the Department website.  When one reads through the criteria for application a taxi driver could tick every box only to find that at the end of the form a statement that PSV drivers cannot apply for it.  For no explicable reason, they cannot apply for it.  It is open to many other businesses that are deserving of it, but taxi drivers are excluded.  Has that changed?  Will taxi drivers be eligible for the new scheme or are they once again excluded?</p>  <p>  I remind the Minister of State, as I have reminded multiple other Ministers in this House, that according to an NTA survey in relation to taxi drivers, they are paying, on average, approximately &euro;11,000 on fixed costs in terms of maintenance, car repayments, insurance and fuel and so on, which they are required to do in order that they can continue to operate, but which they have not been able to meet because their income has collapsed for the last year and a half.  In that regard, there has been no full recovery and it is likely full recovery is even further away as a result of the decision to delay the full reopening of the hospitality sector, which is deeply connected to the viability of the taxi industry.</p>  <p>  Will the business resumption support scheme be extended to taxi drivers or is the Government once again excluding them?  If so, it begs the question as to what this Government has got against taxi drivers.  When it comes to one group, despite the constant repetitions that there will be no cliff edge for those affected, which I heard again today from the Minister of State, there is a cliff edge in relation to the PUP.  The Minister of State might clarify if that is the case.  As the taxi drivers understand it, they are facing a cliff edge on the PUP, some of them from 7 September and others in early November, because if their PUP is reduced to &euro;203, they are then required to sign on for jobseeker's allowance. </p> <p>Taxi drivers cannot sign on for this allowance and so either must face the prospect of giving up their jobs and livelihoods to go on a jobseeker's payment or must sign off all supports, even though they are carrying all of the accumulated costs of the last year for which the Government has given them no support.  Their industry is still not fully recovered so they cannot hope to earn a full living in September when those changes to the pandemic unemployment payment kick in.  Will the Minister of State please clarify that point?  According to what the Department of Social Protection is telling the taxi drivers, once they hit the level of &euro;203, they will be informed that they have to go on jobseeker's allowance.  This is despite other suggestions having been made by other Ministers to the effect that the PUP supports for taxi drivers should be maintained until February of next year.  There is, therefore, a direct contradiction between what the Department of Social Protection is saying and what other Ministers have said about supports for taxi drivers.</p> <p> Many of these same points apply in the case of musicians.  Will musicians, performers and others who work in live entertainment be able to benefit from the business resumption support scheme or are there going to be further exclusions for people who do not have rateable premises, outward looking businesses and so on?  Are they going to benefit from those supports?  To date, the vast majority have not.  Some who have premises and some of the bigger small companies or medium-sized companies in music and entertainment have benefited from some of the support schemes, and are very glad to have done so, but the ordinary jobbing individual or lone trader who is a musician, performer or similar has been excluded from the support schemes to date.  Is that going to change with the new scheme proposed here?  I fear and suspect it is not and that once again the Government has let down this cohort.  I would like the Minister of State to tell me I am wrong.</p> <p> I will move on to the issue of stamp duty.  It is a very serious issue.  The Government is well aware that there is absolute anger and outrage at the fact that these cuckoo funds are swooping in and buying whole estates, as they did in Kildare, north Dublin and other locales, pricing out the ordinary working family, young family, young couple or whoever else is trying to purchase a home.  They can forget about it because these investment funds have swooped in and bought everything.  On foot of the public outrage and anger about this, and the anger expressed by many of us in the Opposition, the Government said it was going to address the issue.  However, it came out with only this token measure of a 10% rate of stamp duty.  In no way will this act as a disincentive to these big super-wealthy investment funds.  They can well absorb the increase to 10% from the 1% or 2% they might have paid in the past.  They will pass it on in the price of the house or in the cost of a lease to a local authority.  An increase to 10% is of no use.  It is not a serious attempt to keep out these entities that have absolutely wrecked the housing market and which are also responsible for manipulating rental prices.  In many cases, they are charging absolutely extortionate rents.  We all know what these people are charging, which is &euro;2,000, &euro;2,500, &euro;3,000 or more a month.  </p> <p> This 10% rate of stamp duty will not do it.  We need to do what New Zealand has done and keep them out full stop.  How would this be done?  We proposed amendments when the Government previously tabled a motion on this issue and we will certainly be trying to amend this legislation.  The rate of stamp duty should be set at 90%.  It should be absolutely punitive and prohibitive if it is to completely stop them from being able to invest.  The threshold should not be ten units as this implies it is okay if they buy up nine units, after which they will be hit with this token 10%.  Instead, it should be 90% and should kick in if they buy more than one unit.  If we are really trying to support ordinary working people who are trying to get a home to put over their own heads rather than investors who are simply trying to make money, we need to set stamp duty at a level so high that they would not dream of buying the properties and this needs to kick in if they try to buy more than one property. </p> <p> It is also absolutely shocking that, in any event, even this token 10% will not affect those who buy properties before leasing them back to local authorities.  It is unbelievable.  It is bad enough that the local authorities are trying to source social housing from these cuckoo and investment funds which are charging absolutely extortionate prices, but we are now going to give them tax supports to do so.  One has to suspect that the Government's change of heart and U-turn on what it was saying a few weeks ago is a direct result of lobbying by the cuckoo and vulture funds.  In this legislation, the Government is quite literally dancing to the tune of these vulture, investment and cuckoo funds, that are doing nothing more than trying to profit from the housing and homelessness crisis and from the misery great numbers of working people in this country are facing.</p> <p> Worst of all, none of this, not even the pathetic 10% rate of stamp duty, will apply to the purchase of apartments.  Of course, this is the area in which these vulture funds, cuckoo funds and investment funds are most active.  They buy up entire apartment blocks.  They are doing it everywhere in this city.  Some of their practices are absolutely nauseating.  They buy up these blocks and do not even rent them out.  They are quite happy just to sit on them.  It is just an investment.  They do not give a damn whether people can live in these places.  They buy a block as an investment, watch their capital gains advance and then flog it off afterwards without paying any tax on the capital gains or, perhaps, rent the apartments out at extortionate rates.  Some of the apartments around here are owned by Lone Star.  The rents on them are &euro;3,000 a month or more.  It is absolutely shocking.  The Government is going to allow that to continue.</p> <p> What we need to do is to exclude these vultures from the market completely.  We need to recover and rescue people from the situation in which we find ourselves as a result of the disastrous policies of NAMA which unloaded the property, sites and so on that put these cuckoo funds and investment funds in charge and in control of this country's dysfunctional housing market.  </p> <p> We will support these minimal measures and extensions insofar as they will support some people but it is really outrageous that no serious action is being taken to stop the rampage of the cuckoo funds and investment funds that are wrecking the housing market and contributing directly to the housing crisis working people are facing.  It is also absolutely disgraceful if, as I suspect is the case, groups like taxi drivers, musicians and others who have been excluded from previous income and grant support schemes are to be excluded from the new scheme put forward in this Bill.</p></speech>

I came up specifically to participate in this debate.  In accordance with the schedule we were given, I was outside observing the protocols, not wanting to come in because I suffocate with a mask on.  I wanted to make a short contribution.  It is not my fault that somebody made the mistake whereby we have all ended up wanting to speak, being here to speak and not being able to speak..</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Ceann Comhairle and I will respect his decision.  I will not get into an argument about it.  I will put my case in a civil way.  I was in the building.  I came, like the others, from Leinster House and someone made a cock-up of the timing.  I am not saying it was the Ceann Comhairle.  I am here to make a contribution.  I have asked the Minister of State to share time but I would like to use my slot if I could.</p></speech>

Many people did not turn up for their designated slots.  I was due to have a slot at approximately 5 p.m.  I am an hour and a half early.  Most Deputies look at what is on the schedule and try to get here at least 40 minutes early in case a debate runs ahead of time but this is way ahead of what we have ever experienced.  In fairness, the Ceann Comhairle should look at the reality of the situation.  We are working between two buildings.  Most of us are in Leinster House trying to work in the office and get back here for speaking slots.  Many Deputies do not turn up for their slots and we are in this predicament.  Those who make an effort to be here should be given a couple of minutes.</p></speech>

I came in after rushing up here and maybe I made my points somewhat forcefully.  I would not argue the toss on this if we were not in Covid times.  We have to keep an eye on the clock and so on but I was in a place that was safe with regard to the Covid situation and as soon as I got word I got up here as quickly as I could.  The point has been better made by other Deputies and, in fairness, the speakers should be allowed to have their say.</p></speech>

Deputies will have to look elsewhere for where those schedules come from.  Those schedules, as I understand it, are estimated times.  When we started this debate, the Minister was the only person in the House.  It has happened before that numerous people have missed their slots or turned up outside of time.  The precedent is that, once the Minister has been called, we do not revisit the situation.  We continue and the Minister responds.  In light of the reasonable case that people are making, I am persuaded that we should revert and go ahead again, giving people their allocated times.  That would allow us to hear Deputy Barry.  I am changing my ruling on this and will allow people in but I guarantee that it will not happen again.  The Whips of the groups and parties need to take responsibility for ensuring their people are here, whether the process is running a half an hour late or an hour and a half early.  It is not my job to go out and catch Deputies by the hand, lead them to the Chamber and pat them on the back.  That is the job of the Whips.</p></speech>

Gap has announced its intention to close 81 stores in the UK and Ireland.  In this State, there are stores that face closure in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I read the press statement Gap released overnight.  It was full of obnoxious corporate jargon.  The company did not have the decency to tell us how many workers would lose their jobs.  As of now, we have no official figure in that regard but probably in the region of 100 jobs will be axed from the end of August to the end of September.  Has this company availed of the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support scheme or other Covid supports?  If so, we should be told how much.  I appreciate the Minister might not be in a position to give us that figure now.  Will the Minister tell us now whether he intends, if State support money was given to this company, to try to get it back?  It is not good enough that huge multinational corporate outfits take the Irish taxpayer's money and run, which is what this company is doing.</p>  <p>  The trade union movement should act on this situation.  It should take an initiative aimed at retail workers and have a real debate and conversation about what can be done to resist the retail jobs massacre.  Part of what could be done, though not the only thing by a long shot, is to get behind the Debenhams Bill proposed by me and the other Solidarity-People Before Profit Deputies to improve the rights of workers when companies shut down in this fashion and with liquidations, etc.</p> <p> The situation in hospitality in the past few days has focused attention on the plight of young people in general and young workers in particular.  Young people in this country have not been hit the hardest by Covid on the medical side but they have been hit the hardest on the economic front.  A package of supports needs to be put in place as a dividend for young people, given their sacrifices and the patient role they have played over the past 16 months.  Such a package could, and should, include an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;15 an hour.  I ask Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n where he stands on that.  He made a number of very poor points in having a go at Solidarity-People Before Profit in this debate.  Will he support our campaign and call for a minimum wage of &euro;15 an hour?</p> <p> Rents should, at the very least, be frozen.  In fact, they should be cut.  Young people are most affected by rent prices.  There are huge fees and low grants for college students.  Fees should be abolished and there should be a living grant.  There must be an end to discrimination against young people in respect of jobseeker's allowance.  There should not be a two-tier system, young people should get the same payment as other unemployed workers and the rate should be raised.  There must be no JobBridge 2.0.  If there is to be training, it must be decent training, with decent pay and a job at the end of it.  There must be a programme of State investment in jobs for young people.  There is no doubt in my mind that there is a significant increase in Garda harassment of young people throughout the country, especially in working-class communities.  Whatever needs to be done to ensure that is knocked on the head must be done.</p> <p> All of this costs money and the question is from where that money should come.  The answer is that there should, and must, be a Covid wealth tax.  Some people and bodies have done well from the pandemic, including the likes of Google, Netflix, the large pharmaceutical companies and others, as well as some very wealthy individuals, including millionaires and billionaires.  We need a Covid wealth tax to raise the funds needed to lift the living standards of the people who made sacrifices during the pandemic.  Young people must be included as an important part of that.</p></speech>

It is a difficult time for all of us and there must be some flexibility.  There is, of course, a job to be done by the Whip's office in the context of ensuring that we are all properly informed.  I do not expect anyone to catch me by the hand, bring me in here and give me a slap on the back.  In fact, my experience is that there are few who will do that for you in here.  Usually, the Whips give you a kick in the rear end rather than a slap on the back.</p>  <p>  I welcome all the measures that have been put in place by the Government since the very beginning of this pandemic.  The Government has reached out in a general way to sectors and has given appropriate financial support.  However, there are certain sectors that have continued, throughout the Covid period, to complain about a lack of support.  I point to those who are self-employed in the taxi business and in private car and bus hire.  They provide a valuable service and have had to fight all the way through the pandemic for support.  They got some recognition recently but we must do much more for them.</p>  <p>  Another section of society that needs support, as mentioned by other speakers, is young people.  I would make a case to reach out to them and include them in some way, by means of benefits and perhaps other supports.  There is no doubt that there is an economic case to be made for such support and there is also a case around health.  In fact, their inclusion in society and in the available supports is absolutely essential.  I include in that the health supports that are required in terms of safeguarding mental health and general well-being.  We cannot ignore young people, who have lost a large portion of their lives to the Covid restrictions.  The Government should reach out to them and provide them with supports that would give them a clear understanding that it is in touch with their situation and wants to support them as well as everyone else.</p>  <p>  The people involved in private coach hire are getting back to work and providing, in line with the protocols, services for businesses and people on staycations.  However, they are not being supported in a way that would allow them to have free rein throughout the country in terms of access to visitor sites.  I ask that the Office of Public Works, OPW, look at opening those sites and their facilities to enable people to travel the length and breadth of the country, observing the protocols but having the facilities available to them.  That is a simple thing to do and it would help business no end.</p>  <p>  We continually make a case for the hospitality sector and I have certainly done so.  Not only has it been closed for a long time but it has also been given a number of false dawns in terms of when it can reopen.  Businesses have availed of the supports from the Government but they have also invested heavily.  Reopening a business is not a simple thing.  One cannot just reach for a grant and expect everything to follow after that.  Businesses in the hospitality sector have employees who are relying on them.  It is extremely difficult for those businesses to retain their employees and, for those that wish to take on extra employees, it is difficult to get them.  There is much work to be done with the sector in the coming week  to build trust and confidence, acknowledge what is needed and recognise the timely fashion in which it must be delivered.</p>  <p>  Nothing like the announcement on Tuesday should ever happen again.  The Government should be in a position to communicate clearly and follow the line in terms of the expectations that are given to people around reopening.  It was a shocking response from the Government to close the hospitality sector again and give no date for reopening.  It showed really poor management that the Government was not engaged with the sector prior to making that announcement.  It raises the question of what kind of flow of information there is between the chief medical officer, the Cabinet and the rest of Government.  What about us in this House?  Should we not be informed of what is happening, on a weekly basis at least?   We are Members of this Parliament and we represent our constituencies.  We should be given full sight of any of the analysis that is taking place and the information that is flowing between the health authorities and the Government.</p>  <p>  Finally, this legislation includes changes relating to taxes and so on.  There is no place in society for vulture funds to purchase any property that could be used for social housing.  We must take a step beyond where we are now and ensure that sector of the market is kept entirely for those who are most in need of social and affordable housing and those agencies that deliver housing to applicants who are on the housing lists throughout the country.  We must take this step.  We are supposed to be representing the people and the ones who are being entirely deprived at present are the young people starting out in life, wanting to get a foothold on the property ladder and not being able to do it.  All over the country, vulture funds are eyeing up properties and not just stepping into the market but having the ability and financial muscle to take over the market.  The Government needs to set down a clear marker that it will not tolerate such activity and it will put the people who are in need first, namely, young couples and those who want to get on the property ladder, and others can wait.  That can be done by way of taxation and a number of suggestions in that regard have been made in the House.  I would like to see the Minister and the Government imaginatively taking up those suggestions and implementing a policy that tilts the balance in favour of the State, and what we are trying to achieve in terms of policy, and away from the vulture funds.</p></speech>

It is a pity that more of his colleagues do not do likewise.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes any measures that will help businesses through the pandemic.  It is unfortunate that the ability of the Government to plan for changes in circumstances in the course of the pandemic is so lacking.  Although the extension of supports we are here to discuss is welcome, the manner in which the Government has led so many businesses to the edge of reopening just to pull the rug from under them at the last minute is a disastrous way of doing things.  Supports are needed desperately but, unfortunately, the Government has a habit of allowing businesses to spend money buying stock and making preparations for reopening but then putting an end to those plans with very little notice.  This is a waste of the meagre resources with which many of these businesses have left with as a result of the pandemic and it is a waste of the resources with which they have been provided.  What businesses need is not just the financial supports they deserve but a clear roadmap that includes contingency plans designed to address worst-case scenarios in the event of issues of growing concern ultimately interrupting scheduled reopening or the ability to trade effectively.  Unfortunately, what we have seen this week is the inability of the Government to plan for interruptions to the reopening schedule and that has thrown the plans of many businesses into disarray and wasted the money those businesses have spent in anticipation of reopening.</p>  <p>  On a side note, before I came into the Chamber, I got a phone call from a 64-year-old taxi driver.  The Department is telling taxi drivers they have to retrain.  Will someone get real in that Department?  I am asking that the letter sent to taxi drivers this morning be withdrawn.</p>  <p>  Workers have also been affected by this.  Although the extension of the EWSS, which Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for, is welcome, workers are suffering as a result of other factors that are bleeding their meagre resources dry and are limiting their ability to plan for the future and secure a place to call their own.  There is a discrepancy between social housing income limits in my county of Tipperary and those in neighbouring counties.  Income limits in County Tipperary are up to &euro;5,000 lower than those in counties Limerick, Kilkenny and Waterford.  That is excluding people from access to social housing in Tipperary but people on the same income who live a few miles away in another county are entitled to social housing.  There is no justification for this disparity.  These income levels were set in 2011, a decade ago, when private rent and private property prices were much lower.  Given the scale of change in the cost of living since 2011, a review of these limits is long overdue.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who is present, and his colleagues to bear that in mind.  The Minister has given no indication as to when his Department expects to have completed this review.  Instead of giving an answer and addressing the issue, he has sought to kick the can down the road while engulfed in a crisis relating to the ability of investment funds to put home ownership dreams out of the reach of many young children.  The Government made a half-hearted attempt to make it seem like it was dealing with the issue but, crucially, set the new stamp duty rate too low for it to be off-putting to these funds.  The exemption relating to apartments has left a significant number of people out in the cold.</p></speech>

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the phenomenon we have seen in the past 18 months whereby the Government has become the last resort, if one likes, in terms of providing people's income.  It is quite a strange scenario.  Governments all over the world, many of which are very right wing, are actually doing things that are very left wing as a result of the pandemic.  The Government has become the provider of income of last resort for many people and the supporter of business in many cases.  All of that is welcome and has been good and fruitful and, in many cases, has got people through, but there are several situations in which problems have arisen.  It would be useful if the Minister could address them.</p>  <p>  The first relates to the banks.  Several people in my constituency have been approved for home loans.  A man contacted me recently on this issue.  He and his wife both work.  She works in the childcare sector and, as such, had to be on the wage supplement, yet, now that they have been approved for a loan and have located a house in north Leitrim which is within their reach and they can buy, they have been refused permission by one of the main banks, a bank which the State has funded and propped up, to draw down the loan.  That is a big issue for many families who are now in a position where they cannot draw down the loan for which they have been approved because the State, in fairness, came to the rescue of business and made sure those people maintained their income throughout the pandemic.  That is an issue with which the Minister needs to try to get to grips.  He needs to meet the banks and sort this out.  The banks always tell us there is no issue but the truth is that when individuals on the ground look into it, they find there is a serious issue.</p>  <p>  The second issue I ask the Minister to address, perhaps he will come back to me on this, is that many people who received the wage supplement in the past 12 to 18 months have now discovered they will have a tax bill at the end of it because the money they received was gross income rather than net income.  Tax had not been deducted from it.  They were unaware of that at the time and, naturally enough, they spent the money because in most cases it was well down on their normal weekly income.  They now find they will have to try to meet this tax bill some time at the end of the year.  It would be useful for the Minister to make clear that there will be an accommodation with Revenue whereby people will be allowed to pay that money over time, perhaps over a couple of years, rather than having to pay it in a lump sum.  That would be very useful and take a lot of pressure off many people.</p>  <p>  Finally, there is the issue relating to banks, housing, vulture funds and all of that.  This is not just a phenomenon that exists in inner city Dublin.  It is in every part of the country.  The pressure on people to get a roof over their heads and buy a home while competing with these funds is absolutely scandalous.  What the Government has done to date will not work.  There needs to be a recognition of that and the Government needs to do something concrete that will actually work and make sure these vulture funds are pushed out once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100040#RR01200"><p>While I welcome any funds that have been given to the hospitality sector to date, the support does not go far enough.  I say that as a self-employed person and in light of the fiasco during the week relating to inside dining in restaurants and pubs.  As I stated yesterday, we are the only European country that does not have indoor dining.  Even fully vaccinated people cannot dine inside in a pub or restaurant.  Publicans and restaurateurs who have no outside areas have no alternative.  They are in a predicament.  Many of them do not own their pubs or restaurants.  They may have mortgages, dependants or leases.  They have been speaking to the banking sector and pushing back payments in the hope that they will be able to reopen.  I spoke to business owners in the sector, some of whom have been in business for 40 years or 50 years and who had hoped the next generation would take over.  They have spent their life savings trying to make payments while their business has been closed.  The add-on costs such as insurance for the premises still have to be paid.  Some of them have dependants.</p>  <p>  I want the Government to go further in helping to support these people.  Some of them need more funding because they have pushed all their resources into keeping the business afloat.  After all the years spent creating a good business, they are now starting from scratch again.  Some of these people are 60 years of age or 70 years of age and are trying to start their business again in the hope that the next generation will take over.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the businesses that need more support will be looked after and brought with us.</p>  <p>  Reference was made yesterday to the position of the younger generation.</p> <p>They are in college and they had summer jobs and were also in receipt of a payment, which was welcomed.  Many of those students will not now qualify for a SUSI grant for next year because they are slightly above the income threshold due to the payments they received during the periods when they were unemployed.  I ask for that to be looked at.  It should be waived for this year.  Students who qualified to have their college fees paid for them last year should automatically qualify this year.  What happened is not the fault of the younger generation.  There was a pandemic.  We must be conscious of that fact.  People and families are now going to have to try and find the funds to pay the fees.</p> <p> I wish to make a final brief point.  The external hospitality sector is open for holidaymakers.  We are all hoping to get a few days away somewhere.  Following the ruling that was made during the week that the pubs will remain closed, we are hoping that all the young men and women who work in hospitality will look after us on holiday, whether it is at the pool or at outdoor sport and recreation facilities.  On their nights off, however, they will not be allowed to eat or drink inside because they have not been vaccinated.  This has not been thought through.  The Government needs to consider those working in the hospitality sector.</p> <p> The bus, taxi and limousine sectors have also been affected.  The workers in these sectors must be considered.  They have missed out in revenue.  They have received subsidy payments during the pandemic.  However, the problem is the requirement that vehicles must be replaced every nine years for drivers to get a taxi licence.  Drivers have lost profits and have had to use their own savings to keep their businesses afloat, even though they were closed.  Now that they are coming back to work, they face having to replace vehicles that are more than nine years old.  Drivers will need three to four years to be able to recoup that to get them back to where they need to be.</p> <p> Some business owners in the bus sector bought vehicles at the start of the pandemic.  Some of these buses have been re-registered and parked up.  While the banks granted borrowers repayment holidays, many of them have to deal with the issues they face during the loan term.  When they open up their businesses again, their repayments are higher because they have to pay back the amount borrowed within the term of the loan.</p> <p> We have a housing crisis, a materials crisis, a crisis at the ports and a felling licence crisis.  All of these crises are causing problems for people who building or renovating homes and who are trying to make sure that they and their children will have a roof over their heads at an affordable price.  I have worked in construction all my life and I have never seen the like of it.  We are being told by our suppliers that they will only guarantee the price of the materials for one week.  Many people want one-off houses built.  I am now having to refuse to price such projects because of the fluctuation in the cost of materials coming in.  When you build a house, you include a percentage margin in the contract.  In determining the percentage margin, you factor in things going wrong and having to make minor amendments to the house.  However, you do not factor in the cost of materials increasing week on week.  In one case, in a job that we were doing, the price of steel went up by 19% over a period of three weeks.  No business could sustain that.  On the other side, the householders have their mortgage and have a set amount with which to build their house.  Everything is pencilled in.  However, such increases in the price of materials cannot be legislated for.  If the issue with felling licences was resolved, there would not be so much pressure on the producers of the raw materials, such as timber.  Those running businesses in the hospitality sector who need timber to create socially distanced eating and drinking areas cannot get the basic materials to do so.  There is a knock-on effect.  The price of insulation has also gone through the roof.</p> <p> It is often said that we should go green and go electric.  The ESB has announced that prices will rise by 9%.  Here we go.  We are pushing everything.  There is a carbon tax.  The people in the towns, villages and rural areas in Ireland are paying the most money because they have no infrastructure.  They do not have access to bus and train services like those living in Dublin.  People living in Dublin can leave their front door and find a shop within 100 yards of their home.  They have access to taxis and the Luas.  They have everything.  However, for there is no infrastructure in towns, villages and rural areas.  The people in those areas are paying the highest levels of carbon tax because they have no other choice.  The Government tells us we should go electric.  What happens then?  The price of electricity goes up by 9%.  This means that the cost of running electric vehicles will increase by 9%, as will the cost of using electricity at home.  The cost of everything is increasing.  The carbon tax and the cost of electricity are rising.  Everything is on the rise.  It is not sustainable.</p> <p> Finally, I wish to make a point on the cost of rent in my area.  For the past number of years, the cost of rent for a nice house in a rural area has fluctuated between &euro;600 and &euro;800 per month.  A two-bedroom house in my area was recently leased at a cost of &euro;1,200 per month.  There are people whose children are moving home because they cannot afford to rent if they are in the family way.  My son is a perfect example of this.  He, his partner and my grandchild failed to find rental accommodation anywhere within a 20-mile radius of where I live.  When they put their names down for a place on the market and looked at their income, they realised that they could not make ends meet.  That is a problem going forward.  The Government must think about it.</p> <p> I know that the Government has taken some measures, but it must sit down with certain businesses.  Accommodations need to be made for the next three or four years to allow people to rebuild.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100041#SS00200"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to speak.  It is very difficult for us to watch our time slots.  As has been mentioned, often, Government politicians do not turn up for their slots.  They fail to turn up, even though it is hugely important for them to speak on these issues for the people they represent.  You could easily lose a speaking slot even if you are in a safe place watching the debate and trying to do your constituency work at the same time.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus on a number of issues in relation to this Bill that need to be ironed out in this country.  These issues concern the nursing home, hospitality, taxi and entertainment sectors, all of which are in very serious financial positions at present.</p>  <p>  I will start with the nursing home sector.  A very unwise decision was made during the pandemic.  At the beginning of the pandemic, Nursing Homes Ireland had to call out the inadequacies of Government planning to support nursing homes and to protect residents and staff from Covid-19.  Nursing homes took early action to advise that visits to homes by the public would be suspended when the public health focus was on protecting other health services and other sectors of society.  This highlighted the failure to plan in respect of and support nursing homes in the fight against a virus that was having a devastating impact on those homes.</p>  <p>  It is extremely disappointing that it has been left to nursing homes to bring our attention the fact that the Government is again abandoning them, their residents and staff.  I find it very difficult that, as NPHET is warning that 700,000 cases and 2,000 deaths could occur in the coming months, the Government is removing the support for intensified infection control measures within nursing homes.  As of today, 1 July 2021, the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, will cease to support the increased deployment of staff and the enhanced utilisation of specialised equipment required to intensify infection prevention control measures in nursing homes.  The scheme has played an integral role in contributing to the additional costs, and supporting the implementation, of intensified infection prevention control.</p>  <p>  Measures in private and voluntary nursing homes are not included in the context of fair deal scheme fees.  The cessation of such support runs contrary to the recommendations of the public health Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel and the advice of HIQA that we must sustain the implementation of such measures.  It also contradicts measures taken by the UK Government this week to extend its similar support scheme for care homes to the end of September, congisant of the ongoing necessity for intensified measures to continue to protect residents and staff from the virus.</p> <p> NPHET has given a stark wake-up call that Covid-19 has not gone away, with the approaching Delta variants heightening public health concerns, yet the first supports to be withdrawn are those affecting the people who are most impacted by this pandemic, namely, nursing home residents and staff.  It would be laughable if it were not so serious.  There is no funding for nursing homes.  The action being taken by the Government contradicts the health experts&rsquo; recommendation on continued protection of nursing home residents and staff at this continually precarious time and defies logic.  Why does the Minister not ask NPHET for its advice on this again?  What is happening is laughable.  Can the Minister reinstate immediately the scheme to cover the months ahead?  It needs to be continued to ensure sustainability and continuity of service provision.  The irony of the whole thing is ridiculous.  The Minister is taking money from nursing homes that are protecting the most vulnerable, yet he is closing businesses all over the country in the name of protecting the public.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  The Government is trying to sell the protection of people when funding should surely remain in place for the nursing homes.  I would appreciate it if the Minister considered that issue further because it is of great concern to Nursing Homes Ireland, all the nursing homes and their staff and residents, who have suffered a lot for well over 12 months.</p> <p> I would like to speak about the hospitality sector.  Publicans and restaurateurs got an unmerciful kick again this week.  A shockingly poor and ill-judged decision was made, again at the last minute.  The Government seems hell-bent on promising something to the sector continuously and pulling it in the last seconds.  I am told some of those affected had stock purchased.  Those selling the products will not give them any credit; they want cash up-front.  A decision was made in the last seconds to keep the businesses closed.  This was outrageous and badly handled.  The Government needs to wake up a small bit.  I do not believe it has any sympathy.  Admittedly, there was a storm at the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting last night at which members were pulling the hair out of each other but that is not much good if something is not happening.  At the end of the day, the backbenchers are no longer listened to, and some of them are not opening their mouths at all.</p> <p> The bottom line concerns the payments the Minister is putting in place for the businesses.  They have now been closed for months.  The length of time is incredible.  The businesses have been destroyed.  Their loyal employees have to leave and try to find employment elsewhere, if possible.  The sector might be looking for workers in the area of outdoor dining but outdoor dining is not all it is cracked up to be.  I looked at the forecast for this weekend.  Saturday, Sunday and Monday are to be wet.  There will not be a sinner out because people are not going to stay outside in the rain.  It is okay if the sun shines.  I cannot understand why the Government did not sit down with representatives of the hospitality sector before it met NPHET to determine what efforts businesses would make to ensure their customers would be safe.  If it did, it could then sit down with NPHET and ask how the businesses could be reopened at the beginning of July, as promised, with safeguards in place and with everyone working together.  Instead, there is a shut-door policy.  The sector has no say.  The Government meets and talks to its representatives when the horse has bolted and businesses are in tatters.</p> <p> I would greatly appreciate it if the Minister outlined this evening what compensation he has set out for the publicans and restaurateurs who have had their businesses destroyed, do not know where they stand and do not trust any Government politician.  They have no faith that the Government will stand over tomorrow what it will say today.  </p> <p> What is happening affects musicians.  They are totally dependent on the little bit of business they used to get in the pub or restaurant.  They feel neglected and do not know where to turn.  They have been told to consider a different type of job.  It is easier said than done.  Musicians who may have done something all their lives are told all of a sudden that they must change their whole world and consider a job that may not be available.</p> <p> Reference was made to taxi drivers.  There are ways of resolving the crisis in the taxi sector.  The nine-year rule dictating when a car should be changed is incredible.  It could easily be worked on.  The cars are fully tested and perfect on the road in every way.  There is a ruling in this regard that needs to be changed.  Other rules also need to be addressed but changing this one would at least be a great help.</p> <p> Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned increases in electricity bills.  We have a major crisis in our country in this regard.  Somebody rang me today to remind me that there is a rural charge.  Now, apparently, the ESB is bringing in some generators because we are running out of electricity in our country.  We will not mention the Green Party or go any further in this regard for now.  There is talk about ways of saving energy but why has it not been considered that the lights in many towns and on many streets could be turned off for a few hours some night?  In some parts of the airport in Cork, there are up to 500 lights.  They do not need to be on all night.  We are not exploring the options but we are certainly facing a crisis in that we are to have no power in the country.  It is extremely worrying for many.  We have had four amber alerts in the past 12 months, which is unprecedented.</p> <p> The announcement during the week on the hospitality sector has affected many young people who wanted to make their first holy communion or do their confirmation.  It is funny that we find out that NPHET never made a ruling on that but the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, did.  He is now the new health adviser.  That is a new move.  He decided that first holy communions and confirmations would not go ahead.  It is just one day - one day on which the children could have a little bit of enjoyment.  It could have been done safely but, again, nobody sat down and talked to anybody.  It is dictation from the top.  Could the church have had an outdoor ceremony?  There are many ways in which the issue could have been addressed but there is nobody listening.  Considering all the compensation, no one has ever thought of giving compensation to the clergy or church in these difficult times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100042#TT00200"><p>I am pleased to support the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which will give effect to some of the decisions announced as part of the Government's economic recovery plan.  This legislation will help to support our citizens and businesses during the next stage of our country's recovery.</p>  <p>  Following public health advice and the risk posed by the Delta variant of Covid, particularly to those who are not yet fully vaccinated, the next phase of reopening will be based on a cautious approach.  We are aware that this is a difficult decision for many sectors, particularly for so many businesses which had believed they would be able to reopen in early July.</p>  <p>  As the country and economy have reopened slowly over the past few weeks, the demand for the PUP, EWSS and CRSS has declined sharply.  Although the outlook for the next few weeks is not yet clear, the provisions of this Bill will provide certainty to businesses and allow them to plan ahead.</p>  <p>  The EWSS has been a key component of the Government's response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.  This scheme gives employers impacted by Covid-19 a subsidy per employee to help to keep them in employment.</p>  <p>  The CRSS provides support for businesses that are forced to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels because of Covid-19 restrictions that either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers of the business from accessing the premises in which the business is carried on.</p>  <p>  The Government's commitment to supporting businesses is underlined by the decision earlier this week that additional support will be payable under the scheme to those businesses that have been asked to remain closed in line with public health advice.  Such businesses may apply for a double payment for a period of two weeks, subject to the statutory maximum payment of &euro;5,000 per week for the weeks from 5 July to 19 July.</p> <p>The extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme will give clarity and certainty to businesses as to their tax liabilities for the remainder of 2021 and will help them with their cash flow as they seek to recover from the effects of the pandemic.</p> <p> This Bill also introduces a new scheme, the business resumption support scheme, which will be a great support to businesses reopening and will be implemented in September.  This scheme is being introduced for vulnerable but viable businesses, particularly in sectors that were significantly impacted throughout the pandemic, even during periods when restrictions were eased.  Businesses whose turnover is reduced by 75% in the reference period, 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021, compared with 2019 will be eligible.  The scheme will not be restricted by location, rate-paying or physical premises.  Businesses which previously availed of other schemes such as the small business assistance scheme for Covid and the tourism business continuity scheme, for example, as well as the Covid restrictions support scheme, will be eligible to apply for a once-off payment based on a percentage of their average weekly turnover for 2019, subject to a maximum payment of &euro;15,000, provided they meet the qualifying criteria. </p> <p> The business resumption support scheme is designed to support some of the worst affected businesses in the pandemic, especially for those businesses that continue to be significantly impacted even after the easing of public health restrictions.  I am also pleased that charities and sporting bodies which did not qualify for the CRSS because of specific tax treatment will be included in this scheme.  That it is innovative and good for communities.</p> <p> I also welcome the extension of the 9% VAT rate, following its reduction from 13.5% in budget 2021, until August next year.  This will be vital to businesses in the restaurant and catering services, guest and holiday accommodation, entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, museums, fairgrounds, amusement parks and sporting facilities, and also services such as hairdressing and other personal services.  These services in all our local towns and villages have had a difficult period and the extension of the reduced VAT rate until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for that sector.  I stress that that date is approximately one year from now and extending the reduced VAT of 9% rate for such a long period is an excellent commitment.</p> <p> The Bill also puts the financial resolution of 19 May, which introduced a 10% stamp duty charge on multiple purchases of houses, on a permanent statutory footing' while providing for an exemption on stamp duty to the provision of the mortgage-to-rent scheme by private sector participants, which is an important part of the broader social and affordable housing agenda.  The purpose of this section is to impose a higher stamp duty rate on the multiple purchase of residential units and the financial resolution allowed this to have immediate effect.  It forms part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the recent phenomenon of commercial institutional investors bulk purchasing homes at or near completion in competition with the owner-occupier market and first-time and family purchasers.</p> <p> The Government has been very active in providing timely and targeted supports which have been vital to so many businesses in our economy.  In the region of &euro;7 billion has been spent under the three schemes being extended under this Bill, the CRSS, the EWSS and the debt warehousing to which I referred.  I am delighted the Government has kept its promise that there will be no cliff edge to supports for businesses and is extending and enhancing supports to businesses as they reopen. </p> <p> It is appropriate that we are extending the vital supports such as the CRSS, EWSS and debt warehousing.  The new business resumption support scheme, which will be available in September, will provide additional support to the businesses worst affected by the pandemic restrictions.  The new higher rate of stamp duty will help to discourage bulk purchasing of residential properties by commercial investors.</p> <p> For these and many other reasons too numerous to mention in the seven minutes available to me, I support this legislation.</p></speech>

One of the Deputies speaking earlier alluded to the appropriateness or otherwise of compensation for the church.  I am not certain if I agree with him on that but there are parents who have put themselves to a considerable amount of expense.  They have bought clothes, as is necessary for the ceremony for their children.  They will not be able to get their money back.  As we know, children grow and will not be able to use those clothes again.</p>  <p>  Some thought needs to be given to the off-the-cuff remarks made by the T&aacute;naiste and the very real impact they have on families.  The suggestion now is that these sacraments would have proceeded if the question had not been asked.  I do not know if that is true but I do know that families are really struggling and this is a real blow to them.  As there are two Ministers in the House, I ask them both to give some consideration to what can be done for these families because they find that, through no fault of their own, they have gone to considerable expense.  Many of them live in my area where a communion ceremony was due to take place on Saturday.  What will they do now?  They will not be able to get their money back and they are seriously out of pocket.  As well as the disappointment for the children and their families and all that involves, they cannot understand how one sacrament, a wedding, can go ahead while other sacraments cannot.  Perhaps the Government can explain that issue to the people affected.  I am not saying the decision was right or wrong.  I am simply asking that the Government consider the impact of the glib off-the-cuff remark made by the T&aacute;naiste.</p>  <p>  I welcome the business resumption supports.  They will be very important but there is still a great deal that is absent.  Certain sectors, such as aviation, tourism, hospitality and parts of retail, are devastated and on their knees.  I will focus briefly on retail.  We have seen the loss of jobs in Arcadia, Carphone Warehouse, Debenhams and, most recently, Gap.  Mandate trade union has called for a forum on the future of retail.  When asked about it the T&aacute;naiste shrugged his shoulders and said retail was changing.  I am asking him not to give up on the retail sector and not to shrug his shoulders or simply say people are shopping online now and that is it.  Mandate's proposal for a forum on the future of retail to protect jobs is very worthwhile and I urge the T&aacute;naiste to consider it.</p>  <p>  On aviation, 480 jobs have been lost in Stobart Air.  This will be the third time I have asked a member of the Government to appoint a person from the Department of Social Protection to deal directly with these people.  They are at a complete loss having lost their jobs and they need some supports.  At the third time of asking, please make this appointment.</p>  <p>  The 180,000 jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector depend on a plan.  I ask that the plan be published and some certainty given because many retailers and many of those involved in hospitality and tourism have purchased what they needed from wholesalers to get them through because they thought they would be reopening.  They now find themselves out of pocket for those purchases.  Many of them are down to their last shilling, as the Government knows.  Bespoke packages most be provided for the sectors most affected, namely, aviation, tourism, hospitality and parts of retail.</p></speech>

T&aacute; mo thaca&iacute;ocht ag dul don Rialtas maidir leis an mBille seo.</p>  <p>  Is Bille cuimsitheach &eacute; agus t&aacute; 31 leathanach agus 15 mh&iacute;r ann.  T&aacute; formh&oacute;r na m&iacute;reanna sin ag tabhairt tuilleadh taca&iacute;ochta do lucht gn&oacute;, do charthanachta&iacute; agus d&rsquo;eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile ar an talamh.  Is rud dearfach &eacute; sin.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; fadhbanna agam leis, &aacute;mh, &oacute; thaobh an d&aacute; rud at&aacute; curtha isteach ann, is iad, na taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; do lucht gn&oacute; ar l&aacute;mh amh&aacute;in &ndash; agus is rud maith &eacute; sin &ndash; ach ar an l&aacute;mh eile cuireadh dleacht stamp&aacute;la isteach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach agus ba cheart go mbeadh p&iacute;osa reachta&iacute;ochta ann f&eacute;in ann maidir leis an dleacht stamp&aacute;la.</p> <p>I welcome this legislation and also the fact that I have some time to speak about it and do not have to rush.  It is very important legislation, comprising 31 pages and 15 sections.  I welcome it all.<br/><br/>My first difficulty, however, is the inclusion of provisions relating to stamp duty.  Those provisions should be in separate legislation; they should not be in this Bill.  I will come back to that and what is in those provisions because I have time to do so.<br/><br/>What is my difficulty with the Bill?  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny, no general scheme published and no regulatory impact assessment published.  We are therefore dependent again on a helpful digest on the Bill prepared by the Library and Research Service.  Its staff are under strain.  They are constantly trying to produce documents for Deputies, and we are all very grateful for that.<br/><br/>I welcome in particular the extension of the EWSS to 31 December 2021 and the extension of the CRSS, but the Minister might tell me why that has been extended only to September 2021.  The extension is up to the Minister, but why would we not give certainty at this point rather than waiting?  I welcome the enhanced restart week payments under the CRSS.  All that is very positive.  There is also the new business resumption support scheme.  We need to see the details of that, and a committee is the best place to look at that.  All these schemes have been very good.  I cannot fault the Government on its reaction or the supports given.  Where I do fault it is on the failure in analysis.  We have people coming to us, such as the various groups that have been mentioned, who fall outside of these schemes, and it is very hard as Deputies to find our way around that.  I would have thought there should be an ongoing analysis of whether these schemes are meeting the needs, given the Monopoly money we are giving out, and rightly so.  However, there has to be accountability and some mechanism in order that we can see whether the schemes are meeting the needs of the businesses and the organisations on the ground and the additional groups the Minister has highlighted such as sporting clubs and charities.<br/><br/>At some stage we will also have to consider whether we are going forward in a way that is transformative because we have no choice but to do that.  Theoretically, we have learned from Covid and learned that there is a climate crisis, so we need transformative action.  If those of us in opposition had suggested spending this amount of money before when we were coming up with ideas, the Government would have laughed at us, yet it is able to come up with this money, and rightly so, but it must be with an overall picture.  Will we have a more sustainable green economy in the aftermath of all of this?  Will we live up to our obligations under climate change legislation?  Have we really learned?  What makes me doubt that a little is the manner in which the Government this week had to rush through the D&aacute;il legislation, to which I gave my full support, to take away the uncertainty on the ground which arose in Galway.  I offer our gratitude to the chief superintendent there who raised the matter.  The Government gave a message of an outdoor summer.  That message became synonymous with outdoor eating and outdoor drinking, and no thought went into a balancing of rights.  That might seem very small, but Galway is a thriving city and the message went out that we wanted people to thrive even more but only as consumers.  The message of an outdoor summer did not involve a broader vision.  It did not involve support for canoeing clubs, which I outlined the last day I spoke.  I am allergic to repetition but it is important to repeat that no support was provided for a real outdoor summer, that is, for athletic clubs, sporting clubs, circus clubs and so on.  There is a particularly good circus in Galway that involves athletics but not animals.<br/><br/>Then there was no balancing of rights in respect of residential areas.  I and the other Deputies and Senators in Galway were inundated with complaints, and rightly so, from residential areas.  In my area, the Claddagh, I spent four hours and 20 minutes one night observing, walking around and going up to garda&iacute; to get them to come down.  There was a mixture of reactions from those garda&iacute;, which I understood completely.  There were not enough garda&iacute; on duty, they were worried about catching Covid, they could not do anything and they could not stop people getting drink from the off-licences.  They went to the point of saying, &quot;This is what you would expect for a summer in Galway&quot;, as people urinated publicly in the streets, drank in an out of control way and so on.  Most people were absolutely well behaved - that goes without saying - but the Government's message allowed for out-of-control behaviour, with no clear message to garda&iacute;, who were left in a limbo.  In religious terms, limbo has been abolished, I understand, but garda&iacute; were left in limbo, not knowing which law they were enforcing or how to enforce the law.  They were left to exercise their discretion, which was absolutely impossible.<br/><br/>On top of that, and while I have the time, I will mention again by way of balance that in 2002 Galway City Council passed a Barcelona declaration after a long consultation.  That declaration committed Galway city to be universally accessible for all its residents.  We were moving away from labels and we had a mantra: good design enables, bad design disables.  We were to roll out all our future projects, including outdoor drinking areas, under that overall umbrella of universal access.  That was thrown overboard with the message from the Government to drink and eat, giving out money - I think &euro;17 million was the figure mentioned - and telling local authorities to help as best they could to take over public space, but with no analysis and no balancing of rights.  While I understand that the Government is under pressure and that there are many powerful voices, at the end of the day we have to balance rights.  There was no balancing of rights in the way the message went out.  I hope the Government will learn from that and come back to that.<br/><br/>As for the music and entertainment industry, I am on a committee.  I do not turn up to its meetings very often but I warned the committee of that from the beginning.  I fully support the Music &amp;amp; Entertainment Association of Ireland.  It has formed a cross-party committee.  It has appealed to us and begged us to use our voices on its behalf at every forum.  One of its specific demands relates to VAT.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill that will keep VAT at the reduced rate of 9% but they do not apply to the music and entertainment industry.  Could the Minister address that?  He is more of an expert than I am in this area.  This is one practical step that could be taken.<br/><br/>The 10% stamp duty provision should not be in the Bill, it should be in separate legislation.  It is extremely important that this be debated.  While it is welcome that the Government is now taking a step, it is far from comprehensive and far from what we need.  An investor with more than ten houses will finally be penalised with extra stamp duty if they buy ten or more houses in one year.  I imagine there will be so many loopholes in this that it will make it ineffective on the ground.  However, let us take it as it is for the moment that the 10% will have some effect on the market.  We are excluding apartments.  Many other speakers have spoken far more eloquently than me about how daft it is to exclude apartments from this on the basis of some forward purchase agreement.  It would not be good for the market or for the supply of houses.  This Government and previous Governments, with their mantra about the market and their accusing us of being ideological, are actually full of ideology themselves.  Their ideology is that the market will provide and that when it does not do so, the Government will provide the market with all necessary supports.  When the Government talks constantly about &euro;3 billion-odd, the biggest amount of money given by any Government for housing and public housing in this country, it fails to say that &euro;1.5 billion of that is going directly into the pockets of landlords and in a manner that is keeping prices and rents artificially high.  Looking at Galway - I will come back to Dublin - <i>daft.ie</i>showed that in the first quarter of 2021, the average monthly rental price in Galway was &euro;1,400, an increase of 6.7%.  The <i>daft.ie</i>house prices report, another report, showed that house prices in Galway rose by 11.9% in the year to quarter 1 of 2021.</p> <p>The Simon Community takes a snapshot of the market every quarter.  For the past two years, it has continuously told us that no houses are available to rent privately within the HAP limits or generally because supply is so bad.  In March 2021, it reported that there were just two properties in Galway city suburbs and two properties in Galway city centre available within the standard and discretionary HAP limits.  <br/><br/>The strategic housing development for the Crown Square scheme in Mervue, Galway, is a build-to-rent housing scheme.  Originally, in 2019, it was granted permission for 288 apartments.  It recently applied for modified and higher density development, blocks of four to nine storeys, with 345 apartments of which 35 are for social housing.  God knows what that means because when I listen to the Government, the phrase &quot;social housing&quot; means anything from the housing assistance payment, HAP, which is not social housing - it is a social support but really is a market incentive - to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, to long-term leasing.  On top of the scheme the Government is bringing in at 10%, it is going to exclude entities or developers that buy up more than ten houses and sell them back to local authorities.  It is not possible to make this up.  I have described it before as a jigsaw with no picture: there are all these pieces that the Government gives us.  They include affordable housing that is not affordable, stamp duty on just ten houses or more with as many loopholes as possible to make the measures non-effective and useless and leasing schemes with no security of tenure, only security of finance for the developer or landowner but certainly not for the tenant.<br/><br/>I thought I was beyond shock and that I had lost that innocence that is somewhere in me that we can change things but yesterday, I read a headline stating:</p><blockquote>	Nama puts Finglas residential rental portfolio for sale at &euro;14.5 million.  Sale of 54 apartments at Prospect Hill offers buyer scope for &euro;1.092m in annual rental income. </blockquote> <p>The article notes the sale of 54 units is &quot;guiding at a price of &euro;14.5 million&quot;.  The reason I use this example is that it really encapsulates the bubble that the Minister is asking us to live in and asking us to believe that this bubble is normality.  The guiding price of &euro;14.5 million is for units held by NAMA in the public interest and for the common good, presumably.  The writer tells us the 54 units are in the &quot;aptly-named Prospect Hill scheme offers the prospective purchaser the opportunity to secure annual rental income of &euro;1.092 million&quot; and goes on to state it is part of a development of 479 apartments.  Interestingly, the 54 apartments are distributed across six blocks.  It is under-rented, despite the crisis, and &quot;the subject portfolio is currently under-rented with just 26 of the units fully-occupied at an average monthly rent of &euro;1,200&quot;, which in itself prompts a range of questions.  Why are they empty under NAMA?  How many other apartments under NAMA are empty?  How many other are empty with other developers?  Then, let us look at the delightful rent of &euro;1,200.  This delightful journalist tells us the rent is &quot;relatively low&quot;.  Remember that the median wage is &euro;36,000, and this rent of &euro;1,200 is &quot;relatively low&quot;, <i>The Irish Times </i>tells us, &quot;when compared to the rents being achieved across the capital at present&quot;.  Significantly, the article then states &quot;The remaining 28 units are vacant and ready for occupancy.&quot;  How long have they been empty?  Moreover, it states &quot;26 of these can be let at full-market rent, as they have not been let previously&quot; and &quot;Market rents are in the region of &euro;1,700 a month&quot; and so on.  The article then tells us the delightful point for a third time that the basic return per year is &euro;1.092 million.  And yet, the Minister tells us that he is seriously committed to affordable housing.  <br/><br/>I will conclude.  I do not recall having so much time for a long time and I am tiring of listening to my own voice but I have to use it to say that where we used to talk about Namaland in respect of what the Government is doing about housing, this is bubbleland.  The State needs to give a clear message that housing is not a commodity; it is a home.  In giving that message to the market, it would give a serious message that the State will provide homes whether through developers or, in my preference, through a mixture of small builders who are crying out for work in Galway.  There should be an audit of public land, which the Land Development Agency has failed to give us.  There is a task force in Galway which has never reported and which was set up because we have a crisis in Galway with people waiting on a waiting list for 15 solid years of their lives.  We set up a task force that has never reported.  I ask the Minister to look at that.  I asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about it and he told me it had reported.  He kindly gave me a copy of the reports but they are not reports.  Instead, they are only letters that give an outline of when the meetings took place, who chaired them and who attended but with no analysis of the housing crisis and no attempt to give solutions.<br/><br/>Finally, I must take the opportunity to say that Galway City Council has no overall city architect.  Let me put on the record that it has very good staff but it has no city architect and no plan for Galway overall in the interest of the common good.  It has many developments that are developer-led.  The harbour is entirely separate.  It intends selling off public land, I would say, to the highest bidder.  There is an entirely separate university development in a different area, namely, Nun's Island.  There is a separate development that is a mixture of co-operation between the city council and the Land Development Agency in Sandy Road.  There is Dyke Road and then there is 115 acres out at the airport.  I am only mentioning some of the land and not any institutional public land owned by institutions that might be willing to give it.  I look at the Minister and ask, how come no one has taken Galway, even as a pilot project, and asked why there is no overall plan based on the common good?  Why would the harbour be allowed to sell off residential land to the highest bidder?  Why would the Land Development Agency work with a council to maximise the cost of houses while the Minister tells us, using different language, that he is all about affordability.  Kafka is not in it with the Government.  Really and truly, the Government excels and when it comes to Kafka, he is only in the halfpenny place.  </p></speech>

I want to begin by addressing some of the points made by Deputy Connolly where she invoked the darkness of Kafka in her analysis of the Department and the Government's housing policy and the work that we are doing.</p>  <p>  I had the opportunity yesterday morning to visit the work under way in Dominick Street on the northside of Dublin, where I saw at first hand the work that is being done by Dublin City Council.  It is building new public and social homes for 70 families, partly to move families from existing council accommodation in Dominick Street and with the balance being used to bring families who are on the waiting list for public and social housing into new accommodation.</p> <p>To allege that this is a Government that has allowed the market to take the lead in providing accommodation to those who need support and who need housing, accommodation and homes to be delivered by the local authority and by the Government is at odds with the reality of what I saw yesterday.  I saw new, excellent accommodation that will be made available at affordable rents, directly funded by the Government and delivered by Dublin City Council in the heart of the city centre.  That, more than an analogy to Kafka, is the reality of what this Government is doing.  The charge that the Government is not playing a leading role in the delivery of housing in the country does not stand up to scrutiny for a second when the largest single builder of homes in the country at the moment is the Government, through local authorities.  We accept and believe the private sector has a role to play in building homes and it was good to hear Deputy Connolly accept that private developers have a role to play in the building of homes.  However, we also believe that this must be accompanied by the State, through local authorities, directly building homes.  That is what is happening in Dominick Street, in St. Mary's Mansions in Sean McDermott Street, in St. Bricin's Park in the heart of Stoneybatter and in O'Devaney Gardens, through work Dublin City Council is doing.  That is the reality of what is under way and that is only a small part of the northside of Dublin.  This is progress that is being replicated all over the country.  We wish it were happening quicker but because of the effects of the pandemic, for a period we were not in a position to build homes.  We are now coming through the pandemic, notwithstanding the challenges we face with the Delta variant, and the Government is committed to directly building homes at scale through local authorities.</p> <p> I will deal with the various points made about the Bill.  Deputy Doherty made the point that there is a real possibility of an uneven recovery, as we hopefully put the pandemic behind us.  That is the reason the Government has such a breadth of economic supports in place.  That is the reason we have the employment wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment.  It is to reduce the risk of an uneven recovery and to use all of the resources that are available to us to support the income and jobs of citizens at a time in which they need help the most.</p> <p> Deputy Nash referred to assessing the role of the pandemic unemployment payment and keeping it under review.  It is in acknowledgement of that point that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, made the decision to extend the entry point for the pandemic unemployment payment for a while longer.  She did so in recognising that there are citizens whom we would have hoped would be back at work but who will not be a position to do so.  Deputy Nash takes a different view on the role of VAT in the hospitality sector.  The role the rate will play for now is in supporting the viability of large employers and many small employers at exactly the time they need help the most.</p> <p> Deputy Murnane O'Connor welcomed the certainty that is being provided by the schemes.  We are extending many of the schemes up to the end of this year to give the certainty to which the Deputy refers.  Deputy Patricia Ryan spoke about the need for small businesses to get support.  Again, that is the reason the schemes are being extended, including the employment wage subsidy scheme, to provide the support small businesses need to keep them viable as we weather this phase of the pandemic.  Thank God we are making progress with the number of people we are vaccinating at the moment but we know that there is still much more that needs to be done.</p> <p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n stated that we are ignoring science.  Whatever we can be accused of this week, a charge that cannot be levelled at us is that we are ignoring the scientists and the public health authorities that work alongside the Government and NPHET in giving us advice.  He referred to the idea that the Government is outsourcing policy decisions to NPHET.  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot attack the Government for the decisions we have made and also say we are outsourcing the ability to make those decisions to NPHET.  It has been very difficult to make the decision to keep more of the hospitality sector closed for a number of weeks.  We know the obligation we have to those affected, to outline a plan regarding how they can regain their viability through indoor hospitality and for other forms of indoor activity for other businesses that are not in hospitality.  We have done it because we have been guided by how we can protect public health while we continue with vaccination programmes that are making a difference to the country.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that Deputy Boyd Barrett is supporting the Bill, notwithstanding the reservations he has about various parts of it.  Deputy McGuinness outlined his views on the hospitality sector and the need to work with it.  I assure him that we are committed to working with it.  It is because of the engagement we have had with the sector that we have an employment wage subsidy scheme that is working and a Covid restrictions support scheme that has had a major impact.  We have a lower VAT rate for the hospitality sector at a time it needs it and we have waived the need to pay rates for a period because that is exactly the kind of support the hospitality sector needs.</p> <p> Deputy Martin Kenny made the fair point that in many cases, the Government has stepped in as the payer of income of last resort when the pandemic hit but went on to make the observation that it was centre-right governments that were doing that.  I make the case to the Deputy that it is because of how we managed our public finances up to this point, combined now with the support of the European Central Bank, that we are in a position to put in place these supports.  That is not about being right wing; it is about trying to make sure that the national finances were safe, were we to be hit by the unexpected.  They were in a good position and combined with the work of the European Central Bank, that has allowed us to do what we are doing at the moment.</p> <p> Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the need to strengthen the supports.  The reason we extended many of the supports in the way we have was to ensure that if we did hit a difficulty, as we have this week, we would not be scrambling around changing support schemes.  We would have a framework in place that is effective, credible and could help, in anticipation of things not always going the way we want.  That is what has happened this week.</p> <p> Deputy Michael Collins referred to nursing homes.  The reason changes are being made to support levels for nursing homes is because of the vaccination programme and our vaccination efforts, which in many cases began in nursing homes, to try to make safe and support our most vulnerable citizens who needed as much help as possible.</p> <p> Deputy O'Reilly alleged that we are shrugging our shoulders in relation to the retail sector.  Again, the very reason we have the current supports in place is to assist the retail sector.  I am conscious of today's news on the decision made by Gap in the United Kingdom and in Ireland.  I agree that shopping habits have changed but that does not diminish the determination of the Government to try to support retailers when this change is under way.</p> <p> As for the stamp duty change included in this Bill, it is appropriate to include it here as this is a finance Bill.  The reason the Government made the changes that it did is to deter behaviour that we wanted to reduce and stop but at the same time to continue to have the policies in place that allow new apartments and homes to be built.  That is what we aim to do with this Bill, namely, to put the balance in place to allow new homes to be built in the future.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

That assessment is particularly applicable to where we stand with the future of banking here in Ireland.  It has been a difficult year.  I want to open by asserting my fundamental view on the future of banking, which is that, ultimately, the banking system should serve as the means to help households and firms achieve their financial, economic and social needs.  I want to update Deputies on some forthcoming legislative and regulatory changes before turning to the latest developments in the banking sector.</p>  <p>  I will begin with what is under way at EU level.  As Ireland is part of the EU's Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, supervision of the Irish banking sector is informed by the EU framework and our main banks are jointly supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank.  The risk reduction measures, RRMs, which are a package of prudential banking reforms agreed by the European Parliament and Commission, which amended the capital requirements regulations, capital requirements directives and the bank recovery and resolution directive, were transposed into Irish law in December.  The Commission is expected to bring forward additional legislative proposals in September to bring the European banking regulatory framework further in line with internationally agreed standards set by the Basel Committee.</p>  <p>  On the domestic front, it is important that problems in the banking sector are anticipated and prevented before they impact on the wider public.  This is why we will bring forward a Central Bank (amendment) Bill to make a significant contribution in this regard.  The Bill will introduce a senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, which will place obligations on firms and the senior individuals within them to set out clearly where responsibility and decision-making lies.  Among other provisions, the Bill will also introduce conduct standards for individuals and firms, imposing binding and enforceable obligations on all regulated financial service providers, RFSPs, and relevant individuals working within them with respect to expected standards of conduct.  Subject to the advice of the Attorney General, I intend to publish the heads of this Bill before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  To keep up with the new ways in which people borrow money, my officials have also been working on a Bill to bring the providers of personal contract plans, PCPs, hire purchase, consumer hire agreements and indirect credit within the regulatory remit of the Central Bank.  This will provide consumers with the protection of the Central Bank's consumer protection code.  A review of the code is under way and a public consultation on the Central Bank's proposals for amendments will take place in 2021.</p>  <p>  With regard to the activity of banks, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, data suggest that the market for new mortgage lending has rebounded quickly from the immediate impact of the pandemic.  Of course, it is important that the necessary prudential and consumer protection measures continue to be applied by lenders as they serve the best long-term interests of everyone in the mortgage market.</p>  <p>  I announced last week my intention to sell part of the State's 13.9% direct shareholding in Bank of Ireland.  To date, &euro;19.2 billion of the &euro;29.4 billion invested in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB over the period 2009 to 2011 has been recovered by way of disposals, investment income and liability guarantee fees.  The remaining investments in these three banks are currently valued at &euro;5.3 billion, leaving a gap of just under &euro;5 billion.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, the State has already recorded a cash surplus to date, with &euro;5.9 billion having been generated as against the &euro;4.7 billion originally invested in the bank.  The State's remaining equity stake in the bank is valued at close to &euro;700 million.  I cannot disclose any further details in regard to the plan at this point as it would be detrimental to maximising value for the taxpayer.  At the end of the period, the trading plan can be renewed at my discretion following consultation with officials and our advisers.</p>  <p>  In April, KBC announced that it had entered a memorandum of understanding with Bank of Ireland which could lead to a transfer of its performing loan book.  This announcement came quickly after NatWest's decision to withdraw Ulster Bank from the Irish market.  I welcome the announcement by Ulster Bank on Monday that it has reached a binding agreement with AIB to sell approximately &euro;4.2 billion of its performing loan book and transfer approximately 280 of the staff who work primarily on that loan book.  It is also welcome that Ulster Bank's negotiations with Permanent TSB and other parties are continuing.</p>  <p>  Ulster Bank also recently announced that it has reached an agreement with the Financial Services Union, FSU, in regard to a severance package for staff.  While this is subject to a ballot of the FSU's membership, it represents constructive progress in regard to Ulster Bank's withdrawal.</p>  <p>  This overview makes clear that our banking sector is currently in a state of flux.  The recent announcements, including those relating to the closure of bank branches, give us cause to reflect on the sector's structure and consider its future.  Advances in technology, the proliferation of innovative fintech players and the expansion of non-bank lending mean we are moving to a more diverse banking sector.  The increasing role of credit unions and An Post in the provision of banking services in the community must also be part of the conversation.  In this context, it is absolutely necessary that we examine the banking sector, review the current landscape, consider how this has evolved over the last two decades and assess how the system can best support social and economic activity.  My Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and I will undertake a broad-ranging review to look in detail at the many relevant issues, including the expectations of the sector, possible gaps in competition and consumer choice and the key role of the banking sector in the provision of sustainable credit to the economy.  The review will need to assess the availability of credit to SMEs from both banks and non-banks, consider whether there are market gaps or failures and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.  It will be necessary to look at the cost of doing business for the sector, including impacts on its sustainability and the forces for change at play or foreseen, be they related, for example, to Covid, Brexit, climate change, housing, regulation or technology.  Many suggestions have already been put forward and I will take them into account in developing the terms of reference.  I assure Deputies that the review will consider various issues raised for this critical sector in our economy and society in recent months.</p>  <p>  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.  The Minister of State and I are well aware of the needs, challenges and expectations of the banking sector in our economy at the moment.  We have had many debates on the sector in the House in recent months.  It continues to be the case that much change is under way.  As I said, I am clear in my expectations and ambitions for what that sector can do within our economy and how it can maintain and grow the employment that it provides, notwithstanding the changes that are under way and the many challenges that, for example, the branch network is facing at the moment, which led to the announcements earlier in the year.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.  The Minister of State will take the House through other areas in the banking sector.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for sharing time with me for this important debate.  The Minister has set the scene for current developments in the banking sector, whether legislative, EU-driven or resulting from market announcements.  All of these matters frame the discussion on the future of banking.  I will follow the Minister's comments by updating Members on some key issues which cut across my areas of responsibility in the Department.  These include the impact of technology on local services, supporting the economy, digitisation and the role of credit unions.</p>  <p>  The banking landscape is changing.  The recent announcements of branch closures are disappointing and regrettable.  The announcement to close branches is clear evidence of the impact technology is having on banking services and the way the public interacts with banks, credit unions and other financial service providers.  There has been a significant change in consumer behaviour recently.  Young people have adapted to change in the use of technology as have many older people.  This is reflected in increased online shopping and purchases from home and online.</p>  <p>  The banking sector is among many businesses that are conducting a greater proportion of their business online.  Contactless payments of up to &euro;50 have resulted in many people using cash less, which is evidenced by the reduction in withdrawals from ATMs recently.  It is important that those who are not familiar with technology are fully provided for and are not excluded.  I am not just talking about elderly people who may not be familiar with modern technology but also about people who may not have access to broadband in their homes or to Internet facilities.  Many people still do not have an adequate mobile phone signal in their homes.  Without these two options, there is a possibility that some people may be excluded.  We have to take that into account.  That is why even though it seems a strange debate in which to make this point, the extension of the national broadband plan throughout rural Ireland will help people to ensure that they are not excluded from banking and other services in future.</p>  <p>  Many people will still want to carry cash and to do their banking in person.  That is many people's choice.  It is worth reflecting that the credit union network, which has over 400 branches, is collectively larger than any of our retail banks at present.  It has a big footprint in our cities, towns and throughout the country.  It is welcome that Bank of Ireland is now entering into a new partnership with An Post.  An Post's network across the country combined with the credit union branch network provides a large number of locations where people can conduct their banking in person on a daily basis.  This will allow personal and business customers to use their local post office for a range of banking services and not just for depositing cash.</p>  <p>  Technology is driven by new services, new ways of banking and greater mobility between service providers.  Increasingly, banks and credit unions are competing with technology-driven firms.  This impacts not just customers but also staff.  Staff must not be left behind in this process.  They must be supported and retrained as banks and credit unions increasingly use new digital skills.  I stress the importance of that.  Many banks and financial companies are technology-driven companies.  One major bank in the financial services sector stated that it has more staff working on technology for the bank than Google has working on technology in Ireland.  People know that you cannot have a debit or credit card without sound technological support to make it all happen.</p>  <p>  When we look to improve the retail financial sector, it is important that we view banks and credit unions as a means to help households and firms to achieve their financial, economic and social needs.  Sustainable and responsible competition in the retail financial sector is vital to ensuring that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options and services available when using financial services and accessing credit.</p>  <p>  Following the recent announcements, we know that many small and medium enterprises, SMEs, including agri-SMEs, will be looking to refinance away from Ulster Bank.  It will also be essential that sustainable businesses and firms will be in place to meet the needs of consumers and the economy when the pandemic has passed and that these firms have access to appropriate credit facilities.  To that end, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has worked closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Finance on the design of a number of credit-related support schemes including the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.</p>  <p>  I believe that credit unions have an opportunity to play a bigger role in providing greater competition in SME and microbusiness lending to many small retailers and sole operators across the country.  Many community credit unions already provide such lending.  Approximately 19 credit unions are involved in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, which will hopefully be a precursor to credit unions taking a larger role in State-supported lending in the future.  I remind people that it is a State-guaranteed loan scheme.  Some 80% of the loan is guaranteed by the State so the risk to the financial institution is significantly diminished.  That is why I welcome credit unions moving into this area.  Since the risk to the financial institution providing the loan is reduced, it can offer competitive rates.  I encourage people to follow up on that scheme.  They can obtain a loan of up to &euro;200,000 without having to give a personal guarantee because of the State's support of this scheme.</p>  <p>  Retail banks and credit unions have had to transform their digital offerings due to customer preference and for cost reasons.  This has led to large, increasing numbers of customers transacting digitally rather than in person.  This shift to digital has been accelerated by the pandemic but was already under way long before the pandemic began.  Banks and credit unions have also had to adapt to new competition from entities which are often digital only.  Our policy framework will need to adapt for these emerging digital finance firms.  Many people like to get old-fashioned bank statements in the post but many others are quite happy to be able to access it on the Internet or their mobile phone.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Finance have been actively engaged in the negotiation of the digital finance package proposals published by the European Commission.  The aim of the digital finance strategy is to ensure that financial services rules are fit for the digital age and to stimulate responsible innovation and competition among financial service providers in the EU, while ensuring a level playing field for all.  The main components of the package are the Commission's communications on retail payments strategy for the EU and a proposal for the regulation of markets in crypto-assets, MICA.  People hear about crypto-assets and cryptocurrencies and any reform or examination of banking in the future will have to be aware of these issues.  There is also a proposal at EU level for the regulation of digital operational resilience, DORA.</p>  <p>  As we move towards a more digitalised system, it is important that legislation ensures that we protect consumers, put in place a more resilient framework and encourage even greater innovation.  Officials are involved in promoting Ireland as a location of choice for financial technology, fintech, development under the Ireland for Finance strategy.  While many of these firms could, and do, compete with banks and credit unions, many are also crucial service providers, assisting the financial system in adapting to the needs of customers.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a review of the policy framework for credit unions, a review that I am currently progressing.  While there are challenges facing the credit union sector, the strengths of the movement cannot be underestimated.  Credit unions have the capacity to help communities all over the country to confront the challenges that they face.  While the movement is undoubtedly a success, I believe that it has the potential to do much more, particularly in developing the structures and expertise to grow SME, micro lending and mortgage lending.</p>  <p>  The Government wants to ensure that banks, credit unions and the wider financial system will effectively contribute to and support economic growth and employment.  The acknowledgment of the positive role of the sector is central to any discussion on the future of banking.</p> <p>Any review must also be forward thinking and forward looking to take account of changing consumer behaviours in the future.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on this important topic and the proposals they have to improve and expand the services provided by banks and credit unions in the overall interests of the economy and our people, especially their staff and customers.  </p></speech>

In response to these developments, many, including the Financial Services Union and Sinn F&eacute;in, have called for the establishment of a forum on the future of banking, bringing in all stakeholders to discuss the current state of the sector, the challenges it faces and to chart a path forward that best serves the interests of customers, staff and financial stability.  While the terms of reference of such a forum should be wide-reaching, its scope should be clear and well defined.  While such a forum will focus on issues such as the digitalisation of financial services and small and medium enterprise, SME, lending, it must also pay attention to the lack of public trust in banks, banking culture and consumer protection.</p>  <p>  On 17 May, the Irish Banking Culture Board published the findings of its public trust in banking survey.  It found that 43% of respondents said that their perception of banks had worsened since the 2008 financial crisis, with only 23% saying their perception had improved.  Overall, 46% recorded a low level of trust in the industry with only 19% recording a high level of trust.  In short, the public are not convinced that sufficient change has taken place to improve its perception of the industry.  This mistrust finds its origin in the financial crisis of 2008 caused by a combination of Government failure and corporate greed.</p>  <p>  However, the financial crash and its consequences are by no means the only explanation for public mistrust of the sector.  In its final report on the tracker mortgage examination, the Central Bank reported that more than 33,000 borrowers had been identified as having been affected by the scandal with &euro;683 million paid in redress and compensation by the end of May 2019.  As the Central Bank noted, since the examination began in 2015, some lenders initially attempted to minimise the number of affected customers to whom they would have to pay redress and compensation.  As a result of the banks' actions, 99 family homes were lost by the end of May 2019.  </p>  <p>  This scandal left a deep and lasting impression in the eyes and minds of the Irish public, an impression that was periodically repeated as banks continued to mistreat their customers even as the examination was under way.  Since 2019, three of the five retail banks have been reprimanded and fined a combined &euro;77.1 million by the Central Bank.  Disturbingly, even during the examination harm was meted out by both KBC and Ulster Bank with their failure to comply with the Central Bank's "stop the harm" principles.  </p>  <p>  Public mistrust in the banking sector is, therefore, a consequence of the actions of banks and nothing else, but responsibility also lies with the regulator and the Government.  The most effective way to manage bad behaviour and reduce bad outcomes is to ensure that individuals are aware of the responsibilities and are held accountable for their actions.  A lack of individual accountability paves the way for misconduct and the mistreatment of customers.  In July 2018, the Central Bank called for a range of reforms that would enhance its toolkit to promote what it describes as "a culture of ethical compliance by firms and individuals".  Among the reforms sought was the introduction of a senior executive accountability regime, which would place obligations on firms and senior individuals to set out clearly where responsibility and decision-making rests, thereby ensuring clear responsibility and accountability.</p>  <p>  More than three years since these reforms were first requested, the Government has yet to publish the heads of Bill of the legislation that would provide for them.  This is simply unacceptable and reveals a Government that does not take accountability in the banking sector seriously.  The legislation that provides for its introduction must be published by the Government without delay.  Trust can only be earned by improvements in standards and the service provided to customers.  As the public trust in banking survey recorded, only 38% of respondents agreed that the banking sector responded well in helping society during the coronavirus pandemic.  As we emerge from the pandemic, the sector has an opportunity to rebuild trust and demonstrate change by the way it treats its customers.  With unemployment unlikely to recover to pre-pandemic levels until after 2022, a cohort of borrowers will find themselves in some form of mortgage arrears and they must be supported.  </p>  <p>  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the mortgage arrears resolution process should have full legal effect with lenders working through the full suite of alternative repayment arrangements with affected borrowers.  This code should be a statutory requirement, not an option.  This must be coupled with an end to the selling of mortgage loans to non-bank entities and vulture funds as the option of first resort.  As the deputy governor of the Central Bank noted in November 2019, "the Central Bank is still having to push banks and non-banks too hard to take a customer centric approach to resolving arrears".  These issues must be included in the terms of reference of any forum on the future of banking. </p>  <p>  The withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC from the market raises other profound questions about our banking sector.  In a response to a letter my colleague, Deputy Doherty, wrote to the Central Bank, the deputy governor warned in December last year that the exit of a retail bank from the market "could contribute to upward pressure to lending interest rates and potentially lead to weaker credit availability".  We now face the exit of two retail banks.  Such change, and the risks it poses, calls for a new strategy towards the sector.  I welcome the willingness of the Central Bank to participate in such a forum and regret the position of the Department of Finance in this regard.  Just as it was appropriate for Departments to engage with stakeholders in the national economic dialogue, so it is appropriate for the Department of Finance and the regulator to engage with stakeholders on the future of the banking sector.  I ask the Minister to now set about establishing the terms of reference for such a forum without delay.</p>  <p>  Today's debate also comes after the announcement by the Minister for Finance last week that he intends to sell the State's shares in Bank of Ireland in the coming months.  More broadly, Sinn F&eacute;in believes it is in the interests of the State, consumer and taxpayer to maintain a shareholding presence in the banking sector.  This includes maintaining a majority shareholding in AIB, especially as the market approaches a state of duopoly with the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC.  This allows the State to pursue its strategic interests when key decisions and transactions take place.  That position should be maintained.  Furthermore, disposing of the State's shareholding in AIB at this time, or in the near future, would fail by some margin to recover the &euro;20.8 billion pumped into the bank by the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has concerns about the timing of this announcement as regards Bank of Ireland, given that its share price has fallen significantly in recent years and its shares are considered to be undervalued presently.  It is essential that any sale achieves value for money for the taxpayer and the Minister must explain why now is the appropriate time to sell. </p> <p> At a meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to discuss banking, it came as a bit of a surprise to hear senior officials from Allied Irish Banks say the banking sector here is very competitive.  I am sure that also came as a surprise to the many informed observers who may have been listening in.  After all, the former President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, told the same committee that when it came to banking we had a quasi-monopoly in this State and that this was a contributory factor in driving up the cost of credit for homes and business borrowers.  If a quasi-monopoly was an accurate an description in 2018 when Mario Draghi made those remarks, with the announcement from KBC Ireland that it is pulling out of the Irish market, it is really accurate today.</p> <p> I listened with interest to the comments of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, on the role credit unions could and should play.  I have previously raised with them my view that credit unions have a significant role to play.  They are trusted institutions in this State.  They are not profit-driven institutions, they are run for the benefit of members and any surplus they generate is returned to members in low interest rates on loans and high interest rates on savings.  The credit union movement has within it the seeds of a not-for-profit banking system.  If credit unions were allowed to compete, they could become real competitors to the banks.  The sector has been saying very clearly that it is being starved out of existence because it can barely get involved in the largest consumer credit market in this State.  I have raised this previously with the Minister and Minister of State when I outlined in detail the regulations the credit unions set out to us, as I am sure they have done to the Minister and Minister of State, that place them at a competitive disadvantage.  I note that today the Minister and Minister of State have said they believe in the credit unions.  </p> <p> I recall that when the credit unions were before the finance committee they set out what they need.  As the Chairman of the committee pointed out, we hear often that people are in favour of the credit unions but we are not seeing action in that regard.  Credit unions would be able to compete and would bring a level of fairness and allow the cost of credit to come down if they were allowed to do so.  That is important going forward.</p> <p> I welcome the opportunity to speak this evening on the future of the Irish banking sector.  I ask the Minister to respond to three points in his closing remarks, namely, the publication of legislation for the senior executive accountability regime, the establishment of the forum and the reason for the disposal of the State's shareholding in Bank of Ireland at this time and if it will provide best value for the taxpayer now and in the next six months.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be delighted that I finished my contribution early.</p></speech>

The level of public interest in this issue is growing.  This is evidenced by the fact that we are having a significant debate on this significant issue so soon after we had a similar debate a few short months ago.  The type of changes we have seen in the banking landscape over the past few weeks are of the type one would usually see take place in the banking market or in any given economy over a period of years.  Ulster Bank is to exit Ireland.  KBC Ireland also plans to exit.  Bank of Ireland is closing 88 branches and, over a period of time, the Government will sell its stake in Bank of Ireland.  I, too, question the timing of that particular decision.  Notwithstanding some sensitivities around the sale of bank shares, I ask that the Minister or Minister of State elaborate on that in their closing remarks.</p>  <p>  There will be huge change in the way we do banking.  We have seen change over the past couple of years and it will escalate.  It will impact on thousands of good and highly skilled jobs.  I regret that in recent times those working in the banking industry have been treated like pawns in a game by senior bankers.  Little regard has been shown to them in the decisions that have been taken on bank branch closures and banking competition and consolidation.  All of these dramatic changes will fundamentally alter the banking and business landscape over the next few years.  While all of this very radical change is happening on a piecemeal basis, it is taking place in the absence, until now, of any real sense of strategic of direction for the Irish banking and finance sector from the Department of Finance, Government and the Central Bank.  Nobody expects the Government to involve itself in the day-to-day decision-making and operation of banks, including in the banks in which we have significant shareholdings.  However, given the scale of the State's investment and shareholding, we are entitled to expect that the State's interest in the direction of banking would extend beyond divesting itself of bank shares.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased the Minister confirmed today that a review of banking will take place under the aegis of his Department.  I have said previously in this House and elsewhere that the future of banking should not be left to bankers alone.  It is a matter for government, for all of us as policymakers and for all stakeholders.  For some time now, I have been taken with the detailed proposition set out by the Financial Services Union in regard to a forum on banking that would be led and facilitated by the Department of Finance, but would not necessarily be owned by the Department of Finance.  We need such a national conversation about the future direction of banking.  I am pleased to note that the Minister referenced that today.  I am interested in hearing the nuts and bolts around how that will proceed, particularly the timeline, how it will be scoped out, what the terms of reference might look like and how we, as Opposition spokespersons and Members of this House, can contribute to that process.</p>  <p>  This will be a very important process.  We know we are careering down the path of an effective quasi-monopoly in the context of Irish banking.  The review must look at the potential of, for example, a third banking force, something we have spoken about very earnestly in this Chamber for many years now.  That will be important as we try to build up the Irish banking sector and create a form of competition that we do not have at this point in time, which is impacting on businesses, job creation and the high level of mortgage interest rates that Irish consumers have to pay for a host of different reasons.</p>  <p>  The review should also look at the prospect of introducing a real and sustainable public banking model in this country, which is an issue we have shied away from.  Over the last few years, many reports have been generated about the prospect of establishing a public banking model based on the German Sparkasse model.  Dare I say it, only lip service has been paid to it.  I was disappointed that during the term of the Labour Party in government from 2011 to 2016 that particular proposition did not evolve to any great degree.  A report was done and sent to Ministers and it was essentially dismissed.  I believe that model has some potential.  It works elsewhere.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, referenced the credit union sector and the potential for it to grow, evolve and play a much more fundamental role in banking as we know it in this country.  Banking will change.  There are huge opportunities for innovation in this space as well, the kind of innovation that people have already adapted to and are demanding more of.  There are some really exciting developments in Irish fintech as well.  Irish start-ups and SMEs are very active in that area.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased the Minister has reported to the House that he will shortly publish the heads of the Bill to give effect to his commitment on the senior executive accountability regime.</p> <p>I look forward to engaging with the Minister and his colleagues on that.</p> <p> Problems with regard to trust in the Irish banking system were mentioned earlier on.  I have had very positive engagement with the Irish Banking Culture Board on that particular issue.  Accountability is important.  It is not just corporations that make decisions that impact on our lives, but individuals.  There needs to be a proportionate regime to make individuals in senior positions accountable for the decisions they take in our banking and finance sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100051#CCC00200"><p>I thank the Ministers for this useful debate.  Deputy McGuinness is in the Chamber.  He has campaigned for this for a long time, which should be acknowledged.  We need to see firm actions arising from this.  It cannot just be a talking shop of a Thursday to fill out the D&aacute;il schedule.  The banking sector has seen enormous changes in the last ten years, and in the last five in particular.  All of us in this Chamber will have seen these great changes, for example, the move towards online banking and away from traditional branch banking with its traditional human relationships.  We are also still seeing the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, 2009 and 2010.  Banking played a role in that crash, which had consequences for the country and for people's lives.  There was also the tracker controversy, which eroded further the trust and confidence that had already been eroded by the previous crash.  It was extraordinary how long it took to resolve that and for the banks to fess up to it, as was what they put families and people through and what they were willing to do to customers, citizens of this State, to avoid responsibility.  It eroded trust in a way which perhaps even the events of the period from 2008 to 2010 did not because we saw the way in which the banks were going to treat people individually.</p>  <p>  When all of this is put together, one can see that this is a tumultuous time for banking.  I want to pick up on a point Deputy Nash raised, which is that this tumult seems to be coming down on the shoulders of bank staff.  That is completely out of order.  In the case of Ulster Bank, when it made the announcement that it was pulling out, its staff, which had been loyal, excellent and the front face of an organisation in respect of which there had been a lot of controversy over the years, heard about the decision on national media.  In a similar way, where there have been cutbacks in other banks, staff seem to be the last to hear rather than being consulted about their own lives and futures.  A very firm message needs to be sent to the banks to the effect that, in this time of transformation and tumult, they must recognise their staff as partners in any decisions taken rather than as passengers.  They must be central to the making of decisions rather than being considered an item under any other business.  From our engagement with the Financial Services Union, it is very clear that bank staff around this country feel like passengers.  They do not feel central.  The Government needs to send a very clear message that this is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  As I have said, the tracker controversy and the willingness of the banks to treat customers and families in the way they did were absolutely appalling but we are still seeing this in many instances around the country.  They were proactive at the beginning of the Covid pandemic in offering payment breaks but the mantra is now "come and talk to us".  That makes sense when one says it but we all know that many personal customers and business customers will stick their heads in the sand and not engage because the banks do not make it easy to engage.  There is a fear of engaging with banks.  There needs to be much more proactivity in that regard.  </p>  <p>  I will cite the pyrite and mica situation we are facing in Mayo, Donegal and Sligo at the moment.  Mortgages held and owned by banks and which form part of their capital base are directly affected by houses crumbling.  The asset on which the mortgage is held is devalued by pyrite and mica.  Despite this, we have found a reluctance on the part of banks to proactively reach out to families and affected homeowners and to ask them to come and speak to them.  It took some engagement with the banks for them to realise what was happening.  This has a number of different effects.  The asset base of the banks is affected and devalued.  The daily lives of customers going through this are absolutely horrific and dealing with the banks is another pressure.  There is an unwillingness to deal with the banks and a fear of doing so.  Proactivity at the outset would have resolved that fear and would have been a much fairer way of dealing with the issue.  That proactivity is beginning to be seen now, but only in some cases.  It needs to be far greater and far more energetic.</p>  <p>  Recent years have been marked by a number of international pull-outs.  The review will be worthwhile to see.  Banks in this country are accused of making massive profits and running away with them and yet we are not seen as a viable location for retail or business banking.  When one sees NatWest pulling out after more than 100 years of service and when one sees KBC pulling out, leaving us with a model based on AIB and Bank of Ireland, one has to ask oneself questions.  We all have to ask ourselves questions.  Online banks such as Revolut and N26 are slowly coming in but many people are reluctant to go to them for full banking services.  While that reluctance is there, the existing two banks, which will be the only ones left in the market, will play to it.  They will continue to give us this system in which we have the most expensive mortgage rates in Europe, in which business loans are much more expensive than is justified by the cost of lending and in which the level of service and product we, as consumers, get is not what it should be in this kind of country.  Until that changes and until we understand the reasons banks are not entering the Irish market and make the necessary changes, our consumers, businesses and communities will suffer.  </p>  <p>  When banks decide to pull out, they turn their backs on communities.  It is very easy to say that people will go online or go the post office to do their banking but in many communities in which Bank of Ireland, for example, is closing branches, these are the last retail branches not only in the town, but in the region.  Bank of Ireland tells them to do their business in their local post offices but in places such as Ballyhaunis, Charlestown, Kiltimagh and Tubbercurry, which is in Sligo but in the same area of Mayo and Sligo, the post office is in a local supermarket.  It is not an appropriate place to do face-to-face banking, particularly where banking of a confidential nature is involved.  Post office staff and managers were not even informed that this was coming at them before the announcement was made and so were not in a position to deal with the initial queries that came in.  This again is an example of how customers and consumers are not on the banks' agenda, much as staff are not.  Customers and consumers of banking services should also be partners as opposed to passengers but are instead lumped in with staff and are the last to know as decisions are taken far away.  </p>  <p>  Given that the State is a main shareholder in Bank of Ireland, when a bank is leaving a community, the building it is leaving should be offered to the community either through a community trust or the local authority, especially given what the taxpayer has contributed to keep the banks afloat.  The same approach should be taken to Ulster Bank and NatWest.  These buildings might be developed as ehubs, community hubs or broadband connection points where, with a little bit of imagination and thinking outside of the box, banking services could be delivered.  Rather than delivering these services in a supermarket through a hatch beside the fruit and vegetables, the existing building, which has the equipment and IT infrastructure, could become a community hub where many IT facilities, including banking, would be offered.  We could do this rather than the building being sold, adding value for the shareholders in the bank that is departing the community.  That is something I would like to see pursued.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's personal commitment to the credit union movement, which is well known.  I know he is pursuing that and that he sees the value of the credit union movement.  Credit unions right across the country are absolutely mad to go lending at the moment.  They want to do proper, responsible lending but are finding that they cannot do so.  Many communities, customers and businesses want to avail of these services but cannot do so.</p> <p> We speak of community-based banking.  We have a model in the context of our credit unions but we do not give them the powers, energy or ability to be that community banking force to provide proper competition for what are, effectively, the two remaining main banks.  We need a complete change of view of our credit unions.  The credit union movement needs to be seen once again as a partner in banking, in our economy and in community and community regeneration, not as a passenger.</p> <p> Business banking continues to be enormously challenging.  The cost of products is much more than in many other markets.  I am sceptical about the way the credit guarantee scheme is being rolled out.  I do not think it is having the impact it should be having in the context of Covid and lending.  I ask for more engagement from Government about that product to see how it is rolling out.  We have franchised out State-backed lending to the banks.  Is it doing what we want it to do and giving the kind of support to businesses that we need it to give?  A hard, honest look needs to be taken at that in the coming weeks, not the coming months.</p> <p> On green products, if we move people into major investments to decarbonise their homes and businesses, our bankings system needs to move with them.  It needs to expand considerably its product range, not just greenwash existing products but make them accessible, encourage people to take them up, make them competitive in price and reflect where people are at in their family experiences.</p> <p> There is a lot to consider.  Tonight's debate should only be a start, not a full stop or a box ticked to keep Deputy McGuinness and the rest of us who looked for it happy for a few weeks.  It needs to be something meaningful and a signal that this D&aacute;il takes banking reform seriously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100052#DDD00200"><p>This has been a bad year for Irish banking.  When we speak of a bad time for banking, we are speaking about a bad time for our citizens.  Banks have been allowed to continue with the tradition of making their customers pick up the bill for whatever impacts the institutions cause.  We saw this on a grand scale during the financial crisis, when the Government of the day stood with the banking sector and ensured that each man, woman and child would have to foot the bill for its failings and bad practices and the fallout therefrom.  This will continue for the foreseeable future.  When I speak of bad times for the banking sector, those who suffer are predominantly the citizens of this country.</p>  <p>  In recent years, there has been an effort to whitewash this grim time and to reimagine what happened.  The most recent example of this was when the Taoiseach was rattled by a question from a Deputy who highlighted his unwillingness to support the Debenhams workers, despite the prior willingness to bail out the banks.  In response, the Taoiseach said that the banks were not bailed out.  He may wish for this not to have been the case and that his party, with the input of others, was not responsible for putting us in that situation.  Unfortunately, however, An Taoiseach can no more change the past than he can do right by the sectors he threw under the bus this week.</p>  <p>  When the banks suffer, there is a warped tradition that calls for the public to take the pain.  The banking system in its current form can fail communities on a localised level as well.  We have seen a number of examples of this so far this year.  In February, we were informed that Ulster Bank was withdrawing from the market here.  That was a major blow for customers, staff and communities and it was compounded when, in March, Bank of Ireland announced its intention to close more than one third of its branches in the South and more than half of its branches in the North from September.</p>  <p>  In my constituency, branches in Cashel, Cahir and Templemore will close in September.  This will leave Templemore with no bank branch whatsoever.  Deputies can imagine how this will affect customers, who will have to travel to avail of in-branch services.  This is where the post office network comes into it.  Shortly after Bank of Ireland announced its intended branch closures, we were told certain services would be available from post office branches.  In March, the Irish Postmasters Union warned that if the Government continues to fail to act quickly and decisively to keep post offices open, local banking services would be put at further risk.  At the end of May, the same organisation warned of unrestrained closures from July if Government financial intervention is not forthcoming.  The Kerr report and the Grant Thornton report both contained recommendations which the Government, for whatever reason, has chosen in large part to ignore.  Who will bear the brunt of this if the Government continues to ignore the plight of the post office network?  It will be our postmasters, their employees and the local communities that they serve.</p>  <p>  In discussing the future of banking in Ireland, we cannot divorce it from the responsibilities that the Government has to ensure that banking services, the ability to transact locally and ease of access to banking consultation are available to all of our citizens, whether they live in urban or rural Ireland.  The future of banking in Ireland is, therefore, dependent upon the Government that is there to lead it.  The traditional parties of government are not the ones to do this.  If they were, we would not have such a series of crises on our hands.  We would not see instances where vulture funds were given the ability to lock young families out of homeownership.  In my constituency, there is great faith in our credit union system.  There is great reliance on our post office network on a number of levels as well.  Their potential should be realised and extended.</p>  <p>  In the past, Sinn F&eacute;in published a document looking at how public banking could work in Ireland.  The decisions of the aforementioned banks in recent times have highlighted the urgency of examining the possibility of a new public banking model.  Such a model is in place in 21 European countries and many more across the world.  Germany's Sparkasse and New Zealand's Kiwibank are two examples which have proven to be hugely successful and popular.  The Government has previously used an Indecon report from 2019 to say that the commercial banks were fulfilling this role.  They are not doing so anymore or will not be very soon.  The Government must engage with credit unions and post offices to explore the possibility of using the existing infrastructures for a public banking system.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has also published a community wealth-building document.  This model is in operation in parts of the UK and the US.  Our proposal is about developing indigenous assets in such a way that wealth is added to our communities, not extracted from them.  It makes financial power work for people and local towns by retaining as much of that wealth as we can through local supply chains and targeted procurement contracts.</p>  <p>  When we talk about the future of banking in Ireland, we must remember that we are talking about the future with our communities front and centre.  We must shake off the tired ways of the past that have brought this country to its knees.  Those banking models have no commitment to the people of this country, only to shareholders who could not care less about Irish communities.</p></speech>

Providing these services well is crucial.  Getting them wrong, as we know from experience, can be disastrous.</p>  <p>  The approach to banking of successive Ministers of Finance and the Department leaves Ireland hostage to the big banks.  Since the beginning of 2015, about 340 bank branches around Ireland have closed or their impending closure has been announced.  That is one third of all bank branches in Ireland at the beginning of that period.  That is worth saying again: a third of bank branches in Ireland have closed or will close over a seven-year period.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has found the average distance to a bank - and this is prior to the departure of Ulster Bank - is 11 km in rural areas and 2 km in urban areas.  In excess of 900,000 people live more than 10 km from a bank branch.  Even where branches remain open, the range of services they provide is diminishing.  Many branches are now cashless and do not provide over-the-counter services.  Instead, they provide advice and self-service through ATMs.</p>  <p>  The needs of small businesses are likely going unmet.  Findings from the CSO indicate that 31% of enterprises valued the local connection when choosing where to bank.  Some 22% of enterprises choose a particular bank because it has a local branch.  An additional 10% choose a bank because the branch was known for good client relationships.  When refused a loan, 42% of SMEs will forgo the funds rather than apply to another bank. </p>  <p>  The consolidation of the market around pillar banks has many negatives for the economy, businesses and borrowers, yet every attempt in the past ten years to break the stranglehold of the shareholder banks has been frustrated by the Department of Finance.</p> <p>A proposal for a strategic investment bank was throttled and instead we got the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, lending through the pillar banks.  Proposals for regionally based public banks were thwarted during the most recent programme for Government negotiations.  Proposals for an examination of public banking were blocked by the Department, with a whitewash report in 2019 saying there was no case for it.  That report, in effect, closed down real and open debate on solutions to the crisis confronting Irish banking.  The repercussions of that, as the sector continues to consolidate around two pillar institutions that are shrinking their presence in the community, are now becoming even clearer.</p> <p> The Department of Finance and the Minister seem institutionally committed to restoring AIB and Bank of Ireland to the role of all-dominant, privately owned shareholder banks with a stranglehold over the entire Irish economy.  If only they showed the same commitment towards rejuvenation of the credit union movement, expanding SME lending outside the Bank of Ireland-AIB-Permanent TSB monopoly or restoring the diversity of financial services provision in Ireland.  Events in banking in 2021 have once again exposed the shortcomings of the strategy of shoring up the pillar banks while hoping the credit unions and post offices will fill in the gaps.  A second tier of banking, with local knowledge, between the level of the credit unions and the three big banks would make a significant positive difference to the Irish economy.  The massive deposits in credit unions nationally show the appetite for community banking.  However, the tiny proportion of those savings that is on loan productively in the community shows the limited capacity and skills in the sector to open up a full community banking service.</p> <p> At a time when the viability of much of the post office network is being called into question, it is amazing that the possibility of looking to expand An Post as a community bank is not being considered.  While An Post is increasing its financial offerings and has a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within 5 km, it does not provide services at the level or scale needed.  Perhaps the most obvious choice of a model to copy is that of the Sparkasse in Germany.  It is an EU-based model and, as such, falls under the same regulation as Ireland.  Representatives of the Sparkasse system have long expressed a willingness to consult with Irish officials and help us to get started.</p> <p> Any proposed forum on the future of banking must examine community banking, both in terms of increasing the capacity of credit unions and the question of whether we need to establish, at regional or provincial level, larger community public banks to fill the gaps in financial services that will only widen further in the coming years, when the three remaining banks return to private ownership and withdraw services from communities.</p></speech>

It is also an opportunity for us to set out a policy that will attract the type of banking being demanded now by the general public and, indeed, by the banking system itself.</p>  <p>  To bring change to fruition, we need to look back over the legacy issues that remain in the banks at present.  Bank of Ireland and AIB are the main banks to be considered in this regard and both still have legacy debt.  We were told this week by AIB that it has reduced its bad debt in terms of mortgages and loans down to &euro;4 billion or less.  The bank has focused very aggressively on the reduction of its exposure to bad loans.  It has used vulture funds, as others have done, to sell off those mortgages and correct its balance sheet.</p>  <p>  There are other issues remaining to be dealt with that tell us much about the banking system.  For example, there is the EBS tied agents issue, which was before the High Court and which witnesses from AIB addressed at a meeting of the finance committee yesterday.  In 2019, the judge in that case suggested to AIB that it should use mediation as a commonsense way to approach this problem, in which two parties have differing opinions.  At the finance committee meeting yesterday, the AIB representatives refused to answer the question as to whether the bank will go into mediation.  A significant number of the EBS tied agents appeared in the Public Gallery at a previous meeting of the committee and some of them have since died.  How long more must they wait for the resolution of a problem that a judge has said could be resolved through mediation?  This issue shows AIB at its worst.  It shows it protecting the system, ignoring those who have been offended in one way or another and simply trampling on any possibility of a commonsense resolution.</p>  <p>  The other issue facing the banks is the proposed forum on banking.  In fact, it is an issue facing the Irish people rather than the banks.  This was discussed recently at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, where I put forward put a motion, influenced by a similar motion that came through the finance committee, calling for a forum of all stakeholders, including the fintech companies and workers, to discuss what the banking landscape should and might look like in the future, if Government policy were to accommodate it.  The motion set out the reasons for holding such a forum.  It mainly stemmed from the issue that arose when Ulster Bank told its customers at the very last minute about its proposals and showed complete disregard and disrespect for its employees.  Representatives of the Financial Services Union came to the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party and made their case for a forum, out of which our motion arose.  My party colleagues were amused that the Taoiseach supported the motion, because I presume it was my motion, but he did.  Therefore, we should be discussing in this House establishing the forum and wasting no time in bringing together all the stakeholders to discuss what might happen in the future.</p>  <p>  I mentioned the legacy issue but I omitted to mention Mr. Tony Lawlor, who came before the finance committee as a witness and spilled out his whole life history in the context of his engagement with Bank of Ireland and the courts.  That is part of the tracker mortgage issue and it is still not resolved.  How many more such cases are still to be resolved by the banks, which are dragging their heels and dragging individuals - citizens we represent - through the courts and through a life of misery just because they can?  That must be stopped.  I call on the Minister for Finance, who has a significant shareholding in AIB and Bank of Ireland, to intervene in the tied agents case and bring about a resolution.  I call on him to intervene in tracker mortgage cases such as that of Mr. Lawlor and bring about a resolution.  Then, proactively as a modern Department of Finance should, it should bring together all the stakeholders and let us have the debate through that forum and on the floor of this House on an ongoing basis.  Doing so will not harm the banks.  It is supporting the notion that we want better banking.</p> <p>We want citizens' banking and community banking.  Through the forum, we want to find a resolution to all of those questions.  Reference is regularly made to community banking.  In fact, members of the finance committee, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, visited such a bank in Germany and were impressed by the fact that the profits the bank makes in the regions it represents go back to the community.  That is the type of banking that is being sought.</p> <p> With Provident gone out of the market, we need the credit unions and community banking to take up the slack created by its departure because people with no money and poor means need to get loans from time to time and they should not have to turn to moneylenders to do so.  We need to stop that practice just as much as we need, on the other end of the greed scale, to stop vulture funds from doing what they are doing with regard to those who owe money.  Likewise, there is an opportunity for the forum to discuss the role of receivers and the use of receivers and what has happened in the past ten years from which we can learn, such as the fact that those very same receivers, who are not regulated, were used by the banks and blackguarded customers across the country.</p> <p> Let us consider the Central Bank Bill the Minister says he is bringing forward.  Is it not about time to recognise all that is being said in this House about credit unions and all of the support given to them by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and to make a special case for them to be included in a regulatory framework other than that in place in respect of banks?  They deserve to be given a lighter framework with lesser bureaucracy and a greater opportunity to participate in their local community by giving loans, by understanding the demand from the community and their customers and being able to respond to that.  Is it not time for the Central Bank, under the Bill the Minister is bringing forward, to change its customer representation?  It is not just a regulator of the banks; it is also supposed to be a protector of the consumer.  That is not happening and we need to understand that.</p> <p> I believe the forum can achieve balance in terms of the arguments on any of these issues and reach a sensible conclusion based on the new developments in banking that will satisfy the citizens we represent.  However, we can no longer leave the banks to imagine their own banking landscape for the future or to devise their own structure for the future.  We have seen what they have done to this country and its citizens in the past.  I do not want them to have the upper hand again in terms of how they might treat their customers should anything happen to the banking models for the future.  We need protections for people as much as they are needed for the banking structure and we need the same protections built around a community banking structure.</p> <p> It is true to say that community banking organisations such as Sparkasse or Kiwibank are almost the same as the credit union system, so that Central Bank legislation should open up possibilities for credit unions.  It should also offer greater protection to risk managers within banks or financial institutions in order that we never again have a case such as that of Jonathan Sugarman, a man whose life was destroyed just because he came forward in accordance with legislation and made a case to the Central Bank.  Now, rather than the offending bank being in difficulty, the employee is in difficulty.  He has not been employed since Banca d'Italia left the country or he had to resign because of ongoing issues with the bank.</p> <p> There are many areas that we need to cover and I hope these statements on the future of banking are simply a first step.  I urge the Minister to take the next step and bring about reform.</p></speech>

This conversation is long overdue.  The withdrawal of KBC and Ulster Bank from the Irish market was recently announced.  In March, we had the announcement that 103 Bank of Ireland branches across this island will close.  The bank is closing one third of its branches, including those in Kilcullen and Monasterevin in my constituency of South Kildare.  The announcement was not surprising, but it was very disappointing.  It was not surprising because the banks have been pushing people away from their branches for years.  They have consistently reduced front-facing staff to turn people away from branches.  These bank closures affect the most vulnerable in society, such as older people and families on low incomes.  They also affect struggling small business owners.  These people, along with rural dwellers, will have the greatest difficulty in adapting, due to the poor availability of affordable broadband.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for the establishment of a forum on the future of banking.  Such a forum would enable industry experts, stakeholders, and customer representatives to consider the state of our banking system and plan a more effective future.  We must be more proactive and less reactive.  We must strengthen the powers of credit unions.  I am a proud member of a credit union.  They do amazing work on a voluntary basis in every community across this island.  We need to give them and post offices a greater role in our banking system. They are rooted in their communities and are best placed to help the local areas of which they are an integral part.  Credit unions should be given limited capacity to provide mortgages.  They should also play a greater role in funding the building of social housing.  We should create a mechanism by which credit unions could invest in social housing.  Credit unions could play a very important role in helping the country to meet its climate change targets by providing funding for a national retrofitting programme.</p>  <p>  We need a strong banking force to counteract the indifference of the current commercial banks to their customers.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes this should be a community banking model which can best fill this role and has published a policy document in this regard.  The issue of public banking has been on our agenda for several years. The Minister may refer to the Indecon report of 2019 and how it dismissed the need for a public banking system because commercial banks were fulfilling the role but that is no longer the case.  There have been fundamental changes in the market with the withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC Bank, as well as the Bank of Ireland branch closures.</p>  <p>  The Government must engage with credit unions and post offices to explore the possibility of utilising their existing infrastructure for a new public banking system.  Colleagues have referred to the Kiwibank model in New Zealand, where banks and post offices share the same building.  It is an example of how existing infrastructure can be used for banking purposes. The Sparkasse model has operated in Germany for 200 years as an interconnected network of 390 individual local authority-owned banks that, between them, operate 12,000 branches.  It offers long-term SME loans at a 3% interest rate, while its best mortgage rate for home buyers is 1.1% fixed for ten years.  We need banks that operate for the benefit of their customers rather than feeding off their misery. </p>  <p>  Finally, I will briefly comment on the withdrawal of Provident, a moneylender, from the Irish market.  In a rare parting gift, the lender has stated it is writing off any remaining debt owed by its customers.  That is to be welcomed but I worry about the next time its clients need a loan.   A solution must be found so that they do not have to resort to unsavoury characters in order to pay for first communions, or confirmations or, indeed, if a household appliance such as a fridge or an oven breaks down.  Community banking is that solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100054#FFF00300"><p>It has been 13 years since the 2007-08 crisis, a crisis for which people paid a significant price and at the very centre of which in Ireland and around the world were the banks and private banking.  However, it seems that almost no fundamental lessons have been learned because in the aftermath of that crisis, as well as massive austerity being heaped onto ordinary working-class people, the banks were bailed out and nationalised in order to save them.</p> <p>Since then, we have been on a road back to private ownership of the banking system, bit by bit.  They are being restored to profitability and then put back into private hands.  We are going in a circle, not in precisely the same way but with many similarities, back to where we were.  We have a banking sector that is increasingly seen to be an oligopoly with three main banks which dominate it.  All of them operate 100% on the basis of profit maximisation.  </p> <p> From a socialist perspective, the most basic point is that private banking does not work.  It works for the private bondholders while they are making profits, but it does not work for the workers of the banks or the ordinary people who want, for example, to be able access banking services in their local communities.  It does not work from the point of view of society and the economy as a whole and from the perspective of ordinary people.  Banks will pursue their own profit, regardless of the expense for the workers, communities, society and the economy at large, regardless of the consequences.  That is what we saw 13 or 14 years ago.  It is what we will see again.</p> <p> The alternative is very simple.  The banking sector should be in public ownership and should be nationalised.  It should be run democratically and as a public utility.  The idea is that instead of running large parts of the economy as a service for the banks, we should run the banks as a democratically owned public utility in the service of the economy and society as a whole.</p> <p> Taking some of the arguments that are made for why we need private ownership of banks and why that it is so important, the argument is often made that banks advance credit to small and medium-sized enterprises.  However, the figures are striking as they show how little credit has been advanced to SMEs in the last year, for example.  Some &euro;4.1 billion was advanced in credit to SMEs in the last year, amounting to a decrease of &euro;1.3 billion or a fall of almost 25%.  It is the largest annual decline since records began.  If we look at where the lending is actually going, the vast majority of it is going to large enterprises.  A portion of it is going to SMEs, which is not included in the figure of &euro;4.1 billion I previously mentioned, the majority of which is property related.  The banks are still just financing property.  It points to the fact that private banking is not playing much of a role in terms of productive investment in the economy.  It is still mainly focused on property investment, even if it has largely cut back to its traditional core business of residential mortgage lending, in other words, fleecing workers who are trying to buy a home.</p> <p> I made the point earlier that banking has changed to some degree.  One of the ways it has changed is in the commercial property side.  A large element of the crisis in 2007 and 2008 was caused by a small cartel of developers defaulting on large speculative commercial property loans after property prices rose so high that the property bubble burst, leading to the collapse of all the main banks.  Commercial property was a central activity of the banks at that point in time.  Without regulation, the banks continued to lend bigger mortgage amounts to ordinary people to make bigger profits on the interest, as house prices lost all connection to wages.  However, first came the defaults on commercial property.  After that, ordinary people began to default on their mortgages as a result of the ensuing collapse of the economy due to the impact of the State bailing out the banks to pay for the property bubble.  The commercial property market collapsed in the aftermath.  Then came the austerity and the slashing of public spending to compensate for the fact that the banks were effectively bailed out.  Massive job losses and so on, went with that.</p> <p> Something interesting that has changed in the property market is the shift to vulture funds.  The majority of commercial property is no longer funded by the private banking sector.  Instead, the Government quite consciously rolled out the red carpet to vulture funds so that they would lend to developers instead and therefore the State would not be on the hook for losses.  Of the supposedly fundamental aspects of the banks, for example, providing credit to small businesses and ordinary people, there is not much of happening in that regard.  In reality, the vast majority of it is still related to property, either building it in terms of businesses or mortgages.  No matter how the rules of the capitalist casino are rejigged after each disastrous new crisis, the house always wins.  This time, it is US vulture funds and corporate landlords.  Last time, it was Irish bankers and property developers and small-time rack-renters.  That is why we need a fundamentally different system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100055#GGG00200"><p>This is a most important debate.  As a newly-elected Deputy, I was in the House on the night the bank guarantee was put in place.  I recall the alarm it raised and the shock it caused among all of us.  That night, no one actually knew what the real implications were.  We were looking at the balance sheets of the banks.  There were loans, but we had no idea of the underlying value of the loans.  I sat on the banking inquiry.  Ultimately, we found that the banks at the time had lent in a reckless fashion.</p>  <p>  We can never go back to that situation again.  There are elements present at that time which are relevant to the current period.  I wish to reflect upon the fact that the Department is about to carry out a banking review.  The Minister of State will appreciate that terms of reference are everything.  I hear that many reports will be produced.  The Minister of State can give the reports as many titles as he wishes.  I am only interested in one thing.  I want to know what the terms of reference are.  There have been many such banking reviews.  Following the latest review, I would like to see a report that is small in size, rich in content, action-driven and complete with timeframes.  I do not want to see a 400-page or a 500-page report.  I know that the Minister of State will appreciate that, given his background.  We know what the issues are.  I want to see a report that explores how we tackle them.  </p>  <p>  I will put my point into context.  Deputies referred to housing and the banks only lending for property and residential homes.  One of the issues currently is that there is not enough supply.  Back in 2005 and 2006 we were building nearly 90,000 units in Ireland.  If we are to believe what the building trade is telling us, we only have capacity to build one fifth of that figure now?  How has that situation arisen?  Building 90,000 houses was not sustainable.  Banks should not have given out the money for that.  It amounted to throwing paraffin on a fire.  Currently, many small builders cannot get finance from banks to build houses.  Many of those houses are not becoming available for first-time buyers to purchase, as I would like them to be.</p> <p>In everything, we need balance.  We need social housing in abundance, we need first-time buyers, and we need the rental market.  That balance is needed at all times.</p> <p> I want to focus on the areas of the banking system the Minister wants to consider.  He spoke about the gaps in the market.  Others have said the banks are only lending in respect of property.  We need to build homes so it is a question of what the capacity constraints are.  Is it a matter of tradesmen and tradeswomen?  Is it a matter of materials, whose costs are increasing exponentially, as Members know?  Is it a matter of a lack of access to credit for the builder building 20 or 30 houses?  Are those in that category unable to get funding from any institutions?  Are we suddenly finding that, in many cases, some properties and apartments are being bought in bulk rather than by the first-time buyer, which is a group we need to look after?  One reason house prices are increasing is a lack of supply in this sector.  I feel strongly about that.</p> <p> Terms of reference are vital.  They would have to be very tight and action driven.  The current state of play will be the first matter.  We must examine what we have in the sector.  The Minister referred to the sectoral expectations.  I assume he is talking about the banks and financial institutions themselves.  I am more interested in what the economy requires from the banks.</p> <p> The Minister referred to gaps in terms of competition and consumer choice.  We are undergoing enormous change and the fintech companies are coming in.  Investment funds are also involved.  There are three other components, one comprising the commercial banks themselves, namely, the pillar banks and other banks.  Ulster Bank is pulling out of the Irish market.  KBC is going.  Another component comprises the credit unions and post offices.  Bearing in mind the actions of Ulster Bank and the requirement for a third force in banking, one concludes that that force must involve Permanent TSB.  Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank are a perfect fit in many ways because their branch networks are almost identical.  It is quite extraordinary.  I sat down to examine them.  If Ulster Bank closes a branch in a town, it is likely that there is a Permanent TSB branch in the locality.  That is a positive.  What does it require to ensure Permanent TSB can become a genuinely competitive force among the other banks?  Those hard questions need to be asked.  We cannot have circumstances in which it is perceived that there is a lack of competition.  That is important.  Therefore, we need a third force.  That third force has to be built around Permanent TSB.  The beauty or benefit of Ulster Bank going is that Permanent TSB is more or less in the same locations.</p> <p> The second component involves the credit units.  Credit unions have a major role to play.  We have examined various financial models for the credit union movement.  The movement gives a network, a solid deposit base and local knowledge.  I was in practice for many years.  In many cases, many of my clients survived not because of support from the pillar banks but because of support from the local credit union.  The credit union helped in a small way by giving them a draft at the start of the month after the bank had refused an overdraft facility.  The credit union became the banker of last resort for many small businesses, many of which are surviving today.  Therefore, we must seriously consider the incremental role the credit unions can play in personal banking.  They are doing elements of mortgages.  They can become another force.  I see no reason there could not be a fourth force involving the credit unions because competition is very much the lifeblood of the sector.</p> <p> The Minister, in his speech, spoke about the roll-out but I did not hear timeframes for the establishment and completion of the banking review.  I did not get an indication as to who will be appointed to carry out the review.  They will need to be top consultants.  I would like the review to entail public consultation with stakeholders throughout the country because, ultimately, the Irish taxpayer saved the Irish banks.  There is no doubt about it.  On the night of the guarantee, the Irish taxpayer, including those who pay VAT and not exclusively those who pay income tax, underwrote the banking sector to save the banks, which they had to do.  We would have to question whether Anglo Irish Bank was systemic at the time but we are where we are.</p> <p> What I want to know are the terms of reference, timeframe and conclusion date of the broad-ranging review.  Will the report be action-based?  Will it take into account all aspects of the banking system?  The fintech companies have a role to play also.  It is critical that there be a public consultation element to the review.  We need to see top-class consultants involved.  It will result in a document that the Department and Minister should take possession of.  It must be action based and have timescales.  What we want at the end are four banking forces - commercial banks, the two pillar banks, Permanent TSB and the credit union system - competing with one another in the best interest of the consumers in Ireland.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the impact has been felt mainly by customers, particularly some of our older citizens.  Over the past month, we have heard announcements that Bank of Ireland is closing 88 outlets across the State.  These outlets offer an important community service, particularly to those who are not confident about or who do not trust the Internet for their banking.  A visit to the bank is an important element in the week of many older citizens.  The weekly food shop and the meeting with friends are often organised on the day on which they do their banking activities.  These individuals, who are often pensioners, were the small business owners of yesterday and they were perhaps the most loyal customers of the banks.  Many have been loyal to one bank throughout their lives.  The decision of Bank of Ireland is, of course, a commercial decision but it is a decision that seems to have been made with scant regard for their most loyal customers.</p>  <p>  Some services are to be made available in local post offices.  While that is a welcome decision, the full repertoire of banking services will not be available in the post office.</p>  <p>  One of the branches due to close in Limerick is the Bank of Ireland located in Roxboro Shopping Centre.  Here there are shops with little shop fronts and small enterprises that are reliant on the footfall generated by having a bank nearby.  I suspect the closure of this branch will, unfortunately, cause difficulties for those entrepreneurs who have established themselves at this location.  It is worth remembering that research suggests that bank branch closures reduce SME lending growth by 63%.  This is an added stress for an area that is one of the most deprived not only in the city but across the State.</p>  <p>  Bank of Ireland should have delayed both the announcement and implementation of its decision until after the Covid-19 pandemic.  Bank of Ireland is not the only banking institution that has made such a regrettable decision during the pandemic.  Its decision quickly followed Ulster Bank's decision to exit the southern market.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that we are discussing the future of banking today.  It is an issue my party has been eager to discuss.  Banking is changing and we need all the relevant stakeholders to be ready for this change.</p> <p>To that end we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been calling for a future of banking forum to be established so that these changes and a banking response to them can be discussed.  I hope the Government is willing to establish such an important banking forum and that it does this as soon as possible. </p> <p> Banking in this State faces some major challenges over the coming months, challenges that need to be addressed head-on.  To my mind they include how the banks continue to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and to the legacy that the impact of the virus will leave.  As regards effective and continued regulation of the sector, we are all too aware of what can happen when such oversight is lacking.</p> <p> How do we utilise other resources such as credit unions and tackle the scourge of both legal and illegal moneylending.  We have not had a public banking system in this State and this is something that I would like to see change.  In Germany there is the Sparkasse group of savings banks, the first of which was established in Hamburg in 1778.  It was created out of a need to invest in the country and to maintain as close ties as possible to local communities.  While we may not have a State banking system in this State we have An Post and credit unions.</p> <p> The credit unions, of which I am a proud member and have been for years, are an important institution within the communities in which they operate.  If the policy existed we could utilise these pillars and model them on the Sparkasse example.  Creating this as another banking pillar could offer a competitive opportunity for people across the State.  The creation of such a system could create a banking opportunity that is sensitive to the needs of citizens and not to those of vulture funds.  </p> <p> Providing banking services via our post office network would provide loans and mortgages at lower and affordable interest rates.  Profits generated could be reinvested back into local communities and could give a lifeline to the struggling post office network.</p> <p> The Minister of State will be aware that the Provident personal credit company has thankfully decided to leave and cease its operations but we need to be wary of what might come after that.  The concern I have is that the void that it leaves in some of the most disadvantaged areas across our State will be taken up by regular and licensed moneylenders who gouge their customers or, unfortunately, be taken by illegal moneylenders who are worse.  Some of the most deprived people who are struggling for money and have a problem with a communion or where an electrical appliance breaks down have nowhere else to go for money.  We need to ensure that we legislate properly and that people who are illegally dealing in moneylending have to be stamped down on as fast and as strongly as we can to put them out of business.  While we discuss the future of banking we have the opportunity to discuss these issues and provide protection and confidence to our citizens.  </p> <p> In conclusion, we as legislators have a great deal of work to do on banking.  A positive step that the Minister of State could take would be to establish that forum which we talked about that could assemble the views of stakeholders and qualified experts so that we can future-proof banking in this State.  We need to get it right as we all know what happened when it went wrong, where hundreds of thousands of people emigrated, many never to return.  We never need to go back to that again.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100057#JJJ00200"><p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The current state of our banking sector is a major cause of concern and has a big impact on many other aspects of our lives, most notably, the housing crisis.  In recent months we have seen moves by Ulster Bank and KBC to leave the Irish market.  A struggling banking sector with a lack of options and availability in the mortgage market makes affording a house beyond the reach of many people on decent wages.  If we can do anything here to help revitalise our banking sector then it should also help to address some of the problems in our housing sector.</p>  <p>  We need to ask ourselves why banks have withdrawn from the Irish market.  Usually, when a business withdraws from a market it is because it is no longer able to make a profit.  If those banks who have left the Irish mortgage market were no longer able to make a profit in Ireland then we need to examine why this is so and take whatever steps we can to create the conditions where Ireland becomes an attractive place for banks to do business.  Many of the regulations on lending and mortgages were introduced as a result of the banking crisis and bailouts ten years ago.  We must recognise that that level of Government intervention in the market is not sustainable in the long run and we are seeing the consequences of that now.</p>  <p>  If we take the average Irish income of about &euro;38,000, the maximum mortgage that a person can get is &euro;133,000.  If the person had a 10% deposit then he or she can only afford to buy a house costing &euro;150,000, which is almost impossible to find.  Prices are rising but incomes are not rising nearly as quickly.  That means that the mortgage rules are no longer fit for purpose and need urgent review.  </p>  <p>  We must also note that in the past it was more common that a person would get a job for life on a permanent basis at a reasonably young age.  The rise of zero-hours temporary employment contracts and things like rolling fixed-term contracts make being able to qualify for a mortgage much more difficult.  The housing crisis will only be solved by creating the conditions for increased housing supply through a planning policy that is sustainable and viable, alongside increasing people&rsquo;s ability to buy a house via appropriate lending rules.  Both of those things require a healthy banking sector so that house builders can access credit to create the supply and house buyers can access credit to buy.  </p>  <p>  I have spoken so far about the link between banking and housing but there are obviously many other reasons a healthy and competitive banking environment is essential.  Banks play a vital role in injecting money into a struggling economy.  God knows how big the struggle will become once the Government eventually decides to stop shutting down sections of economic activity for months on end.  When a bank or credit union lends a small sum to an individual it is because that individual wants to spend it on something, thus creating an income for the person selling whatever it is.  </p>  <p>  I wish to mention credit unions here also, of which I too am a member.  They play a vital role in our financial sector, developed by the people in an area and working for the benefit of the people in that area.  Credit unions on the whole are a fantastic example of community co-operation in action.  I can see a more prominent and expanded role for credit unions in the Irish banking sector in the future.  </p>  <p>  I understand that we are currently in the process of selling off our shares in Bank of Ireland.  Irish taxpayers invested a great deal of money into this bank to ensure its survival over a decade ago.  I hope that the Minister of State and the State will not sell these shares in a bad deal for the taxpayer.  We need to see a good value for money return on those shares, even if it means holding off until their value increases.  Hopefully, it will lead to a situation where a healthy and vibrant banking sector can develop in a sustainable way without the need for the State having to ever again provide rescue supports.</p>  <p>  We have shown over the past 15 months how quickly important laws can be rushed through this House.  I am not advocating rushing anything through.  However, reviewing and, if necessary, amending rules and regulations in the banking sector to be more reflective of the current situation could and should be done swiftly.  It would also be likely to increase the possibility of attracting new companies into the Irish banking sector.  </p>  <p>  We have to examine if some of these restrictions can be removed or amended to encourage the return of competition into the banking sector.  Competition in any sector mainly benefits the consumer.  The current lack of competition in the market is bad news for the consumer.  Lack of competition not only reduces the number of products available but it also means that the remaining firms have less incentive to provide competitive deals to customers.</p>  <p>  We have heard in the last year or two whispers about creating a State bank.  Why can we not just create the conditions where existing banks will be encouraged to return to the Irish market.  I fear that a State bank will become an endless money pit, similar to the HSE, which will further erode competition and choice for the consumer.  The banking sector needs to be competitive if we, as a nation, are to have any chance of being competitive on the European and world stage.</p>  <p>  We have seen the disastrous effects of the lack of competition within the insurance sector.  We saw many businesses decimated and fail because of an exorbitant and price-gouging structure within insurance.  It has taken all of five years from when I first travelled to meet the competition authority in Brussels, the Directorate-General for Competition, to ask it to investigate the matter.  We now have a preliminary finding of anti-competitive practice but it is too late for many who did not have the moneys available to facilitate the lack of competition and exorbitant charging.  I am calling on the Government to act in time on this and not to ignore it as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission did on the insurance issue, which is why I had to go to Brussels in the first place.</p>  <p>  The Government must put a framework in place that ensures competitive trading practices in the banking sector.  That includes attracting new banks, resourcing post offices and increasing the financial remit of the credit unions.  Our very survival is in the balance and if this does not happen then the Government can close the door behind it.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

It is a huge issue, especially in light of two banks wanting to leave our country and having their minds made up but also in light of Bank of Ireland recently closing branches in Dunmanway and Bantry, in west Cork.  That has been a devastating blow to those towns, which had been loyal to Bank of Ireland, and to the people who live in the surrounding areas: on the peninsulas, in the surrounds of Bantry, Castletownbere, Kilcrohane, Sheep's Head, Mizen Head and Beara, out into Drimoleague and Dunmanway and all the way down into Ballineen and the Skibbereen area.  These people stood loyally by the banks down through the years, and those banks have treated their customers shoddily.  I come from an area that lost a bank, the AIB branch in Schull.  Such a closure has a devastating effect on a town.  Within a year the local supermarket in Schull closed, with a loss of, I think, 17 or 18 jobs in that local community, so such closures deal a devastating blow in local communities.  The problem is that it does not look like there is a lot of confidence in the banking sector at present when banks are leaving our country and local banks are being closed.</p>  <p>  We have to look at the credit union as a way out.  It is stated in the programme for Government that the Government will review the policy framework for credit unions.  Where is the Government with this review?  For some reason in this country there were powers that be in previous governments that made sure that the credit unions could not compete.  They are ready to compete, to offer mortgages and to work with customers for those mortgages, which are badly needed, and they have an excellent record.  I met with the Bantry, Bandon, Skibbereen and Dunmanway credit union managers recently to try to see whether we can further this for them in the D&aacute;il, get the Government to see sense, forge ahead with the policy framework, make the changes and allow credit unions to compete in the market.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would explain how far we are from that.  What kinds of changes will be made?</p>  <p>  We should also look at the post office sector.  Post offices are closing their doors in rural Ireland and haemorrhaging and they need support.  I would like to see the vision the Minister of State has for the post office sector.  Post offices deserve better.  The postmasters and postmistresses out there serve their communities.  There are opportunities there and we are not availing of them.  The Minister of State might give us an insight into that.  Instead of focusing on closing doors, maybe we should focus on better opening the doors that are already there.</p>  <p>  I will give my colleague the remainder of my time.</p></speech>

It never mentioned the credit unions.  I mentioned this to Ministers when the five pillar banks were mentioned.  Like other speakers, I am a credit union member.  The credit union and the post office are the last two banking systems in Ireland that have people behind the counter who know you by name.  You are not known by number there.  You walk into your local credit union, you know the staff behind the counter and they say, "Hello, Richard.  How are you?  How was your day?".  The banking institutions, however, have all gone online.  Let us tap this and tap that.  If you ring them up, you are asked for your account number and, no matter where you are calling from, you could be talking to somebody from Dublin through a banking system.  The one banking sector that has stood alongside us through Covid, the only people who stood by us through Covid, when the banks turned around and said, "We will extend your loans but you will still have to pay off your interest within the term", and the only ones who made concessions to us were the credit unions.  They turned around and said they would extend loan terms and they extended them but they did not do as the banks did.  The banks extended loans by three or four months but told customers that if they had a five-year loan, they still had to pay off that loan within the five years.  This meant that when things picked up the customers had to pay more, even though we were in an economic crisis because of Covid.  The credit unions turned around and said, "We will give you the three, four or five months but we will add it onto your loan and give you the break now that you do not have to pay for two or three months."</p>  <p>  The other factor that has to be taken into account here is that the legislation that comes down through the credit unions from central banks and so on is over the top.  Did the Minister of State know that the boards of all these credit unions are made up of volunteers?  They are local people in local communities who have volunteered to go on those boards to look after the parishes, towns and villages around them.  They are all volunteers.  Everyone in the top tier of the banking sector, however, takes the cream off the top and gives nothing back, taking the big money at the top.  The volunteers who run our credit unions, however, are local people who know where the local funding has to go back in.  If the Minister of State does anything, he needs to help the credit unions so they can come back and give the funding to the householders who want to build at an affordable rate.  The central banks are making it far too hard for them while they compete with the present banking system.</p></speech>

The State was forced into a &euro;70 billion bailout paid for with a decade of austerity, seriously impacting public services and, of course, a situation in which many homeowners lost their homes.  This was a consequence of extremely risky speculative spending in a drive to maximise profits.  Despite the bailout, we have since had the tracker mortgage scandal and there has been an exodus of foreign banks, leaving just two big banks now completely dominant in the State.  One of these is AIB.  It is effectively State-owned but continues to operate as a profit-driven private enterprise.  There is an opportunity to transform AIB into a State-owned entity with a mandate to play a key role in the development of a sustainable economy through more strategic investment policies.</p>  <p>  However, we also need a third banking force.  The Public Banking Forum of Ireland has been arguing for such a third banking force since the crash, basing its ideas on the German Sparkassen public community savings banks.  Four hundred of these public community banks account for 40% of the retail banking sector in Germany.  They are key to the German SME sector, which is itself the key factor in the German economy.  This is not a new idea in Ireland.  In the early 1820s Ireland had as many as 65 community-based savings banks in its cities and larger towns.  These savings banks were much like the early English savings banks of the 1800s, which were not much different from the German Sparkassen.  The Public Banking Forum of Ireland proposes that credit unions co-operate at regional level to institute regional public savings banks in co-operation with An Post and local community organisations.  The idea is to create ten regional alternative banks with a focus not on profits but on customers and lending to customers, small farmers and small businesses.  This would address and counter threats to services in rural areas such as closures of post offices and so on.</p>  <p>  I do not have time to develop these proposals fully, but the Government must look at this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100058#KKK00400"><p>There is no doubt but that the way in which banking is done in Ireland is changing.  I think this will cause the biggest problem for the Central Bank and the Department of Finance in how they manage the new arrangements when there are so few pillar banks in the State.  It possibly forces them to look at new operators and a system that some of us in the Opposition have been pushing for some time.  If it is looked at properly, it can provide an opportunity for citizens to access equitable finance.  Credit unions can and do provide a financial system that citizens trust and want to see do more.  My local credit union is now offering mortgages, and if I am going to look for a mortgage or mortgage finance there is only one place I will look for it.  I would view it as an honour to owe money locally and see the profit made on my loan going to help other local people.  It is not such a revolutionary idea but it would be revolutionary for Ireland.  It is to be hoped the State will get fully behind banking in the community.  One thing we have seen in this country is that the banks do not care for citizens or their workers.</p> <p>They have striven for profit for shareholders.  Even when we the people have been shareholders, the Government was not interested in reflecting our needs either.  For many years people on the fringes of the banking system, as the Minister would see it, and Opposition Members have pushed for the accommodation of credit unions and the post offices in the banking system to serve the needs of people.  The State has resisted it as much as possible, and made it as difficult as possible for them to provide services.  It must have been in the hope that the banks would ride in and head them off.  Now that we have seen that will not happen, maybe the Government will embrace the new reality and make the credit unions and post office network the new solution and put as much effort into helping them as they have in the banks in the past. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100059#LLL00200"><p>I will concentrate on just one aspect of the future of banking: the role of credit unions.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's positive comments on credit unions and those made by many other Deputies.  The programme for Government makes the commitment to enable the credit union movement to grow as a key provider of community banking in this country.  I ask the Minister of State what has he done and what will he do to ensure to deliver on that promise.</p>  <p>  Legislative change is essential to deliver on that commitment.  I have just two suggestions.  The Credit Union Act, as amended in 2012, is a child of the financial crisis.  It failed to introduce proportionate regulation.  We need legislation that is appropriate for credit unions, proportionate to the risks involved and ensures adequate capital reserves for credit unions.  The current Act uses a sledgehammer to crack a nut and it is failing us.  Our banks cost is &euro;60 billion or &euro;70 billion plus, and they needed strong regulation, but credit unions were very different.  I recall the then Minster for Finance, Michael Noonan, saying there was a &euro;500 million black hole underneath the credit unions.  That was not true.  The league's own funds covered the majority of any losses.  I suspect our State is probably in profit right now because of the levies they imposed on credit unions to pay for future losses.  Credit unions have paid their way.</p>  <p>  Second, the register of credit unions must be fully independent.  The Central Bank should not be the regulator.  There is a possible conflict of interest and I believe the Minister must change that.  The Minister of State has a golden opportunity to serve the citizens of this country by ensuring that we have a strong community banking sector underpinned by credit unions.  If he does that, he will keep the promise that this Government made to the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100059#LLL00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for sharing their views.  There were 16 or 17 speakers, which indicates the significance that Members attach to this issue.  Sessions such as this show the range and volume of issues that require consideration when there is an attempt to dissect a system that touches on so many elements of our daily lives.  It is also a very good reminder of the pressure that banking is under due to changes in technology and regulatory requirements on one hand and the demands on banks by customers who see the world change around them on the other, and who use technology in a way that only a few years ago we would have felt was unlikely.</p>  <p>  The way the public interacts with banks, credit unions and other financial providers has changed fundamentally, and this has been accelerated by the pandemic.  Many will still need or want to carry out their banking activities in person.  Credit unions and An Post have significant branch networks in addition to those of our retail banks.  The Government is, and will continue to be, supportive of the financial sector meeting the needs of households and firms to achieve their financial, economic and social needs.  </p>  <p>  As the Minister for Finance pointed out earlier, the Department of Finance will undertake a broad-ranging review to look in detail at the many relevant issues in the banking sector.  We must recognise that much change is under way.  Ireland has had a difficult few months with regard to that change.  For the review to be a process that will signpost how banking can deliver for society and the economy, we must recognise that people are seeking banking services through electronic and card-based systems.  While there is a variety of needs we want to meet, we may have to meet them in a different way in future.  We need a process that provokes and invites genuine debate rather than seeks to preserve the present situation in its entirety.  I was impressed by a Deputy saying that it was not about preventing branches closing but about opening new doors.  That must underpin the review.  The future will happen whether we like it and we need to be part of it, to plan for it and be proactive.  I assure Deputies that the review will involve extensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders.  There is a process to be followed, including modalities and the time scales involved.  The Minister will announce its details as soon as practicable.  </p>  <p>  Many of the issues raised by Deputies overlap with the issues that the Minister and I have been considering all along.  We will take on board everything that has been said but we are clear that we want to end up with tight terms of reference that can deliver solid and achievable results in a reasonable timescale.  Some asked for that and stressed the importance of that and the terms of reference.  We do not want a review that goes on for three or four years because time will pass us by.</p>  <p>  In addition to the banking review, the Government is progressing a review of the policy framework for credit unions, which is a programme for Government commitment.  I have met many credit union stakeholders in recent months and we will meet again before the summer recess.  Many meetings are taking place.  When the Bank of Ireland branch closures was announced as well as Ulster Bank's withdrawal from the country, I immediately met with some of the key credit union organisations to put it to them that this was an opportunity as in many cases they will be the only financial institution left in many towns and locations.  I am encouraging them to take this as an opportunity to grow small and micro businesses in those areas as well as local customers who may not want to travel outside the region following the bank branch closures.</p>  <p>  There is an opportunity for the credit unions and it is important that they actively go after that opportunity and not to wait for a banking review to conclude down the road.  The movement must develop, as a matter of urgency, collaborative approaches to develop structures and expertise needed to develop its business model.  Some of them cannot do all the mortgages on their own but if a group come together on a collaborative basis, they will be able to provide scale and I am particularly interested in understanding how credit unions can grow the SME and mortgage lending sustainably.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible to comment on all the points raised in the past few hours but every one has been taken into account.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell began by talking about banking culture and public trust, senior executives and accountability.  The heads of Bill will be published before the summer.  She also mentioned the mortgage resolution process, the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC and the sale of the Bank of Ireland shareholding and the Government's role in that.  I stress the bank's independence in this regard is protected by a relationship framework, which was insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the marketplace.  A European framework is in place to deal with Bank of Ireland and other key banks.  The role of credit unions was also mentioned.  Deputy Nash also mentioned the Bank of Ireland shareholding and the need for the forum to be a broad-ranging review.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary mentioned tracker mortgages and how they contributed to an erosion of trust.  Others referred to that as an example of the culture in banks with which other people take considerable issue.  Ulster Bank's staff were the last to hear of its withdrawal.  We definitely need to have improved communication on key issues that effect people's livelihoods so that they do not hear about it on the 8 o'clock news some morning when they turn on the radio.</p> <p>Mica and pyrite were also mentioned.  The banks were brought into the issue because they have mortgages on many of the properties and they should have been more proactive dealing with their own assets that they knew were not worth the amounts given for the mortgage while their assets were crumbling before their eyes.  The discussion on mica cannot be completed without the banks being brought to the table in some respect because while we are protecting people's homes, to some extent we are also protecting the assets of the banks, which have a role to play in this issue.</p> <p> A couple of Members asked questions about the reason banks such as Ulster Bank and KBC are withdrawing from Ireland and the reason we have no new entrants coming in.  That is one of the most fundamental questions that has been highlighted here.  It is very easy to talk about branch closures but we must examine what is happening here that banks are leaving because they do not feel it is a proper place to do business.  That is an issue we must address.  It is not only a problem that banks are leaving the country, but we are not getting new banks to come here.  That issue must be examined to make sure that we have a viable, sustainable and competitive banking industry in the future.</p> <p> It was also suggested that when Ulster Bank, KBC or Bank of Ireland leaves a town they should give the bank to the local community.  I suggested that from day one.  Many bank branches are in key locations in main towns and many of the premises are in good condition.  Local authorities, through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, should consider possible uses for some of these buildings.  The last thing we want to see is the banks walking away.  They are such big buildings they will not be easily sold to people in the private sector and we do not want them to become another source of dereliction on streets in so many towns around the country.  I ask the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to engage on the issue to see if there is scope for these buildings to be put to good community use or for housing, which would regenerate many of the towns where these branches are closing.</p> <p> Public banking was mentioned, as were credit unions, extensively.  Deputy Shortall said a third of the bank branches in this country have closed or are closing over a seven-year period.  That mirrors what is happening banks everywhere throughout Europe and in the United States.  There is a bigger picture.  That is the reason I said we must ask why banks are leaving.  What is happening with bank branches in Ireland is what is happening everywhere.  For that reason we must look to the future and open new doors, not try to prevent the doors we have from closing, which has happened in many cases.  Local businesses want to have local banks in the area.  The legacy debts of AIB and Bank of Ireland are giving rise to issues in many cases.  Tied agents were also mentioned.</p> <p> The legacy of the financial crash was mentioned.  What we want to do is talk about the future of banking.  We had a major debate here today about the problems of the banks in the past ten years.  Resolving the problems of the future will not be done by exclusively focusing on the past.  I would like to see much more forward thinking about how young people are doing their banking.  Some use cards to get cash.  They are also more active customers in some of the new financial organisations than some of the established banks.</p> <p> I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  Everything that has been said in the debate will work its way into the consideration as part of the terms of reference on the review of the future of banking.</p></speech>

The clear understanding of everybody at the meeting is that a report was to be prepared on the optimum location of an ambulance waiting base that would be located centrally somewhere in Conamara.</p>  <p>  On 13 May I tabled a parliamentary question which received a reply stating the matter was referred to the HSE and the NAS.  I asked when the report on the optimum location would be available.  I got the answer, tr&aacute;th&uacute;il go maith, inniu.  However, there is no answer.  Nothing has happened.  I was told that the National Ambulance Service is focused on improving service delivery and to this end an analysis of operational resources is currently planned.  In other words, it has done nothing and nothing has changed.  It is vital now that we get action, as agreed at the meeting, on this issue.</p></speech>

Like the other Deputies, I thank you for selecting this matter.  I thank Deputies Connolly, Farrell and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for raising the issue of ambulance services in Connemara.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the National Ambulance Service has been engaging with local representatives on an ongoing basis regarding the provision of emergency ambulance resources for Connemara.  The most recent engagement involved the chief ambulance officer for the NAS west division, meeting virtually with the Connemara Ambulance Crisis group and other attendees invited by the group.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to that.</p>  <p>  As a result of these engagements, an analysis of ambulance demand and response times for the area has been circulated.  I understand from the NAS that feedback is awaited from the group.  The Deputies have specifically raised the possibility of an ambulance base located centrally in Connemara to ensure the region is covered at all times.  As the Deputies may be aware, the National Ambulance Service deploys its resources in a dynamic manner operating on an area and national basis, as opposed to a local or county basis.  This means that emergency ambulances are not held at specified static bases, but used in a more flexible manner that reflects the population need and demand.</p>  <p>  Dynamic deployment uses an ICT platform that provides real-time information to the staff of the National Emergency Operations Centre, who continually match currently available resources and their locations with service demand requirements.  The most appropriate nearest available resource is deployed in the first instance.  The baseline and capacity review also highlighted that the most effective way to improve emergency response times in rural areas is through the community first responder scheme.  Community first responder groups comprise trained volunteers, who are supported and dispatched by the National Ambulance Service.</p>  <p>These groups respond to particular types of medical emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, chest pain, choking and stroke.  I am advised that, at the end of February 2021, a total of 275 schemes were established, including 26 in County Galway.  In Connemara, two community first responder groups have returned to service following Covid-19 stand-down, while four other groups will be reactivated.</p> <p> The purpose of the question was the follow-up in regard to meetings.  Prior to coming to the House today, I followed up on the issue because I did not feel my scripted response would address it properly.  I want to outline the information I received just before coming to the House.  The National Ambulance Service has advised that no report has been committed to in regard to a feasibility study for a base near Maam Cross and no commitment was provided for a base location, nor any report committed to.  The National Ambulance Service has undertaken an analysis of demand, which consists of calls in the Connemara area, in order to understand the level of service required in the area.  Further analysis of national demand is being undertaken but the ability to complete this analysis has been hampered by the recent cyberattack.</p> <p> It is important to have that read into the record of the D&aacute;il because I would be doing the Deputies a disservice to stand here and give the answer I have in front of me, which does not address the question which the Deputies raised as to exactly the position in regard to addressing the report, if there was a report, and timelines for location.</p></speech>

The reality is that we can all work together on this, and we see that from the fact the three of us are working together, with many other Oireachtas Members as well.  What we have at the moment is just not working for the people of Conamara.  That is why there is a campaign group, although that is not to take away from any of the work the Minister of State outlined in her statement.  The reality is it is just not good enough for the people of Conamara and it is not working.  When people get to the point where they have to call an ambulance, they are in a crisis situation and they need that professional help immediately.  In the Conamara area, when they make that call for an ambulance, they cannot say with certainty that it is going to be there or that help is going to be provided.  Looking at this need to be a priority.  It was my understanding that a feasibility study was going to be carried out.  What we clearly need is a centrally-based ambulance base in Conamara.</p></speech>

There is no misunderstanding on the side of Deputies or on the side of the people on the ground.  We clearly understood from the last meeting that a report would be prepared.  I am not sure if the word &ldquo;feasibility&rdquo; was used but there was to be a report on how suitable that area was, from Maam and Oughterard out, in regard to a base location for the ambulance.  That was clear but, since then, we have got nothing but evasion.  Ar&iacute;s inniu, t&aacute;im ag iarraidh ar an Aire St&aacute;it, m&aacute; t&aacute; aon chumhacht aici, freagra a fh&aacute;il maidir leis an tuarasc&aacute;il a gealladh d&uacute;inn nuair a d'fhreastail muid ar an gcruinni&uacute; i l&aacute;r mh&iacute; Aibre&aacute;in.</p></speech>

During the term of the previous D&aacute;il, people came out from the National Ambulance Service to look at a location in Conamara and, at that stage, there was really no question but that a base was needed.  The idea that it does not have bases such as this and that, while waiting, it moves an ambulance into a central position is incorrect.  It has a number of those in County Mayo, for example.  The problem with Conamara is this.  If the National Ambulance Service wants to call the nearest ambulance when its ambulance is gone, it is in Galway city.  It is a simple as that.  What we need is action in this regard.</p>  <p>  If we took what the National Ambulance Service said, namely, there was no commitment to look at the optimum location in the middle of Conamara, I think it is a case of mass hallucination on the part of the participants at that meeting, both the community and the public representatives, because all of us clearly understood that the National Ambulance Service was going to look around the area and find the most suitable location.  We need to stop the pussyfooting.  If it is not going to do it, let it come out and answer to the people of Conamara, and say it is not going to do this.</p>  <p>  I live in the heart of Conamara, 35 miles from Galway city and far from the services.  This campaign has been going on for seven to ten years and it is time it was brought to a conclusion.</p></speech>

We are fortunate that it is a Minister of State from Galway who is taking this question as I have a complete understanding of Connemara, and I have an understanding that when I leave the Bearna road to go out west, I am as close to Dublin as I am to some parts of Connemara.  As to what I will do for the Deputies, the answer I got this evening was from the trauma and pre-hospital emergency care policy unit.  I will organise a meeting with that team within the Department of Health, along with the members of the National Ambulance Service, within the next month.  I invite all three colleagues, who are working closely together, representing their constituents on the ground, to a meeting.  Perhaps we can move this agenda item forward.</p></speech>

In one sense, however, it is very positive because I know he is a regular visitor to Tramore and he knows the lay of the land in the south east as well as anybody in this House.</p>  <p>  I want to share with the Minister of State some of the Bus &Eacute;ireann services that were disrupted in the south east, out of Waterford in particular, on just one day, the Sunday of last week.  These details are taken from the Bus &Eacute;ireann website.  On route 2, the 5 p.m. service from Wexford to Dublin Airport was cancelled along with the return service at 9 p.m.  On the 4-X4 route, the 9 a.m. service from Waterford to Dublin Airport was cancelled along with the return at 1.15 p.m.  The 4.30 p.m. service from New Ross to Dublin was cancelled along with its return service.  Five services on route 40 were cancelled along the Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Rosslare route and four of the services along the 360 route between Waterford and Tramore were officially cancelled as well, according to the website, although I am led to believe that another six services in each direction were also cancelled during the course of the day.  As the Minister of State may remember, this was on one of the best days of the year so far, when we could expect passenger numbers between Waterford and Tramore to be especially high, and at a time when the buses are running at a limited capacity because of Covid restrictions.</p>  <p>  The upshot of these cancellations is that many passengers were left high and dry, either waiting for a bus that was not coming or having been told that the service was at capacity and that they could not get on.  Moreover, and this particularly applies to the longer intercity Expressway routes, people just were not informed in time to make alternative plans.  People were left feeling angry and let down and they struggled to find an alternative way to travel.  I know of one case in particular where the last intercity service was cancelled and the person had to sleep out for the night, having no alternative.</p>  <p>  This is not an isolated incident and these cancellations are happening on an ongoing basis.  It is leading to a situation where people feel they cannot rely on the public transport service operating out of Waterford.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State cast any light on the situation?  Is the problem exclusive to or particularly pronounced in Waterford?  Are there particular issues with staffing in Waterford?  An additional city service has been laid on to provide transport to the mass vaccination centre in the Waterford Institute of Technology Arena.  Has that route been adequately resourced or is that impacting the provision of other services?  How stand the relationships between management and drivers at the Waterford depot?  Are there difficulties that the Department can get involved in to help to resolve.  The Minister of State knows as well as anybody how hard we fought in programme for Government negotiations so that State spending would go two to one in favour of public transport over road projects.  Moving people away from private vehicles to public transport is a key action to decarbonise our transport sector and meet climate targets.  For people to make that choice, public transport has to be comfortable, affordable and reliable.  That does not seem to be the case in Waterford at the moment.  Will the Minister of State outline whether the Department is aware of these issues and what steps it is taking to remedy the problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100062#OOO00200"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh for giving me the opportunity to discuss this.  I am familiar with Tramore.  We go there for our weekly supplies of Dooly's chips.  As Members will be aware, the Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding related to public transport.  However, the Minister is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services as this falls under the remit of the National Transport Authority in conjunction with the relevant public transport operators, which is Bus &Eacute;ireann in this case.  The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that public transport operators, including Bus &Eacute;ireann, have demonstrated great dedication and resilience in dealing with the unique challenges posed by the impact of Covid-19 on the sector.  At the height of the pandemic last year, Bus &Eacute;ireann services continued to operate at a time when many others ceased operations and delivered essential public transport to those who needed it, most notably front-line workers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the easing of some level 5 restrictions in recent months, such as those previously placed on schools, construction, retail etc., has led to a significant increase in demand for some public transport services.  While operators are now permitted to carry up to 50% of normal capacity on each service, there are still some capacity constraints on certain services, with increased congestion also causing issues.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question about bus services in the south east, Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that, regrettably, it has experienced operational issues in recent weeks that have impacted on service delivery in the Waterford area.  I understand that while the majority of services in Waterford have continued to operate as scheduled, a small number, less than 5% of the scheduled services in Waterford, were impacted and therefore did not operate.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the issues with these services have largely been due to staff shortages in the region, which was more than the typical need to cover annual leave and vaccinations at this time of year.  A further contributing factor has been the significant increase in congestion in Waterford in recent months due to the higher traffic volumes following the relaxation of some Covid-19 restrictions.  This gets to the point the Deputy made about public transport and private car travel.  Some local traffic diversions have been in place in Waterford city to facilitate local business, which have impacted on city bus routes and schedules.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has been assured by Bus Eireann that it is addressing the issue of driver availability and that it is well advanced in its recruitment process in Waterford, with a number of these new positions due to start this weekend and more to follow.  I am pleased to advise that Bus &Eacute;ireann is due to commence additional summer services for Waterford to Tramore this Sunday.  These services will double the frequency between midday and 7 p.m. and provide additional capacity to those travelling to the newly refurbished terminus in Tramore.  While I trust this clarifies the position regarding Waterford services, Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised it is happy to engage directly with the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

I do not envy him.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who spoke before him had an answer that was not an answer, but she was able to elaborate on it because she is a Minister of State at that Department.  I am afraid that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has been handed an answer that is not an answer but it is not his Department.  To say that some of the services were cancelled due to increased traffic in June, when schools are finished and the traffic is lighter, is risible, as is saying that local traffic diversions have for some reason cancelled intercity services from Waterford to Dublin Airport.  I do not envy the Minister of State having to sit there but that was not an answer.  Bus &Eacute;ireann said there are staffing shortages but it will double the service from next week.  How can I put those two things together?  Last week, Bus &Eacute;ireann was short-staffed.  It was not just for one day since this has been ongoing.  It was short-staffed and could not provide the scheduled service but it says it will double the service next week.  I know there are issues in the Waterford depot.</p>  <p>  I do not ask the Minister of State to elaborate on his response, since he has a script which was supplied by another Department, but I ask him to go back to the Minister for Transport to ask him to get actively involved in this.  I cannot accept the deflection, saying that this is not under the Minister's remit and that it is the NTA's problem.  There is a role for the Minister.  Something is happening in the Waterford depot that is particular to the area.  More services have been cancelled than in other areas.  Will the Minister of State relay that message to the Minister for Transport in the clearest possible terms?</p></speech>

I am more than happy to take the issues back to the Department of Transport.  There is a commitment in the notes that the CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Stephen Kent, is happy to discuss the matter directly with the Deputy and with other Deputies who have raised this.  The issue of the delivery of some Waterford services was raised by a number of Members.  It is important, in light of the previous question, that we get comprehensive and specific responses to what seems to be a significant challenge in this area of the south east.  I am happy to take the issue back to the Minister but there is a commitment from the CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann to engage directly about the matter to try to resolve the issue.</p></speech>

I congratulate those behind the report and indeed the residents and campaigners who have been working on this for years.  The campaign related to the promise of regeneration started ten years ago.  We are being told it has been put on hold for four years.  This is not just an issue for the local authority.  The State bears responsibility for the conditions these people live in.  The question is not just about the speed of the proposed regeneration programme but highlights the systemic, State neglect and disregard for Oliver Bond tenants and others, including in Balgaddy, Pearse House, Bernard Curtis House in Bluebell and hundreds of council homes.</p>  <p>  Although it was in the media today and yesterday, it is worth going over some of the conditions people live in.  One woman who I spoke to today talked about a neighbour, a 27-year-old mother of four, babies and kids up to the age of six.  She is pregnant again.  She has sewage constantly coming up through her shower onto her bathroom floor.  Most neighbours have complained about sinks being blocked.  From last March until now, there have been several complaints about blocked sinks that have not been addressed by the council.  After a fire in her home, the mother of a woman I know there had to wait for 11 years for her windows to be replaced while the wind and rain howled through her windows.</p> <p>Another neighbour waited three years for a hall door to be replaced.  A 77-year-old woman is still waiting for broken latches to be fixed on her windows.  It should interest the Minister of State, as a Green Party Deputy, to hear that these people are absolutely crucified trying to pay heating bills because the wind howls through their properties.  There are broken latches, pipes bursting in kitchens and sewage outside the flats.  Most of the tenants say the washing machines they purchase last just three to four years because of blockages that wreck the machinery.</p> <p> A report and a promised regeneration have been put back on hold for four years.  This is not just because these buildings, built by Herbert Simms in 1936, have preservation orders and are very beautiful to look at, which is true.  It does not explain how tenants have been treated for decades or how issues of mould, damp, sewage, etc., continue.  These tenants still have no legally enforceable mechanism to vindicate their rights.</p> <p> I have one comment.  We often hear in this House - we have heard it repeatedly from the T&aacute;naiste but also from other Deputies and the mainstream media - that people should not expect the right to free housing.  That "free housing" says much about the nature of the deep class bias against public and social housing in this country.  These people are tenants and they pay 15% of their total family income on their rent.  This attitude is very ignorant and shows there are vested interests in this society who see property as a way of generating wealth rather than a way of housing families.  </p> <p> I am asking that the Government makes the regeneration of Oliver Bond flats a priority.  It should not just put everybody out in the sticks and expect hardly any of them to come back.  Tenants were promised they would be temporarily rehoused in a block of apartments on Bridgefoot Street while Oliver Bond was regenerated block by block.  That promise has now been taken from under them when the council told them no other tenants will be going into that block.  These are huge issues and the Government has to intervene.</p></speech>

I did not see the report but I am shocked at what I have heard.  These are certainly unacceptable conditions for people to be living in.  At the very least, people should expect a basic minimum decent standard of living and a decent standard of quality housing in 21st century Ireland.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p>  <p>  Our Department is committed to ensuring that tenants in social housing are provided with adequate housing that meets the standards most recently laid down in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.  Our Department is actively engaging with the local authority sector to promote the preventative maintenance of local authority housing stock and provides significant funding for stock improvement works.</p>  <p>  In addition to funding provided by local authorities in respect of their own housing stock, approximately &euro;350 million per annum, our Department provides funding across a number of programmes to support the local authority work to maintain and improve social housing stock.  In all cases, it is the local authorities that identify priorities.  The continued work of local authorities in undertaking stock condition surveys, their responsive and planned maintenance programmes, as well as important programmes such as the energy retrofitting and voids programmes, seek to support the local authority maintenance programme. </p>  <p>  Specifically with regard to Oliver Bond House, as the Deputy said, built in 1936 by Herbert Simms, and one of the oldest and largest flat complexes in Dublin city with 397 units and approximately 1,200 residents, the upkeep, refurbishment and regeneration of this social housing complex is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authority.  However, it is my understanding that Dublin City Council is actively engaged with the residents and is working on a number of short-term projects to improve the outdoor common areas as well as long-term proposals for the retrofitting and refurbishment of the flats at Oliver Bond House.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council is working on proposals and designs for two projects that will see the total refurbishment of all 397 flats at Oliver Bond House in two phases to bring them up to modern standards, including size and energy efficiency.  Our Department looks forward to receiving these submissions for funding consideration from Dublin City Council and we will work with it to ascertain the appropriate funding mechanisms for these projects.  Deputy Smith spoke about other projects such as Pearse House and Bluebell.</p>  <p>  In addition to the normal voids programme funding, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, recently announced funding to bring flats that are vacant in older flat complexes, including Oliver Bond House, back into stock. </p></speech>

I am very disappointed and, again, I echo what the T&aacute;naiste said in his last two criticisms of responses from Ministers, or those who advise them, as inadequate.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to cast his mind back to a European Committee of Social Rights ruling that stated Ireland was in breach of the European Social Charter.  This was a class action taken by communities throughout the country in relation to local authority accommodation.  It ruled that Ireland breached Article 16 of the charter which states that: "The family as a fundamental unit of society has the right to appropriate social, legal and economic protection to ensure its full development".  The ruling found that the provision of family housing is "to ensure the right to housing of an adequate standard for not an insignificant number of families."  This ruling was made after a collective action was taken to the European Committee of Social Rights but it has never been acted on by this State.  It has never been put in legislation and has never been ruled upon, but it is about local authority tenants and their rights.  The Minister of State may not be aware of this either, but local authority tenants do not have recourse to the Residential Tenancies Board.  A significant cohort of tenants in this country are completely excluded from any independent complaints process.  </p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State two things.  I ask him to really use every power both he and the Department have to hurry up the question of the regeneration of Oliver Bond House.  That is the first and most important thing I ask.  The other is to speed up legislation to address our breach of the rights of tenants under the European Social Charter.  Local authority tenants, no matter where they are in the country, have no independent body to which they can go to make complaints.  It is a bit like somebody who feels they have suffered a grave injustice going to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and having garda&iacute; investigate garda&iacute;.  Local authorities do not investigate their own complaints properly.  Oliver Bond House, Bernard Curtis House and Balgaddy are the evidence of that.  I could go on naming them but the dogs in the street know this is true.  Local authority tenants live in appalling conditions.  This is the 21st century.   </p></speech>

I was at meetings all afternoon when I received this question.  I apologise for that but I will read the report.  I give the Deputy my commitment that I will work with our Department, and with the Minister, to try to advance the regeneration of Oliver Bond House.  I give my commitment on that and I will try to expedite matters with Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  On the legislation on the EU charter on the rights of tenants, again, I will get a response for the Deputy on that as well.  It is really important that we try to work together to achieve this.  Again, I am appalled at what I have heard this evening.  It really is unacceptable that people have to live like that in this day and age.  I give my commitment that we will work to try to resolve it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100063#PPP00600"><p>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</p>  <p>It gives me great pleasure to bring this Bill before the House today.  I am really piggybacking on the great work done by others, namely, former Senator Colette Kelleher, Oein DeBhairdun and Senator Eileen Flynn.  Ms Kelleher and Mr. DeBhairdun's work during the last Seanad is a tribute to them and their commitment to the process undertaken to bring this Bill into being.  This process is one in which the Traveller community and its networks and organisations, such as the Irish Traveller Movement, were, and continue to be, engaged towards an additional assurance that this Bill is one that reflects the needs and aspirations of the community.</p> <p>The Bill was originally introduced into the Seanad three years ago this Saturday by the former Senator, Colette Kelleher, co-signed by Senators Lynn Ruane and the former Senator, Grace O'Sullivan.  True to the community which it seeks to include, it has travelled far.  It was easy for me to put this Bill forward, with the support of Senator Flynn.  It is great to note that the Joint Committee on Education and Skills is supportive of the Bill.  That is positive.  </p> <p> I have read the Seanad debate on the Bill and I do not understand why it was not brought forward as a Government Bill.  That is an important question because Government commitment is important if this Bill is to pass and become law.  As indicated in the Seanad by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, for this Bill to pass it will need a money message.  I hope that will be forthcoming.  Hopefully, that is enough said about that and it will not be found wanting.</p> <p> The Bill is important in recognising the significant role that Traveller culture has played in Irish society and that needs to be developed.  Education is a key means of encouraging social acceptance of diversity, fighting discrimination and redressing disadvantage.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history within the curriculum of Irish primary and post-primary schools is a logical and necessary continuation of the State's historic recognition of Traveller ethnicity in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2017.  </p> <p> In 2005, it was recommended that Traveller culture should be an integral part of the intercultural curriculum in schools and be represented positively in each school.  Similarly, the Department of Justice and Equality's National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 commits to develop educational resources on Traveller and Roma culture and history for use in primary, post-primary and adult education settings.  In 2009, the Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe stated that Roma and Traveller history and culture should be appropriately reflected in the general curriculum of schools in member states.  </p> <p> Former Senator Colette Kelleher said that this Bill arose, among other things, from consistent reports and research highlighting the grossly disproportionate outcome for Travellers in education compared with the wider community.  The Bill seeks to amend the Education Act 1988 to formally include Traveller culture and history in education.  Education is a key means of encouraging social acceptance of diversity, to fight discrimination and to redress disadvantage.  The Bill in its current format does not guarantee the inclusion intended will happen in practice.  That needs to change.  There is work to do on Committee Stage and I welcome that the committee has expressed support for the Bill and is willing to work on it to ensure it does as intended.  I sincerely hope the Government will support that as well so that we can get a Bill that reflects the needs of the Traveller community.</p> <p> To ensure Traveller culture and history is taught across curriculum subjects rather than relegated to an optional choice dependent on a teacher's individual interest, it requires inclusion in the textbooks and materials, to be not segregated out from other lessons and for teacher training to be fit for purpose to the task.  Legislative inclusion will guarantee that these components will be visible and taught across curriculum subjects.  The 2018 audit of the curriculum, commissioned by the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was comprehensive and its ambition reflected what is now required.  Promises made by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, in 2019 were limited to a scoping exercise, which currently has not been published and is, perhaps, proof of the need for a safeguarding of inclusion in law.</p> <p> Understanding Traveller history and culture as part of Ireland's story is valuable for all learners and will substantially help to combat racism, discrimination and othering.  For Traveller children, a curriculum that is a positive reflection of Traveller life past and present can advance outcomes for Traveller learners and improve retention in education, but only if it is taught by teachers who are trained and culturally competent.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history within the curriculum of Irish primary and post-primary schools is a logical and necessary extension of the State's historic recognition of Traveller ethnicity in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2017.  </p> <p> There are 11,000 Traveller students in our education system and their culture and history cannot be ignored.  Including Traveller culture and history in the State's education system responds specifically to the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe in 2009, including that Roma and Traveller history and culture should be appropriately reflected in the general curriculum of schools.  A direct assurance also removes the burden of young children having to educate their peers, as sometimes happens with their teachers as well.  </p> <p> According to a 2017 ESRI report, Travellers are over 50 times more likely than persons in the general population to leave school without a leaving certificate.  Only 9% of 25 to 34-year-old Travellers have completed second level education, compared with 86% of all persons nationally.  These are shocking figures and this Bill can, and will, play a part in addressing them.  Interestingly, in New Zealand, the adoption of Maori-centred education for over 1,000 Maori students in selected schools significantly increased the retention rates and academic results of participants relative to Maori students in other schools.  That project helped to encourage the New Zealand Government to adopt a large-scale policy at national level to give Maori culture and history a central place in education.  This is a perfect example of how this proposal can work and benefit society generally.  Indigenous minorities are a living fact of many countries and regions.  We need all children to learn about Travellers as a way to extend the horizons of global understanding and to reflect a more truthful Ireland.</p> <p> As stated by the former Senator, Colette Kelleher, learning about aspects of this culture, such as the Gamin language, which is recognised by UNESCO as a protected asset, Traveller music, the historical barrel-top and wattle-lobans and Travellers' fight for inclusion and dignity, will broaden the cultural and historical education of Irish people and students in the same way as Black History Month has done for students in the UK and USA.</p> <p> Enacting this much-needed legislation will help to counter the discriminatory attitudes and negative messaging regarding Travellers that exists among members of the wider community.  These myths have and continue to perpetuate a cycle of victim blaming.  As described by psychologist William Ryan, members of a dominant community see features of the social life of a marginalised community that are the result of poverty and marginalisation as essential features of that community's life and use this observation to justify racist attitudes that cause this cycle of poverty, exclusion and marginalisation to continue.</p> <p> During the debate in the Seanad the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, said that he was supportive of actions which aim to improve educational outcomes for Travellers, including ensuring that the school setting is a more welcoming environment.  It is from the dark and uncomfortable aspects of our history, including our treatment of members of the Traveller community and many other marginalised groups, that we learn the most important lessons.  Recognising and respecting Traveller culture and history ensures that we can build a relationship based on trust, respect and understanding across all cultures.  </p> <p> I do not believe that passing this legislation will be enough and everything will change.  As an Oireachtas, we must send out a strong message that we want to see this Bill enacted and delivered in all of our schools.  We have been here before.  The 2001 Department of Education and Skills guidelines on Traveller education in second level schools states that schools must be proactive in acknowledging and validating Traveller ways of living.  Across the 14 subject areas identified in the Department's guidelines only social, personal and health education, SPHE, has had some sparse, irregular references to Travellers.  There were no references to Traveller culture and history in other subjects such as history, music, business studies, geography, arts, crafts and design.  Twenty years on, these guidelines have not been universally adopted by schools.  </p> <p> The 2018 audit of the curriculum commissioned by the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was not only comprehensive, it again highlighted the pervasive and sustained gaps within the curriculum on inclusion.  The lack of any meaningful progression further informs and affirms the need to ensure an appropriate inclusion.  </p> <p> Traveller representative groups sat on the NCCA advisory group during the 2020-21 process, in which they met twice.  The Traveller representative groups and the NCCA worked well in the earlier process, but the outcome is not yet determined and there remains no indication or commitment to extend the current process beyond its scoping stage.  </p> <p> Enacting this legislation will not be the panacea, but it could well be the start if the Government and the Department of Education act on it and ensure it is delivered.  I take this opportunity to thank the Irish Traveller Movement for its help in regard to this debate.  I am delighted to be able to move this Bill on Second Stage.  I hope that the Government will not be found wanting in progressing it and in providing appropriate guarantees in regard to its much-needed, wanted and deserved delivery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100064#QQQ00200"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this vitally important Bill.  At the heart of it is the underlying principle that we must strive for an education that enriches, values and nurtures every child and young person within it.</p> <p>The Government will be supporting this Bill.  I am acutely aware of the power of education and specifically the power that it has in not only shaping the lives of students, but in shaping the outlooks of future generations.  We must always strive for a better education system, one which best meets the needs of all the students within it. </p> <p> In recent decades, progress has been made in creating an education system that is more inclusive and supportive, including for Traveller children and young people.  This being said, I recognise that much remains to be done and the sheer fact of this Bill being brought before the House today highlights this.  As Deputies will undoubtedly be aware, this is borne out by some of the statistics surrounding Traveller children and young people in education.  For example, just 13.3% of Traveller females were educated to upper secondary or above compared with 69.1% of the general population.  Nearly six in ten Traveller men were educated to primary level at the highest.  This is in sharp contrast to the general population, for which the comparable rate is just over one in ten. Clearly, we must do more to ensure that Traveller children and young people feel their experience and perspective is fully and equally valued by the education system so that this system provides opportunity for them to reach their fullest potential. </p> <p> Since the Bill was first introduced in the Seanad, a considerable body of work has been progressed by the Department of Education in order to further this shared objective.  One of the first undertakings was for the National Council on Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the Government's advisory body on curriculum and assessment, to complete an audit of current curricular provision on Traveller culture and history in our education system.  This audit was completed and subsequently published. </p> <p> The audit identified a number of means through which students&rsquo; understanding of Traveller history and culture can be advanced through the present curriculum across primary and post-primary levels.  For example, throughout primary school, subjects such as history offer an opportunity for students to learn more about the lives of men, women and children from different social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds through Ireland&rsquo;s past.  Through the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, students can be encouraged and supported in developing a greater understanding and appreciation of Ireland&rsquo;s diverse communities.  At post-primary level, there are also opportunities for students to develop a greater awareness of Traveller culture and education.  For example, at junior cycle, schools have the autonomy to develop programmes of study that help students to develop a greater appreciation of how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to our communities and to understand how historic events have shaped contemporary society. </p> <p>  In considering the question of current provision, we must be careful to examine not only the curriculum as it exists on paper, but to look carefully at practices across our school system, as has been alluded to, and to examine not only whether these topics are being taught, but how they are being taught.  While this work has admittedly and regrettably been slowed by the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced the NCCA's ability to go into schools and learn from students and teachers, it remains ongoing.  It has been further supported by the appointment of a full-time education officer in the NCCA in September 2020.  This officer is leading on this work and engaging with education centres from preschool to post-primary.</p> <p> A first draft of the NCCA&rsquo;s research paper on Traveller history and culture should be ready to present to NCCA boards and council in the fourth quarter of this year.  From September 2021, public health guidelines allowing, further work on gathering examples of practice from across early years, primary and post-primary settings will begin.  I look forward to the receipt of this research paper and to considering the next steps which arise from it. </p> <p> In this regard, it would be remiss of me to fail to acknowledge some of the very positive work which has taken place and continues to take place within the education system to promote and support Traveller culture and integration.  Much of the NCCA&rsquo;s work over the coming months will be in visiting schools and other education settings to learn more about work that is already happening to promote awareness and respect of Traveller culture and history and to identify best practice for future policy development. </p> <p> The question of improving Traveller outcomes and experiences in education cannot be answered by curricular change alone, as has also been alluded to previously.  This change must be bolstered by further positive actions to ensure that the Irish education system and broader society is a welcoming and supportive environment for Traveller children and young people.  The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, provides the framework and strategic direction for interventions across a range of Departments to support the additional needs of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland in practical and tangible ways.  It contains 149 actions across ten distinctive themes.  There are a number of very significant actions for the Department of Education in this strategy, including the development of education resources on Traveller and Roma culture and history for use in primary, post-primary and adult education settings; achieving improved access, participation and outcomes for Travellers and Roma in education to achieve outcomes that are equal to those of the majority population; and fostering a positive culture of respect and protection for the cultural identity of Travellers and Roma across the education system.</p> <p> I am pleased to note that there are a number of areas under this strategy in which significant progress has already been made.  For example, one of the commitments under this strategy was to address potential discrimination in education by reviewing policy on admissions to school and addressing issues including the publication of school enrolment policies, the ending of waiting lists, the introduction of annual enrolment structures and ensuring transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was passed by the Oireachtas on 4 July 2018.  Further to the commencement of a number of sections of this Act, all schools have drafted new admissions policies, which seek to create a consistent and equitable approach to how school admissions are operated for primary and post-primary schools.  I am pleased to note that the operation of these policies has now commenced and have governed the admissions of students to primary and post-primary school for September 2021 enrolment.  </p> <p>  Another very significant body of work being undertaken by my Department is the NTRIS education pilot, which has been established to improve school participation for Traveller children and young people.  This pilot project serves four areas across the country within Dublin, Galway, Wexford and Cork, supporting approximately 50 school communities.  In each of these four pilot areas, additional staffing resources have been provided comprising an additional educational welfare officer and an additional home-school liaison co-ordinator, funded by the Department of Education, and two Traveller and Roma education workers, employed by local Traveller and Roma support groups through the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  These staff work together with schools and their staff, parents, students and Traveller and Roma communities to remove barriers which affect Travellers&rsquo; engagement with, and experience of, education.  Among the work undertaken through this pilot is the development of positive relationships between schools and Traveller and Roma communities, supporting effective transitions for Traveller children and young people from preschool on to primary, post-primary, and further and higher education and exploring and developing new approaches and initiatives to support Traveller and Roma children in education. </p> <p> The programme for Government contains a commitment to review the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 and to ensure that the successor strategy has a stronger outcomes-focused approach.  I will be working with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in respect of education initiatives as part of the review and engagement with Traveller representatives will inform this work.</p> <p> It is also worth noting some of the wider work which is under way within the Department to ensure that our schools are welcoming and positive spaces for the students and staff within them.  I am thinking here of legislation such as the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019, which sets out guidelines for a framework which schools must apply in their engagement with students and parents.  The Bill seeks to support schools in proactively consulting with their school communities and creating a positive school culture.  From my background in education, I know that many schools are already very advanced in this regard but it is my hope that this legislation will help to further guide and underpin this excellent work.  This Bill was passed by the Seanad during its last term and I look forward to returning to the House shortly for Second Stage of the Bill.</p> <p>At the core of any school community is the well-being of its students and staff.  My Department seeks to promote the provision of a whole-school approach to supporting well-being.  Such an approach has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for children and young people, including increased inclusion, social cohesion and social capital and improvements to mental health.</p> <p> The Department&rsquo;s well-being policy, first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019, is largely preventative in focus and seeks to reduce the risk factors and promote the protective factors for well-being in the school community.  The provision of a positive school culture where children and young people experience a sense of safety, belonging and connectedness is a key protective factor, as is the opportunity to experience positive and respectful relationships across the school community.</p> <p> Since the well-being policy was published, work has taken place to realise the vision set out therein.  Following an action research project involving 30 schools, the professional development service for teachers is developing continuing professional development to support schools as they engage in a well-being promotion process.  This national roll-out of continuing professional development is due to begin in autumn 2021, depending on public health advice, and will continue for three years.  Supports will be offered on a face-to-face basis in the first term of the 2021-22 school year, if public health guidelines allow.</p> <p> I reiterate my support for this Bill.  As currently presented, this Bill provides an opportunity to recognise the unique position of Traveller culture and history within the overall Irish context.  I am happy to support the Bill.</p></speech>

I listened intently to the point she made about what has happened since 2018 and about the audit completed and published in 2019.  I was not aware of that.  I have not seen that report.  Maybe it went into committee and was discussed there but I think it must be brought into the D&aacute;il or the education committee to discuss the issues.</p><p><b></b>Travellers, as Ireland's most long-term disadvantaged group, experience gross disparities compared to the general populace in terms of educational attainment.  That is still the case even though the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, the student and parent charter and the well-being policy have been brought in.  The Bill introduced by the former Senator, Colette Kelleher, sought to integrate Traveller culture into the curriculum.  Travellers are over 50 times more likely to leave school without a leaving certificate in comparison to non-Travellers and only 9% of 25- to 35-year-old Travellers have completed second level education, compared to 86% nationally.  Including Traveller culture and history in the curriculums of Irish schools with have a transformative effect on young Travellers' relationship with the education system, recognising and validating their distinct culture and helping to work against feelings of exclusion and related high drop-out rates and towards greater levels of educational attainment.</p><p>As Deputy Pringle mentioned, the potential for the recognition of minority culture within a school curriculum to improve the education attainment of minority students was demonstrated by the Te Kotahitanga project in New Zealand, where the adoption of a Maori-centred education for over 1,000 students in selected schools significantly increased the retention rates and academic results of participants relative to Maori students in other schools and helped to encourage the New Zealand Government to adopt an education policy at a national level that gives a central place to the Maori culture.</p><p>The former Senator, Colette Kelleher, said her Bill would:</p> <blockquote> 	amend sections 9 and 30 of the Education Act 1998 to [state] that the Minister shall prescribe that Traveller culture and history is taught in recognised Irish schools.  Given that previous Government education strategies regarding the Traveller community did not culminate in an implementation plan, [such as] the 2006 Traveller education strategy, the adoption of legislation by the Oireachtas is the best way [Senator Kelleher said] to ensure that the Department of Education ... honours its commitment to develop primary and post-primary curricula which include Traveller culture and history as mandatory elements of primary and second-level education.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[This Bill will] also allow the Minister to consult with representative bodies, [such as] the Irish Traveller Movement and other Traveller community groups[.] </blockquote>  <p>I welcome the initiatives brought in to date but this Bill will introduce Traveller culture into the curriculum in all its forms, including music and history, and bring teachers, class, parents and other students into that culture. </p><p>The yellow flag initiative in October 2019, before the lost year of Covid, involved a presentation in the D&aacute;il with five schools from Dublin, Cork and, I think, Kerry.  There were cultural initiatives and activities to develop recognition of different cultures in communities.  That is a good initiative but has not been broadened out enough.  Only a certain number of schools do it.  It is important that the Minister looks at bringing in that education part in the curriculum.</p><p>I remember going to school in the blackboard days when the paper was put up on the blackboard where mammy was at home with dinner ready waiting for daddy to come home.  The culture was changed by changing that image of what was expected of the mother.  It is important a clear effort is made to bring in that cultural aspect to our curriculum in the education system.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an mbeirt acu.  Is Bille iontach &eacute;, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, ar a l&aacute;n leibh&eacute;al.  T&aacute; s&eacute; chomh gearr, d&iacute;rithe agus dearfach sin.  Beidh deis againn go l&eacute;ir foghlaim as an rud at&aacute; i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r an Bhille seo.  Is iontach an rud freisin nach bhfuil an tAire n&oacute; an Rialtas ag cur in aghaidh an Bhille.  Is &eacute; an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n at&aacute; againn anois n&aacute; &eacute; a chur i gcr&iacute;ch chomh sciobtha agus is f&eacute;idir.</p><p>I welcome this Bill.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Pringle, and the former Senator Kelleher for her hard work in pushing this through the Seanad.  It has arisen organically from work on the ground and is a Bill we can only praise.  It is so short.  There are two paragraphs in it.  I have never seen a more focused or shorter Bill in my life.  Maybe I have not lived long enough.  It is:</p> <blockquote> 	An Act to provide for recognised schools to promote a knowledge and understanding of the culture and history of the Traveller community<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />by the insertion of &ldquo;including a knowledge and understanding of the culture and history of the Traveller community...&rdquo; [and so on] after &ldquo;other cultural matters,&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>It comes following the recognition in March 2017 of Traveller ethnicity.  That was a wonderful night.  I remember it well.  The Public Gallery in the D&aacute;il was full and it was a moment in time when we finally did the right thing following the tremendous work of Traveller organisations.  They led us by the nose and we followed and did the right thing.  It is interesting that when we recognised Traveller ethnicity in 2017, it followed on from an awful lot of reports.  Since then there have been other reports, which are welcome.  If I have a minute, I might come back to them.</p> <p>It is worth noting, in particular, that the Bill follows the publication of two reports on the recognition of Traveller ethnicity by the justice and equality committee in 2014 and 2017.  Both recommended the recognition by the State of Travellers as an ethnic minority.</p> <p> There were other reports that led to that historic evening.  I refer to one, from 1963, as an example of how far we have moved.  At the time it was written, the report by the Commission on Itinerancy was considered forward-thinking.  Its terms of reference, when we read them now, were staggering.  It was inbuilt in its work to look on Travellers as a problem.  The terms of reference were to "enquire into the problem arising from the presence in the country of itinerants in considerable number", "examine the economic, educational, health and social problems inherent in their way of life", and consider how to "promote their absorption into the general community".  There was no recognition of Travellers' ethnicity or how distinctly different they were from the settled community.  The members of the commission were appointed by a former judge.  There was no representative of the Traveller community and no representative from the then Department of Social Welfare or any charitable organisation.  We have moved very far since then, which is to be praised.</p> <p> The Minister mentioned many positives in her speech.  She is going to change the strategy to look more at outcomes, which is welcome.  The change in admissions policy is welcome.  There are many other positive points.  I echo what my colleague, Deputy Joan Collins, said regarding the audit.  I would love to read that report.  There have also been many failures on our part and I include myself, during my time as a councillor, in that.  In Galway, we have utterly failed to live up to our legal obligations to provide accommodation for Travellers.</p> <p> However, tonight is not a night to go into that.  Instead, it is a night to zone in on what we can learn from the Traveller community.  In terms of music alone, we have Mary Doran, The Fureys, John Reilly and Pecker Dunne, to whom we must be thankful for so many tunes.  The John Reilly song, "The Well Below the Valley" would have vanished if Christy Moore had not recorded it.  We are indebted to the Traveller community for many things.  I only have time to mention music but it is true on many other levels.  I had the privilege of teaching in a training centre for Travellers when I was a student.  I can only say that I learned more from them, although I hope they took something from me as well, as a teacher who was grateful to teach communication skills.  We can learn as a society by being inclusive and having an open mind in respect of all cultures.</p></speech>

I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill, which was brought forward by Deputy Pringle, and to offer my full support and that of my party for it.  The Traveller community faces discrimination at many levels in society.  This discrimination can be obvious or subtle.  Many in the community feel marginalised in Irish society.  Their experiences and interactions ensure they are made to feel excluded on a regular basis.  They are made to feel they do not belong and are not valued as citizens of this country.  The Traveller community is treated in a manner that does not reflect the values and ideals of the 1916 Proclamation, which referred to "cherishing all the children of the nation equally".</p>  <p>  People's understanding of Traveller culture is often ill-informed, negative and, at times, condescending.  To change this, we need to change people's attitudes.  We can start this process of developing an understanding of Traveller culture and history by teaching it in classrooms.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum of primary and post-primary schools is long overdue.  The Traveller community is now recognised as a distinct ethnic group and this recognition must be reflected in our education system.  The community has a rich culture and history and its own unique language.  It is a proud community.</p>  <p>  More than 15 years ago, a decision was made by those in authority to block off Dunsink Lane, which linked Finglas with Castleknock and where more than 80 Traveller families were living.  I vehemently opposed this ill-conceived decision, which resulted in the isolation of those families from the general community.  This, in turn, led to unnecessary tensions and a breakdown in the relationships between the Traveller and settled communities.  To this day, it remains a bone of contention.  The boulders that remain in place are a graphic reminder of the deliberate separation of the Traveller community from the general population.</p>  <p>  This Bill will bring much-needed awareness among the settled community of their fellow citizens in the Traveller community.  I hope that, in time, through the educational process, this awareness will bring greater tolerance and understanding of a unique community that is often seen as being outside the margins of society.  A curriculum that gives a positive reflection of Traveller life, past and present, is one positive step.  A level playing field when it comes to education is another, and it is badly needed.  This is just one small step in a process that is long overdue and will make our society more open, tolerant, strong and diverse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100067#TTT00300"><p>I join colleagues in complimenting former Senator, Colette Kelleher, on her work in this area, along with Oein DeBhairduin, Senator Flynn and, in particular, Deputy Pringle, who has brought forward this Bill.  As has been noted, it is a short Bill to promote understanding of the culture and history of the Traveller community.  The question that strikes me is why we have to do pass legislation to do that.  I want to use my time to look at why we do.</p>  <p>  Realistically, if we are to address the discrimination Travellers face on a daily basis, we must acknowledge the State's role in the policy that got us here.  Travellers' history, including their impact and role in the War of Independence, the role their clans played throughout our history and the history of their music and culture, is hidden from us.  It is hidden from Traveller children and the wealth and richness of it are also, crucially, hidden from non-Traveller children.  That creates a reliance on negative stereotypes and a cycle of racism and discrimination.  The State as a whole, from its foundation, made a decision that Travellers were of no real value and set in process a policy of assimilating and absorbing them.  This was backed up by legislation in 1925, three years after the State was founded, and continued right up until 2002, with the introduction of the trespass legislation.</p>  <p>  I see the history of this State as one that includes a process of legislative cleansing of the Traveller community.  The Local Government Act 1925 had a clear intent to remove Travellers from the physical environment.  It was not stated quite so, but when the Act was reviewed in 1947, the then Minister said it was specifically targeted at those living at the side of the road.  The State initiated an attack on a people's identity, seeking the erosion of that identity and culture.  This meant they were seen as not being entitled to the same recognition, investment, resources and rights as settled people.  There was a significant demarcation between them and us.  The greatest insult of all was in the past ten years, when the austerity that was imposed on the people of this country saw an 85.5% cut in provision for Traveller education.  That is a shocking statistic.</p>  <p>  The Irish Free State's idea of what it was to be "true Irish" or "valued Irish" led it to create a monocultural identity.  It did this in partnership with the Catholic Church, as we have seen through the pages of history.  We are now more aware of what happened to women, with the backlash and counter-revolution against them by way of the Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes, etc.  We are more aware of that now, as well as the incarceration of the poor in industrial schools.  That incarceration did not exclude children and poor from the Traveller community.  The same level of investigation into the history of the treatment of the Traveller community by this State has not been done.  It needs to be done.  We must face up to what is deeply inherent in the State by way of a legislative process that encompasses all the arms of the State, including medicine, the courts, the Garda, local authorities and so on.  There is a deeply embedded bias against Travellers and it is in the Department of Education as well.</p> <p>That early intent of the Irish Free State to remove Travellers from the physical environment has been repeated several times.  That was illustrated in the 1960s by the Commission on Itinerancy to which reference was made.  It was headed up by Charles J. Haughey, the then Minister for Justice, who stated at the time there could be no final solution until itinerant families were absorbed into the general community.  That is what has been happening.  As noted by Deputy Connolly, there were no representatives of the Traveller community or organisations that cared about Travellers on that commission.  We should look back at the history of this State and how it set out to hide the Travelling community, to impoverish it and to embed racism into every system.</p> <p> That has been the experience of many Deputies, particularly at local authority level, in the context of the local Traveller accommodation committees, which have been an absolute farce because Traveller accommodation and education have only worsened since.  I very much recommend the Bill but, ultimately, this issue will not be truly dealt with until we fess up and have a full investigation into the actions of the Irish Free State.  As we will be commemorating 100 years since its establishment shortly, this is the time to look back in history and see how the legislative cleansing of the Travelling community was repeated several times through the decades.  Let us begin by passing this legislation post-haste and ending that sort of legislative cleansing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-07-01a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="19:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070100068#UUU00200"><p>To be clear, what we are discussing here is a measure aimed at combatting racism and discrimination.  Anti-Traveller racism runs deep in Irish society and it is strongly reflected in the State, the various arms of the State and the education system.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, understated the position quite severely in her introductory remarks.  I welcome the fact she is supporting the Bill but to say that, "In recent decades, progress has been made in creating an education system that is more inclusive and supportive, including for Traveller children and young people", albeit with the rider that, "This being said, I recognise that much remains to be done and the sheer fact of this Bill being brought before the House today highlights this", really understates the position, especially when you consider that a young Traveller person is 50 times less likely than other kids to stay in education up to and including the leaving certificate and that specific Traveller education supports in schools were cut to the tune of more than 85% during the austerity period.</p>  <p>   I point to the identities of the Deputies who are present for this debate.  I cannot see around corners or to the seats above me, but it seems that although the Minister has come into the Chamber to participate in the debate, she is alone on her side of the House.  I stand to be corrected but is there another Government Deputy in the Chamber?  The Government may be voting for the Bill but where is the enthusiasm for it among Government Deputies?</p>  <p>  This is a very modest measure to combat racism and discrimination in schools but it is a fine Bill and I support it entirely in word and in spirit.  The idea of making Traveller history and culture an integral part of the education of young people is a very positive proposal.  It will encompass the songs, storytelling, language and history of Travelling people.  While reading up in preparation for this debate, I learned about the role of Travelling people in the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence, when weapons were hidden in wagons and transported from one area to another etc.  Young people in schools should be learning about this.  By the way, two groups will gain if that is done. First, the young Traveller people who will see their history reflected in the education system will gain, but so will all the other young people in the education system who have been denied knowledge of and education on this part of the history of the country and so on.  Bringing that into the education system would be warmly welcomed by a big majority of young people.</p>  <p>  An anti-oppression point of view and consciousness is quite prevalent now among young people.  You see it in terms of opposition to the oppression of women, support for #MeToo and repeal, opposition to racism with the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as on international issues such as solidarity with the Palestinian people against injustice.  If Traveller history and culture become part of the education system, young people will embrace them.  Of course, anti-Traveller racism and discrimination cannot be knocked on the head and dealt with for good merely through the education system.  There are myriad other injustices that are rooted in society.  Travellers constitute 1% of the population yet 12% of homeless young people are Travellers.  I refer to the significant amounts of funds in councils for Traveller accommodation that remain unspent .  That will have to be uprooted both within the education system and outside it in wider society.  The Bill is a small but important step forward and I am very happy to support it.</p></speech>

There are two of us present out of a party of 37 Deputies.  Deputy Barry can work out the percentage.  There are not many Deputies in general present in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  I thank former Senators Colette Kelleher and Grace O'Sullivan and Senator Ruane for introducing the Bill in the Seanad.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for agreeing to set up an Oireachtas joint committee to deal with issues relating to the Travelling community when he was asked to do so by former Senator Colette Kelleher after a discussion I had with her regarding the need for such a committee.  We agreed that, given the significant number of issues faced by the Travelling community, unless there was a dedicated committee within the then existing structures in Leinster House, we would never get around to dealing adequately with the myriad challenges that community faces.  I thank Deputy Pringle, with whom I have co-operated on other issues, for bringing the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  I thank the Minister for the decision that the Government will support the Bill, which is vital to getting it through the House.</p>  <p>  I first became interested in the Travelling community while I was a student through the inspiration of Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il, a Jesuit who made it his business to live with Travellers, to get to know them and to speak about the significant challenges they face.  That was not today or yesterday.  When he wrote his last book, detailing prejudice and tolerance in Ireland, I had the great honour to be asked by him to write the foreword to the book.  It is interesting he dedicated his whole monumental work and the whole span of prejudice and tolerance in Ireland to Ireland's Travelling community and then, after a hyphen, wrote "Ireland's apartheid".</p> <p>I often wonder whether the State reflects the attitudes of the people, or if it is the other way round and the State dictates attitudes to the people.  In many ways, the reality is that in a democracy, the State reflects the views of the people.  Unfortunately, when it comes to Travellers, those views are negative, discriminatory and have serious consequences.  Having had to read the book to write the foreword, looking across the whole span of all the different prejudices and intolerances, the one thing that jumped out at me was that the general public attitude to the Travelling community was the most negative of all.  For example, I believe the figure was 18% of Irish people believed that Irish Travellers should not have Irish citizenship.  Looking at all of the other sociological indicators, they are all on the negative side.  We will only change these attitudes by education and by informing people that the Travelling community is a community with a long tradition and history and a deep culture.</p> <p> I believe it was Thomas Davis who stated "Educate that you may be free".  I hope that with this Bill we will educate all the young people of Ireland so that they may be free of intergenerational prejudice towards a very important indigenous community in this country.</p></speech>

I recall my father telling me that members of the Travelling community of that time, a man and his wife, called to the house twice a year.  According to their tradition, the man would not enter the house but the woman would.  My father told me that they were the finest tinsmiths.  He said they could produce workmanship that was second to none and that he did not see anywhere else.  My father was a very handy man himself. </p>  <p>  I had the chance to observe the different culture of the community in the early 1990s, when I was in school myself.  There was a Traveller boy in my class who only reached second year.  Later, I was on the board of management at Col&aacute;iste na Tr&oacute;caire in Rathkeale in my time as a councillor.  You would imagine that given that Rathkeale has a large population of Travellers, there would be many Traveller children at the school.  Believe it or not, in certain classes you would be lucky to find one.  Indeed, the Col&aacute;iste na Tr&oacute;caire in Rathkeale had among the lowest number of Traveller students attending in the county.</p>  <p>  The school made some accommodations for the Travelling community.  Part of the culture of some of the members of the Travelling community in Rathkeale was that they did not want their children, and the girls in particular, to mix with the boys in the mainstream school.  A separate part of the school was set up to allow the Traveller children to come to school, because it was the only way they would do so.  Most of the girls would get as far as third year and then leave.  Most of the Traveller children did not progress past third year.  I am not talking about long ago.  It was only a few years ago.</p>  <p>  Personally, I know many people within the Travelling community who run good businesses.  There is a stigma which is present in every society and culture.  There is a minority of people who cause trouble and it results in the whole community being tarred with the same brush.  It seems to happen in many cultures.  In my experience, the majority of people within the Travelling community are good people, but like all societies, there is a minority that causes trouble.  Minorities should not rule anything.</p>  <p>  Every person and child, no matter what culture they are from and what race they are, should be entitled to an education, like everyone else.  That is why I am supporting this Bill.  Every child, regardless of nationality, is entitled to the same chances as others.</p>  <p>  From the days of the tinsmith to the present day, we have evolved and moved forward.  Technology is advancing and everything is moving forward.  It is time that the education sector also moved forward.  We must ensure that every male and female child in this country and world has the same rights to education.  There should be no boundaries.  That is why I welcome and support this Bill.  I am delighted that Deputy Pringle brought it forward and thank him for doing so.</p></speech>

It shows the positive side of this House, whereby a piece of progressive legislation is presented by the Opposition, in this case by Deputy Pringle following on from the work of former Senator Kelleher, and is accepted and supported by Government in an attempt to advance and improve the lives of a particularly vulnerable group.  I thank the Minister for supporting the Bill.</p>  <p>  In respect of Irish politics, I would also say that we should be thankful that we do not have a mainstream political party in Ireland that plays the race card.  Every other European country has one, but we do not.  There are individual politicians who say stupid, ignorant things at election time.  However, no mainstream political party to date has played the race card or the anti-immigrant card, outside of a referendum in 2004.  We should cling to that and build on it.</p>  <p>  What every child, person and human is looking for is a sense of belonging, to feel significant, wanted and needed.  In the history of this State, we often undertook an experiment of sameness, where we presented, through our education system, an experience of Irishness that made many children feel that they did not belong, were not needed and were not significant.  I know of people in my community who were brutalised for the sin of playing soccer.  I know that middle Ireland feels a little dismissive about the idea of a community that gets excited about disco dancing instead of Irish dancing.  Generations of young people were taught by Christian Brothers who were, in many instances, deeply unhappy people.  They were teaching in parts of the country that they did not want to be in and teaching children they did not understand.  They were teaching a language, in the Irish language, that was completely alien to the experience of the children they were teaching.  Within all that, we now have potential, through this Bill, to empower, enrich and lift every child with the experience of our Traveller people.</p>  <p>  I played a part in the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  As has been mentioned, it was a proud day in 2017 when the ethnicity was recognised of people who exist as part of this nation.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned in her speech that she felt the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was progressive.</p> <p>It is but there is a provision in it that I hope she will agree needs to be amended.  It provides for 25% of places to be kept for the children and grandchildren of past pupils.  The problem for the Traveller community is that this would affect it disproportionately because if a child's father or mother did not go to secondary school, he or she would compete for the places at a disadvantage.  I hope the Minister will support the Labour Party amendment to that Bill at some stage, as she said she will.</p> <p> In trying to seek significance or belonging, the power of having your culture and who you are reflected within the education system is incredibly emotional.  It is incredibly emotional for a young person to feel he or she belongs.  It is difficult for young persons to come to terms with the fact that they do not belong because of who they are and that there is nothing they can do about it.  This causes internal frustration and anger and starts a lifelong quest for belonging that can sometimes be obtained in destructive or negative ways.  With this Bill, we have an opportunity to change radically how we approach our education system.  I impress on the Minister the necessity of having a teaching profession that reflects the children the teachers are teaching.  We should have more teachers from Traveller, immigrant, working-class, disadvantaged and disability backgrounds so every child will feel significant and wanted and that he or she belongs.</p></speech>

I also thank the Senators who previously contributed to the development of the Bill.  I particularly acknowledge the personal engagement and personal witness of many of the contributors this evening.  These have added greatly to the debate.  It is such a positive step that we can garner unanimity within the Chamber on this issue.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that this Bill will not put everything to right.  No Bill has that capacity but it is important that the Bill speak to opportunity and inclusion for all within the education system, especially Traveller children and young people.  The Bill, as currently proposed, provides an opportunity for schools to promote Traveller culture and history.  This, in turn, will assist in the development of a greater understanding of our shared history, culture and society.  The work being done by the NCCA is important because that work will support schools in this regard.  The engagement of an NCCA full-time education officer and the work and research, involving the gathering of examples of best practice and identifying resources and initiatives regarding Traveller culture and history, will support teachers and school leaders in delivering on the objectives of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education will continue to progress the actions outlined in the NTRIS and the DEIS plan to support educational provision for Travellers.  Officials will continue to collaborate positively and proactively with Traveller representative groups in the context of the NTRIS and education provision generally.  The strategy pilot on supporting Traveller and Roma, STAR, is under way in four areas and provides for additional staff who work together with Traveller and Roma parents, children and young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and local and national service providers with the overall objective of improving Traveller and Roma attendance, participation and retention in education.  It is intended that the evaluation of a pilot to be conducted in the next school year will inform future policy initiatives to support children and young people from the Traveller and Roma communities in their education.</p>  <p>  The funding provided by the Department of Education for the DEIS programme in 2021 is in the region of &euro;150 million.  A total of 887 schools are participating in the programme in the current school year.  It is worth noting that approximately 50% of all Traveller students attend DEIS schools.  Hence, while I acknowledge that not all Traveller pupils attend DEIS schools, the funding provided to DEIS schools means a greater proportion of Traveller students benefit relative to the general population.</p>  <p>  At the end of April, the Department hosted a shared learning day for all DEIS schools, with a particular focus on transitions, a central theme in action planning for improvement in these schools.  Well-supported educational transitions are linked to positive educational outcomes.  The event was an opportunity for DEIS schools to listen to experiences of successful transition from early years education to primary education and then to post-primary, further and higher education.  As part of this event, the attendees heard the inspiring stories of both a Roma student and Traveller student about their individual experiences of our education system and the supports and individuals that helped them progress into and complete higher education and fulfil their potential to the fullest.</p>  <p>  Progress is being made on improving educational outcomes for Travellers but I accept more work remains to be done.  We must always strive for a better education system, one which best meets the needs of all students within it.  In supporting all initiatives to improve Traveller attendance, participation and progression in our education system, the Government agrees to support the Bill in its current format.</p></speech>

That they came in to put their words of support on the record is a tribute to them all.  It was great to hear them.  I pay tribute to former Senator, Colette Kelleher, Mr. Oein DeBhairduin and Senator Flynn for their support.  I thank Senator Ruane and former Senator, Grace O'Sullivan, for their support in getting the Bill through the Seanad and to the D&aacute;il tonight.  This is important.  I thank the Irish Traveller Movement for its input into tonight's debate, which was important.</p>  <p>  It was great that there was widespread support from all the Members in the House tonight.  That was powerful to see.  While it is important to recognise how Travellers have been treated by the State, we must recognise the potential for change and how it can take place.  This Bill can do a lot to contribute in this regard.  It is through the education system and the education of our young people that we can make genuine change.  Deputy Barry said two groups will benefit from this: Traveller children and settled children.  That is important for the future.  It will feed into the whole process. </p>  <p>  I thank the Government for its support, which is vital.  The Bill will now proceed to Committee Stage, which will be dealt with by the education committee.  There is a need for some amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will be supportive in that regard so we can have it enacted.  That will be important and send an important message.</p>  <p>  I thank the Members, including the Ceann Comhairle.  I look forward to progressing this Bill further.</p></speech>
