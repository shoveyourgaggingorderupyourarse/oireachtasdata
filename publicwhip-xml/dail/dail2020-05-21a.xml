T&aacute;im ag smaoineamh ar na daoine at&aacute; ag fulaingt &oacute;n v&iacute;reas, chomh maith leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag troid i gcoinne an v&iacute;ris gach l&aacute;.

As of last night, 1,571 people had died in our State and 494 more had died in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>In total, 24,315 people in the Republic of Ireland have been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Some 87% have now made a full recovery and others are well on the way.</p> <p> This week, we have seen the lowest number of daily deaths and cases, and the lowest numbers of people in our intensive care units since March.  While we continue to mourn those who have died, we will never get used to the daily loss of life.  We take some comfort from the fact that the trend is going in the right direction.  Transmission in the community has been effectively suppressed, which was the strategy from the beginning, and we are now working to suppress it in other settings and clusters.</p> <p> On Monday, we began the reopening of our country with phase 1 of the relaxation of restrictions.  So far, it is going well.  Many people are back to work, more shops are open, and friends and family within 5 km are able to meet outdoors again.  There has been broad compliance with the five rules and the four steps so I want to say thank you to the Irish people.  We have shown our capacity to reorganise our lives to protect the welfare of all, and it is a remarkable demonstration of solidarity and care for each other.</p> <p> We need to stay vigilant, however.  We really will not know until the first week of June whether the easing of the restrictions has increased the reproduction number, or to what extent.  The Cabinet will make a decision on the next steps on Friday, 5 June on foot of advice from NPHET.  I am aware that some other countries are opening faster but every country&rsquo;s circumstances are different.  We stand over the slow and steady approach.  If things go well, it can be accelerated but we simply cannot make that call at the moment.</p> <p> As of midnight, 18 May, 295,626 tests have been carried out.  We will exceed 300,000 today or tomorrow.  Over the past week, almost 37,000 tests were carried out, and 932 of these were positive, giving a positivity rate of 2.5%, a decrease on last week but still a little too high.  Testing has been ramped up to meet the scale of this crisis, and this week the HSE reached its target of having the capacity to test 15,000 people every day, with capacity of up to 100,000 per week.  As the Chief Medical Officer said on Tuesday, we need to be fluid.  We have more than sufficient capacity right now but that might change, and we have to keep alert to changing circumstances.  We have agreed a strategy that is on target to deliver this week an average turnaround time from swab to result of between one and three days in the vast majority of instances. </p> <p> There has been a remarkable scale-up in contact tracing by the HSE, as was reported to the Special Committee on Covid-19 on Tuesday.  The HSE says the median turnaround time for giving someone a positive result and commencing contact tracing is now just over one day and is improving all the time.  Therefore, I extend my thanks and the thanks of the Government and this House to all involved in testing and contact tracing.  The work they do is essential.  It is life-saving and it is enabling us to reopen our country and economy.  Thank you very much.</p> <p> Work has already begun on preparedness for a possible second wave in late autumn or winter, coinciding with the regular flu season.  On Monday, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, announced the decision to make the flu vaccine available free of charge to all children aged between two and 12 this year and to all those defined as at risk aged between six months and 69 years.  As we know, everyone over 70 already has access to the vaccine without charge.  I believe we can save hundreds of lives this winter and every winter by having a much greater uptake of the flu vaccine.  This matters now more than ever as we need to avoid a second wave of Covid-19 coming at the same time as the flu season.  It is particularly important that the uptake by healthcare workers be much greater than in the past.  This pandemic teaches us that there is no excuse not to be vaccinated.  We have experienced a small taste of what the world was like before vaccines, and it has not been good.</p> <p> We are also examining ways to retain some of the additional critical care and bed capacity that we have gained in recent weeks.  The Department of Health has established an independent expert panel to make recommendations ensuring a protective Covid-19 response in our nursing homes is planned for the longer term given that we may be living alongside this virus for quite some time.  We need to know how we can better shield nursing homes in the second wave, if that is at all possible.</p> <p> Everyone in this House understands that coronavirus has dealt a severe shock to our economy.  This has deep social consequences as well, including record-breaking levels of unemployment and lower living standards for many.  Some long-term sequelae are also now becoming apparent.  For example, due to social distancing, the cost of providing public services and infrastructure projects may rise.  It might cost us more to do less.  Many parts of our economy might never look quite the same again, sometimes for the better but also for the worse.  The recovery will therefore not be easy.  As this will be a global recession, an export-led recovery driven by agrifood, tourism and multinationals such as we experienced ten years ago is unlikely.  Brexit will further complicate matters.  As I said a few months ago, Brexit is not over; it is only at half-time, or, perhaps more accurately, half-time has just ended.</p> <p> On the upside, we have not been shut out of the money markets as we were 12 years ago, and at least in part due to the policies of the outgoing Government and that which preceded it, we retain the confidence of the European institutions and capital markets.  In short, this time we can afford to borrow to reflate our economy at low interest rates and with little conditionality.  We are doing that and should continue to do it.  I think we all agree that substantial borrowing by the State will be necessary to cushion the blow to our economy and society.  We will have a very substantial budget deficit this year and a deficit in the Exchequer borrowing requirement for several years to come, leading to increased national debt.  We will use this borrowed money to: first, provide income supports for those who have lost their jobs; second, get businesses open again; third, provide retraining and educational opportunities for our fellow citizens who are now without employment; and, fourth, stimulate economic activity through investment in public housing, healthcare, childcare, transport, regional development, renewable energy and retrofitting, as well as the intelligent use of tax policies to stimulate economic activity.  We should continue to borrow until the economy returns to sustained growth.  From then on we should seek to reduce borrowing and our deficit and achieve a broadly balanced budget again within a few years.  We do not need to be the best boys in the fiscal class but we should seek to run deficits similar to those of our peers in northern Europe, not much larger ones.  This is a sensible and sustainable thing to do, it is what the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is doing, and I totally endorse that approach.</p> <p> Having said all that, I am concerned that there is a growing belief that we can borrow cheaply forever and that this is the solution to all our problems.  This is the "free money" argument and it is coming from the right as well as the left.  There is, however, no such thing as free money.  Borrowed money, debt, has to be serviced, that is, the interest on it must be paid every year.  This will be a new and recurring charge on our public finances and it will have to paid.  Debt also has to be refinanced or rolled over when it matures.  Some will say this does not matter because it is a problem for someone else in ten, 20 or 30 years' time.  I do not agree with that attitude.  That someone will be us or, if not us, our successors, children and grandchildren.  Furthermore, we should not make the mistake of assuming that being able to borrow cheaply now means we will be able to do so in six months or a year.  The world has changed so much in the past six months, and we would be naive to think it could not change again, and quickly.  If conditions do change, the countries with the biggest deficits and the largest debts will be the first to feel the ill wind, and we need to ensure that that will not be us because the consequences for our society would be grave.</p> <p> Even if this never happens, we need to be honest with the public about the consequences of prolonged low interest rates and increased money supply.  Yes, there are lots of upsides, such as cheaper mortgages and business loans, but there are many downsides too.  Prolonged low interest rates hit savers, mainly older people, and investment in financial assets such as pensions and enterprise is discouraged in favour of physical assets such as land and property.  We know this already in Ireland in light of the poor performance of pension funds in recent years while investors piled cash into development land and apartments, thus driving the cost of housing upwards and exacerbating both the housing crisis and the pensions time bomb.  Prolonged and excessive increases in money supply can also lead to inflation.  We have not seen high inflation for a very long time but that does not mean we will not see it again.  We are way overdue it in many ways.</p> <p>Inflation devalues the spending power of people on fixed incomes - people who do not have the liberty to increase their fees or raise their prices - namely, people on welfare, pensioners and workers.  Some have suggested consols issuing perpetual bonds.  That should not be ruled out but it is clear that this option would involve having to pay a much higher interest rate on such debt than on ten or 20-year money.  This is a fact that we cannot escape from.</p> <p> There are no easy answers, no risk-free or perfect solutions, no policies or strategies that will produce only winners.  The next Government, whenever it takes office, will have to sail the ship of state through the hardest of rocks and the toughest of hard places.  It can be done but it will not be easy and at all times we need to be honest with the public, offering frank answers, not easy ones, and real solutions, not fake ones.  As always, I look forward to hearing the comments, observations and questions of Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100006#D00200"><p>Over nearly three months now more than 2,000 people have lost their lives on this island as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Our first thoughts today must be with their friends and loved ones as well as those who are still fighting the virus.</p>  <p>  It is almost too terrible to contemplate what would have happened if we, as a society, had ignored the threat and carried on as normal.  There is no question that our hospitals would have been overwhelmed and that many people who have successfully recovered from or avoided the virus would have been added to the terrible death toll.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the work of those who have sustained not only our health system but the many critical professions which have sustained our country through this terrible time.  The wider community started restricting its activities from before the formal public lockdown was implemented and the community spread of the virus has been controlled.</p>  <p>  The impact of clusters remains a major concern.  When we return to look for lessons to be learned from this crisis, there is no doubt that the situation in nursing homes and the spread of the virus in health settings will be a focus.  So too will be the situation in meat plants, which has grown significantly during the past while.  I hope today we will hear more details about what measures are to be taken to identify and act on clusters earlier and around the issue of self-isolation for some of the workers involved, as well as more prompt responses for those who have tested positive.  This should be done in a constructive and assistive way to help families of people in that situation.</p>  <p>  The process of unwinding restrictions is under way and we need a robust debate about how this should be carried forward.  The science remains clear but the policies which are possible, while respecting the science, are very much open to debate.  There is not only one possible way forward and the range of expertise that should be included in discussions is wide indeed.  The strongest responses to emergencies are always those that allow multiple voices to be heard and those which accept constructive challenges.  I genuinely believe at this stage that we need a multidisciplinary input in terms of the reopening of society and the economy.  We need to look again at moving faster and restoring the effective functioning of the D&aacute;il.  I note the reports this morning where the deputy chief medical officer emphasised that there is no clear prohibition on meetings that last longer than two hours.  We should look elsewhere in Europe for examples of parliaments that have successfully restarted their work.  We do not need a return to full normal business or the general partisan back and forth that defines too much of what we do, but we do need to be able to review major policies.  We have seen from the excellent work of individual journalists how the response has been strengthened by a willingness to ask hard questions and point to weaknesses.</p>  <p>  There is far more we could and should be doing here.  Deputy McNamara's committee, or the committee that he chairs, is already doing important work in teasing out specific issues.  Next week we are due to debate and vote on a major spending proposal.  At present there has been no consultation with the majority of the D&aacute;il on the details of that proposal.  It will not be acceptable to simply present it as a closed proposal.  Consultation is not defined by briefing the media before briefing Deputies.  It is an important measure and there is no doubt that the majority here will be fully constructive and helpful.  Let us ensure that we prepare for next week and any legislation we may need to review in the weeks afterwards in this inclusive spirit.</p>  <p>  In discussing the unwinding of restrictions we should start by acknowledging that all of the evidence is that the overwhelming majority of people have been responsible and will continue to be responsible.  Department of Health research published in recent days indicates that 85% said they would be willing to wear a facial covering in some situations if it was recommended.</p> <p>Only a tiny minority oppose restrictions relating to social distancing and other measures to control the potential spread of infection.</p> <p> As we move forward we do not have to fear complacency but rather we must have clarity in what is proposed and ensure measures make sense and are credible.  As with so many matters, it is uncertainty and inconsistency that causes trouble.  The division between shops that are allowed to open and those which must remain closed simply makes no sense, and in some cases this is damaging the credibility of the overall restrictions.  The distinction between hardware stores and homeware stores is foolish and there is now no doubt whatever that stores that were allowed to open are actively trying to fill the gaps created by keeping other types of closed stores.  From a competition perspective, there is clear unfairness in that.</p> <p> I understand the public health concern is to avoid encouraging the mass movement of people, which is reasonable.  However, the evidence increasingly implies that the restrictions are simply concentrating movement into a limited number of locations, which is exactly the opposite of what we should want.  The 5 km limit is making it harder to sustain social distancing in areas with a higher population density and it does not appear to be part of restrictions used by other countries in a similar stage in their response efforts.  I do not play golf but if we are saying a person can play golf but not if the course is 6 km away, it becomes an example of guidelines that need to be refined or have more nuance.  I say this in a helpful way.</p> <p> As my party have said for some time, we must significantly expand the range of expertise and opportunities considered when deciding specific elements of the reopening strategy.  As a broad principle, an inclusive consultation should be established for every area and we should let the professions and businesses involved have the opportunity to propose solutions that may not have occurred to officials but which would work in practice.  I know the Taoiseach has stated it is more difficult to reopen than close, and I get that, but it is why we should have multidisciplinary expertise to assist the Government and its work in that regard.</p> <p> With the reopening of schools we must avoid the scenario that came about with the leaving certificate, where a closed, internal process led to unreasonable expectations and uncertainty.  Central to discussions must be an acknowledgement that the closure of schools is not hitting all groups equally.  I believe passionately that we must educate children in our schools and find the wherewithal to do that.  Many pupils do not have the facilities or equipment to learn properly away from schools.  The proven interventions relating to educational disadvantage that have been implemented over the past 20 years overwhelmingly rely on the teacher-pupil interaction.  We must acknowledge this and take action to help them to limit time lost and make up for it.  This is particularly true for children in disadvantaged settings and DEIS schools.</p> <p> The economic impact of the crisis has been unprecedented and the reality is nobody really knows the scale of the impact or exactly what we should do to get through and rebuild from the crisis.  However, we know certain sectors that are at a greater risk than others and our core principle must be to ensure we do not permanently lose business and jobs.  The wage subsidy scheme is effective but it is clearly not a long-term response.  Evidence is emerging of an enormous threat to the future of smaller Irish-owned firms and early-stage firms.  They continue to face a cash flow crisis that threatens their very existence, and in many cases they face having to take on debt that may undermine their viability.</p> <p> The core economic principle in this crisis has been to try to see the debt incurred during the response as separate from normal debt.  The normal benchmarks have, in effect, been moved because of an acceptance that this debt does not define the structural soundness of overall finances.  This is why, for countries, different rules can and should apply in contrast to those relevant for normal economic cycles.  However, for firms and small firms in particular, the evidence is that the normal rules are applying.  We must find a way of making available to these a combination of grants and long-term lower or, preferably, no-interest financing.  The small business sector feels the measures to date have not been on the money for its members, if Deputies excuse the pun.  The overwhelming feedback we are getting from the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector is that there has been no response to the core crisis they are facing, and this is particularly true of the domestic non-exporting SME sector, along with the firms that are exporting.</p> <p> Our public sector must be treated fairly too.  We cannot allow public companies and places like third level institutions and universities to be undermined by carrying massive new debt and being forced into major cutbacks.  We must have a public sector bailout that is comprehensive and fair.  The normal rules of bringing in senior executives and telling them to sort this out must be stopped.  The third level sector, including universities, are in trouble as revenues are depleting.</p> <p>Along with that, there has been an urgent investment in technology to ensure they are ready for the autumn.  There is a real crisis there.  I hope that we will be told today what financial measures are to be proposed to help the wider public sector, including universities, institutes of technology and public companies.</p> <p> T&aacute; an earn&aacute;il tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al faoi bhr&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach.

The agreement does not guarantee that it will happen, but it is a positive step and our Government's recent conversion to supporting this policy is welcome.</p> <p> Populists in Ireland and throughout Europe love to talk about a conspiracy of the elites against the people and refuse to acknowledge the many benefits that all sections of society gain from shared standards, open access to markets and generous supports for areas like training, public transport, community development and sustainability.  Fianna F&aacute;il's position has for some time been that Europe is under attack for failing to take measures that it has neither the funding nor power to implement.  The development of a new way of directly aiding countries and regions in trouble is essential, and this new display of solidarity identified by the Merkel-Macron announcement is a hopeful sign of a new direction across Europe.</p></speech>

I might be resigned to playing golf if it is so desired by the public.  Let us hope not.</p>  <p>  First, I extend our sympathies to all of those who have been bereaved by this virus.  I extend our solidarity and wish for a full recovery to all those who are sick, and our profound thanks once again to workers on the front line.  I also thank the Irish people for their forbearance.  They have held the line and have been remarkably disciplined thus far.  Of course, we are making another request of them to continue in this safe, proportionate and thoughtful way as we advance into our exit strategy.</p>  <p>  The first step in ensuring that we have a fair long-term recovery from the Covid-19 crisis is to ensure a safe and fair reopening of our society and economy.  We need to get it right now so that we have the sound foundations upon which to progress.  Fairness has to be built into every phase of the reopening.  This means doing everything possible to protect incomes and to ensure that people receive the supports they need when returning to work or reopening their businesses and enterprises.</p>  <p>  Where clear problems or anomalies arise, the Government has to be proactive in producing common-sense solutions.  The urgency required from the Government in correcting mistakes and delivering common-sense solutions is glaringly absent in two important areas, the first being the provision of childcare as our reopening moves forward.  T&aacute; strait&eacute;is ch&uacute;raim leana&iacute; at&aacute; s&aacute;s&uacute;il do thuismitheoir&iacute; riachtanach d'oscailt rath&uacute;il an gheilleagair.  Chun an geilleagar a fheidhmi&uacute; caithfidh daoine a bheith in ann dul ar ais ag obair.  Chun daoine a bheith in ann dul ar ais ag obair, caithfidh c&uacute;ram leana&iacute; s&aacute;s&uacute;il a bheith ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  Second, women returning from maternity leave remain locked out of the wage subsidy scheme.</p>  <p>  A childcare strategy that works, is safe for children and workers and meets the real needs of parents is essential for the success of our reopening and ensuring that we can advance safely.  For the economy to function, people have to be able to return to work.  For many, that of necessity means quality childcare.  It is simple and a no-brainer.</p>  <p>  The crux of the problem that we face is that the phased plan for the reopening of the economy is not aligned with the plan for the reopening of childcare facilities.</p> <p>That will not happen for all workers.  It is planned until 20 July, which is more than nine weeks away.  Many workers who return to work before then will be expected to do so without an answer to their childcare needs.  As we speak, essential workers are working without a solution.  Many cannot afford an individual bespoke childcare arrangement from their own resources.  It is unclear when people will be able to mix with their extended families.  This creates a huge headache for more than half of working parents who rely on their wider family for childcare, including grandparents.  The reality still remains that the burden of childcare falls disproportionately on women.  It would be very wrong if any woman or any parent for that matter was forced out of a job for the lack of childcare.</p> <p> As the Taoiseach will know, many households depend on two incomes to make ends meet.  It would be crippling for those families to lose one pay packet because the Government had not got its act together in terms of childcare.  We all appreciate that the emphasis has to be on health and safety.  Take that as read.  The Government had eight weeks to formulate a solution.  While it was planning for the reopening of the economy in a gradual and incremental way, it should have been giving the very necessary thought to childcare because they go hand in hand.  It should have ensured that a workable childcare plan was hardwired into the wider reopening strategy.  It is incredible that this did not happen.  The current problem is symptomatic more generally of a model of childcare that is almost an afterthought in public policy and planning and it is an approach that has badly failed parents and children.  It needs to be corrected.  Parents need a plan.  Parents need a solution and it is needed urgently.</p> <p> This lack of urgency is also reflected in the manner in which the Government has approached the issue of women returning from maternity leave who, as things stand, cannot access the wage subsidy scheme.  This, too, needs a solution.  I note that the Minister for Finance said yesterday that he is examining how to deal with the problem.  New legislation is not required.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, already adapted the wage subsidy scheme without an immediate change to primary legislation.  The Revenue Commissioners can deal with this matter on an administrative basis.  I hope and I trust that the Government does not misjudge the level of stress and anger among the women affected by this exclusion.  They had not left the workforce, they were caring for their newborn children.  It is wrong and unfair that they are currently excluded because of a legislative deficiency.  It is extremely disappointing that this issue has not yet been resolved.  Mistakes happen - that is life - but when a mistake is identified it is not acceptable that the Government drags its heels and the mistake is not rectified very quickly.</p> <p> I have two questions.  Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for Finance today to instruct the Revenue Commissioners today to include women returning from maternity leave after 29 February in the wage subsidy scheme?  Will he acknowledge that the childcare measures under the reopening road map are not fit for purpose and that we urgently need a plan for childcare provision that meets the real needs of parents to allow them to return to work?</p></speech>

Women who went on maternity leave and are now due to return to work want to be able to avail of the wage subsidy scheme and we want them to be able to avail of it as well.  I do not need to direct the Minister to do anything about this.  He is already working on it.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are working on a solution.  Identifying a problem is much easier than coming up with a solution.  The problem is not quite as the Deputy described it.  This issue affects women who went on maternity leave and were taken off the payroll.  There are different cohorts.  Some were not taken off the payroll and they can avail of the wage subsidy scheme, which the Deputy did not mention in her contribution.</p> <p>The ones who cannot are those who were taken off the payroll by their employer and were not on it on 29 February.</p> <p> This means there are other groups who also need to be considered, potentially people who are on parental leave or paternity leave and people who were on a leave of absence or career break.  When one identifies a problem, one has to come up with a solution and also consider all the new problems one may create and try to think of those solutions as well.  As is so often the case, it is not as simple as the stroke of the pen the Deputy often claims it is to resolve issues like this.  The Minister for Finance is working on it with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, and if we come up with a solution, we will inform the House of it and implement it as soon as we possibly can.</p> <p> On childcare, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, was in the Chamber only yesterday outlining her plans to reopen the childcare sector.  The plan is to do so on a phased basis from the end of June.  That requires a number of things, including consultation with the sector, which is now very much under way, but also examining how it is being done in other jurisdictions, and that is under way as well.</p></speech>

I do not accept any excuse advanced for not dealing with the clear-cut situation of women returning from maternity leave who are locked out of the wage subsidy scheme.  The Taoiseach is right that it is those who were not topped up by their employer, but that makes the situation all the worse because they were solely reliant on their maternity benefit.  That is unfair.  If other scenarios have arisen, we must deal with them too, but it is of no comfort to women who have been excluded from this scheme, who are coming back from maternity leave, and who are employees with a protected status under the equality legislation, to say to them, "Well, you have to wait because there are other problems also."  All of these matters need to be dealt with but this issue has been raised for weeks with Government.  It is not a new issue and these women need an answer.  It is unfair to exclude them and I would ask the Taoiseach to move very promptly.  I urge him to instruct the Minister for Finance today, because the matter has not been resolved and what the Taoiseach has said is of no comfort to the women concerned.</p>  <p>  As to the considerations of the childcare sector by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am really alarmed.  I hear and understand that we are considering the Norwegian model, with numbers of children in pods and playing with a single toy between them.  I have to say that it will take a miracle, certainly for any children I have ever had any dealings with, to enforce that level of physical and social distancing.  It strikes me that there is going to be a huge issue around capacity and physical space.  There is going to be a huge issue around personnel and the numbers of childcare workers available.  I have no sense at this point that the Taoiseach is in any way, in a real-world way, dealing with those very pressing matters.  We do not need to hear at this point that the Taoiseach is considering models that might apply.  He needs to be considering the day-to-day realities of childcare provision here in this State, how he is going to make it safe, how he is going to grow capacity and how he is going to make up for the fact that fewer children can be in restricted spaces and the consequential need for more personnel.  I have no sense that those matters are being considered or planned in a concrete way at this juncture.</p></speech>

We hope the numbers will continue to improve.  It is a shocking loss again for all those families who lost people yesterday.  They are first and foremost in our minds, and steady and slow is the right way to try to minimise further loss.</p>  <p>  However, we will look in the coming weeks and months for a large number of people to come back to work.  Not all of them, and some may find new ways of working from home, but we are looking at a lot of people returning to workplaces in the summer.  It will be difficult to do social distancing on the likes of public transport.  In my constituency, it is very hard to see how we can manage social distancing on the Luas and, similarly, on the buses.  Certainly, our bus network capacity will be significantly restricted if we are still applying the social distancing measures.  This gives us an opportunity or necessity in providing other safe modes for people to get into work and the obvious way for a lot of people is to walk or cycle.</p> <p>Cycling, in particular, has the capacity to allow people to cover distances and is also safe regarding social distancing.  We should be looking to do what I believe Transport for London, TfL, is doing, which is a ten-fold increase in the numbers of people cycling.  I refer to making it safe and attractive and making that increase happen.  </p> <p> I understand Dublin City Council is due to publish plans.  It has done good work in the last month to create safe space on our streets and to use this opportunity, when we do not have large volumes of traffic, to reconfigure some streets.  The council is also seeking in the coming days to bring out a significant plan for how we might make it safe, in a temporary but significant mechanism, for this new transport system to apply this summer as people return to work.  I do not think we are getting a similar speed, but I believe in a similar system in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  There are plans in Cork and Galway for bus and cycle routes and we should be putting those in place in the next few weeks, even temporary structures, to create these circumstances. </p> <p> I am keen to get the Taoiseach's sense on this and if he thinks that is a message we need to send to local authorities.  I also refer to getting the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to row in in support to get the scale of flexibility and speed required in creating a safe cycling network, in particular, in our cities and towns so people can get back to work in that way, at scale, in huge numbers to help the recovery we need in our economy.  Does the Taoiseach think that is a message?  I would be interested to hear his perspective from within Government as to whether there are plans for measures on that sort of scale of ambition.</p></speech>

Every crisis does create opportunities, and one of the opportunities that arises out of this crisis is to provide more space on our streets for pedestrians with wider footpaths as well as more space for cyclists.  We have already seen a big increase in the number of people cycling into Dublin city centre in recent years, but it is still way lower than in other cities of our scale across Europe.  We would like to see much more cycling in cities such as Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, and other towns as well.</p>  <p>  I would put the message out to city councils and local authorities that this is now an opportunity to draw up plans to improve pedestrian facilities and provision for cyclists, and also to implement them.  That is particularly the case at a time when it is difficult to do some forms of very complicated construction.  I am not an engineer, but I would have thought that this type of outdoor work, widening footpaths and putting in cycle lanes, is probably easier to carry out than some more complicated projects.  I think this is an opportunity and I encourage city councils to take up the suggestion being made by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I support that as the Head of Government.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise the Office of Public Works, OPW, which is part of central government while local authorities are not, for making the decision yesterday to increase by 33% the amount of the Phoenix Park being made available to people cycling and walking.  That is a very good move by the OPW and I welcome it.</p></speech>

My second question concerns employment.  I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's earlier statement that we have not really fine-tuned small business supports to make this work.  Part of what we should be considering is allowing for a bottom up response where the State provides grants, financing or loans.  There could be a whole variety of different supports.  We are probably going to see a major transition in the retail space, for example.  The local authorities and local community enterprise boards could be proactive in trying to make retail and other spaces, including employment and enterprise hubs, available for businesses to move into during this incredibly difficult time for our small business community.</p>  <p>  This opportunity could also be used to not only support existing small businesses, but also to allow them and new businesses to bid-in locally to create new distribution systems.  In the area of food, for example, we know we need to create new distribution systems directly connecting Irish food producers with consumers.  We could use this as an opportunity to set this up on an experimental basis in different parts of the country to allow new enterprise models to be tried and tested.  I refer to putting large resources into doing that, with funding coming from the centre, possibly using some potential European funding, but then allowing existing and new creative business and local enterprises to bid-in and get access to office and retail space in that system.</p> <p>I know that is slightly abstract, but it will be key to how we get small businesses working in new and different ways as we come out of this crisis.  That is the second broad proposal on which I am seeking the Government's support.</p></speech>

It involves a three-month rates waiver and a rates rebate of up to &euro;10,000 to make any adaptations a business may need in order to buy new stock for reopening or to do whatever else it needs.  Under the wage subsidy scheme, the Government will pay the bulk of staff wages for a period.  There are also loan guarantees and credit lines.  It is substantial when one puts it all together, but that is not to say that it could not be added to.  We are open to suggestions in that regard.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, I am a big fan of competitive funds.  They are a good idea.  We established four such funds under Project Ireland 2040, including the disruptive technologies innovation fund, which has been very popular, and the climate action fund.  We may consider another competitive fund targeted at SMEs.  The advantages of competitive funds such as these are that they are budget-capped such that one knows how much they will cost, the process is efficient because the best projects are the ones that win, and they drive innovation and cause people to think differently.  The Deputy has made a very good suggestion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100012#K00300"><p>I will be slightly more critical in making my third point.  It seems that the State has responded very quickly in many ways, but in the education sector - I will be honest although I do not wish to say this in a negative way - it has not been seen from the outside to have been as quick to respond.  What has happened with the leaving certificate and so on is a real concern.  I share the concerns of other Deputies.  I do not see why we could not get a system in place such that schools could return in September rather than being radically delayed.  Similarly, it is crucial that we manage the new leaving certificate process in order that our students are able to begin third level education at the usual time of year rather than in November.  If my son goes to college, please God, I do not want him to have to wait six months to do so.  That is a long wait.  I must explain to him why it takes us six months to get our act together in this sphere.  Many other sons and daughters are in a similar position to him.  How can one explain a delay of six months?</p>  <p>  More specifically, last week I raised the fact that Scotland and other parts of the UK maintained their special needs schools through the crisis.  Deputy McDonald is correct that the issue of how one separates people is very difficult, be that in a care setting, in the context of childcare or in terms of accommodating those with special needs.  However, the number attending special needs schools is small and there is a good staff-student ratio.  A real health benefit would accrue from getting our special schools and special disability classes back in June.  Many parents in particular circumstances are experiencing serious difficulties.  It would be a sign of the education system starting to step up to the plate a bit if, in the final days of May, it managed to get our special needs schools back in action in June.  At the very least, that should be an achievable ambition for the Government.</p></speech>

In Northern Ireland and certain other parts of Europe, schools were not fully closed down but, rather, kept open for a certain number of essential workers' children and those with particular special needs.  If we were to do this all over again, the advice from NPHET might be different and we might keep schools open in some way.  That is hindsight.  Looking ahead, the Government has a particular concern regarding children with special educational needs, autism, intellectual disabilities, behavioural problems or child protection issues who have now been at home for a very long time and really need educational input.  I would love us to be in a position to open special schools or special units in some way before September if at all possible.  That would require the engagement and co-operation of the public health authorities and the various unions involved.  It is not the most straightforward process.  We are giving priority to July provision and seeing if we can have enhanced, extended or other July provision in some way such that we can provide something for those children, perhaps not in June, which is not too far away, but maybe in July and August.</p> <p>That engagement has started but we will need the co-operation of all of the partners - the unions in particular - in getting that over the line and agreement from the public health authorities as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100013#L00200"><p>Our thoughts are with the families of those who have lost their lives in the last week and with all of the workers out there who are doing such a fantastic job.  This week I want to raise three issues with the Taoiseach.  The first is workers and the consistency of public health advice.  The second is how we are going to open up our health services, particularly cancer screening and services for people with disabilities.  The third issue is how this crisis is disproportionately affecting many women.</p>  <p>  This week, as a result of the appearance of critical health officials at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, we quite coincidentally had new public health advice offered to the Houses of the Oireachtas, following a request from the Department of Health.  I wonder why the Department of Health, at this juncture, asked for that.  In summary, the advice said that members or witnesses should only be present for a cumulative period of two hours in any 24 hours.  If this is surpassed and if anyone present during any of that time displays symptoms of Covid then everyone else would have to self-isolate for 14 days as they would be considered close contacts.  In effect, we now have to create a working environment in here - I have my stopwatch on because I am due back in here later on and that is not a joke - that prevents the possibility of this happening.  Hence, the Minister for Health will not appear twice today but this cannot just apply to him; it has to apply to every other person who is working.</p>  <p>  We were aware of the two-hour rule but not the cumulative range.  All of a sudden, this advice was proffered on Monday evening and was news to many of us.  Was it news to the Taoiseach?  I have had many meetings with the Taoiseach, virtually and in person, over the last nine weeks.  I knew about the two-hour rule, which the Taoiseach often referenced but I do not think that, up until recently, he was even aware of this cumulative two in 24-hour rule.  The advice has been supported since by the CMO and the director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, albeit conditionally.  They said it was not hard and fast and that risk assessments must be made but I do not think this washes with most people and I do not think it is actually realistic.</p>  <p>  In plain language, it is absolutely bonkers that this advice, which may have existed, was only socialised to everyone on Monday evening and made public on Tuesday.  I can see the Ceann Comhairle smiling at me because it is absolutely true.  It is bonkers that such advice is issued this far into the crisis because this changes everything.  Why did NPHET not make this clear before now?  I would like to know when the Taoiseach, the Government and Ministers were made aware of it.  I was not aware of it.  I broke those conditions in here last week.  I was in here for questions to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Health.  I was here for well over two hours.  The ramifications and knock-on effects for Irish society and businesses are extraordinary.  Amazingly, this advice came within 24 hours of the CMO saying that the virus transmission had been "extinguished in the community".  This does not make sense.  If this is the public health advice, so be it but I genuinely do not believe many, if any, people in here were aware of it.  If the Members who are elected to represent the public of this country were not aware of it, how could workers, employers and organisations be aware of it?  How are they all meant to operate within this advice?  How are they professionally meant to carry out individual risk assessments across all locations?  How can any factory, shop, pharmacy or office operate in such an environment?  This changes everything.  It is obvious that many workers are working in environments where these conditions do not exist, some of whom are not too far from here.  We cannot stand over a two-tier society where all of us in here and in the Courts Service operate under one set of public health guidelines and everyone else out there operates under something completely different.  We need to treat everyone the same, be it those who are looking after our healthcare, providing food, keeping us safe, working in factories, garda&iacute; etc.  What has happened sounds like something from George Orwell, that some are more equal than others.</p> <p>I do not even want to think what impact this development is potentially going to have on insurance premiums.</p> <p> There are three choices for the Taoiseach.  Either the Government can publish comprehensive and consistent guidelines through NPHET, sector by sector, in the next 24 hours on how shops, factories, Garda stations and everything else can operate under these guidelines, or it accepts this will not be possible in many settings and it will not be viable, if it was done, because many businesses would not be able to operate.  In essence, we would accept, as a Legislature and as a Government, that some people's lives have to be put at risk, so I do not think that is an option.  The third option is that we, the Government and NPHET work this back - this is not advice from the WHO, I understand - and change it to something that is more realistic, proportionate and implementable.</p> <p> Everyone here is working hard.  The Government has done a fine job, NPHET has done a fine job, the HSE has done a fine job and we are all doing our best, but this is something that needs to be dealt with and dealt with now.  While I am at it, going forward, we need to ensure we have one linear voice in regard to public health advice and that comes from NPHET through the Government.  To have others giving advice and that being used creates confusion all over the place and it cannot continue.</p> <p> I say in jest that if the Taoiseach does not change what has transpired, I am not sure how long more Government formation talks are going to take, but they will possibly take another 100 days because the parties will not be able to meet for a considerable period.</p> <p> There are two other issues.  We are reopening the economy and we have a road map but we need a published road map in regard to health care.  For three weeks in a row, I have raised the issue of non-Covid preventable deaths.  I want to relate two issues, the first of which is cancer screening.  We know cancer screening saves lives and 11,000 people a month get screened.  I have heard commentary from the deputy chief medical officer that that is not going to happen in the near future.  That is not acceptable and I also do not think, by the way, that it is his role, because under the law - the Health Act 2004 - it is actually a role for the HSE.  This needs a plan or, otherwise, lives are going to be lost.  We already know some of the potential statistics.  It needs to be brought in soon.</p> <p> The second issue is in regard to people with intellectual disabilities, and I am glad this issue was raised previously.  I have received much correspondence and it is an area in which I take a lot of interest.  I have received correspondence from the family of Philip, who basically outline how much he has regressed in the recent weeks.  We need a plan.  We cannot let down this sector of society.  We need a plan soon in regard to people with intellectual disabilities, who are regressing.  They do not have day services, they do not have outreach and they do not have social interaction outside their own house.  It cannot continue, so I beg for this to be brought forward.</p> <p> With regard to the impact the Covid emergency has had on women, the Central Statistics Office survey was quite welcome but was also quite worrying in regard to many of the statistics, which I do not have time to quote.  However, the Taoiseach relays that on top of other issues, for example, on top of the issue relating to maternity leave, which should be solvable pretty quickly, and on top of the issue relating to how nurses in many areas of the country have not yet received their back pay, and the majority of them are women.  The Taoiseach also layers on top of that the way in which the childcare situation for healthcare workers, a large majority of whom are women, particularly in nursing, has not been dealt with.  On top of that, he layers the nervousness that everyone has that the full childcare solution that is meant to start rolling out in June is not going to happen.  Although it may be unintended, it is real, and the Taoiseach can see why many women feel they are proportionately, in some way, being treated differently during this crisis.</p>  <p>The Government and Legislature need to deal with this collectively.  I ask that over the next 24 hours somebody in government answer the question my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, asked yesterday.  I was in meeting with the Taoiseach eight or nine weeks ago and the Minister for Health had under his arm a proposal on healthcare workers and childcare.  I believe this is the solution being pushed forward now, nine weeks later.  We need a cast-iron guarantee that childcare will be opened up and in place in early June.  Many families need to know that will be the case.  I ask the Taoiseach to answer that question directly please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100015#N00200"><p>I want to make brief reference to the health advice we received late on Monday evening with regard to the Covid-19 committee.  It came out of nowhere and I still cannot figure out who took the decision to request it or go to that particular source.  It has certainly caused major problems for the operation of the committee, the House and, we now know, the Courts Service, and goodness knows how many other workplaces.  It has the potential to cause chaos because its implications are so severe.  It is important that today, as leader of the country, the Taoiseach makes a clear and categorical statement on the status of this advice and what the advice is generally, not only for the operation of this House but for many different settings.  How can we possibly operate if this is the prevailing health advice?</p>  <p>  It is very important that we operate on the basis of official health advice from the WHO and that the Taoiseach checks out what is happening in other parliaments.  I am not aware of any other parliament that is acting in this way, with members forced to behave like Jack in the boxes, jumping up and down and in and out.  If nothing else, we should think forward about how to operate on the basis of this advice.  For example, we have been speaking about the need to go down to the convention centre to legislate.  Would the two-hour limit apply there?  How could we possibly get legislation through the Oireachtas if we cannot spend more than two hours together in any one day?  It make things completely unworkable and the Taoiseach needs to provide clarification about it today.</p>  <p>  I want to concentrate on decision-making on the lifting of restrictions.  It has been said that it is a much more complex task to lift restrictions and open up the country than it was to close it down, which happened very quickly, and rightly so.  It is more than a week since I put it to the Taoiseach that he needed an expert multidisciplinary task force to plan and manage the reopening.  At that time, the Taoiseach said the Cabinet sub-committee was the task force and I challenged him on that.  I put it to him that however competent a group of Ministers is, it does not possess the expertise and skills to plan and manage the very complex task of reopening the country.  Issues that need to be looked at are the health advice, which must be the priority advice, and skills with regard to risk assessment and risk management, logistics, human resources and the various sectors being considered for opening up.  My understanding is there is no body in which those skills exist.</p>  <p>  We do not know the basis for the very big decisions being taken.  They are life changing.  They impact people's lives, livelihoods and futures, their psychological and physical health and many other aspects of their existence.  Because the Government does not provide a rationale for these decisions, it is hard to keep people with it.</p> <p>It is hard for the public to understand why the Government is saying certain sectors can open and others cannot.</p> <p> For example, looking at what would appear to be some illogical decisions that have been taken, why is it that the construction industry and big construction sites can open up?  It does not make sense and people who understand how the construction industry works would say this is high-risk stuff.  We also heard the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, yesterday referring to the fact that the construction industry had pushed and pushed to get an early opening.  Is that how decisions are taken?  Is it the case that powerful lobby groups have access to Ministers?  Is that what it is about?  How is it decided?  Another powerful interest group is the horse racing industry.  I gather that it has been successful in its lobbying to get horse racing opening sooner than had been planned.  We now see a clamour from vintners looking for pubs and bars to be opened earlier.  What is the basis on which decisions are being taken?  I raised this with the Chief Medical Officer the other day.  We had a discussion about risk assessment.  Obviously, the health expertise is in the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  They have access to a certain amount of mathematical expertise also.  However, the CMO made it very clear that the decisions on particular sectors are taken by the sectoral groups, Government Departments.</p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach that he needs to be much more forthcoming and transparent about the basis on which decisions are taken.  I referred the other day to what happened in Denmark in terms of reopening the schools, where a complete risk assessment was carried out of the impact of opening schools and the impact on the R-nought number, for example.  It was estimated that it would go up slightly initially but would come back down.  Everybody understood that and teachers, teachers' unions, education authorities, health authorities and everyone understood what they were embarking upon.  They were all signed up to it and it appears to have worked well.  There is none of that kind of transparency here around the Taoiseach's decision-making.  It is really important that he is much more open and that he explains the basis on which decisions are taken rather than there being the suspicion that they may be a result of political pressure.</p> <p> The Taoiseach also referred to the schools.  I am very familiar with what is happening with schools in the UK, which continued to open.  They catered for the children of front-line workers, health workers in particular but also supermarket workers.  They catered for children where there were welfare concerns and for children with special needs.  The numbers that actually came in were quite small but services were provided for them.  They were provided by a mixture of teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and childcare workers.  In the main, that has served very well.  Why was that approach not taken here and why can we not do it at this point?  Certainly there are going to be a lot of problems relating to children with special needs, children at risk and children who are possibly being minded by other children at home in unsatisfactory circumstances.  There is also the whole question of children missing out on the social and educational benefits of attending school.  We had a situation where it was stated by the Taoiseach that the leaving certificate was definitely going to take place.  Then it was a case of maybe it will take place and then it was a case that it did not have to be done.  All of these things, the speculation and thinking aloud, results in an emotional roller-coaster for our schoolchildren.  It has been a very tough time for them.  For that and so many other reasons, I call on the Taoiseach to be absolutely clear about the evidence he is using for decisions around this and that he ensures there is adequate risk assessment and continuous risk management.  We may have to take steps backwards depending on what happens with the virus.  I urge the Taoiseach to do so.</p> <p>I am not expecting a detailed reply but perhaps the Taoiseach will just acknowledge the points I have made.</p></speech>

We do have a plan for reopening the economy and society.  It is published and is being implemented.  It is also, however, a living document that can be amended, updated and clarified as we go on.  That is what is happening.  Ultimately, any decisions made on reopening the country, the economy and society are made by Government on foot of advice from NPHET.</p>  <p>  I would not rule out the idea of having a task force, but by their very nature task forces are non-statutory.  They may be made up of very capable people, but by their definition they are advisory, have no legal personality, cannot hire staff and cannot enter into contracts.  The decisions are made by Government in the end.  There is much ongoing consultation.  There is, for example, much consultation with unions through ICTU and with the employer bodies, such as the Construction Industry Federation and IBEC, which is where the protocol came from that enabled many businesses to open in recent weeks.  It was the unions and employers coming together with the Government.  On Friday we produced three papers, and not just the public health advice from NPHET.  There was also an economic analysis and a social analysis, and we propose to do that ongoing.</p>  <p>  I accept that there are other models.  I have looked at the model in Belgium, where they have a group of experts in charge of the exit strategy, GEES, which comprises people from different backgrounds who advise the Government on its reopening plan.  I do not rule out doing that.  We may yet decide to go down that road of having an advisory body different from NPHET that is made up of multidisciplinary advisers, as Deputy Martin would describe it.  We do, however, need to be realistic about it in that there will still be lobbying and there will still be political pressure from different sources.  Decisions will still be contested.  One of the biggest problems we have in all of this, which is true in Denmark too, is that there is not an awful lot of evidence because this is a new virus and is a pandemic the likes of which we have not seen for 100 years.  All the models are only models and all the evidence is pretty weak.  This is the truth of what we are dealing with. </p></speech>

In the short time that I have I will zone in on two of these groups.</p>  <p>  With regard to the arts sector, &euro;6.5 billion is being given to big business in grants and supports.  The arts, on which we have depended more than ever in recent months, got &euro;1 million, which is pathetic.  This industry faces a bleak, if any, future in the short to medium term and yet we can only come up with &euro;1 million.  Will the Taoiseach agree to a national campaign for the arts sector demands for &euro;20 million in extra funding for this year and next year, to extend the Covid-19 payment to those who were denied it because they were not working on 6 March, to continue that payment at least until these sectors recover, and to use our national broadcaster to give particular support to musicians and artists?</p></speech>

On the &euro;6.5 billion for business, what the Deputy said is a little misleading.  That is for business and incudes the arts and entertainment sector.  I appreciate that everyone in arts and entertainment is not a business but many are.  It is also a huge industry and of course that &euro;6.5 billion is also open to them.  The &euro;1 million provided was for particular projects through the Arts Council of Ireland.  There is a huge amount of resources that arts, entertainment and leisure businesses can draw on, just like any other business can.</p></speech>

It is a stark contrast.</p>  <p>  The taxi driving industry has been absolutely decimated, with 70% to 80% of people off the road.  The Taoiseach may be interested to know that of the few taxi drivers who are still on the road, many are over the age of 66.  This is because the Government has denied them the Covid-19 payment.  They are the most vulnerable group of taxi drivers but they are on the road because the Government will not give them the Covid-19 payment.</p> <p>As a result of this industry's link to mass gatherings, sports, tourism and the arts, which is similarly devastated and will be for the foreseeable future, they are in deep trouble.  I am asking again for a specific package of financial supports for taxi drivers, that the Covid payment be extended to taxi drivers who are over 66 and that it be retained as a minimum subsidy for taxi drivers, but that they be allowed to continue to work to top it up until their industry recovers at some unknown future point.  Will the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport agree to meet representatives from the different taxi representative groups who are coming together as we speak and who want to discuss with him the specific packages and supports they need to keep 23,000 taxi drivers with some sort of livelihood for the future?</p></speech>

Given the fact that some people may have dependants, many of those in receipt of the State pension, contributory or non-contributory, will actually get more than &euro;350.  That option is there for people who need it.  What we are not doing is paying people the pension as well as the pandemic unemployment payment.  That would be two benefits.</p>  <p>  Almost all taxi drivers are self-employed.  Anyone who is self-employed whose income has dropped is entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment.  I suspect there are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of taxi drivers who are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  They are entitled to that and they should get it until such time as they are able to get going again.  I agree that the sector will need help.  I do not know exactly what will have to be done but I imagine it will require an adaptation of the cars in some way, perhaps by putting screens between the back and front or something of that nature.  I do not know.  I certainly would welcome an engagement between the Minister, Shane Ross, and the sector to work out what needs to be done to allow taxis to get moving again, what work would be carried out and how we might help to co-fund it with them.</p></speech>

Kepak has 650 workers there, of whom more than 120 tested positive for Covid-19 last week.  All over the world, meat plants are hot spots for Covid.  In the United States, where President Trump has come in for particularly sharp criticism, more than 10,000 meat workers have been affected and at least 30 have died.  That international criticism has been justified, but the USA has 100 times the number of meat plants that we have.  Ireland, with 860 infected workers, has an infection rate per meat plant more than eight times greater than that of the disgraced USA.</p>  <p>  On Friday morning last, in a riveting piece of radio, RT&Eacute;'s Brian O'Connell reported on meat workers working shoulder to shoulder and on top of one another.  He interviewed two immigrant meat workers who told the nation that workers at their plant with high temperatures had been sent home but were told to come in the next day.  No PPE had been distributed until very recently.  The workers did the interviews with voice-overs for fear of losing jobs and accommodation.  Gerry McCormack of SIPTU has said this problem in the industry is more generalised.  He has spoken of some employers as having "ignored completely the recommendations from the HSE on how to do physical distancing".</p>  <p>  Here is an industry with a low-paid, largely immigrant workforce that has been run like a dictatorship, with workers treated little better than modern-day slaves.  In Northern Ireland, meat workers were forced to walk off the job at Linden Foods, Moy Park, APB and the Foyle Food Group just to secure improved health and safety.  Here is an industry that needs to be run under workers' control.  Workers' control of the meat industry would give far greater priority to workers' health, safety and lives.  Can anyone seriously doubt that infection rates would be lower, possibly far lower, in the meat industry if it were to operate under workers' control?</p>  <p>  The virus has been ripping through meat plants for at least a month.  When was the first inspection of a meat plant carried out in this crisis by an officer of the Health and Safety Authority?</p> <p>We know that zero inspections had been done by last Wednesday.  The HSA spokeswoman seemed to imply at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that the first inspection may only have been done last Monday.  Why was there such a shocking delay?  Did the Government fear treading on the toes of the meat plant bosses, even as their workers suffered?  What alternative explanation can the Taoiseach provide?</p> <p> Does the Taoiseach agree that when a cluster is found in a meat plant, not only must every worker and his or her family be tested but work must stop at that plant until such time as the tests are complete?  Does he also agree that any worker forced to take time off for this reason should receive full pay in the interim?</p></speech>

It is not the approach we take in healthcare, for example, or in many parts of the public service.  If somebody tests positive, we do not shut down the hospital in question, the D&aacute;il or wherever.  I am not sure we would apply to meat plants that approach of shutting everything down if one person tests positive while testing everyone in his or her family.  That is not an approach we have applied anywhere else that I am aware of and it is not one we would apply in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The answer to the Deputy's question, therefore, is probably "No" but I will ask for some guidance on that from the public health authorities.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's fourth question, the rules that apply to people who work in meat factories are the rules that apply to everyone else.  If anyone is required to take time off to self-isolate, he or she qualifies for the pandemic illness benefit payment of &euro;350 per week.</p></speech>

Our debt of gratitude to our front-line and community healthcare workers grows ever greater.</p>  <p>  I want to update the House on some people from Waterford who are supporting our national efforts to overcome the many challenges the coronavirus epidemic is presenting every day.  I thank Commandant Dr. Patrick Kelly of the Irish Defence Forces.  Dr. Kelly is an expert in infectious disease management and has been supporting my office in recent weeks in assisting implementation of large industry back-to-work protocols.  I thank the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation for their support and assistance in these matters.</p>  <p>  I commend Ambassador Daniel Mulhall.  Through close co-operation over a number of weeks with the consul general in Atlanta, Mr. Shane Stephens, Ambassador Mulhall and the British Consulate General, along with my office, secured the repatriation yesterday to Ireland of four Irish nationals.  These citizens had suffered weeks of arduous lockdowns on ships off the coast of the United States, with no immediate prospect of returning to Ireland.  I thank Ambassador Mulhall for his services in this matter.</p>  <p>  I thank hospital management at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, for their continuing efforts in Covid-19 activity.  Further to my request some weeks ago in this House, they directed the UHW south east regional pathology laboratory to facilitate the analysis of covid swabs to be taken in our residential care settings.  This has enabled test results to be turned around in less than 48 hours and is assisting greatly in keeping nursing homes in Waterford largely free of Covid-19.  Additionally, further to support I requested and received from the Minister for Health, I can confirm that significant initiatives in medical device and PPE development by our applied materials technology gateway at Waterford Institute of Technology are in development and are being supported by the HSE.  Furthermore, business promoters in Waterford. who wish to remain anonymous, are playing a major part in assisting large volume specification approved PPE purchases in China, which are helping to protect our front-line healthcare workers.</p>  <p>  Waterford and the south east are giving much to the national effort but a significant issue remains to be clarified with respect to our national standing and treatment.  In recent days, the modular cardiac catheterisation lab in place since 2017, providing diagnostic angiogram services, has been removed from University Hospital Waterford, leaving the entire population of the south east of 500,000 people entirely dependent on one operational catheterisation lab being operated in the UPMC Whitfield private hospital.</p> <p>The people of the south east have yet again been pushed back to 2016 operational standards.  I refer to having one catheterisation laboratory for 39 hours per week in a supposedly nationally designated cardiac care centre dealing with acute heart attacks.  The 14-year-old main catheterisation laboratory in University Hospital Waterford was scheduled for a four-month refit, which has been stopped because of Covid-19 infection control protocols.  UPMC Whitfield recently installed and commissioned its laboratory in eight weeks.  Our remodification is scheduled for 14 weeks, which will now probably be 20 weeks.</p> <p> A second catheterisation laboratory, which the Government promised on 18 September 2018, saying it would be built under a 13-month programme, has not yet been cleared even for a pre-qualification listing for construction tender award.  I could make five telephone calls here today and find five contractors who are pre-qualified to do the work.  It is fair to say that if political capital in Waterford were counted in currency, it would currently constitute a bucket of escudos.</p> <p> Questions I asked the Minister for Health on these issues in this House on 24 April remained unanswered until about five minutes ago, when I received a communication from my office to the effect that a statement had come in from the Minister.  Funnily enough, it is dated 14 May.  I welcome the press release that was issued two days ago through one of the Fine Gael Senators.  It states that, with respect to the development of a second catheterisation laboratory at UHW, it is anticipated "the project will go to tender before late July."  I am anticipating a three-course meal at home this evening when I return to Waterford but given that my wife works full-time and I have three young children, I would say I have little chance of getting it.  The timeline being discussed is 22 months after the initial announcement.  Must we conclude that we may anticipate the reactivation of the refurbishment of our existing catheterisation laboratory also in the coming months?</p> <p> May I bring the Taoiseach back to a statement he made in Waterford on 31 July 2017 at the opening of the extension to Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb, where he was speaking on the issue of educational healthcare?  There he said that for as long as he was Taoiseach, Waterford would not be neglected or forgotten.  I am asking him now to act on this fine sentiment, which he so clearly expressed and which he expressed as someone with deep roots in Waterford.  Will he instruct his Department to take responsibility for and oversee both the remodification timelines for the existing catheterisation laboratory at UHW and the project execution in respect of the second permanent catheterisation laboratory facility?</p> <p> Will his Department also oversee the equitable expansion of cardiac resources at the Waterford centre?  We know from three years of recent HSE ambulance data that just 1.5% of heart attack patients transferred to regional centres when the Waterford centre is closed arrive within the clinical timeframe.  This means 98.5% do not.  The people of the south east have waited long enough to have this national centre placed on par with the other five regional cardiac care centres in the country.  Will the Taoiseach, during the remaining term of the Government, ensure steps are taken immediately to approve and mandate the delivery of what has been promised to us and is required by us and in so doing provide some redress for the inequality and capacity constraint in the regional cardiac service in the south east?</p></speech>

In particular, I echo his words of thanks to that great Waterfordman Dan Mulhall, our ambassador in the United States, who has done a lot of work getting people safely home.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, my Department is made up of 150 civil servants.  While they are great people, I am afraid they just do not have the wherewithal to take on the project management of specific projects, be they associated with catheterisation laboratories, motorways or other infrastructural works.  It is, however, a matter in which I have an interest.  I am as frustrated as the Deputy and, indeed, Senator Cummins over how difficult it has been to get the second catheterisation laboratory built in Waterford and how slow the process has been.  I will continue to pursue it in the term of this Government, and the next if I am part of it.  I know the Deputy will also.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that there has not been a break in continuity for cardiology patients in UHW.  The new catheterisation laboratory in the Whitfield is welcome and ensures there is a more stable solution while we await the building of the second laboratory in the university hospital.</p>  <p>  A further consultant interventional cardiologist is in the final stages of recruitment through the Public Appointments Service.  The HSE advises me that an additional interventionist will allow for a seven-day service from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the existing catheterisation laboratory.  Interviews for this position took place on 27 January so I hope it will come to fruition.</p> <p> The South/South West hospital group has advised that the existing cath lab is being prioritised for upgrading.  This decision was based on an assessment conducted by the national clinical head of medical devices on the history and age profile of the equipment in the lab and a number of incidents of equipment failure in 2019.  It advises that a number of options were explored and that, following this exercise, it was agreed by all stakeholders to work in partnership with UPMC Whitfield and reach a service level agreement to use its newly constructed cath lab in Waterford for the duration of the upgrade.  The Minister for Health is proceeding with the provision of a second cath lab in Waterford based on the HSE's preferred option for its location and operation.  As set out in the appraisal, the preferred option is for a second cath lab associated with a 12-bed day ward delivering six additional beds on the roof of the existing cardiology department, which will operate five days a week and provide diagnostic services.</p> <p> The HSE has advised that funding was allocated in the 2019 capital plan for the provision of the second cath lab in Waterford.  That money was carried over to 2020 and on 9 January planning permission was received by Waterford City and County Council.  The HSE further advises that preparation of the contract documents has now commenced, contractor selection is under way, the tender will be complete by the end of July and it is expected that construction will commence in October with a ten to 12-month programme.  The HSE notes that the works and schedules were delayed due to Covid-19.  That is the updated position.  I know that Deputy Shanahan, other Deputies from Waterford and Senator Cummins will pursue the matter.  Given that this has taken so long, I fully appreciate that nobody in Waterford will believe it will happen until it does happen, but I will continue to take an interest in and pursue the matter.</p></speech>

We are lucky we have a person from a medical background in that position.</p>  <p>  For the past nine years, however, the Government has forgotten about rural Ireland.  When the pandemic hit, rural Ireland did not forget about us.  It kept food and drink on our tables and has kept us going through the pandemic.  Yesterday has gone, today is here and tomorrow has not come.  How do we get our businesses and our country up and running again?  Let us move forward.  There are 39 constituencies in Ireland, 11 of which are in Dublin, and 19 seats in 26 constituencies outside of Dublin were filled by Independents in the most recent general election.  What does this tell us?  We all know Dublin is the capital, but Limerick is my capital.  I want to work with the Government and with others.  People may come to Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il looking for positions.  I do not want positions.  I want to help and I want to work.  I want direct access to Ministers.  I am for the betterment of Ireland.  I want Ministers positioned around the country, not just in Dublin, where there are at present seven Ministers.  I want the Government to listen to the people of rural Ireland.  I will sit down and work collectively with anyone, bringing a voice for rural Ireland.  Rural people live outside of areas with speed limits, in small towns such as Croom, Adare, Newcastle West and Kilmallock.  Once you leave the areas with speed limits, there is no rural broadband and there are no bus services.  People have to drive to work.</p>  <p>  I understand what is happening.  I am self-employed.  I am from a farming background.  I have been a member of Limerick City and County Council.  What has Covid-19 taught us?  It is that our broadband is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>We need a collective approach.  It is not viable in its present format.  It needs to be grand-aided.  We need to incentivise the private companies to look at the amber areas.  It is easy to target the profitable areas.  The information on amber areas in Ireland is well documented.  Companies are cherry-picking the areas that are profitable and leaving the areas that are not profitable.  They are massaging the figures.  Realistically, it does not add up.  How do we fix this?  The word here is "incentivise".  Why does the restart grant only cover companies with up to 50 employees?  A progressive hotel in Limerick has seen bookings decimated for the year ahead.  So much has been cancelled.  The hotel owners had hoped to have up to 100 people employed by Christmas.</p> <p> The World Health Organization recommends social distancing of 1 m.  Social distancing in Ireland is 2 m.  It would be very difficult to run a business or run hotels on this basis.  I would not like to see my dinner coming at me from a 2 m distance.  Some common sense is needed here.  We have all heard today how different countries are dealing with different things and how the Government is learning from different countries.  The World Health Organization has the distance at 1 m.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the most recent advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is 2 m.  The distance of 2 m is used in the United Kingdom and mostly across Europe as well.  I see in other countries like Australia and New Zealand they are talking about 1.5 m.  I see that the World Health Organization is talking about 1 m.  This is under review.  I think we all agree that getting the country going again would be far more practical, especially in schools and businesses, if it was 1 m rather than 2 m, but ultimately it is one of those things that is and should be a call for the Chief Medical Officer and the National Public Health Emergency Team.  While the Government makes the decisions, I believe there are some things that are pure public health advice and this is one we have to defer to the team on.  Having said that, I know the team considers evidence as it comes in and will be considering that matter as we go on.</p>  <p>  In defence of the outgoing Government as it approaches the end of its term, we established the Department of Rural and Community Development with a capital budget of &euro;1 billion.  We can really see that taking shape now on the ground.  Whether it is the town and village scheme, LEADER, CL&Aacute;R, rural recreation or greenways, we are really making a difference.  We signed the contract for the national broadband plan.  It had been promised forever but now it is actually happening.  It is a &euro;3 billion investment in rural Ireland.  It is the biggest investment in rural Ireland ever connecting more than 500,000 homes, farms and businesses to fibre over the course of the coming six or seven years.  That work is now under way.  It will be rolled out to approximately 100,000 premises per year.  It will take time to do but it is being done.  I hope that the new Government will not cancel that contract but will honour it and ensure that it gets done.  We got the road maintenance programme and the roads programme going again, including the local improvement scheme.</p>  <p>  What we were unable to do - I admit this - was to protect the incomes of farmers, especially beef farmers.  I very much regret that we were unable to do that but I believe that was largely due to factors well beyond our control.</p></speech>

The small-time business will struggle to survive this crisis, which is far greater than anything we have ever faced before.  People from business after business are contacting me daily,  I assume they are contacting other Deputies too.  They tell me they cannot see how they are going to survive, never mind reopen.</p>  <p>  Tourism is a major employer throughout this island.  The incoming Government must fully focus on a clear way forward.  People throughout the country and in my constituency who own restaurants, pubs or hotels are in contact with me daily, including people from Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty and all the way down at Crookhaven and Mizen Head.  They are asking me one question: when can they open?  How can they reopen taking into account social distancing?  Can they survive reopening a restaurant, pub, hotel or caf&eacute; with a handful of customers and still be expected to pay staff, rent, rates and every other overhead that can be thought of?  The reality is that if the Government will not concentrate a serious focus on tourism and on Ireland's capacity, then the consequences will be devastating for many years to come.</p>  <p>  Two weeks ago today in the D&aacute;il, I urged the Taoiseach to set up urgently a public tourism task force.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, he answered me positively by saying that he would support the task force being set up.  The announcement of the setting up of this task force was made yesterday and I welcome it.  Why, however, was there no board member from Cork announced?</p> <p>In the name of God, what is the mindset when every county where tourism is a major sector is represented but Cork is not?  It is right for these counties to be represented but Cork, a county that plays a massive role in tourism, has been dropped from the task force.  I ask the Taoiseach and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin to intervene and include a member from tourism sector in Cork on the task force.  Why has no member from the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, or the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, which employ over 50,000 people, been put on this task force?  What is wrong with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that it has failed to include two of the biggest contributors to tourism in this task force?</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach intervene and work with the Minister, Shane Ross, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, to right this wrong?  Let us all work together to rebuild tourism to its former glory in all sections of Ireland.  I am getting a large number of questions about tourism in west Cork and, unfortunately, we are not able to get answers.  I understand the pressure on Departments currently with respect to reopening, rules and directives but could F&aacute;ilte Ireland, an established tourism body, be put in charge of queries that are coming in daily from businesses that want to reopen?  It can lay out the required answers.</p> <p> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, announced in the past week there will be no driving tests for the foreseeable future.  This is terribly unfair to the young people in the country who want to attend jobs and college.  The Minister simply slammed the door but why did he not look at a road map as to when people might be able to sit their driving test?  Those who genuinely and urgently need to drive in rural communities, where there is no public transport, should be given a special emergency permit so they can drive to work or colleges until the end of the crisis.</p></speech>

I know she will do a really great job.  I remember when I was Minister with responsibility for tourism many years ago, the sector was going through a very bad patch but recovered very quickly.  It is an amazing and resilient industry and it can bounce back.  It is the industry that was hit first and worst, and it will be hit for the longest time.  It will need much Government support to get going again and I am determined that it will be put in place.  It can really only happen when tourism is possible again.  I am still optimistic that domestic tourism will be able to be resumed some time in July, with international tourism resuming later in the year.  It will be a bad year but I hope something can be salvaged and 2021 can be a good year again.</p>  <p>  As I understand the representation on the task force, nobody is there to represent a particular county, whether that is Dublin, Cork, Wexford or Donegal, and the people involved should not be thinking that way.  This is a tourism recovery task force for the entire country and not one particular county.</p></speech>

Beidh m&eacute; ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar ghas&uacute;ir le riachtanais faoi leith agus ar scoileanna speisialta at&aacute; d&uacute;nta le dh&aacute; mh&iacute; anuas anois.  Coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin, d&rsquo;ardaigh m&eacute; an cheist seo leis an Taoiseach.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ionraic agus mac&aacute;nta ag an am agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach raibh an litir l&eacute;ite aige.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuil s&iacute; l&eacute;ite aige anois.  I will not focus on golf today in any event but I will come back to it in a moment in discussing the voices that have been heard relating to golf, construction and vintners.  No voice is being heard on behalf of those with a disability.  I have often heard it said here that nobody has a monopoly on empathy, which is true, but the Taoiseach has a duty to demonstrate leadership.</p>  <p>  Two weeks ago I raised this matter with the Taoiseach and pointed to a letter he had received but he said he had not had the chance to read it.  It was redirected to the Taoiseach.  I understand he is busy and he has read it since.  I do not want to use my words so I will use my few sentences to describe the words that have been relayed to me.  The loss of skills being experienced by children and the regression into negative behaviour has been described as "heartbreaking".  It is a grim indictment of our nation that education and welfare appears to have been cast aside for six months, if we go to September, without any documented rationale or justification.  This goes back to Deputy Shortall's points on how decisions are made and whose voices are heard.</p> <p>A parent stated that the closure of the schools until September was nothing short of a disaster.  An Inclusion Ireland study has pointed out that home schooling is not working.</p> <p> I will provide three brief examples, the first of which is of a nine year old boy with autism.  We want to hear his voice in the D&aacute;il.  He is non-verbal and has serious functional issues.  When he finally got a place in a special school, he accelerated to being very functional.  His routine made him a smiley boy.</p> <p> Another parent has twin boys who are autistic.  One of them attends a special school.  He needs and breathes routine, structure and certainty.  Parents are living in their own unspoken or unacknowledged hell within the national pandemic.</p> <p> The final voice is of a parent whose son is 14 years old.  He has a diagnosis of autism with global developmental delay.  He is non-verbal and incontinent.  Directly as a consequence of no attendance at his special school for more than two months, he has become aggressive and self-harms from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed.  His hand is lacerated.  As soon as the wound is closed, he opens it up again.  He head bangs.  He breaks items and so on.  He has a sibling attempting to do the leaving certificate.</p> <p> What voice is there at Cabinet level and on NPHET for these children?  Having read the correspondence, I ask the Taoiseach for recognition of the problem and his agreement to a meeting with the parents who have written to him.  One has written on behalf of 60 parents.  Make our special schools an essential service.  Examine what has worked successfully elsewhere.  Seriously consider reinstating teachers, special needs assistants and so on.</p> <p> The Taoiseach mentioned July provision.  He has a minute to answer me.  Please do not mention July provision again.  I accept that it is going ahead and that the Government is looking to extend it.  What I want to know is what actions are being taken to open special schools.</p></speech>

I read the letter that she alerted me to and I have replied.  Actually, I have received many letters from parents of children with autism, with intellectual disabilities, with behavioural problems.  I know they are really distressed.  I am concerned about their welfare and I know they are, too.  They may not have a powerful lobby, but they do have a voice at Cabinet.  That voice is the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, the first Cabinet Minister for disabilities that we have had, Mr. Finian McGrath.

The Taoiseach stated that he would look into the matter.  In response to me yesterday, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Ms Doherty, told me that she was looking at amending the referral pathways.  That is important and good, but it addresses only 50% of the problem.  A part of the criteria for accessing this rent supplement is one's financial status and employment status.  Domestic violence is as likely to happen in a wealthy home as in a, let us say, poorer one.  Being a victim of domestic violence should itself be sufficient to access the emergency rent supplement.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Government completes the second half of the work?  I thank him for the first part.</p>  <p>  My second question brings me back to face coverings, which we have discussed for the past two weeks.  I was pleased with the Government's recommendations.  However, the numbers wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops are still low.  I did a back-of-the-envelope check.  Take the three weeks between phase 1 and phase 2 and assume the R number is 1, even though I know it is less.</p> <p>In that time, if wearing a face mask was to cut back the numbers infected by 10% that would mean that at the end of three weeks 50% fewer would be infected.  If the face mask did not work well and people did not follow protocols and only one in five wore a mask, 30% fewer would be infected.  Even if it was one in 100, it would be 7% fewer infected.  As part of a suite measures they are important.  Will the Taoiseach specifically strengthen his advice around face coverings?  I am not asking that they be mandatory but that the advice be strengthened.  Will the Taoiseach consider following the example of other countries and have face masks distributed free of charge to citizens?  Will he work with local groups and businesses to ramp up the production of face coverings?  Will he launch a public awareness campaign in regard to the homemaking of face coverings and will he consider their distribution on public transport?  Many people want to wear them but they might forget.  If they were distributed on public transport that might be part of the solution to increase capacity on public transport, which in two, three and four weeks' time will be a paramount issue.</p></speech>

I think everyone in the House appreciates that.  Rent supplement is not provided to people who can afford to pay their own rent or mortgage or buy their own home.  If we were to extend rent supplement to any group that does not need it for financial reasons that would be a big policy change and an expensive one and I am not sure it would be the right course of action, notwithstanding the very difficult individual circumstances that people may find themselves in.</p>  <p>  In terms of the advice on face coverings, there is new advice on face coverings that the Deputy will be aware of.  The advice is that people should wear face coverings on crowded public transport and in crowded indoor places like shops but it is not mandatory.  It is also strongly advised that people not see it as a substitute for hand washing, social distancing and all of the other actions.  This is very much one of those things that is a public health issue.  While people are entitled to offer their opinions, including Deputies and me, we have to be guided by the CMO and NPHET on something that is purely a matter of public health advice.  There is a public awareness campaign under way advising people when to use masks, how to use them, how to make them and so on and that will be stepped up.</p></speech>

It is concerning that the D&aacute;il debate he has refused to attend concerns the situation of meat factories, which appear to be operating to very different standards than those that were laid down before this House.  It is ironic that in this very controlled environment, politicians are being protected from attending for more than two hours-----</p></speech>

I am sure Deputy Carthy would like to stay and ask me some questions on the topic, although he is leaving the Chamber now.</p>  <p>  First and most important, I wish to express my sympathy to the family and friends of those that have been lost to this disease since I was last in this House.  I think of them today and every day, and I know all of us in this House, across parties and groupings, do.</p>  <p>  On Monday, we initiated phase 1 of our Roadmap to Reopen Society and Business.  We moved ahead on the basis of the clear public health advice that we received.  We did so knowing increased movement carries increased risk.  Our message remains stay at home, but we have eased some restrictions to allow more outlets and public spaces to open.  We were able to make that progress and move to phase 1 of the road map because of the actions of the people of Ireland.  As a country, we faced the reality that this highly infectious disease was among us and we responded to the threat from it.  We understood how quickly it can spread and how lethal it can be.  We heeded the advice and the evidence.  We learned what works and we set about doing it as a country together.  Our efforts and our sacrifices have pushed Covid-19 back but it is certainly and sadly not gone away.  If we do not stay smart it will come forward again in a resurgence. The progress made is contingent on our actions. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to once again report to the House that our modelling shows the R rate remains stable at around 0.5.  Work by Professor Philip Nolan&rsquo;s team shows it is between 0.45 and 0.63.  This means that for four weeks in a row, this number has remained significantly below 1.  Four weeks ago, our case numbers were in the region of 400 to 800 every day.  This week &ndash; for four days in a row - our cases numbers have been below 100.  This day last month, 774 people were in hospitals across our country with Covid-19.</p> <p>Today, 367 people are in hospital with coronavirus.  On 21 April, 132 people were in ICU.  Today, that number is 49.  Our recovery rate has reached 87.1% and I am pleased to confirm that 258 people have been discharged from intensive care.  We think of all of them.  Yesterday, I spoke to Tom, a wonderful man from Waterford who was discharged after spending 66 days in hospital.  He and his brother ended up in ICU and, thankfully, both have now been discharged.  I am sure Deputy Butler knows them.  We send our best wishes to them and to all those 258 people who are now getting their lives back on track.<br/><br/>Many people have become sick with this virus and many have lost their lives.  Let us never forget that and let us never forget them.  However, we have shown as a country that we can suppress the spread of this virus with the right measures.  Whether we are at home, at work or outside our homes for some essential reason, we need to keep washing our hands properly, covering our coughs and sneezes, respecting the important two-metre rule, staying away from crowds and heeding the new and important guidance on face coverings in certain places.  We must take it one step at a time.  We are only in phase 1.  Let us go forward and not risk going backwards. <br/><br/>I wish to update the House on certain important matters.  We know Covid-19 is going to be with us for some time.  This has consequences for every section of society and the health service is no different.  We all accept the need for and wish to see the recommencement of the delivery of non-Covid health services.  However, we all wish for that to be done in a manner that is safe and effective for patients and staff.  The HSE has now developed a clinical road map for the delivery of non-Covid services in a Covid environment in order to enable the safe and clinically appropriate reopening of services.  The road map outlines eight key principles that will be used to guide the reintroduction of all non-Covid services.  Those principles are equity, safety, based on need, long-term population benefit, clear and effective communication to patients, ensuring all healthcare staff are engaged and consulted, risk benefit analysis, and public health principles of pandemic management.  I am sure Deputies and the public know that getting back to normal will not mean going back to the way our health services were before coronavirus.  It needs to be understood that although we have this clinical road map, we will have to remain flexible and capable of responding to any changes in the behaviour of the virus.  The HSE intends to publish its plan for non-Covid health services in a Covid environment within two weeks. <br/><br/>On the issue of nursing homes, throughout the response to the pandemic there has been particular focus on the challenges in the nursing home sector.  The sector has been and remains an absolute priority for me.  All of the evidence indicates that we will continue to live with this virus and its impact for a long time to come.  I believe it is critical that we now take the opportunity to examine how things have evolved in nursing homes in Ireland and the measures we have adopted so far and to consider international experiences.  What are other countries doing?  Are there things they are doing better than us?  Are there things we can learn from them or<i>vice versa</i>?  We need to look at the approaches in other countries, identify examples of best practice and ensure we put them in place here.<br/><br/>We must continue to plan appropriately to meet the ongoing challenges of Covid-19 into the foreseeable future.  It is not just about getting on top of the nursing home situation today, although there has been good progress in that regard.  It must be about ensuring we maintain that vigilance.  Today, I announce the establishment of a Covid-19 nursing home expert panel to examine and advise on these matters.  It is a crucial aspect of good planning and a recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  It will support Ireland&rsquo;s navigation through the Covid-19 landscape and ensure the best possible safeguards are in place to protect the many people who call nursing homes their home.  The panel will have four members, a public health expert who will chair the group, a geriatrician, a senior nurse and a public interest representative.  I expect the group to do its work by the end of June such that we can share it with the House as we prepare for the weeks and months ahead.<br/><br/>I advise the House that I intend to update the Government tomorrow on further measures we intend to take in respect of travel, protecting our country and ensuring measures are in place at airports and ports.  All travellers who come through an airport or port, regardless of nationality, must fill out a passenger locator form.  They are asked to self-isolate for two weeks and provide the State with the address at which they will so do.  This is the land of c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  We love welcoming people to our country, but now is not the time for non-essential travel.<br/><br/>I will now address the matter of clusters of Covid-19 among employees of meat factories, as I stated I would.</p> <p>I am informed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, that as of 16 May there were 16 outbreaks in meat factories associated with 828 cases.  The HSE established a national outbreak control team and specific guidance has been issued to all meat factories.  I understand that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, also has an ability to inspect meat factories and all workplaces to ensure their compliance with the back-to-work protocols in place for Covid 19.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak with the chairperson of the HSE&rsquo;s national outbreak control team, Dr. Mai Mannix.  I thank Dr. Mannix and her team for their work.  Preliminary estimates from the team indicate that so far between 55% and 60% of employees in meat factories who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 have now recovered, thankfully, and have returned to work.  We wish all of them well.  NPHET will consider the issue of meat factories further at its meeting tomorrow.  I will await any advice or recommendations from NPHET and will share same with the public and this House.  Let me be very clear that if employees are unwell or have any symptoms of this virus, they must not go to work and should contact their GP to seek advice and a test.  If people cannot self-isolate, measures can be put in place to ensure that they can do so.  We are using our facility at City West in this regard.<br/><br/>Last week in this House, Deputy Naughton expressed concerns in relation to how test results were being relayed to employers.  The Chief Medical Officer, CMO, has clearly highlighted the importance of patient confidentiality and I very much share that view.  The HSE has now made it clear that this practice is not to continue pending engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner and any other relevant regulator or authority.  I have also written to the HSE seeking more information and a report on this matter. <br/><br/> There is no part of our country and no age group that has been untouched by this disease.  It is important to say that because sometimes people think this is a virus that visits others, people in a certain age group or with a certain condition.  We know that some people are more vulnerable to a bad outcome from this virus but the latest figures that I want to share with the House show that out of the total number of Covid-19 cases in Ireland, in 16,064 or 58.6% there was no health underlying condition.  In other words, 58% of the people who got Covid-19 did not have an underlying condition and were not otherwise ill.  Despite the power of this virus and the suffering it has caused across the world, this country has gone to great lengths together and we have managed to contain it.  As our circumstances change and our society and economy reopen, we must stay focused on what we have learned and continue to practise it every day.  It is in all of our hands.  We all need to make sure we do everything we can to successfully move from phase 1 to phase 2 and to find that sweet spot where we can safely live alongside this virus.  We need to stay with the evidence and the clear public health advice that we have been given.  We ask everyone in this country to stick with us, stay at home, stay safe and protect each other. </p></speech>

I thank the Minister.  I will take five minutes, three of which I will use to ask questions, leaving two minutes for the Minister to respond.  My focus will be on the mental health, disability and intellectual disability sectors.  I pay tribute to all of the front-line staff working in these sectors as well as to families and carers.  I also sympathise with and offer my condolences to those families who have lost loved ones since I spoke here last week.</p>  <p>  Last week, I raised the dire warnings issued by the WHO and the UN about a looming mental health crisis and what is sometimes referred to as the third and fourth wave of a pandemic.  On 23 April, I secured agreement from the Minister for the establishment of a high-level mental health task force that would include experts and patient representatives.  The establishment of such a task force is essential.  It is critically important to bring together experts and patient representatives who can take an overarching view of what we need in terms of mental health in dealing with the Covid crisis and the other issues in mental health over the next year, including the lack of a director of mental health.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on the establishment of the mental health task force.  In terms of any mental health task force, a programme for Government or anything else connected with mental health, the publication of the refreshed A Vision for Change is essential.  I appreciate that it may not be normal practice for a Government in the current situation to publish a Government policy document but there is broad agreement across the House that it should be published and I ask that this be done.</p>  <p>  Many people with disabilities, both physical and intellectual, may be cocooning for the next year or more until a vaccine is found.  Day services, respite care and community supports have all effectively come to an end.  Parents and family members are exhausted.  I can hear the stress in the voices of the people ringing my office.  </p> <p>Patients are also becoming distressed due to the break in routine.  If there are underlying conditions, how is the education of those with intellectual disabilities going to continue in the next year or so?  What supports will be put in place in terms of minimising the community and social isolation they are going to experience for quite a time?  There is also the economic impact for people with physical or intellectual disabilities who have been in the workforce.  Much good progress has been made in that area but it is going to slip back.  There will be regression in rehabilitation because the supports cannot be kept up to the previous level as a result of prolonged cocooning.</p> <p> A cross-departmental strategy needs to be put in place because the issue is going to affect education, economic well-being, social well-being and mental health well-being, as well as physical supports.  Perhaps some sort national plan needs to be put place and I would ask the Minister to comment on that.</p> <p> There are more than 1,500 young people with a physical disability in nursing homes or congregated settings but these are not appropriate settings and their families are very concerned to have them in those settings.  A policy needs to be put in place in regard to housing and health to get those people back into the community, so they can be taken care of and take care of themselves. </p></speech>

It is timely because, yesterday, I spent much of the day meeting, at the request of Deputy Shortall, the Disability Action Coalition, Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, which work with and represent people with intellectual disabilities and their service providers.  They have done an incredible job in terms of both managing Covid and managing or limiting the spread of infection through their facilities.  I had an opportunity to pay tribute to them and their staff, who have really stepped up to the plate.  They told me about a new way of working with the HSE.  It is unprecedented that they are working in such close partnership and there is a big eagerness on their part not to go backwards and to keep that relationship going.  I also got that very strongly from Dr. Cathal Morgan of the HSE.</p>  <p>  On the issue of disability and education, I share the Deputy's view that many children and others are out of school settings and other educational settings for a significant period, and perhaps they have not had access to health services or educational services.  As the Taoiseach indicated, the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and I are doing some work on supports we might be able to put in place over the summer for that group.  I will come back to Deputy Browne very shortly, once the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and I have bottomed that out. </p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of isolation, I was very impressed by the use of technology by these organisations in terms of ensuring that even if the person could not go directly into a house, they were still having their Zoom classes or the like, which is something we need to keep up.  However, we also need to look at how we can restore the in-reach visits in a safe manner.</p>  <p>  When I referenced the non-Covid care plan that the HSE is due to publish within two weeks, I am very clear that it is not just a non-Covid care plan for the hospitals but that it also has to be a non-Covid care plan for communities.  Dr. Colm Henry and Anne O'Connor, the chief operations officer of the HSE, are leading on that and I expect some of the answers to the Deputy's questions on how we safely resume those services to feature in it. </p>  <p>  With regard to A Vision for Change, it is ready go to Government and it is my view that the new Government should own and embrace that policy.  I am open to a discussion across parties in that regard, maybe at a level above my pay grade. </p>  <p>  On the issue of the task force, I am looking for clarity in regard to whether the Oireachtas wishes to establish it or whether the Deputy wishes to see a task force established within my Department.</p></speech>

In a Covid world, this is going to have a dramatic impact on our healthcare system and reduce the number of patients who can be seen.  As the Secretary General said, it will cost more and take longer to do less.  Hospital bed occupancy will drop from near 100% to 80%, which is the equivalent of losing about 2,000 public beds.  The plan was to go from 10,000 beds to 12,600 over five years under Sl&aacute;intecare.  Instead, we are going from 10,000 to 8,000 in about two months.  Radiologists tell me they will be able to scan about half the number of patients, so a sick child in need of an MRI who has already been told they will have to wait two years, in this world, will actually end up waiting four years.  Outpatients' consultants have said they can see about half the number of people in any given session.  Before Covid arrived, we had the longest waiting times in Europe to see these consultants.</p> <p>In the new world if they can see half the number of patients in the same time, the waiting times would double.  The pain, suffering and loss of life at this level of reduced capacity is almost unfathomable.  We could be looking at a level of loss of life many times more than we already see, tragically, from Covid-19.  Opportunities such as telemedicine have been referenced when I have raised this issue with the HSE but based on the scale of the challenge we need a root-and-branch review of how we will deal with this to ensure that not only does capacity not decrease by 20% to 50% but actually increases to deal with the lists.  To this end, has a task force been set up?  If so, has there been any progress?  If not, is that something the Minister will consider doing as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100031#GG00200"><p>The short answer is that, yes, it is something I consider doing as a matter of urgency but there is work under way in respect of it.  The Deputy is entirely correct.  Our clinical experts believe we are going to need to keep bed occupancy in our public health service at approximately 80% to 85%.  That is what it should normally be but we know that this has not been the norm in Ireland.  We need to keep it at approximately 80% to 85% as long as we are living alongside Covid.  Let us be honest, we would all like to keep it there going forward.  The Secretary General said here in the Chamber at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response the other day that we cannot go back to the situation with people being left on trolleys.  This is not because the trolleys are undesirable, although they are, but because of the infection control issues that arise.  There are real challenges.</p>  <p>  One of the discussion points we are going to have to have is about how we look at the extra capacity we have put into the public health service and how we look at partnering and utilising private bed occupancy.  By the way, even if we park ideology there are different ways in which we can we can arrive at that.  There is a review built into the private hospital agreement at the end of May to run for 30 days and there will be a discussion for the current or new Government in this regard.</p>  <p>  With regard to outpatients, I genuinely think there is a huge opportunity for reform in the context of measures such as virtual clinics.  We know that in Ireland many people go to outpatient clinics who would, if they were in other countries, see allied healthcare professionals in primary care centres.  Much of what the Sl&aacute;intecare report includes that we have temporarily set up for Covid needs to become the new norm.  The short answer is the executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare office in the Department of Health is analysing where we are at with regard to the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, what good has happened in Covid-19 that we want to bank and keep and what other things perhaps have fallen behind or are new challenges.  The board of the HSE is also considering these issues from a strategic point of view and I expect both pieces of work to be completed over the summer months.</p></speech>

I understand that we are also making our plans here.  It is imperative that nursing homes, residential homes and care homes be given much higher status when these plans are being drawn up.  I welcome what the Minister announced in his opening speech, that there will be a nursing home expert panel.  I have a question on the make up of that panel.  The Minister stated that the chair would be a public health expert and that there would also be a geriatrician, a senior nurse and a public interest representative involved.  May I assume this will mean that somebody from Nursing Homes Ireland or from that area of expertise would be on the panel?  We have noted that Nursing Homes Ireland was not represented on NPHET.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday, at the meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, I questioned Dr. Colm Henry on the resumption of cancer screening services, which is a huge concern.  I was disappointed with his answer because he said it is far too early to say when the screening programme will be back up and running and that the screening services will be focused on symptomatic patients in the short term.  The Minister has also given us information that a clinical road map will be put in place for non-Covid care in a Covid environment.  May I assume that the resumption of cancer screening services, particularly BreastCheck and CervicalCheck, will be included in that road map?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100031#GG00400"><p>I thank the Deputy Butler.  On the nursing homes, I have informed Nursing Homes Ireland of this expert panel and we will certainly have an opportunity for it to input.  There will be many stakeholders from which the expert panel will need to hear.  I do not intend to have people from representative bodies on it but it is important that there is a way for those bodies to have an input.</p>  <p>  When we look at other countries the world over, we put a lot of measures in place in Ireland for nursing homes that other countries did not but, equally, we know we have seen a very difficult situation in nursing homes.</p> <p>I want to know if there are more things we can do here based on best international experience.  I want to bring those experts together.  We are not just going to have to deal with Covid for a couple of days or a couple more weeks now.  We may well have to go through a winter period and maybe beyond that.  What do we need to do and learn in that regard?  It is about doing a comprehensive but quick piece of work that is back to us by the end of June so that we can plan.</p> <p> On screening services, I absolutely get the importance of this.  The HSE is currently developing capacity planning for the ongoing delivery of Covid-19 and non-Covid care services side by side.  They will obviously examine the issue of screening as part of their non-Covid care plan.  I want to be in a position to recommence our population screening programmes as soon as possible.  It has to be safe for patients and staff.  None of us disagrees on that.  As we all appreciate, screening can involve tests and examinations which present particular challenges for the staff running the programmes in terms of physical distancing issues.  There are a lot of challenges there but there will be a lot of challenges in many sectors.  We need to plan and know how we are going to recommence it.  I make the point, though, that I think Dr. Henry was making in respect of symptomatic patients.  Nobody needs to wait for screening.  If you are symptomatic today, go forward.  That is not in any way to demean the value of our screening programmes but I urge those who are symptomatic today to contact their GP.  I expect with the framework document the HSE will publish within two weeks that it will outline its plans in respect of screening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100032#HH00200"><p>I want to ask about information.  How much is being spent on information campaigns during the coronavirus crisis?  I have to ask if the message is actually getting through.  Anyone who passed the canal earlier this week would have seen that it was like a bank holiday weekend.  I was contacted last night by a worker on a construction site who said social distancing was not being applied at all.  Front-line workers are telling me people are not going to hospitals for fear of the virus.  Why is this?  Why do people believe our hospitals are somehow unsafe?  The suspension of smear tests and other diagnostics have sent the message that if someone has a symptom, he or she is not safe to be tested.  There are people at home desperately afraid to contact their GP.  Why is this?  It is not right.  The message should be that anyone who needs healthcare should get it, not because of how much money they have in their wallet or whatever.  It is about getting the service.  Is it because compared to other countries we have incredibly high rates of the virus among our healthcare workers?  We have to get the message through that our staff are protected and our hospitals are safe.  Every mistake we make now, we pay for in lost lives and years of repercussions.</p>  <p>  I want to ask why there is not a public campaign regarding an illness associated with the coronavirus in children called Kawasaki disease, which can be triggered by Covid-19 in under fives and can be fatal.  There are already 100 cases of it in New York and the Italian doctors reported a 30-fold increase in cases.  I know lots of things can change in the pandemic but doctors and nurses are aware of this rare disease and there is little information on it.  Why?  The public needs to know what to look out for so they can get treatment if they need it.  This is of huge concern to me.  On people with disabilities, as the Minister knows, a few months back there was a 1% decrease in funding for children with disabilities across the board.  That has to be reversed.  Children with disabilities need to have the funding and we to make sure that we resource the most vulnerable children in our society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100032#HH00300"><p>I want to ask the Minister about smear testing, not specifically about screening but about women who are symptomatic and who have come forward.  I have been contacted by a number of them in the past week.  They did as the Minister has previously advised.  They were symptomatic, they were concerned and they went to their GPs.  Their GPs are telling them now that the labs are not accepting the smear tests.  I fully appreciate this was not the Minister's intention when he gave the advice but they are being told that the labs are not accepting the smears.  In some instances, the GPs are taking the test and saying they will hang onto it until such stage as they can send it forward, while others are telling women they appreciate they are symptomatic but there is nothing they can do because the labs are not accepting the smears.  I ask the Minister please to investigate this because as we have discussed before, some 21,000 screening tests are going to be missed.  There has to be a catch-up programme but in the intervening time there has to be help for these women.</p>  <p>  We have 41 days left on the private hospital deal.  Where do things stand at the moment?  It is an extraordinary deal.  I do not necessarily think it is going to represent great value for money in the outturn but I fully understand why the capacity was needed.</p> <p>Will the Minister indicate how many surgeries or procedures have been carried out in private hospitals, broken down by specialty?  I have asked for this previously.  It is important that we see this information.</p> <p> I received figures on the average occupancy of these private hospitals.  According to the information I have, the Bon Secours Hospital in Limerick was occupied for an average of 1% since the deal was signed.  I put it to the Minister that there are people on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  That cannot be allowed to continue when there is spare capacity just down the road.  Will the Minister outline the information he has on that matter?</p> <p> I welcome confirmation that advice will be forthcoming with regard to air and sea ports.  That guidance and advice will be very welcome.  NPHET has recommended, however, that passenger locator forms are filled out.  I am not sure how diligently this is being attended to.  My information from people working in the airport is that it is a little hit and miss.  We are aware that people do not have to fill out these forms.  Has the Minister been apprised of how many people are filling out these forms?  Is he aware if the follow-up phone calls, as mentioned by NPHET, are taking place?  How many such phone calls have been made?  Is the information communicated to his office or to the HSE?</p> <p> Will the Minister consider working with managers in local authorities to source and supply mobile homes for self isolation for preventative accommodation for members of the Traveller community?  I ask this because we have just been made aware that there is a very high rate of infection, with one in every four Travellers tested being Covid-19 positive.  These people urgently need accommodation to self-isolate if required.  They want to do the right thing - and the Minister is aware that they have said this publicly - but they cannot do so without assistance.  I ask that he work with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and with local authorities to ensure this assistance is provided.</p> <p> Money is still owed to nurses in Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Letterkenny, Limerick and the south east.  This is money the Minister has agreed to pay to them.  In addition, the expert group on pay for nurse managers, which is due to report at the end of the month, has not even held its first meeting.  It is all very well to stand here at 8 p.m to give them a round of applause, which is very much appreciated, but those nurses went on strike and won the money that is now withheld from them.  It is not fair and it is not tenable.  We have already spoken about the upstairs-downstairs attitude that sometimes exists.  Members of this House received a pay increase.  I did not accept mine and I think many, most or all of my colleagues did not accept theirs.  Our pay increase came as a matter of course.  The nurses won this money.  Will the Minister please ensure it is paid to them without delay?</p></speech>

I might respond in writing to some of them.  I have a list of the breakdown for inpatient discharges, day cases, diagnostics and total outpatient figures relating to the private hospitals.  If I was to read it out, it would take up all of the time so I will send it to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I have an open mind regarding how we proceed with the utilisation of private hospitals beyond the current timeframe of the existing agreement.  I recognise, as does the Deputy, there will be a need to use that new capacity.  The question is what that arrangement and agreement would look like at a point in time where the pandemic is in a different place to the one we feared.  I will write to Deputy O'Reilly on that.</p>  <p>  Without getting ahead of the discussions I hope to have with Government colleagues tomorrow, at the moment the passenger locator form is on an administrative basis.

We are also keeping our Northern Ireland colleagues informed of our plans in that regard and we had a quad group meeting recently with the Deputy First Minister, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the T&aacute;naiste and my counterpart in the North.</p>  <p>  I will absolutely take away the issue relating to the Traveller community and work with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Development and his Department on it.  I will come back to the Deputy for more detail on that.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of symptomatic cancer patients.  I will certainly talk to those involved with the HSE's national cancer control programme today or tomorrow on that, and I will revert to the Deputy tomorrow.</p>  <p>  With regard to the enhanced nursing practice measure, the numbers are going up.  We need to get everybody paid.  The HSE has told me that there has been a situation where some people have been out of payroll offices and so on.  I will keep in close contact with the INMO on this.  We need to get to that point.</p> <p>It is money owing to them.  They won it, it was agreed to, and the money has been allocated and should be paid over.</p></speech>

Last week we had a brief discussion about Pieta House and the additional services that will be provided during and post Covid-19.  Will the Minister clarify whether the 300 hours that he stated will be provided for therapy for high-risk clients are per month or per quarter?</p></speech>

The funding is being provided to fund an additional 300 hours for high-risk clients and the quarterly review will ensure that any client who commences a programme of support can have reasonable assurance of its completion.  The cashflow supports are also contingent on a continuation between the HSE and Pieta House.  I will confirm that in writing to the Deputy but that is my understanding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100034#KK00400"><p>Last week the Minister stated there was additional funding of more than &euro;343,000 to provide 300 hours of therapy per quarter for high-risk clients.  I also have a written response from the Minister that reiterates that.  This works out at &euro;1,146 per hour for therapy sessions.  The average cost of a psychotherapy session is in the region of &euro;70 to &euro;120 per hour.  If, for example, 300 sessions were charged at the higher end of the average - &euro;120 per hour - that would cost the State &euro;36,000.  The State is paying Pieta House more than &euro;343,000 to provide the same service.  That is a difference of &euro;307,000 per quarter.</p>  <p>  I have also received information from some self-employed therapists who have contacted me and other members of my party and who counsel clients for Pieta House.  They charge them only &euro;24 per hour, yet the State is funding Pieta House to the tune of &euro;1,146 per hour.  The Government, as the Minister said, has already invested heavily in Pieta House, to the tune of &euro;2.03 million per year, and Pieta House has also availed of the wage subsidy scheme.  Despite this, several staff were let go and others have been offered redundancy.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister inform the House exactly where this funding is being directed?  Is any of the additional funding being used to pay for the redundancies?  Does the Minister think we are getting value for money at &euro;1,146 per therapy session when it would cost the State &euro;120 per hour, or &euro;24 per hour if a self-employed therapist at Pieta House was hired?  The State should provide such services and not rely on a charity to do so.  Pieta House provides an essential service but it is essential only due to the lack of investment in mental health by this and previous Governments.</p></speech>

I could outline, although I do not have the time now, what we are doing to beef up the public mental health services but I agree with the Deputy that Pieta House does a really good job.  It is very well regarded by people throughout our country, as was seen in recent weeks in terms of how people responded to the fundraising call from Pieta House.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that the HSE and Pieta House have formally agreed to that additional funding, as the Deputy rightly noted, of &euro;114,608 per month, or &euro;343,824 per quarter, and that will be provided once the current Government staffing cost schemes, which Pieta House has availed of, have ceased.  It is to help keep staff.  The HSE has also committed to providing cashflow support on a monthly basis, with the position to be reviewed after each quarter.  The funding is being provided to fund an additional 300 hours of high-risk clients and a quarterly review will ensure anybody who commences a programme can complete it.</p>  <p>  As I said when we spoke last week, the cashflow support is contingent on the continuation of that engagement between the HSE and Pieta House on a more sustainable funding model for the organisation.  Work has been ongoing between the HSE and Pieta for some time on how to ensure that the funding will be sustainable into the future.  That ongoing engagement is required in return for the cashflow support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100034#KK00600"><p>I wish to raise two issues with the Minister.  First, the sadness and devastation of suicide has touched our community in Dundalk this week, with the death of a young man I knew.  I express my sincere sympathies to his family and friends.  Unfortunately, it is a situation that has been endured by families in Louth and throughout the country for many years.  The message needs to be that suicide leaves nothing but pain and unanswerable questions.  Often, it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.</p> <p>The pressure people are feeling is being exacerbated by this pandemic.  I want to let people know there is help out there for them.  To families who are worried about a loved one, they should engage with the person concerned, ask how he or she is feeling, ask if he or she feels like ending his or her life and contact the appropriate services immediately.  Sometimes, the last people one wants to talk to when one is going through a bad time are those one loves the most.  However, there are services available and there are people who care, such as Pieta House, which was mentioned earlier, SOSAD Ireland in Louth and the Samaritans.  These organisations step into the breach, like many other NGOs, when State services are lacking.  We need to make sure people make contact and tell how they feel or that people tell these organisations they are worried about a loved one.  They will help.</p> <p> I echo the calls that have been made by Deputy Ward for a special sitting of the D&aacute;il to focus on mental health and for the reconvening of the Committee on Future of Mental Health Care.  The WHO has said that Covid-19 could cause a global mental health crisis so I want to ask the Minister if there are immediate plans for a strategy to deal with the short term as people head into the tenth week of lockdown.</p> <p> The second issue I want to raise is Dealgan House nursing home in Dundalk.  I acknowledge the correspondence Louth Deputies have received from the Minister's Department following my questions here two weeks ago and I acknowledge the correspondence from his office in recent days but core issues remain.  I acknowledge the news that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, will carry out an inspection at Dealgan House in the near future and is talking to families there.  Can the Minister clarify if this inspection report will be used as the basis for deciding if and when the RCSI Hospital Group will hand operational control back to the owners of the nursing home?  That is the immediate concern.  We still do not have knowledge of how and under what circumstances the RCSI Hospital Group will step back from Dealgan House.  I would like the Minister to directly address this.  This needs to be decided upon and communicated to families who still have loved ones in Dealgan House.  They need to know whose call it is for the RCSI Hospital Group to end its involvement.</p> <p> There are constant concerns about a second wave of the virus coming as we unlock and families with loved ones in Dealgan House, as well as in every other nursing home in the State, need reassurance that any and all measures are in place to ensure people in residential settings will be protected into the future.  We need to know there is a foolproof contact infrastructure in place for all staff or for anybody with worries.  The families demand an inquiry into what happened at Dealgan House.  Can the Minister state today whether a preliminary process can be put in place to gather testimony from families and staff and whether an inquiry be established?  Families feel strongly about this.  We need to ensure it happens and that we do not have other scenarios like Dealgan House in the future.</p></speech>

The Deputy is entirely right to put on the record of this House that it is okay not to feel okay and that there are supports available.  I direct people to <i>yourmentalhealth.ie</i>for a range of good information and supports.</p><p>I am in favour of the suggestion of a special sitting of the D&aacute;il on mental health.  It is not a matter for me but it is a good idea and it is a matter for the Business Committee.</p><p>On Dealgan House, I have heard some of the stories through the public forum of families and they are heartbreaking situations.  My thoughts are with them all.  I understand HIQA is to carry out an inspection and that will form the basis for any further actions that may be required.</p><p>I will write to the Deputy and other Louth Deputies on the RCSI Hospital Group and its ongoing involvement as well as on making a patient advocacy service available for people in the community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100035#LL00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and I acknowledge the tremendous work being done by him, his Department, the HSE, nursing home owners and employees and everybody in the country.  I also welcome the Minister's commitment to set up an international best practice assessment of how matters have evolved in our nursing homes.  This assessment will examine: the fact that 54% of all deaths from Covid-19 in Ireland have taken place in nursing homes; the measures we have adopted so far, some of which have worked and some have not; and will consider international experience on approaches and identify any further best practices.  Given the fact that this virus will more than likely return, it is important and proper that the Minister has limited the time for which this committee will sit.  It will only sit until the end of June or July so that it will have real proposals to work on.</p> <p>The committee needs to consider not only what will happen in the future but also what happened in the past.  I represent the constituency of Louth, where Dealgan House Nursing Home is located.  Sadly, a large number of people died there.  I acknowledge the question Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked in this regard but I have a different one: why did the HSE go there in the first place?  I am not asking when it is going to leave.  It can leave only when it knows exactly what happened in the nursing home, what the problems were and how they are being addressed.  It can leave only if it is absolutely satisfied all the people who live there, and their families, are safe and well.  We need to get to the bottom of that.</p> <p> I am not referring to Dealgan House Nursing Home disrespectfully because it got an exemplary report from HIQA at the last public inspection.  The last set of published data on all nursing homes shows that only 123 of the 581 nursing homes in Ireland were fully compliant with all regulations.  That is an absolutely unacceptable number.  As regards governance and management, 32% of the nursing homes, public and private, exhibited non-compliance.  Regarding infection control, 18% of the small, limited number that were examined &ndash; 251, I believe &ndash; were non-compliant.  Therefore, there are important issues to be addressed.</p> <p> We do not want to apportion blame but get to the facts so families who have lost loved ones can have closure.  Closure is the most important thing for families.  One of the big problems they face is that they do not get to say goodbye to their loved ones.  That creates great trauma for them.  Nursing homes and hospitals have different configurations of buildings and different arrangements but it should be possible for every single family to say goodbye, in the appropriate and proper place, to their loved one.  This, above all, is crying out to be addressed.  Friends and relatives of bereaved families see a beautiful ceremony but it is a sad one.  That it may be attended by fewer than ten people causes great emotional distress for the families and their relatives and friends.  We can act only according to the best possible advice, and I acknowledge death is cruel at any time, but death is exceptionally cruel when families must endure what is happening now.  I am not blaming anybody but just believe we need to have the best possible advice, given in the best possible way, to end this.  I understand the reason for limiting the number who may attend a funeral to ten.  I am not disagreeing with the guideline and I would only work with and support public health advice on any of these matters, but it needs to be determined whether there are ways in which people could participate at a distance.  People love to be with their families, loved ones and friends at a time like this.  I hope we can do more on this.</p> <p> We must look to the future.  We need to move away from the nursing homes model.  It represents a failure right around the world.  Covid-19 is rampant and affects most people who are over a certain age and in nursing homes, but it is a fact that home care is under-supported and undervalued.  Having people live in their homes must be our priority, along with the provision of services to their homes, notwithstanding the existence of Covid.  Preparing staff to provide this service must be a top priority.  If we cannot visit people in their homes, the community setting should be the next priority.  I refer to where people can live in small bungalow-type accommodation in which they can be looked after.  There are examples in this country.  The system should be in place to support home care.  There should be a deal for people in home care in addition to those who must go to nursing homes, which I accept has to happen.</p>  <p> I appreciate that the Minister will be happy to reply to these points.  We need to examine the role of HIQA.  It has not just an inspection regime - in fact, I think it may not have enough inspectors - but also retraining and upskilling programmes.  It is all very well to talk about inspecting a nursing home if there are problems in it but we need to make sure staff are trained to the highest possible degree.  There needs to be greater interaction between the HSE and private nursing homes on upskilling and helping everybody to get through these difficult times.</p> <p> At the end of the day, we need to make sure the staff needed in nursing homes are there.  The level of dependency - high, medium or low - of residents in nursing homes determines the ratio of doctors to residents.  Occupational therapy and speech therapy services must also be provided.  It is not good enough to have residents warehoused as, unfortunately, they can be in many respects.  They pay high fees and in many cases get very little other activities for that money.</p></speech>

He has championed the rights of older people, so I take very seriously what he has to say about the matter.  He is right.  At the end of this pandemic, or when a new Government is formed, there will be a big job of work for this Oireachtas to do in moving forward with a new model of care for our older people.  We have all been saying for years that we want people to be able to grow old in dignity in their own homes.  This House, however, has never passed legislation to make that happen.  Regardless of which parties have been in government, that has never happened.  There is no statutory home care scheme.  Incidentally, we have a scheme nearly ready and a new Government, whoever the Minister for Health may be, should be in a position to bring that forward quite quickly.  A statutory home care scheme is key.</p>  <p>  The second issue, without getting into the ownership model, whether it be public or private - Deputy O'Dowd referred to both - is the connectivity between a nursing home and the health services, as he rightly says.  The idea cannot be that because someone has gone into a nursing home, our responsibility of care to him or her lessens.  There are serious lessons for Ireland and the world in that regard.</p>  <p>  The idea of the expert review panel is to look at what we have done in Ireland and how it has gone, what is in place that we need to keep given that this pandemic is not over and we need to continue to shield and protect vulnerable people and what other countries have done and whether we can learn anything from them.  The idea is that the leading geriatrician, leading public health expert, senior nurse and public interest representative will come back to us by the end of June, feed that information back into NPHET and share it with this House.  That will be very useful.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd has been in touch with me about Dealgan House Nursing Home.  I will await the outcome of the HIQA report.  As I said to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, in my role I need to be careful not to pre-empt what I will do on foot of receiving such documents, but I take the matter seriously.  Deputy O'Dowd is also right about the issue of people wanting closure.  I took the opportunity to FaceTime some staff and residents in nursing homes around the country the other day and noted the connection and the bond between staff and nursing home residents.  They are like a second family so many of the staff are grieving as well, and I acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  On the issue of saying goodbye, the Taoiseach met some religious leaders recently to discuss how we can safely get church and religious services, including funerals, back up and running.  That meeting was very useful.  The Irish Hospice Foundation also wrote to me yesterday and I intend to meet its representatives next week.  People are grieving and hurting as a result of Covid and non-Covid deaths and we need to look at how we can do better in that regard.</p>  <p>  I will reflect on the Deputy's comments on HIQA and come back to him.</p></speech>

We have a road map that specifies when social services and businesses will reopen.  For example, we know that on 20 July people can go to the hairdresser's but we do not know when they can, for example, get a cervical check or breast check.  The HSE website simply states: </p> <blockquote> 	Breast screening is paused until further notice.  It will begin again when it is safe to do so. </blockquote>  <p>In other words, there is no indication or prediction as to when that will happen.  That is what people see.  We are encouraging people to present to a hospital if they are sick.  We are telling them that this is the time to go back, yet health professionals do not know when their services should be offered again.  If the health professionals do not know, the patients will have even less of an idea when they should be there.  It is therefore important that we provide clarity in the same way that clarity was provided to businesses.</p> <p>For example, I have been contacted by several occupational therapists, including people who do a mixture of public and private occupational speech therapy for children.  They are prepared now to reopen with appropriate precautions but they are unclear on where their services fit in to a reopening road map.  I am looking for a road map to avoid uncertainty and anxiety for them and their patients.  Can the Minister tell me for a start if he can map the reopening of the various detailed medical services onto the existing road map or if there is a plan to do that?</p></speech>

We know that roughly from the middle of March until 12 May the position was that all non-essential health services were effectively paused.  Then, on 12 May, the national public health emergency team said that from a public health point of view the team believed it was appropriate to lift the pause and replace it with a recommendation on appropriate clinical and operational clinical decision-making.  Since then, the HSE, led by Mr. Paul Reid, has been working on trying to put in place a safe non-covid care plan.  Those responsible in the HSE are doing good work.  I met Paul Reid to discuss this matter either yesterday or the day before.  It is their intention within two weeks to publish the framework for non-covid care in Ireland.  I outlined on the record of the House earlier the eight key principles that they would use as a guide.  I will not eat into Deputy Smith's time by going through those now but I am happy to send Deputy Smith a note on that.  Within two weeks I expect the HSE to outline to people how the executive intends in a safe manner to recommence non-covid health services in the community and in hospitals.</p></speech>

It will be within two weeks.</p>  <p>  We are all aware that there are profound implications for mental health from the pandemic.  Yet, as far as I know, A Vision for Change is 14 years old and requires to be updated.  I know there have been reports from people like Catherine Day on trying to improve mental health strategy.  Can the Minister outline to the House where we are on getting an updated mental health strategy and whether the document is likely to be published?</p></speech>

We have all probably met with Mental Health Reform and other organisations on this.  We need a new vision for change, absolutely.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, has been working on this and there is now a draft new version of A Vision for Change.  It was considered by a Cabinet committee.  It is ready to go to Government.  However, there is a longstanding position on not bringing forward new policies.  There has been a view expressed in this House in recent weeks, to which I am sympathetic, that despite the political interregnum political leaders are happy for me to bring it forward.  I cannot give a commitment on behalf of the Government but I am happy to engage with parties.  The general view is that we allow the new Government to bring forward the policy - we all hope there is one of these soon.  A new A Vision for Change document is ready to go.  It is simply a matter of when we bring it to Cabinet and whether it is brought by the outgoing Government or the incoming Government in a few weeks' time.</p></speech>

I was going to be funny and say that Deputy Smith could answer that, but I will not because it is a serious matter.  It is ready to go to Government.

In general, the simple way of planning for things is that we look at what is likely to happen based on what has happened in the past.  Things continue on and they go along a line.  However, because this is a novel coronavirus and we do not know exactly what path the disease will take, there are several different possibilities that have profound implications across different sectors of society.  It covers everything from whether a double-decker bus carries 17, 35 or 50 people to how many people will be able to go into a waiting room for a medical service.  We have many different possible outcomes.  Different amounts of money will have to be borrowed and different quantities of services will be available.  It is actually a time when we need scenario planning.  Will the Minister consider asking for some proper scenario planning to be carried out?  I do not know whether that should be by econometricians or someone else.</p></speech>

I discussed this with the chairperson of the HSE and the chief executive.  I am conscious and clear about the fact that NPHET advises the Government from a public health point of view on the Covid-19 pandemic.  The running of the health service falls to the HSE.  I have had good discussions with the HSE on non-covid planning.  I see Deputy Kelly nodding in agreement.  Deputy Smith is right.  As I was saying earlier, we probably need to keep our capacity at 80% to 85% bed occupancy in our public health service.  That has serious implications in terms of how we prepare for a winter surge.  We also need to look at outpatient clinics.  Will we be doing more of them virtually?  I imagine we will be.</p> <p>We also need to look to see if this is an opportunity to move some of the outpatient clinics.  For years we have been talking about bringing people from outpatient departments to the community, so could the new community assessment hubs or primary care centres be used in that regard?  Could we have allied healthcare professionals leading that?  I assure Deputies that this work is under way and being led by Dr. Colm Henry, the chief clinical officer of the Health Service Executive.  I expect we will be able to talk about it in detail in a fortnight.</p></speech>

I want to speak to international travel within Europe.  Every country has its own road map and part of that is reopening international travel, and every country is coming up with different rules.  There is a lack of symmetry or reciprocity in this.  A person may be quarantined on arriving in a country but would not be quarantined on returning home, which makes no sense.  Will the Minister update us on efforts to co-ordinate the strategy across Europe?</p></speech>

At a European level, there is no doubt this is discussed at various ministerial European Union Councils and the like.  We must acknowledge that different countries are in very different places.  For example, I know Germany is considering the idea of having a so-called travel bubble with a couple of other countries that are in a similar position with the virus.</p>  <p>  The Irish position is that we expect people, whether Irish or not, to self-isolate for 14 days.  This applies to anybody coming to the country, including returning Irish people.  We also expect people to fill out a passenger locator form, indicating a name, phone number and where the person intends to stay for those 14 days.  These processes are being administrated and a good job is being done by the border management unit.  We must look at how to regulate for that and I hope to be in a position to update the Government on that tomorrow, or if not then next week, on how we can move forward in that regard.  I would be happy to brief the Deputy after that.</p></speech>

We all know we got new advice here this week.  I will not relay the entire story again but the advice means I have a stopwatch in front of me to measure the length of time I am in the Chamber so I do not go beyond two hours.  I broke the rule last week as I was here for questions to the Minister and the Taoiseach.  This was new to all of us and we did not know the advice.  We thought with a break after two hours, we could come back.  When did the Minister first become aware of this rule relating to workplace settings?  We cannot have one rule for here and one for somewhere else.  The advice is that if one goes beyond two hours in a workplace setting within 24 hours, a close contact is created and this clearly creates risk.  When did the Minister first become aware of this?</p></speech>

I have heard this mentioned during the day and I have heard people asking the Taoiseach to clarify the matter etc.  I am open to correction from the authorities in the Oireachtas but my understanding is that the Oireachtas brought in a public health expert.  I heard Deputy O'Reilly describe the person as an independent public health expert.</p></speech>

It is the Oireachtas public health advice from an independent expert brought in by the service.</p></speech>

Page 4 of the National Interim Guidelines for Public Health management of contacts of cases of Covid-19 seems to be updated to reflect this.  We need clarity where there is confusion.  The Minister only became aware of the advice this week and perhaps nobody else asked the question.  This is NPHET's advice.  There cannot be two conflicting rules.  I referenced George Orwell earlier and I will not do so again.</p>  <p>  The Minister only found out about the advice this week and it is from NPHET, although it has come a circuitous route, with the Oireachtas getting advice from another individual.  How is it that this was socialised to everybody else only this week?</p> <p>Was risk not being created across all communities by the fact that this had not been socialised beforehand?  How are people meant to operate in shops and factories?  People can only spend two hours in the same space within 24 hours.  Otherwise, they will create close contacts, and if anyone gets infected, everyone will have to isolate for 14 days.  Take my local shop as an example.  It did not have a clue about this.  If anyone working there got infected, the shop would have to close.  Viability is the key issue.  If NPHET was aware of this situation, why was the public health information not socialised before now?  It has huge ramifications.</p> <p> Who initiated the request for advice following concerns about Oireachtas sittings?  I accept the public health advice - that is not the issue.  Who initiated the conversation between the Oireachtas and the Department of Health regarding the first sitting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and people's concerns?</p></speech>

It is about carrying out a risk-based assessment of any workplace and a variety of factors can obtain, for example, the safety of a location, how long to spend in a room and the like, but I am sure there can be more clarification.  I hope that a way forward can be found.  I believed the Covid committee was coming up with innovative ways of ensuring that it could do its business.  Doing that business is crucial.

Rather, I am worried about the people in my local shop.  How are they meant to carry out a risk assessment?  It would mean having a many more employees and would make the business unviable.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister the question again because he did not answer it.  Why was this public health information not socialised - put out there - across the country previously?  Why did it appear all of a sudden this week?  Deputy Harris is the Minister for Health.  Tell everyone in this country who owns a shop, including pharmacists, how they are meant to operate in these conditions.  They will have to get assessments done.  For many, how they will do that is questionable.  Who is professional enough to do it?  It is not viable.  How are shops, other retail outlets and the people who produce our food, including meat factories, meant to operate under these guidelines?  I do not buy the idea that every area is different.  Rooms have a certain square footage and we are expecting people working on checkouts to spend six or eight hours together in the same environment.</p>  <p>  Either this advice on risk was known and not mentioned or it is new.  The Minister found out about it last week.  The whole country is depending on what he will say.  We need to know why this was not socialised.  Is it new advice?  If it already existed and people were not informed, then a risk of which they were not informed was created.</p></speech>

On 27 March, workplace protection and improvement guidance was issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, for all workplaces that were open.  The NSAI is the body from which people and businesses around the country are taking their advice.  Guidance has been issued for many different sectors.  For example, guidance has been issued by the national outbreak control team in respect of meat factories and by HIQA in respect of nursing homes.  It has been the case, and is the case the world over, that different settings have different guidance.</p>  <p>  There has been a debate since the start of this pandemic as to whether the Oireachtas should fulfil its duties by having Members work from home using virtual technology.  There have been good ways of using committee rooms and video links.</p> <p>My understanding is that the Oireachtas asked for the piece of public health advice and I am following it.  That is my understanding of how it surfaced.</p></speech>

It was written advice that was given that is completely new advice.  Previously a consultant on workplace health and safety was asked to come in and gave the original advice that we have been operating to up to this week.  The other was just a particular medical person who was asked.</p><p>I have four questions.  I read in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has said that immediate action is needed to mitigate the risk of infection spreading throughout our public hospitals.  I want to bring a matter to the Minister's attention, although I understand he has already received a letter about it.  This is about the packed waiting room at Beaumont Hospital last weekend, where large numbers of people were sitting side-by-side, many of them waiting there up to 12 hours.  Photographs of the situation have been sent to the Minister.  I hope he can respond to us about that high-risk situation.  My concern is that that high-risk situation is being repeated every day and every night in emergency department waiting rooms throughout the country.  What guidance is being given to public hospitals in terms of the safe management of people waiting for services in emergency departments?  This is an urgent issue.  On the one hand hospitals are providing services to Covid patients and on the other hand the non-Covid patients would seem to be placed at risk as a result of the failure to segregate and provide sufficient space for social distancing.  If that situation was to arise in a shop the numbers would be reduced drastically.  There would be control on the numbers but there does not appear to be any control on the numbers in emergency department waiting rooms and we need a response on that urgently.</p><p>My second question concerns private hospitals.</p> <p>We have been told by the Minister for a number of weeks that there would be a road map and that there is unused capacity that needs to be brought into use for non-Covid conditions.  That needs to happen quickly.  I read the briefing we got from the HSE the other day.  We are still talking about two weeks before that is finalised and the services are up and running.  There are empty beds in hospitals.  We are paying quite a lot for them and they should be brought into use as soon as possible.  For example, we have talked before about the advisability of having elective-only hospitals.  If we look at the Sports Surgery Clinic in Santry as an example, why are we not using it to its maximum capacity and putting large numbers of people through it for hip and knee procedures and all the other orthopaedic work that needs to be done?  I do not see why there is a need for a delay in ramping that up.  It is really important that we use that capacity to the absolute maximum and I hope the Minister will retain it for the foreseeable future.  It is really important that he does so.</p> <p> Regarding Covid services in public hospitals, there is a single list.  When people come in with Covid, they are not asked whether they have health insurance, and that is absolutely right.  All patients are being treated for Covid in public hospitals.  By the same token, all patients should be treated for non-Covid conditions in private or public hospitals where there is spare capacity.  There should be no question about that and we should be embedding that principle into our health services generally.</p> <p> My next question relates to home care services.  There are indications of delays in home care provision in terms of, say, somebody being discharged from hospital and needing home supports, as well as delays in testing before the home care service is put in place.  Equally, where a person in receipt of home care has suspected Covid, there are delays in getting the test and delays in getting a new team of carers into that situation.  Another concern is that at the beginning of this pandemic, a lot of families were nervous about home care workers coming in and asked for the service to be suspended.  Now, several weeks down the road, those families cannot cope any longer and want the service reinstated, and there seems to be delays with that.  Some action is needed there fairly quickly.</p> <p> My fourth question is how we identify high-risk groups and respond to them appropriately.  There is a stand-out example of delays in responding.  It was early days and all of that kind of thing and it happened in other countries, but there undoubtedly were delays in identifying and responding to the high-risk situation that people in nursing homes were in.  There were tragic results because of that.  There are a whole lot other high-risk situations.  People in direct provision - the Minister is just getting to that now - and Travellers are examples.  There are also meat packers and construction workers who are living and working in very high-risk situations.  There is no point in coming along a week or two after the event when there is an outbreak or several clusters.  Is there a system in place to identify those high-risk groups and is there a hit squad to ensure there is a speedy response to outbreaks in those circumstances?</p></speech>

We were able to clarify that this is the case.</p>  <p>  I have not yet seen the letter from Beaumont Hospital to which the Deputy referred, but I will make sure I see it straight after this and I will respond to the Deputy and to the letter.  It is important to say that one of the reasons we are reading today about the HIQA report on acute hospital infection prevention and control preparedness - I thank the authority for publishing it and the transparent way it went about it, so that there is no need for freedom of information requests and so on - is that it was requested by NPHET in recognition of the fact that we cannot talk about everybody else having to manage infection control and not get on top of it in our health service.  It will help to surface the challenges we are going to need to face.</p>  <p>  HIQA points in the report to the progress that has been made, particularly during the Covid-19 period, to expand the infection prevention and control capacity and capability in acute hospitals, and this is no doubt an assistance in our efforts.  However, it also identifies common challenges across hospitals in relation to access to PPE, which will become a bigger issue as we commence more services, testing kits and consumables.  It draws particular attention to the need for additional supports for the UL hospital group and the South/South West hospital group.  My Department is now working with the HSE on the implementation of practical measures to address each of the risks.  In fact, I wrote back only today asking to receive an update on that next week in terms of how we are getting on with the implementation of each of those recommendations.</p> <p>I also intend to pursue it at my weekly meeting with the HSE next week.</p></speech>

That is a rarity, but we need to be able to address this issue.</p>  <p>  Regarding private hospitals, I share the Deputy Shortall's view that we are going to need to retain all the capacity we can.  Where I think there is room for debate, although I think I am close enough to Deputy's view on this, is how to best use that capacity and what arrangements and agreements we come to in that regard.  It is complex to switch back on non-Covid-19 care.  I am not being smart in saying this, people get that.  It is complex to switch this back on from a safety point of view and also from the perspective of clinical prioritisation.  Earlier, for the purposes of transparency, I placed on the record the eight key principles the HSE is applying in deciding the priority and order of resumptions.  I expect the work by Dr. Colm Henry and Anne O'Connor within a fortnight and for it to be very helpful in guiding what non-Covid-19 care will look like for the next three months or so, and what that will mean in the context of using the extra capacity of the private hospitals.</p>  <p>  I will come back to the Deputy on homecare.  I was not familiar with testing delays there.  Regarding the reinstatement of services, that is a fair point.  People might believe they need their service back after being nervous.  I will try to get a sense of the numbers in that regard.  We can debate another day the nursing homes and how Ireland responded.  The Deputy makes a fair point, however.  This is a challenge the world over.  We have tried to suppress Covid-19 in the community and we have largely done that thanks to people's efforts.  Then we see clusters and outbreaks in different sectors, some of which are more predictable than others.  Tomorrow, the HSE is due to bring a testing strategy paper to NPHET regarding how it tends to target - and the Deputy has often raised this with me - the extra testing resources it now has at particularly vulnerable sectors or groups of people.</p></speech>

I also asked him about the mechanism for identifying those groups and responding, and that is an important point.  If we look back over the past week, for example, there were about 86 new cases the other night.  If that was based on a positive rate of 3% or less, that means that fewer than 3,000 tests were performed.  The numbers are getting very low now, so there should be vast capacity.  There should not be any reason for not ensuring there is full testing and repeat testing in those high-risk settings.  I find it hard to understand why we are not using that capacity.  We are only using a fraction of the capacity for which we have been waiting for several weeks.  The capacity is there but there seems to be a problem availing of it.  That does not make sense.</p></speech>

As we begin to resume non-Covid-19 care, we are going to see a significant need to increase testing, and regular testing, among certain cohorts of people.  That could include hospital staff and patients going into hospitals----</p></speech>

The testing strategy paper tomorrow - and genuinely tomorrow - at NPHET is to finalise that deployment.  The HSE is bringing the paper to NPHET tomorrow.  Even ECDC guidance out this week, I think - and which was shared with the Covid-19 committee - refers to the frequency of testing that may be required in long-term residential care settings.  When we map that out, it is possible to see how we quickly get through capacity.  I expect news on that issue in the coming days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1565" speakername="Gino Kenny" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100043#TT00800"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.  I have two questions for the Minister.  The first concerns testing of front-line healthcare workers.  Healthcare workers across the world have suffered a terrible toll in fighting this pandemic.  In Britain, 200 NHS workers - doctors, nurses, care assistants and auxiliary staff - have died.  It has been a terrible toll.  In Ireland, more than a quarter of front-line workers have contracted the virus.  That is 25% and that has also taken a huge toll.</p>  <p>  It takes three days for a front-line worker to be tested and for the result to come back.  Does the Minister envisage a time when the period relating to testing front-line workers will be much shorter?  It has to be under 24 hours.  I offer the example of a nurse who does a shift, finishes work and is then tested for Covid-19.</p> <p>Does the Minister envisage that nurse having to work his or her next shift, which may be the next day, without having received a test result?  It seems impossible that this could be allowed.</p></speech>

I would appreciate his privately conveying to me any examples he has of such situations.  Although what he stated is correct, the HSE in its plan has given a commitment that, starting from Monday, 18 May, it will take an average of one or two days from a swab being taken for test results to be received.  The overwhelming majority of people should be receiving results much more quickly than was previously the case.  That is certainly the feedback I have received from people, including GPs, this week.  I am sure the Deputy will be able to point me to examples of where it is not the case and I would welcome him doing so.  The process turnaround times have significantly improved.  The advice for anybody with symptoms is to self-isolate until the test results are forthcoming in order that he or she will not accidentally spread the virus.  That would be my advice to anybody who fears they may have contracted the virus.</p></speech>

Last year, the Minister made an announcement regarding access to Spinraza for those living with spinal muscular atrophy.  Unfortunately, the response I received yesterday to a parliamentary question indicates that fewer than half of the applicants approved for Spinraza have received it.  Glen McHugh Farrelly, one of those applicants, is 19 years old and a student at Maynooth University.  He is frustrated by the process.  He thought he was going to get Spinraza at this time last year and would be able to move on with his life.  However, 18 of the applicants have not received the drug.  The Minister knows as well as I do that time is of the utmost essence in the context of this drug and the condition.  Can he give any assurance to those 18 people and their families that they will be able to access this drug as soon as possible?</p></speech>

What he has stated is correct.  My officials and I have met several Deputies, including him, in respect of this matter, and I have met several of the patients awaiting this drug and their families.  I am disappointed that some are still waiting for it.  Rather than giving false hope or false commitments, I will arrange to meet the Deputy via videoconference or telephone early next week and I will speak to the CEO of Children's Health Ireland in the meantime to try to get timelines.  I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

I have written to the Ceann Comhairle under Standing Order 44A to complain that the Minister has not answered the question and ask that he request that the Minister does so.  I have a very simple question for the Minister.  Has he at least seen the breakdown of costs for April provided by the private hospitals?</p></speech>

I expect to be briefed on the matter by the Secretary General or another senior official of my Department as part of the review process we intend to undertake as per the agreement.  That is due to commence at the end of this month.  It is a review process of 30 days.  I have not yet seen the breakdown of costs but I intend to be briefed on it.</p></speech>

We are now finding out that, two weeks after the figures were to be provided by the private hospitals, the Minister has not looked at those figures.  We are expected to be okay with that and with the fact that he has repeated in writing that he is refusing to publish the figures on the grounds of commercial sensitivity.  As a result of this, the public will not get to see them.</p> <p>The public is asked to pay the bill for this, which is substantial, but does not have oversight.  This makes a joke of the idea of the open books model which was touted by the Government.  The sum of &euro;115 million per month is more than the entire debt write down for Siteserv, with which it was claimed there was no problem at the time but which then required an inquiry.  If the Government, the State and private hospitals have nothing to hide here in terms of the deal then I do not understand why these figures are not published.  This is an arrangement between the State and all of the private hospitals.  The only way we can understand why we are paying what look like - although we do not have the full information - extremely high fees per bed is to publish the accounts.  The public is paying for this and has a right to see the receipts and to know what is happening in our health service.</p> <p> The Minister has said in the past that in retrospect, the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to look at this but the idea that behind closed doors an accountant will look over costs is simply not acceptable.  We are talking about &euro;500 million of public money, potentially, by the time this is finished, or something close to that.  Again, I ask the Minister to look at the costs.  I also ask him to intervene to, at the very least, allow Deputies to view the figures but they should really be published.  The public has a right to know.</p></speech>

We were trying to make sure that we had ventilators and rooms for Irish people who might be struggling to breathe and fighting for their lives during a pandemic in which we could have seen 39,000 of our citizens die at this stage.  I will never, ever regret making sure that we did everything we possibly, humanly could to obtain access to every single bed, ventilator, nurse, doctor and healthcare professional possible in this pandemic.  If that allows Deputy Paul Murphy to score points or play politics, that is okay.  There are important questions that he should ask as a Deputy on these matters and I have no difficulty with that.  I fully respect his right to do so but trying to elide everything in a big conspiracy theory involving Siteserv is beneath him.</p>  <p>  The HSE received information on this on Friday which is currently being analysed.  The Deputy will have to pardon me but the information was only received by the HSE last Friday and this is Thursday, in the middle of a pandemic.  The Deputy will have to pardon me for not yet analysing information that must go to the HSE, to an accountant and then be relayed to me.  The information sought is in line with the heads of terms for the arrangements, which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 April.  It includes the management accounts of the hospitals for the six months prior to the arrangement and the information as set out in schedule 2 of the heads of terms.  The information is being verified by a firm of accountants on behalf of the HSE, which is the appropriate thing to do.  Of course there is commercially-sensitive information therein and most people in this country will understand that, but it is intended to publish summary financial information regarding the arrangement in due course.  There will obviously be recourse to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and there will be lots of scrutiny but obtaining this capacity was number one, two and three in terms of our priorities and making sure that we had access to as many beds as possible for a surge which, thankfully, has not yet come but which may come in the future.</p></speech>

I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who have died over the past week due to Covid-19.  The number of deaths is decreasing, which is to be welcomed but the sorrow and grief of those who have lost loved ones to this terrible virus is as painful as at any other time.  I would also like to take this opportunity to offer those who are currently fighting Covid my full support and I wish them well during this very difficult time.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank the incredible healthcare workers throughout the country, and particularly in County Louth, for the amazing personal sacrifices they have made to keep us all safe.</p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, more than 20 residents of the Dealgan nursing home in my constituency have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of April.  As I have said previously in this House, I am not interested in a blame game but lessons must be learned and admissions must be made regarding how certain aspects of the Covid-19 outbreak were handled by those in power.</p> <p>In order to ensure the same mistakes never happen again, it is vital to spell out how certain areas and sectors were overlooked, abandoned and left to fend for themselves for far too long, until it was too late to stop the virus from taking hold.  Nursing and residential homes are the most obvious victims of this neglect.  It was known from the very start of the Covid-19 outbreak, from what happened in other countries, that the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions were most at risk from this virus, yet nursing and residential homes ranked near the bottom of this list when it came to Ireland's preparations for the outbreak here. </p> <p> I have a real concern that the management of nursing homes will be made scapegoats and blamed for the high number of deaths that occurred in these settings.  Management and staff always have a responsibility for what happens on their watch but the tragedy that happened in so many nursing and residential homes could have been greatly reduced had they been given assistance from the top, as was needed from the very start.  It is utterly unacceptable that immediate support was not made available when it emerged that only seven of the 24 nursing staff were available to work in Dealgan House Nursing Home due to staff contracting the virus or being suspected of having the virus.  If coming to the aid of nursing homes had been treated as a national emergency, then replacement of staff, provision of PPE and regular testing would have occurred as a priority at the start.</p> <p> The record is very clear that this did not happen.  The result is a huge number of casualties, loss of life and utter devastation for families.  All that the families are looking for is answers.  They do not want to hear excuses or admissions from those in power regarding the failure to protect their loved ones.  The only way lessons will be learned is by ensuring the same neglect of the most vulnerable in our society never happens again. </p> <p> Does the Minister accept that the Government's failure to act early enough in safeguarding nursing and residential homes contributed to the devastating outcome that befell those homes?  Can he confirm that he is planning to set up a public inquiry into what went wrong in nursing homes like Dealgan House Nursing Home in Dundalk?</p></speech>

In regard to Dealgan House Nursing Home, I very much welcome the fact HIQA is due to carry out an inspection in regard to Dealgan and I will be guided by the outcome of that, as I am sure the health service will be.  HIQA is the regulator and has the ability to go into any nursing home and inspect it, and it is right and proper that it is going to do that.</p>  <p>  I join with the Deputy in paying tribute to staff.  An impression has been given, not by the Deputy but by some, that suggests every nursing home failed to prepare.  My experience, from very detailed engagement with nursing home owners and staff, is that people have worked extremely hard.  This is a very infectious virus.  It is hard to keep it out of the Deputy's home and mine, and even harder to keep it out of a home where many people live together, in particular people who are vulnerable.  That is not a reason we should not try to rise to the challenge.  The world over, this has been a real challenge.  Some countries have not tested in nursing homes and some do not record deaths in nursing homes.  Painful as it is, we put everything out there for people to see, so we can learn and can do better, which is very important. </p>  <p>  I am sure there are learnings and there must be learnings, but I do not accept that Ireland acted slowly in this regard.  If one looks at the interval between Ireland having its first case and making the recommendation around visitor restrictions, in this country it was 14 days; in South Korea, it was 47; in Belgium; 36; in Sweden, 61; in Spain, 41; in France, 47; in Norway, 16; in Canada, 46; in Germany, 48; in Australia, 53; in the Netherlands, 22; and in New Zealand, 23.  Therefore, we moved very quickly in terms of putting visitor restrictions in place and also providing personal protective equipment to what are for-profit, private businesses, and it was right and proper that we did that.  There was also a funding scheme, HIQA protocols, testing of asymptomatic residents, testing of staff and a plan was put in place in that regard.</p>  <p>  There is absolutely a need to make sure we look around the world and check if there are more things we can do.  That is why I have announced today, on the basis of a NPHET recommendation, that we will set up an expert review panel, with a geriatrician, a public health expert, a senior nurse and a public interest representative.  The panel will look at what we have done in Ireland, what has gone well, what we can do more of, what we need to do more of, what other countries have done and what learnings there are.  The panel is to report back by the end of June.  I will be happy to share that with the Deputy then. </p></speech>

Most families are totally unprepared when confronted with the discussion around a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order when a loved one becomes gravely ill.</p> <p>I am aware the HSE guidelines place an obligation on healthcare providers to consult with patients where possible or, alternatively, with family members regarding the issue of "do not resuscitate" orders.  However, the reality is that many families are too overwhelmed when they are faced with this situation to be able to make a fully informed decision on the spur of the moment.  I know for a fact that many families who have been in this heartbreaking and terrible situation could not fully grasp what they were being asked and were 100% dependent on the information given to them by those caring for their loved ones.  They are now left with questions as to whether they did enough to save their loved ones and the answer, of course, is that they did.  Any of us can only act on the information we are given.  My concern is that patients and families are not significantly informed on the matter until it lands at their door.</p> <p> A HIQA report from a number of years back referred to the fact that "do not resuscitate" orders were written on the medical charts of patients in some nursing homes without the consent or knowledge of the next of kin.  This is an unbelievably serious matter and the only response to this is more openness and public debate on the issue.  I am aware that many families were put in impossible situations in recent weeks, with a feeling of being kept in the dark and feeling overwhelmed about what they were confronted with regarding their loved ones who became gravely ill.  In many cases, sadly, they died.  I stress that I am not singling out any specific nursing home.  However, the area of "do not resuscitate" orders needs urgent attention.</p> <p> I have nothing but respect and admiration for the heroic healthcare workers who have been standing in the firing line in recent months to help save the lives of others.  They are true heroes.  I want to put on record my praise and gratitude to them in the strongest possible way.  However, as a society we cannot allow the situation to continue whereby families feel totally overwhelmed when confronted with issues such as "do not resuscitate" orders.  In some cases, they believe that doctors are making judgments on whether their loved one should receive additional medical care not based on clinical considerations but on quality of life and other non-medical considerations.</p> <p> The lack of a proper public consultation on these issues before the Covid-19 outbreak has placed us in this impossible situation.  It has caused huge heartbreak and even despair for many families.  The answer required is not an uncontrolled discussion on medical ethics but one that openly embraces the view of those who have been left out of the debate and sidelined in recent years.  I call on the Minister to address this as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

These are major decisions that we take as individuals and sometimes take in consultation with our families.  I can only imagine how difficult it is for people at a time of huge grief.

I hear very clearly his call in this regard and I will consider the HIQA documentation he has referenced and will reply to him in writing.</p></speech>

I know the percentage of residents from such homes admitted to hospital during a typical flu season is quite low.  We all know that Covid-19 poses a much more serious health risk than a flu and I would have thought the percentage of residents being admitted to hospital should be considerably higher.  There are many distraught families who have lost loved ones in nursing homes and residential settings who are looking for answers.  I would like an answer on the exact percentage of residents admitted to hospital for treatment of suspected Covid-19 or after testing positive between February and May 2020.  Will the Minister indicate this percentage?  If he needs time I ask him to give a commitment to place the precise figures on the public record as soon as possible.</p></speech>

During recent weeks, essential front-line healthcare workers from various parts of my constituency and beyond have contacted me to express their concerns about the fact they have no time to do homework with their children.  They are worried that come September, when schools reopen, their children will have fallen behind.  The parents of some children were home full time to offer them support and home educate them but these were not.  Many healthcare workers work 12 hour shifts and have little time with their children.  Some were even forced to isolate from their children when at home to prevent the potential spread of the virus within their homes.  What provisions are in place for the children of these healthcare workers?</p> <p>I propose that they should be given additional support in tandem with the July provision scheme already being rolled out for children with additional needs.  These schemes should be run simultaneously in primary schools across the country.</p> <p> I would like to concentrate in my second question on coronavirus testing and the need to get tests carried out quickly with same-day or next-day results.  I have had all too many calls with people waiting for days and weeks to get results so they can get cancer treatment or other urgent procedures done.  The State has sent samples to Germany to speed up results.  This whole process came at a great cost as a PC-12 aircraft had to be acquired by the Air Corps.  No one would argue with that until now we find out that if a small bit of investment was made, labs in Ireland could have given us thousands of same-day or next-morning results at a fraction of the cost.  I refer to excellently run companies like Animal Health Laboratories Limited in Bandon which is giving same-day or next-morning results for the HSE on a small scale.  With a little support it could turn out thousands of results weekly, saving the State millions of euro and saving lives.  Can the Department of Health look deeper at companies like Animal Health to carry out tests in this country, thus creating badly-needed employment and saving the State significant costs and probably saving lives?</p></speech>

The point he makes is a very interesting one, that they have been at work when many of us have been staying at home, and the Deputy raises their concern in respect of their children and their children's education.  The Deputy will understand that it is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, but I will certainly raise the matter with him and ask that he or I respond to the Deputy directly.  I thank the Deputy for bringing it to my attention.</p>  <p>  On the issue of testing, I hope people are beginning to see an improvement in the turnaround time.  Job number one was trying to ramp up capacity so that we have capacity to do up to 15,000 tests a day or 100,000 tests a week from this week.  Job number two, which is equally important, is the turnaround times.  I am very pleased that the HSE has now outlined how it intends to provide an average of one to two days of a turnaround time from swab to result.  I am certainly getting feedback of an improvement in turnaround times but I will keep a very close eye on it.  On lab capacity, that is a matter for the HSE but I would be happy to take examples the Deputy has given me and ask the HSE to respond.  I would point out that we are now using 41 labs, which is a very significant lab capacity.  That has grown from just using one lab in UCD and has been built up right across the country.  If there is potential to do more, I would be very happy to hear about that from the Deputy.</p></speech>

We have a family in Limerick where one of the parents and two of the children were diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  Patches for pain alone cost &euro;130 for one child and this is not covered under the medical card scheme.  These children are in chronic pain.  The pain gets so bad that the child falls unconscious.  Some 16 times in the last eight months there has been an ambulance transfer to the accident and emergency department.  With no dedicated pain consultant assigned to under 12s, the HSE has directed them to rheumatology, which is not effective as they say they are not trained in this syndrome.  The public are on waiting lists for rheumatology of two and a half to three years.  They have been promised a consultant from Belfast but this has not materialised.  A waiting list for physiotherapy is up to two years currently and there are 5,300 signatures to a petition looking for a pain consultant.  This mother is distraught and has been up all night with her children crying.  It is not satisfactory and I need the Minister's help.</p></speech>

I do not have the information to hand but from my memory, I understand that there was a pain consultant working within Children's Health Ireland, I think in Crumlin, who left the position for a variety of reasons.  I wish the consultant well and understand this person was very highly regarded by patients and families who are really feeling that loss.  The last time I checked I understand the HSE was in the process of trying to recruit a replacement.  On foot of the Deputy's query, I will take the individual details of the cases he has referenced and ask the HSE to respond to him directly.  I will also find out where they are at in terms of recruitment of a new, full-time consultant.  In the interim the HSE was trying to put together a multidisciplinary team, which sounds similar to what the Deputy was saying, but I understand that is not the same as what the families want and need.  I will revert to the Deputy directly and will ask the HSE to come back on the specific cases.</p></speech>

This company operates to ISO and ICE standards and Food and Drug Administration, FDA, guidelines.  It has tested the process in many situations and it is now at the highest standard.  The issue for the company is that it is competing with other companies that have brought in equipment from countries such as China.  These do not have the same approval as Irish companies and using their methods does not have back-up for temperature screening.  This is not a level playing field and is not reliable.  We have been told that this virus originated in China and now we promote businesses from China to come here to supply temperature monitoring equipment.  We have companies in Ireland, including in Limerick, that produce this equipment to the highest standards, including the HSE standard.  We should be looking here before any equipment is brought in from China.  China has given us enough.  It is time that we looked after our own companies to fix the problem.</p></speech>

The Deputy's general point is on the importance of trying to support indigenous industry.  This issue has been raised by a number of Deputies in the House.  I have spoken to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation about how we can work together to support Irish businesses in this area and I intend to do so again.  We are, however, very grateful to international partners for providing us with that equipment at a time when we could not source it in other places.</p></speech>

Driving instructors and testers would have a maximum of eight people in their vehicle daily.  There needs to be some easing of restrictions in this regard.  One solution could be for instructors to use only their own cars, which are Road Safety Authority, RSA, compliant, and for regulations to be put in place that all instructors abide by the hygiene standards laid down by the RSA.  Many instructors' cars have antibacterial seat covers and cars can be sanitised if necessary after every lesson.  Machines for sanitising vehicles in a ten-minute cycle cost between &euro;400 and &euro;500.  Maybe an incentive could be used to fund or partially fund this cost.  Instructors could also operate a dual control system while wearing masks and gloves.  They have the use of a hand-held thermometer.  They are being told, however, that there can be no driving lessons or testing until social distancing restrictions no longer apply.  It is mandatory for a student studying to be a paramedic to hold a C1 driving licence.  That licence has now been deferred for 12 months due to Covid-19 but it is mandatory to hold a full car licence for paramedic training.  A person who does not hold a full licence cannot take up a paramedic training course in college and this course cannot be deferred.  Once again, it is front-line workers who are affected.  We need to ease some of the restrictions in that area.</p></speech>

Again, for the record, I do not believe they were prioritised.  My office has checked when it came to our attention from Europe that there were serious problems in nursing homes.  It was way back in early March.  We did not learn from other countries but perhaps we will learn now.</p> <p> I turn to private hospitals and preface my remarks by saying I am an absolute advocate for public medicine.  However, the manner in which the arrangement with private hospitals has been carried out has not been fair or equitable.  The Minister did not lay the contracts before us.  He laid the heads of agreement but the rest is commercially sensitive and we cannot see it.  I am in receipt of quite a lot of correspondence telling me the hospitals in Galway are at 15% to 20% capacity.  We are paying &euro;115 million per month.  We have major waiting lists and our two private hospitals in Galway city are at 15% to 20% capacity.  The hospital itself - I must be wrong about this figure but it is what I have been told - was at 30% to 40% capacity as of 15 May.   The Minister has stood in the Chamber and told us he had to make such arrangements, and certainly I welcomed the narrative at the time that we were taking over the private hospitals to deal with a pandemic.  However, we are not utilising them.</p> <p> On top of that, I was talking to somebody yesterday about Merlin Park Hospital in Galway, which has a state-of-the-art rehab service.  It has a gym and all types of therapists but it is now lying idle because, under this deal, the Government transferred the patients from that wonderful facility to a private hospital.  It took the therapists and patients into the private hospital to allow them to get up to 15% or 20% capacity.  It sent the nurses into the public system and left the system empty at Merlin Park, and that is to mention only one service.  None of the way this has been done makes sense to me.  Surely anybody with a bit of sense would know that when the terms and the heads of agreement were signed, it should have allowed for change.  Will the Minister please give us a copy of the contract so that we can see what we are dealing with?  Will he state we can change this so that we can bring capacity up to 100%?</p> <p> I have two letters to hand, one from someone who has been on a waiting list for some time but is not being taken for treatment and another from a person who has been diagnosed with cancer of the uterus.  The latter has got her diagnosis but there is no surgery because a memo two weeks ago stated there would be no surgery until September.  There are many other examples while our hospitals are empty.  Furthermore, there is a complete lack of equity and fairness in respect of how consultants are being treated.  Private ones can see no private patients, whereas other consultants on mixed contracts can see private patients in public hospitals.</p> <p> I do not expect the Minister to agree with me but surely he will admit we have a serious problem on our hands in the way this is being carried out.</p></speech>

I want us to see greater utilisation of that capacity but, as Dr. Colm Henry of the HSE has said, we have to do it in a safe manner.  Even in the case of surgeries the Deputy talks about wanting to be recommenced, it is not just a matter of flicking a switch.  We will have to look at how we can provide it safely and how we can bring people back into our health service safely-----</p></speech>

Presumably, it was a clinically appropriate decision to do that but I will check that out.  A review at the end of May is built in to the agreement and I am very open to the idea of looking at how we can use the hospital.  I will write to the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

We have reached a stage on our road map where we can have a McDonald's but we cannot have a cancer screening.  Is that satisfactory to Deputy Harris, as Minister for Health?</p></speech>

The decision to suspend cancer screening was taken by clinicians on public health grounds.  I do not have responsibility for McDonald's but I do have responsibility for the safety of people in our health service, of its staff and of the women and men of Ireland who use it.  The decision is in line with the advice not just in the Republic of Ireland but in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and New Zealand.</p> <p>I have yet to find another country that has turned back on its screening programme.  I want to turn it back on but I want to do so in a safe way and I will be led by clinical advice.  Within two weeks, we will have the non-Covid-19 care plan from the HSE, led by clinicians, which will determine when it is safe and how they intend to recommence screening.</p></speech>

Through the incredible efforts of the Irish people, we have saved an awful lot of lives.  My ongoing priority is to manage the virus to a point that we do not see a second wave and that we continue to see the virus suppressed while we try to live alongside it.  That will be a difficult and delicate balance.  My priority at that point is to begin to safely turn back on non-Covid-19 services.  In his role as a Member of this House and as Chairman of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, the Deputy will see how challenging that will be.  We will have to run our health service in a very different way.  There will be opportunities in that but there will be challenges too.</p></speech>

I was listening earlier when he spoke of the HSE plans for non-Covid treatment.  He said such treatment had to be safe and clinically effective but did not say it had to be timely.  The Minister also said there would be a plan within two weeks but unless intervention is timely, it is not effective.  I am not being political about this.  I was about to say it is only the Minister and I in the Chamber but there are still only a few of us here.  I am really concerned that we are watching a slow car crash in front of our eyes.  Many people are suffering unnecessarily and many will die because of but not of Covid.</p>  <p>  While I am not putting the responsibility for that on the Minister's shoulders, one of his areas of responsibility is the contract with the private hospitals.  I heard the Minister say he had an open mind on the contract and that he will look at it again.  I ask him to do so because I have had so much correspondence about it.  For example, a gynaecologist in a private hospital in my constituency contacted me.  Many of her patients need life-saving, urgent interventions and she cannot perform any of them.  I have also been contacted about the local podiatry service for diabetics.  To paraphrase what I have been told, unless patients are in danger of needing amputation, they cannot have their toenails seen to.  That is the bottom line.  Those are the kinds of circumstances we need to act on speedily.  I await the Minister's response.  I have spoken to him about this before in this House and while I do not say we should cancel the contract, we should review it, change it and get it to work more efficiently.</p>  <p>  We have a two-hour time limit here.  If any of us spends more than two hours in the Chamber and it transpires that someone here has Covid, we have to self-isolate for 14 days.  That is the recommendation that has been given.  We are socially distanced here and we use hand sanitiser entering and leaving the Chamber.  Can the Minister make the detail of the relevant risk assessment available to Members?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100051#BBB00500"><p>I am open to correction but I believe the risk assessment was done by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I did not carry it out but I hope the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will make it available to Members if it has not already done so.</p>  <p>  The point the Deputy made about deaths because of but not of Covid-19 is a serious and accurate one.  This will be a major challenge for all of us.  While I am growing in optimism that we will get through this Covid-19 pandemic, I am not ignoring the awful loss of life and pain it has caused.  Our next big challenge will be secondary morbidity and there is a huge body of work we need to do on that.</p>  <p>  On the private hospitals, we effectively took them over for a purpose.  If that purpose changes, we have to be big and brave enough to change as well.  I have an open mind on that.  There is a structured review process to go through that will involve more than my Department.  It will involve the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others.  It will start at the end of this month and run until the end of June.  I will approach that with an open mind.  However, we will need extra capacity.  How we use that capacity is a discussion we should have.</p></speech>

The world we knew in February has changed utterly.  Adjustment to the new reality is challenging each of us, and it places large and stressful demands on the way we live our lives and the way our society is organised.  All organisations need to learn to adjust and survive in the environment we are in and to equip themselves for the society that will emerge from Covid-19.  Adaptability, flexibility, imagination, foresight and courage are all the hallmarks of those who will rise to this challenge.</p>  <p>  It is not without accident that many across the heritage sector are recognised as essential workers in response to Covid-19 in this country.  Our national parks and nature reserves, for example, remain open and accessible to the public, albeit subject to the current 5 km restriction.  They are and will remain major supports to our mental and physical well-being in these days of movement restriction, social distancing and cocooning.  In the midst of this crisis, our heritage sector has been highly valued by our citizens.  It will need our support as we emerge from the current situation.</p>  <p>  Over the past 11 weeks, the heritage-based work of my Department has focused on providing the essential services of maintaining, protecting and continuing to provide access to our national parks and nature reserves, and, through Waterways Ireland, maintaining our inland navigations.  I am engaging with stakeholders across the heritage sector to assess and measure the wider impacts and implications of Covid-19 on and for the sector and, of course, supporting all-of-government well-being initiatives through online services provided by the Heritage Council, Waterways Ireland and my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service, in addition to the National Monuments Service and our own built heritage team.  Since the publication of the road map for reopening society and business, the Department has been working to implement it across all the public services we provide while also ensuring all necessary public health measures are in place.</p>  <p>  Following the decision on 12 March to close our cultural institutions and tourism sites, all visitor centres at our national parks and nature reserves were closed to ensure physical distancing was observed.  Over the following weeks, the parks and reserves welcomed an unprecedented number of visitors as people took the opportunity to experience and enjoy our natural heritage.  To meet this challenge, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has erected public health notices across all sites, introduced electric variable message signs where feasible, introduced one-way systems and deployed additional resources at popular visitor locations.  When we implemented the extensive public health restrictions on 27 March, the services provided by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, including the maintenance and protection of our parks and reserves, were identified as essential.  The service is part of the law enforcement and prosecution architecture of the State as regards wildlife crime and is responsible for the protection of wildlife and the conservation of biological diversity.</p>  <p>  This core work has continued over the past eight weeks.  Wildfires have posed a particular threat.  Eight fire danger notices have been issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The setting of uncontrolled fires, which damage and destroy protected habitats and species in Natura 2000 sites and in our parks and reserves, has been a recurring problem over the years.  It is, between 1 March and 31 August, an offence under the Wildlife Acts.  Beyond being an offence, at this time when the full attention of our emergency services should be devoted to addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, it is a particularly abhorrent antisocial act.  Since 24 March, there have been six fires in Wicklow Mountains National Park and the Wicklow Mountains special area of conservation and special protection area, and a major fire in Killarney National Park.  I extend my gratitude to and appreciation for the fire services in both affected counties and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  They worked tirelessly battling the conflagrations.</p>  <p>  Since midnight on 30 March, our inland navigations have been closed.  However, Waterways Ireland has continued essential work to manage water levels and where required to undertake emergency repairs.  Canal towpaths have remained accessible.  I am aware that for many citizens living within 5 km of canals, formerly 2 km, towpaths have been an important amenity for exercise.</p> <p>In protecting and conserving our built and natural heritage, historically we have sought to change the way in which we as a people interact with our built and natural environment to protect and even to restore instead of destroying and degrading and to harness our heritage to promote the individual and collective well-being of our people.  An important component of this has been inviting visitors to historical sites and education centres, often located in rural communities.  Since 12 March, all indoor sites have been effectively closed, which has severely impacted commercial income, not only for those who operate sites, such as my Department, the Office of Public Works, the Irish Heritage Trust and the Irish Landmark Trust, but also those ancillary services provided in communities close to the sites.  My Department continues to engage with the Irish Heritage Trust, the Irish Landmark Trust and other bodies to establish the scale of loss of commercial income, having regard to the road map.  The Heritage Council has undertaken a survey of heritage organisations and workers and is analysing the results in detail at the moment.  The summary impacts identified by respondents include temporary closure, postponement of income generating events and lack of revenue streams.  This is similar to the impact faced by the non-profit cultural sector, which I outlined to the House last week.</p> <p> Despite these impacts, those involved across the heritage sector have repurposed the way they work to provide educational services in new ways.  In my Department these efforts have been orientated towards supporting all-of-Government well-being initiatives.  This work has drawn on existing services provided by my Department, such as the historic environment viewer, which makes the National Monuments Service's sites and monuments record and the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage available to the public in the form of an online map.  Examples of online services include the Waterways Ireland online learning zone, which has been featured on RT&Eacute;'s Home School Hub, and Know Your 5K, which is an initiative of the Heritage Council and the National Museum that helps the public to use a wealth of online resources to find out more about the story of their locality.</p> <p> This week my Department has taken National Biodiversity Week online, running a campaign under the hashtag #LoveNature to raise awareness of our country's biodiversity and nature conservation and to promote public engagement through digital resources.  We are also encouraging people to engage with biodiversity in their immediate vicinity.  For many, one of the unexpected outcomes of the public health restrictions has been a renewed engagement with our immediate surroundings and natural environment.  This new awareness may be a moment for us collectively to reverse the unprecedented global deterioration in the health of our ecosystems which was identified by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services global assessment report last year.</p> <p> The time approaching is one of challenge, renewed purpose and recovery.  It will also be a period of growth, renewal and resurgence.  The economy will perform again and the constraints of recent months will be replaced by a converse and more constructive set of opportunities.  Our heritage sector has a central role to play in this process.  I thank again all those in the sector who have been working so hard since March.  It is at times like these that we appreciate not only the intrinsic value of our heritage but also its importance in sustaining our national life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1557" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100053#HHH00200"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the opportunity to address the House on heritage during National Biodiversity Week and having just celebrated World Bee Day yesterday.  UNESCO has pointed out that 89% of all world heritage sites are either totally or partially closed.  The heritage sector in Ireland, like all other sectors, has faced closures and job losses.  Most facilities under the remit of the National Parks and Wildlife Service are closed to the general public, and our historical houses, castles, estates and gardens lie empty.  There appears to be light at the end of the tunnel as many amenities are beginning to make plans to reopen.  This is a mammoth task for these providers in making and putting in place mechanisms to ensure that facilities can be enjoyed safely.  The Government must provide all supports necessary to enable them to do so.</p>  <p>  A question that has been gathering a lot of momentum is whether our failures on biodiversity have caused the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.  More and more research is pointing to humanity's destruction of biodiversity as the cause of the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19.</p> <p>Regardless of whether that is the case, the Covid-19 pandemic presents us with major opportunities in the context of our natural heritage.  The crisis has caused a 17% drop in daily global carbon emissions.  The media has been awash with stories of wild animals and birds changing their behaviour because of reduced human activity.  Green areas are being rewilded.  We have a unique opportunity to maintain these areas of emerging biodiversity and reverse the destruction of our ecosystems.<br/><br/>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this week's announcement from the European Commission of a major EU biodiversity strategy to 2030.  Although this year's international dawn chorus day had to be cancelled, Derek Mooney put a lovely spin on things when he asked people to immerse themselves in the birds' world.  He urged people to pull up a chair, open a window and enjoy a wonderful free natural concert that will not and cannot be cancelled.  I also listened attentively this week to Padraic Fogarty from the Irish Wildlife Trust.  Unfortunately, he was not so optimistic that the pandemic is giving nature a real opportunity to rejuvenate itself.  He spoke strongly about the need to put in place more tangible efforts to protect our wildlife.<br/><br/>It is good to see our cultural institutions like the National Museum of Ireland working with the Heritage Council to launch the Know Your 5K initiative, which invites people to share their discoveries and insights about the hidden heritage of their locality.  It is akin to the local authority golden mile competitions, which are dotted throughout the country.  These are initiated by heritage officers in our local authorities and involve active local heritage enthusiasts in our communities throughout the length and breadth of our country.  I am keen to take this opportunity to give great credit to the likes of Anne Marie Curley in Cavan County Council and Shirley Clerkin in Monaghan County Council.  They ensure a focused effort to protect and preserve our heritage in our local authorities.<br/><br/>As the Minister is aware, Irish wildlife groups have called for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to be put on an independent footing through the establishment of a wildlife crime unit, with increased powers for enforcement and funding to address the biodiversity crisis in Ireland.  They have called for the establishment of an independent agency - something like the Environmental Protection Agency - in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to be responsible for the enforcement and communication of information to people.  The director of the national biodiversity data centre has acknowledged that while many people are doing small things in their gardens and some farmers and local authorities are helping out with biodiversity, it needs to be cranked up at Government level for transformational change to be achieved.<br/><br/>One year after this House declared a climate and biodiversity emergency there has been little progress in addressing the loss of certain species.  That is the main point of view of experts such as Oonagh Duggan from BirdWatch Ireland.  Not enough is being done to support and enhance the NPWS to strengthen its ability to nurture biodiversity, restore habitats and address the climate crisis.  Kevin O'Sullivan wrote a lovely piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>at the weekend.  In summary, he suggested the Government is lagging behind the public regarding the acute need for action in terms of the loss of our hedgerows, the loss of our trees and the detrimental impact this is having on our environment.  While we acknowledge that people are doing many things in positive ways and working with local authorities, it is certain more effort is needed on a transformational scale to address the climate and biodiversity emergency.</p></speech>

There are 15 Ministers in the Cabinet under the Constitution and she has ministerial responsibility for the Gaeltacht.</p> <p>As I stated, the Irish language is a particularly important part of our heritage.  It is one of the oldest written languages in Europe and it is still a vernacular.  Of course, the Gaeltacht is the place that is a living well from which the language keeps springing anew.  Since 1904, Gaeltacht courses have been held every year and they have created a significant connection between people all over the island, North and South, in the Gaeltacht communities.  It is nearly unique and I do not believe it is replicated anywhere else in the world.</p> <p> For the first time in 116 years, n&iacute; bheidh aon chol&aacute;iste Gaeilge ann i mbliana; there shall be no Irish college this year.  This is a massive economic blow to the Gaeltacht.  The reality is there is money in the Gaeltacht Vote that was set aside to pay the grants to the mn&aacute; t&iacute; this year for keeping students.  We should remember that the mn&aacute; t&iacute; were not working in March because people do not go to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish in the middle of March, so they are not entitled to the Covid-19 payment.  My question to the Minister is what will she do, like her action with Galway 2020, to support the colleges, the mn&aacute; t&iacute; and the halls and facilities funded by the Department and which rely on income from the Irish colleges to pay for things like insurance.</p> <p> I also ask the Minister if she will consider creating a new grant this year as I understand tourism will be allowed in August, although it would not be suitable to put four or five children from different backgrounds in a room together.  It may be possible to encourage families to stay in a house in the Gaeltacht during that period or five days, for example.  Some of the money already in the Vote could be used constructively, particularly for parents with children in Gaelscoileanna, to encourage people to come to the Gaeltacht for five days.  This could happen over three or four weeks in August on a rolling basis.  Would the Minister consider introducing a scheme like that to retrieve some of the season for the mn&aacute; t&iacute;?  It would also give a unique opportunity to families to learn the Irish language together in a programme.</p></speech>

First, we recognise that the colleges play a vital part in the social and economic infrastructure of the Gaeltacht, with up to 27,000 students going every summer.  My son was due to go this year and is extremely disappointed not to be going.  I know it is of major economic value, bringing in approximately &euro;50 million from economic activity in the region.  It is regrettable that because of Covid-19 we are not in a position to do much about that.</p>  <p>  Under the Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, my Department provides a subsidy to Gaeltacht households that provide accommodation for students attending Irish language summer colleges in the Gaeltacht and the households also received a payment from these colleges.  I know the Minister of State, Senator Kyne, and officials in my Department on a number of occasions have met the college representative organisation, CONCOS, with a view to identifying the financial pressures and points where they must be examined.  They are looking at support packages around that sector.</p> <p>We are aware that it is important and intrinsic to the entirety of the Gaeltacht, not just the mn&aacute; t&iacute;.  The Deputy can rest assured that this is on our radar and something on which we are working intensely.</p></speech>

On Monday morning, I was delighted to receive in the post from Laois County Council's heritage officer a beautiful, fantastic, practical and educational publication from the NPWS, funded by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht's national diversity fund.  The booklet, entitled Gardening for Biodiversity, was authored by Ms Juanita Browne and illustrated by Mr. Barry Reynolds.  I advise as many people as possible to look for it online if they do not have hard copies.  It is beautifully produced.  It came in the middle of the Covid-19 restrictions, although perhaps these books come on a regular basis.  It was interesting because, in recent months, many people who were lucky enough to have a garden or allotment found a great interest in gardening once again.  Many have spent time tending to the trees, shrubs, flowers and grass in their gardens that they did not had the time to work on previously because they were busy at work.  Now they have a little more time at home to engage in these activities.  Many people have reconnected with nature, which has been a positive side-effect of the Covid-19 restrictions.  My own hands might be a little grubby under the nails, as I spent the past two evenings weeding various flowerbeds.</p>  <p>  It is important that we help biodiversity.  When I was chairman of Castletown's Tidy Towns committee years ago and we won the national award, there was one particular household whose walls were overflowing with weeds.  I approached the man as chairman and asked whether we could do something about the weeds.  He was a pure environmentalist.  He looked me in the eye and told me that the weeds had to live too.  That put me in my place.  I was there to tidy up the place, but that actually made me think twice.  There is something good in that, and I advise people to look at the recent publications.</p>  <p>  People have been at home for the past number of weeks.  I should also mention the international dawn chorus, which was cancelled.  Many people are taking time to listen to the birds in their gardens or the trees or flying overhead.  I have spotted in the big trees at the end of my garden buzzards and all sorts of thing I had not seen in some time.  I have been told they are common in some areas.  I have seen birds that face severe restrictions - herons and different birds that gobble up fish in the local rivers, streams and ponds where they can.  Some people like those birds and others believe they must be protected.  There are a diversity of views on the matter.</p>  <p>  Apart from the people listening to birds in their gardens as they have been advised to do, I have found that extended families now communicate in a different way.  They do WhatsApp quizzes.  I have seen WhatsApp quizzes where people have taken photos of the birds in their gardens or taped their sounds and others must identify them.  Schools could do more of that type of education.  Back when we were a more rural society, we knew these things from birth.  We lose that knowledge when we move into villages, towns or larger urban areas and stop seeing birds at first hand.  Some people are fortunate enough to still see them.</p>  <p>  I recognise and welcome the Department's historic towns initiative.  I am unsure of its level of funding, but the initiative could be enhanced and developed in due course.  It fits into the tourism sector, and people are looking at their surroundings more.</p>  <p>  RT&Eacute; needs to be complimented.  It has shown many good television programmes in recent times.  Maybe they had always been there and I just did not have time to watch them, so perhaps I am being unfair.  It is not that I am watching too much television, as we have had lovely, fine evenings and I have been outside.  However, I have watched some beautiful programmes.</p>  <p>  I am not here to be critical of the Department, although we could talk about much in that regard.</p> <p>I join in all of the praise for National Biodiversity Week.  We could all do with a bit of diversity in our lives.  We get up every morning, we take various modes of transport to work, we work, we come home, we eat food, we sit down and mingle with our families and then we go to bed and repeat it all again the next day.  In a way, biodiversity week and the Covid restrictions - dare I say it - have been good for the soul.  They have been good for people.  We have taken a step back and we have seen many things we do not normally have time to absorb.  I thank everybody for their efforts in this regard.  </p> <p> The Minister mentioned various fires in woodlands around the country.  I am delighted to see drones in operation by local authorities and the fire services because they can identify the source of a fire and send firefighters directly to the areas concerned, which means they are getting to the core of the problem much quicker and their safety is enhanced because they are not in the line of where the fire is emerging.  </p> <p> I join with the Minister and others in advising people to enjoy National Biodiversity Week during the restrictions of Covid-19.  It is a good side effect and it is good for the soul and humanity that we take time to do that.</p></speech>

I agree with the previous speaker and other speakers that there is a silver lining to Covid in terms of the thriving wildlife that we are seeing.  However, this is a temporary reprieve.  The rejuvenation that we have seen will only be a temporary reprieve unless we put in place protections to ensure that it continues.  It is a big challenge for us to do that in the time that we have before industry, commerce, agriculture and life in general springs back into life and we again turn our backs and look at wildlife in a different view.  I appeal, not to the Minister, but to us as a society, to reap the rewards in terms of wildlife on this island in particular.</p>  <p>  Taca&iacute;m leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  T&aacute;im i mbun d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta leis an gCoiste Gn&oacute; maidir leis an Aire St&aacute;it, Teachta Kyne.  T&aacute;im den tuairim gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh eisean, n&oacute; Aire &eacute;igin eile le Gaeilge, anseo.  N&iacute; c&oacute;ir go bhfuil s&eacute; i gcruinni&uacute; an choiste.

N&iacute;l s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go d&iacute;reach cad at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute;.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Minister a question concerning the cultural institutions, not only the national institutions but the many local museums and institutions that play a huge role in terms of our international tourism.  These institutions attract many people but as they are now closed they will not enjoy tourists travelling from abroad.  I appeal to the Minister to find some way to help them attract Irish tourists, people who are living in Ireland who are not going to go abroad who have not enjoyed the benefits of visiting their local museums and other institutions.  These institutions are well organised but they need additional funding to help them in terms of the Covid restrictions.  I have previously discussed with the Minister the need for funding to assist them to get their collections online.  I praise those institutions that have used this opportunity to get their collections online, which we can share with those who have not seen them to enjoy.  There is a vast amount of collections that need to be made available online.  Since lockdown, Kilmainham Gaol has been sharing a video per day which is encouraging viewings from people who have never visited it because of lengthy queues.  This is an opportune time to open up these collections to Irish families, in particular as we wait for the international sphere to kick-in again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100057#MMM00300"><p>I am conscious that the Minister, Deputy Madigan, and I have never spoken in this Chamber or outside of it.  A great deal of concern has been expressed to me in regard to the derogation which classifies the wood pigeon as a pest.  Will the Minister give clear and concise clarification as to whether she intends to sign this derogation?</p>  <p>This species causes enormous destruction to standing crops, putting unnecessary pressure on the tillage farmers who have, for decades, depended on the game and conservation organisations for crop protection.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has stated that this decision was based on scientific advice but it has yet to publish that advice even after the National Association of Regional Game Councils, NARGC, called on it to do so.  Without that advice being published, the only easily available evidence to give credence to not signing the derogation is from the UK.  However, after a similar ban was enforced in that country, farmers reported yield reductions from 10 tonnes to 2.5 tonnes per hectare, resulting in enormous financial losses.  I am firmly of the opinion that this will be replicated here if the derogation is not signed.</p> <p> The current procedures to protect crops have been in place for decades.  Without any consultation with the stakeholders involved, the Minister appears to have removed from tillage farmers their most effective form of crop protection and then created even more uncertainty by failing to make a clear statement with regard to a possible deferral.  The conservation status of the wood pigeon is not threatened.  The September 2018 final report on the review of the derogation process put its population at an estimated 2.8 million and classified it as secure.  With more than 300,000 ha of land being used by tillage farmers, the majority of it for cereal crops, these farms produced 1.8 million tonnes in 2018, which was actually down on the previous year, according to the Central Statistics Office.</p> <p> The Minister will come back and tell me that a farmer can apply for a section 42 licence, but the reality is that this is counterproductive for tillage farming and crop protection.  The farmer may apply to take appropriate steps but that application is subject to an assessment being carried out first by National Parks and Wildlife Service staff.  Only then will a permit be granted, after the damage is done to the crops.  I urge the Minister, on behalf of the tillage farmers of this State and the thousands of responsible game and conservation club members, to give clarification on this matter and ensure that any further decisions by her Department in this regard are taken in consultation with the stakeholders involved.</p> <p> Second, will the Minister provide a detailed breakdown of staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service on a county-by-county basis?  Rural Ireland needs to be confident that staff levels are sufficient but, right now, that confidence is simply not there.</p> <p> Finally, of the approximately &euro;14 million in licence fees that is taken in every three years from legally held firearms in this State, not including the tax receipts from secondary retail component sales or repairs, not a red cent is put back into the clubs that provide a vital service in relation to conservation and preservation.  The perception is that everything these organisations contribute to rural Ireland is entirely forgotten.  In the 1990s, the native grey partridge, one of only two native game bird species in Ireland, was on the brink of extinction, with only 20 birds nationwide.  The national grey partridge conservation project, carried out in conjunction with the NARGC, was launched in 2006.  Today, that bird's population is more than 900.  How is this money being spent and why is it not contributing back into the local organisations that have provided services to this State, essentially free of charge, in terms of conservation and preservation?</p></speech>

They have done a huge amount of work online and I am well aware of the challenges they face.  I thank the Deputy for also mentioning rural and regional museums.  We are working very closely with the Irish Museums Association and the directors of the Council of National Cultural Institutions on a plan of action.  For the national cultural institutions, reopening obviously poses a series of different challenges, particularly for the theatre sector, which the Deputy also mentioned.  We are doing everything we can to assist with that.</p>  <p>  I congratulate Deputy Clark on her election.  Regarding wood pigeons, she is probably aware that I am allowed to make annual derogations under the birds directive allowing for the capturing and killing of some listed species for air safety and where there is a threat to public health or risk of serious damage to crops.</p> <p>Scientific advice was given to me by my officials who propose removing the wood pigeon as they suggested there is limited evidence to suggest that they do, in fact, cause serious damage to crops over the summer.  However, serious concerns have been raised by Deputies and other stakeholders with me about the exclusion of the wood pigeon because of damage to crop yields and some of the other reasons mentioned.  That includes damage to crops that make it difficult to harvest.  There is also contamination which makes it particularly difficult for tillage farmers.  As a result, the status quo is being reinstated for the wood pigeon this year.  Lethal means will be permitted by land owners in June, July and August to prevent crop damage.  The Deputy also mentioned section 42 licences.  An expected surge of those was going to come to my Department and we would not have capacity to deal with a deluge of licences during the Covid-19 crisis.  The Deputy might have mentioned the grey partridge.</p></speech>

Last week the Ceann Comhairle did the same.  I watched and read back on what six Deputies had done and the Ceann Comhairle intervened with regard to my time and he has done the same this week.  I asked that the clock reflects this and that it does not count.  I will speak for less then two minutes now and allow the Minister time to respond and to allow Deputy Stanley to have two minutes if that is in order.</p>  <p>  As it happens, I will not need all of my time because I welcome the Minister's decision regarding wood pigeon shooting.  It was very unfortunate, and I hope the Minister agrees, that the decision in the first place was made without consultation.  My question and request of the Minister is if she will ensure that decisions such as this in future do not happen before consultation takes place with the stakeholders.  In this instance, it was tillage farmers and game clubs that were affected.  I would also like the Minister to give an opinion on whether, considering these issues come up time and again, and as we speak about Government negotiations, that the issues in this regard would be better served by a different Department.</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of the peat harvest and domestic turf cutting on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs.  Bord na M&oacute;na has not been able to commence the peat harvest, including at Kilberry near the Ceann Comhairle, and domestic turf cutters have not been able to start on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs.</p> <p>That is due to the decision on planning consent being held up.  It was supposed to be dealt with in March but that was not done.  The jobs of hundreds of Bord na M&oacute;na workers are at risk.  Hundreds of thousands of households in the midlands are facing a winter without fuel because of the ban on domestic turf cutting.</p> <p> Although peat harvesting is to be wound down as part of a just transition, it was meant to happen in an orderly manner over eight to nine years, with domestic turf cutting to continue.  We have had three months of exceptional weather but Bord na M&oacute;na staff and turf cutters have been confined to standing on the sidelines or looking out through a window at the sun shining and the harvest going down the drain.  What has happened is a scandal.  The Department and the Government knew this problem was going to arise given the outcome of the High Court case last October but they did not bring in legislation to avert it.  Only now is the application for a substitute being considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Leave to apply for consent was supposed to be dealt with before 10 March.  It was held up because of Covid.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with this issue.</p> <p> The effect of this issue is that peat harvesting or domestic turf-cutting cannot commence on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs until mid-June at the earliest.  At that stage, the best four months of weather will be gone.  That is outrageous.  I am aware we cannot interfere with the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but I am asking the Minister to get one of her senior officials to contact An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ask it to process the decision as quickly as possible because too much time has been lost.  I asked the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to get an official from his Department to do the same.  I also ask the Minister to ensure that a provision allowing for domestic turf cutting to continue on these bogs is included in the programme for Government her party is negotiating with Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.</p></speech>

That would make it somewhat easier to apply.  Obviously, it is quite cumbersome to be obliged to apply for planning permission for leave for substituted consent.  As the Deputy recognised, it is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Several jobs will be created in the midlands.  There will be vacancies for machine operators, engineers, hydrologists, ecologists, environmental scientists, site supervisors, community liaison personnel and staff to evaluate amenity development potential.  There will be a significant amount of work available there.</p></speech>

Turf may be harvested from non-designated bogs in accordance with guidelines.  No more than two persons should be on a bog at any one time.  A rotation system could be agreed in advance by text or WhatsApp.  Those cutting turf must do so and then leave the bog.  Each individual must travel separately to the bog unless people are from the same household.  Obviously, they cannot be over 70.  They must bring identification or proof of ownership of the turf bank or have a turbary right.</p>  <p>  I think Deputy Carthy mentioned public consultation.  I have now reinstated public consultation, so I accept his point in that regard.  The reconfiguration of any Department is a matter for the party leaders involved in the Government negotiations.</p></speech>

I have read them.</p>  <p>  Last week, I raised with her in the House the fact that I envisage that a considerable or small portion of the Department's budget cannot be expended in particular spheres because of Covid-19 and public performances being suspended, among other things.  Is she in a position to outline an internal or departmental road map in respect of how such resources can be reallocated to support various sectors within her Department?</p> <p>Of course, this relates to performance artists, musicians and all of those who are unable to practise their particular profession.</p> <p> On heritage, the subject of today's discussions, will the Minister provide more detail on top of what she already mentioned in her opening remarks on the importance of supporting our heritage centres throughout the country to promote tourism?  We will see a significant amount of holidaying in Ireland when all of this ends - something that we should encourage - because people will be reluctant to get onto aircraft, which is understandable.  From the Department's perspective, are there any initiatives it proposes to roll out in tandem with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to highlight and encourage such activities?  In terms of historic buildings and our national heritage sites, we should ensure that these facilities are marketed in Ireland to Irish people as destinations.  Are there plans within the Department to improve the facilities being provided, including organising activities at these sites and similar endeavours?  Perhaps the Minister would provide a brief outline of any proposals in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100061#QQQ00200"><p>The Deputy touched briefly on culture there and obviously my Department is working very closely with all art organisations and with the Arts Council in particular to determine how we can support the sector overall.  Obviously, the collective national impact of increasing access will have to be assessed and not just the safety of the individual cultural outlets.  We must consider the audiences as well as the participants.  This sector was one of the first to be hit and will be one of the last to get back on track.  Under the road map, national museums and galleries are not due to reopen until 20 July and theatres are not due to reopen until 10 August, all things being equal.</p>  <p>  The key word here is engagement and I and officials in my Department are in constant engagement with the sector.  An expert advisory group was set up a short while ago and is due to report back in a few weeks.  The group will give advice to the Arts Council on how to move forward.  The Arts Council has carried out a number of different surveys in an attempt to get more information on how it can help and how people themselves feel they can be helped.</p>  <p>  In terms of the approach in the road map, the criteria that must be taken into account include whether an activity or event is safe in terms of public health and whether it is rational in terms of its social and economic benefits.  We must also consider whether the decision is evidence informed.  In that context, we must use all of the data and research available to guide our thinking.  Another consideration is whether it is fair, ethical and respects human dignity and whether it is open and transparent.  Decisions must be clear and well communicated.  Obviously we must also consider the whole of society, based on the concept of solidarity and supporting cohesion as we exit the lockdown over time.  These are all extremely important considerations, as are research actions being carried out by the Arts Council.  The council is engaged in forecasting based on projected figures.  It estimates a loss of &euro;2.9 million in income per month.  It has also conducted a survey of 165 organisations to identify the impact on audiences, a survey of artists as well as a survey of strategically funded organisations.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of shovel-ready heritage projects which we hope to roll out over the coming months to try to boost the sector.  I agree with Deputy Farrell's comments, having worked in this Department which has a huge width and breadth.</p> <p>In each part of each sector we need to come up with innovative approaches and to have, as the Deputy said, a sort of alignment with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other Departments, particularly around tourism.  Heritage is very closely interlinked with that and we want to have that alignment in terms of moving forward because Ireland can still showcase its wonderful heritage sites.  We have some incredible UNESCO heritage sites in this country and we might have more applications, given the date for applications to become a world heritage site has been extended to March 2021 to allow local authorities to nominate other areas around the country.  Some of these sites help in terms of enhancing tourism and attracting tourists to this country, and heritage is very closely linked with that.  I completely agree with the Deputy on that point.</p> <p> We have to be open throughout as to what we are doing, and we are fully transparent in everything we are trying to do.  We are working on botanical attractions as well as presentation and improvement projects, and we are talking to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and local chambers in terms of what we can do.  I know the Heritage Council does a vast amount of work in this sphere and has undertaken a number of different surveys with a view to finding out what it can do to try to assist in the sector.  There has been a huge loss of revenue from caf&eacute;s and franchises.  Even though the national parks and reserves have stayed open continuously, and indeed the National Parks and Wildlife Service rangers have been working 24-7 since Covid arrived, the caf&eacute;s and visitor sites themselves are closed.  The parks and reserves remained open not from a tourism perspective but purely from a public health perspective because, obviously, it is good for people's mental health to get out and about in the fresh air.  However, we are conscious that we want to get this sector and those visitor sites back up and running.  For example, Muckross Park had to close completely and there will be a loss of revenue in that regard.  While all 86 outdoor spaces have remained open, many seasonal jobs have been lost and we must also consider the situation of franchises and businesses like bicycle hire, small local enterprise offices and so on.  We also had to close Glenveagh Castle, the archaeological sector will be quite badly affected and will have a real downturn, and there has also been huge damage to sole traders.</p> <p> One positive is that under the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040, some &euro;300 million is going into built heritage and natural heritage over the next period.  That will give a boost although, again, we can have the infrastructure but not the people in it, so it only goes so far.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have any comment with regard to unspent resources?  Heritage week is something an awful lot of people look forward to every year, myself included.  I always take the opportunity to get in the car and take the kids off to some facility they perhaps have never been to in the midlands or sometimes a little bit further away, but it is a usual event in my family that, on a Sunday, we tend to go off to one of our wonderful national heritage facilities.  The Minister might take a moment to deal with that issue.</p>  <p>  To tie in with what I was talking about earlier in regard to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport trying to tie into the whole idea of encouraging people to utilise the resources at our fingertips across the country, there is the idea of a "Destination (insert county name here)" - Fingal for myself, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown for the Minister or wherever it might be.  We need to encourage the Department to hook in with those local authorities and the governing Department to try to encourage visits to certain facilities across the country.  In the short time she has left, the Minister might provide an answer to that question.</p></speech>

Most of the 31 local authorities have an <i>in situ </i>heritage officer who does a lot of work in the community and we also give them some funding.</p> <p> Heritage Week will be going ahead but, obviously, it will be in a different format to previous years.  Since the emergence of the crisis, we have been deliberating on how we can best deliver it.  We will be inviting people to undertake projects that will culminate during Heritage Week.  People can explore the topic and the theme this year is heritage and education and learning from our heritage.  This year, Heritage Week will take place between 15 and 23 August.  We will be able to showcase online most of what the public has gathered together.  I thank the Deputy for his contribution.</p> <p> To answer the other question, the Department never has a surplus and people definitely get bang for their buck and we use every cent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100063#SSS00200"><p>This is national biodiversity week and the Minister will agree that the pandemic has slowed our pace of life, narrowed our scope of travel and silenced much of the noise around us.  It has done so to a point where awareness of the living world around us has never been more acute.  It is not just the big stuff, but insects, flowering plants and what is in rockpools.  Incidentally, on entering Leinster House last week, I found a popular hawk moth on the ground and picked him up and put him somewhere safe.  It is everywhere; it is in our cities, including here in the heart of Dublin.</p><p>We cannot say with certainty that the shutting down of economic and social life in Ireland has had a positive impact on biodiversity.  Noticing nature more does not necessarily mean there is more of it about.  What we do know, however, is that despite the best and vastly under-resourced efforts of conservationists, we are losing our wild plants, fish, insects, birds and mammals at an alarming rate.  Last year, the House declared a climate and biodiversity emergency.  At that time, the sixth report to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity painted a disturbing picture on the fate of global wildlife.  In Ireland, a third of all bee species could be extinct by 2030, our butterfly populations have declined by 12% in a decade and more than half of our fresh waters are polluted.  More than 90% of our protected habitats are classified as being of unfavourable conservation status, including our marine environment.</p><p>It is not all bad news, however.  As a member of a local authority heritage forum for 16 years, I took part in some amazing work at local government level to raise awareness of our biodiversity.  Our heritage officer network is, in my view, one of our great assets in promoting community engagement and participation in natural heritage.  Heritage week is the culmination of that success in engagement.  For a very modest outlay on the heritage officer programme, a great deal has been achieved.</p><p>In Kilkenny, we adopted <i>Bombus hortorum</i>, the garden bumblebee, as our county insect.  Perhaps it was an obvious choice given that it is black and amber but it was not just a symbolic gesture, there was very real intent behind it.  We also became the first local authority in Ireland to adopt the all-Ireland pollinator plan, a hugely successful initiative that needs to be expanded and adequately funded.</p><p>The National Biodiversity Data Centre is doing incredible work in promoting and mapping wild Ireland.  I was fortunate to have been involved in several projects supported by the data centre; from Daubenton's bat surveys to the mapping of invasive species on the river Nore and her tributaries.  An expansion of this citizen and science-led approach will have the dual benefit of filling in the gaps in data on species and increasing awareness and appreciation of our natural world.  The void in our lives created by Covid can be filled and fulfilled by quieter time spent closer to nature.</p><p>I welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, that he will allocate funding for Tidy Towns groups throughout the country despite the cancellation of the 2020 competition.  We are all aware of the amazing work being done by Tidy Towns groups throughout the country, particularly in the context of biodiversity, promoting no-mow areas, eliminating herbicide use and creating bug hotels and habitats for birds and bats.  Tidy Towns, along with the green schools programme, is one of the great community-based environmental successes of recent years.</p><p>My colleague, Dr. Cathy Fitzgerald, an eco-social art practitioner based in Carlow, has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Across the Irish Art Sector, we must urgently promote why independent cultural responses are vital alongside science in sustainability initiatives.  Creativity has a key, if yet under-acknowledged role to inspire relevant Earthcaring values and practices to our communities, for all our futures. </blockquote>  <p>She is referring to the role the arts community can play in encouraging a deeper awareness and consciousness of our natural heritage.  Exploring such a notion within local authorities and within the Arts Council could help transform our relationship with nature and provide sustainable employment through arts practice development on ecological issues.</p> <p>I hope that this can be explored further with whoever forms the next Government. </p> <p> The national biodiversity expenditure review carried out by the NPWS found that there remains a historic underspend on biodiversity as a percentage of total Government expenditure.  Within that spend, 80% is through agricultural subsidies, 10% operational costs and 6% on salaries.  The disparity of spend between the State and local government is quite telling.  Some 96.6% of all spend on biodiversity is by central government, with only 1.2% spent by local government.  However, it is through local government actions that people and communities engage most on awareness and conservation.  Even a modest increase in funding to local government and to the National Biodiversity Data Centre could be transformative.  The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, whose chief executive spoke at the national biodiversity conference at Dublin Castle just last year, recommends that countries spend at least 0.3% of GDP on biodiversity.  We are way below that minimum.  Agriculture accounts for 75% of Ireland's expenditure on biodiversity, through agri-environmental measures in subsidies.  Some 90% of the spend was linked to terrestrial ecosystems, a shameful neglect of our marine ecosystems which are many times greater in extent.  The scariest thing is that only 2% to 4% was linked to actual capital investment in nature.  Capital investment in nature is what is needed to reverse biodiversity loss</p> <p> When do we actually decide to take nature seriously and spend accordingly?  When do we decide that nature, the web of life on which all humans depend, is a need to have, not just a nice to have?  Do we need to wait for our pollinators to be threatened with extinction?  Do we need to wait for the entire country to be a monoculture of rye grass and Sitka spruce?  Can we say that now, in Biodiversity Week 2020, one year after the declaration in this House of a biodiversity and climate emergency, that we will transform how we fund and support through policy our biodiversity?  I understand that the NPWS is working on a financial needs assessment to determine the level of expenditure that is needed to deliver the national biodiversity action plan.  Funding to environmental NGOs must be increased through this.</p> <p> Access to nature can be a refuge of healing and calm during these dark days.  I would like to think we all value it more through this pandemic and would want our policy makers to invest in conservation and restoration.  I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister towards nature but we need a renewed commitment in this House that we will not only halt biodiversity loss but enhance, conserve and protect our natural world with leadership and a shared vision.</p></speech>

We have done a huge amount over the last number of years.  I have been in this Department for two and a half years and we have significantly increased the funding.  Primarily, what the Deputy spoke about is biodiversity and species, really.  We have the national biodiversity action plan, which commenced in 2017 and will conclude in 2021.  There will be an opportunity at that stage to perhaps draft another biodiversity action plan.  It is based on the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the overarching international agreement which underpins the global biodiversity framework.  My Department is the lead authority for that biodiversity action plan but we work with other stakeholders as well.  It is the third one and it is an all-of-Government document.  The progress is monitored through the biodiversity working group, which meets twice a year, and the independent advisory group, the Biodiversity Forum.</p>  <p>  I think the Deputy or perhaps Deputy Farrell mentioned local biodiversity projects.  We have given &euro;2 million over three years to local authorities.  We have a partnership with the Community Foundation of Ireland in terms of 56 projects that it was working on last year.  My Department gave &euro;100,000 towards that.  We also have the heritage plan, the strategy of which I launched in November 2018.  It is now out for public consultation.  This will be an all-encompassing heritage plan.  We can make it as ambitious as we can, including from a practical perspective.  It is so important when we are talking about biodiversity, and certainly from my experience, that we bring people with us.  It is often the smallest projects that really make such a difference.</p> <p>It is about getting communities involved.  A number of Deputies today said that they developed green fingers over recent weeks and that they have really taken an interest in biodiversity in a way they had not before.  Deputy Noonan's comments on species are important, as is the status of protected habitats and species, which I am acutely aware of.  In 2019 I published a third report on the assessment of the status of habitats and species that Ireland is required to protect under the EU habitats directive.  They make up much of our mountains, lakes and coasts, our fresh waters and our seas and are the large part of our territory and heritage.  The report is based on a substantial body of scientific work that has been carried out over the past six years.  Overall, the picture of the plant and animal species is substantially better with more than 70% stable or increasing mainly because Ireland is the stronghold for many of the listed species.  It is also encouraging that a wide range of species from whales to tiny plants have healthy populations and prospects.  Some species, however, such as freshwater pearl mussel are still in trouble.  We have prepared a priority action framework up to 2027, which we are currently looking at.  This identifies the financing needs and priorities that need to be dealt with.  They are directly linked to the specific conservation measures that are encompassed in the Natura 2000 network of protected areas.</p></speech>

I am certainly a nature lover.  I am a committed angler and like other Deputies and many people throughout the country I have seen a silver lining in this pandemic by enjoying nature and in being allowed to enjoy nature more than we usually are.</p>  <p>  I shall front load my contribution with some questions and I would appreciate a written response from the Minister to anything she does not get to reply to here.</p>  <p>  The all-Ireland pollinator plan is reaching the end of its natural life.  It is a five-year plan from 2015 to 2020.  My assessment is, as Deputy Noonan has also said, that it has been a successful plan. I believe it has been successful because it won the hearts and minds of people around pollinators and raising awareness.  Eight or nine years ago our local authority introduced a wildflower meadow policy.  It was deeply unpopular.  People living in housing estates felt it was just an excuse by the local authority not to cut the grass.  The hearts and minds had not been won.  When we go canvassing now and meet people we see grass verges that have been appropriated for wildflower meadows or little wildflower stretches.  It is a wonderful success.  Is the Minister or her Department planning specific measures to improve the next five year all-Ireland pollinator plan 2021-2025?</p>  <p>  I shall now turn to the destruction of hedgerows.  It is happening up and down the country in almost every county.  It can happen on a relatively large scale or on a smaller scale.  Each occurrence of it, be it inside or outside nesting season, is a disaster for biodiversity and nature.  Is the Minister satisfied with the detection rates for hedgerow destruction and with the prosecution rates against these crimes?  I am aware the National Parks and Wildlife Service works very hard to combat this and I commend the service on this element of its work, which is a difficult job.  I would appreciate the Minister's comments on this.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise again a matter that was raised last week which is the raptor buzzard deaths at Timoleague.  The deaths occurred in December but we were only made aware of them recently.  This is only the latest incident.  It happens in Wicklow, but is also happening up and down the west coast from Donegal down to Cork in particular.  Our birds of prey and our raptors are being targeted.  The majesty of these birds and what they bring to tourism and to the variety of our nature offering cannot be quantified.  It almost hurts more when one sees this happening.  It is an awful crime against nature.  Does the Minister support conservationists' calls for setting up a wildlife crimes unit?  If not, does the Minister have a better idea for how to tackle these crimes?  There are very few crimes against nature more wounding than seeing the deliberate poisoning of our birds of prey and our raptors.</p> <p> My final question relates to the EU biodiversity strategy that was published yesterday.  As it was made public only yesterday, the Minister has probably not had a chance to digest it, but there are some interesting elements in it.  A proposal in the strategy calls for one third of nature protection sites to be strictly protected.  We interpret that as meaning that they should have no human activity.  Particularly in the case of beaches or elements of bogland that are open to the public and that the public respect and use appropriately, would it preclude people from using parts of our beaches and that kind of land if the strategy were implemented in the way we have interpreted it?  I am interested in the Minister's thoughts on that.</p> <p> I will conclude with a comment.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, does a very good job - a very tough job - of protecting wildlife and biodiversity.  It is a battle it fights against local, national and global environmental trends.  Nevertheless, it is not always right and it does not always make the correct decisions.  In the context of coastal erosion at the Burrow in Portrane, the NPWS would not listen to local people, local public representatives or independent experts when we all said we needed coastal protection measures to protect the dunes and the very habitat the NPWS wanted to preserve.  We lost many years in our fight against coastal protection at the Burrow in Portrane because of the NPWS's intransigence, rigidity and inability to communicate effectively, not only with public representatives and local people but also with the local authority.</p> <p> Those dunes are now gone.  Property has fallen into the sea, homes continue to be threatened and local businesses are on the verge of also falling into the sea.  Important local amenities such as public toilets are only centimetres away from being destroyed.  Measures are being put in place but those lost years will never be got back.  Thanks to the proactive nature of the Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, who visited the site a couple of years ago, he managed to get the various stakeholders on board, including the NPWS, but it was too slow.  It continues to be too slow and those years are gone.</p> <p> I hope the Minister hears this message clearly and the intent with which it is given.  While I acknowledge, as I have done previously, the great job the NPWS does in respect of hedgerow destruction, in its job of protecting wildlife, habitats and, ultimately, the community in Portrane it failed utterly.  That habitat and the terns that were nesting there, for which they were protected, are now gone because they have nowhere left to nest.  The community is vulnerable and more properties will go.  It is important the Minister is cognisant of that and that a clear message goes to the NPWS that sometimes it is important to listen to the community, representatives and independent experts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="20:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100066#VVV00200"><p>I will try to cover all the Deputy's questions.  The coastal protection measures in Portrane have been enabled by the National Parks and Wildlife Service so, with respect, the Deputy is not correct in that regard.  The agency with primary responsibility is Fingal County Council, as he may be aware.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service responded within weeks to the temporary sea protections being put in.  From a special areas of conservation perspective, natural erosion takes place and it would not be appropriate to put protective structures in place for them, although that is perhaps slightly different.</p>  <p>  On the EU biodiversity strategy, the Deputy is correct that it was released only yesterday.  It is to be very much welcomed.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and I will have a meeting next week with the parliamentary state secretary to the German federal minister, Dr. Maria Flachsbarth, specifically relating to the contents of the strategy, in advance of the German Presidency of the European Council.  It will be a good opportunity to discuss the strategy in more detail.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of the national pollinator plan.  That does not just relate to my Department but is a cross-agency initiative, as the Deputy is probably aware.  I take on board some of the points he made.  Animal pollination plays a vital role in regulating ecosystems, but we can always look at enhancing and improving plans that are already in existence.</p> <p> The Deputy mentioned buzzards.  The incident that happened with them in Cork was shocking.  I know we are speaking about buzzards in general terms but I did an interview on "Morning Ireland" on RT&Eacute; Radio One specifically on that incident and also answering the question whether we need a wildlife crime unit.  We have such a unit in the Department, which is headed up by principal officer John Fitzgerald.  There is strong legislation on wildlife.  In section 74 of the Wildlife Act 1976, one of the penalties on summary conviction is a six months' imprisonment.  There is also a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000 on indictment or two years' imprisonment or both.  I am not sure if we can go any further than that.  We have had a number of different prosecutions in recent years for poisoning.  The grey heron in County Louth was the last one in 2016 but there was also a case in 2014 where two defendants were poisoning birds in quarries in Waterford and they were fined &euro;8,000.  In fairness to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, it does a huge amount of work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have a memorandum of understanding there as well.  The raptor, our bird of prey, is one of the success stories we have in Ireland.</p> <p> The Deputy mentioned the cutting of hedges.  The Wildlife Acts dictate when hedge cutting can take place, namely from September to February, and the Minister does not have any discretion in that.  Roadside hedge cutting will always be allowed for safety purposes.  Other hedge cutting is allowed for agricultural and forestry purposes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100067#WWW00200"><p>It is a little over a year since Ireland declared a climate and biodiversity emergency.  We were one of the first countries in the world to do so and it was a significant milestone for our nation.  It was a time when we made a public acknowledgement that we needed to place a much greater emphasis on our wildlife and nature and our place in it.  At the time, I was a councillor on Wicklow County Council and Wicklow was the first county in Ireland to declare a climate and biodiversity emergency.  The momentum for that declaration came from the ground up.  It came from ordinary people such as mothers, fathers and children in Wicklow.  They wanted us to hear their concerns about how we were managing our environment.  They wanted us to acknowledge that the approach we had been taking was wrong and that we needed to step up and start protecting our natural world.</p>  <p>  At the time, I was conscious this could not just be a virtue signal but that this declaration had to be followed by action because action is what the environment needs.  There has been a lot of action.  There has been a lot of talk about biodiversity and the all-Ireland pollinator plan and there is a much greater awareness in our communities about how individuals can improve their local patch.  That is to be applauded because a lot of good work is going on.  At a national level, we need to work a lot harder, faster and smarter.  We need to make decisions that are science-based, ecologically sound and have an environmental objective at their heart.  When it comes to addressing biodiversity loss, one of the key things we need to do is to protect the biodiversity we have.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, we have seen a number of incidents where we have failed to protect our heritage, environment and wildlife.  First, there have been a number of illegal fires burning across the country.  At a time when the nation was in lockdown, huge tracts of land were destroyed by fire.  In my constituency of Wicklow, there were six fires in April, mainly on State land in national parks.  More than 400 ha of protected land was destroyed along with the wildlife therein.  It also impacted heavily on the air quality in the area, the headwaters of the Liffey and the drinking water that feeds Dublin.  It puts the lives of our firefighters at risk to deal with these fires.  Unfortunately, these fires are not one-off events.  In one area of commonage in the Wicklow Mountains National Park, there have been illegal burns on the same land for 11 years out of a 19-year period up to 2019.  This land will take years to recover from an environmental perspective.</p> <p>We can no longer tolerate these annual illegal fires and all efforts need to go towards ensuring they do not happen.  I welcome the fact that the Department is going to use drones to monitor the affected areas.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and fire service have done considerable work on fire prevention but these services are stretched to capacity and need more resources.</p> <p> Our national parks need active management plans.  Currently, only two of our national parks have management plans and both of these are 11 years out of date.  Our national parks have very few by-laws to enable the rangers to manage what happens within them so in many instances their hands are tied.  These are problems that could easily be rectified and this should be a focus of the Government.  What are the Minister's plans to update and develop the management plans for the national parks?  Will she agree to create a series of by-laws to enable our rangers to protect these important natural resources?</p> <p> In recent weeks, we have been made aware of the illegal killing, in January, of 23 buzzards in Cork, as mentioned in the Chamber.  The enormity of this killing is shocking.  Twenty-three birds of a protected species that until relatively recently were considered extinct in Ireland have been killed.  It is also shocking that the public became aware of the incident, which happened in January, only in May, via social media reports.  I understand there is an ongoing investigation but I would have believed a killing to this extent, which occurred without the landowner's knowledge and involved the use of a highly toxic, illegal chemical, would have resulted in a public safety issue.  I acknowledge the landowner who notified the Garda and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the crime and I thank him for his vigilance.  It is great to see him working with the authorities.</p> <p> This was one of the largest known killings of raptors in this country.  I imagine, however, that many more such incidents occur regularly and that what is being reported is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the persecution of birds of prey.  How, therefore, do we go about protecting these vulnerable species and environments?  I strongly believe we need greater transparency and accountability where wildlife crime is concerned.  Until the true extent of the issue is laid bare for all to see, it will be easy for it to go unreported, unacknowledged and unmanaged.</p> <p> Will the Minister consider establishing a register of illegal fires, whereby they may be recorded as they happen in our national parks and special areas of conservation each year?  A mapped register would be an important visual record of where fires are happening and how often they are happening.  Once the true extent of this problem is known, we will be in a better position to manage it.</p> <p> The Minister, in addition to holding people to account for illegal fires, which was mentioned, should consider establishing a wildlife crime unit within the Garda to assist the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I am aware there is already a good relationship between national parks and the garda&iacute; at local level but it needs to be formalised and resourced fully through a specialised central Garda unit, as was done in the United Kingdom.  This would assist in ensuring that those who perpetrate the crimes are held to account.</p> <p> There are ways in which we can fix the problems but we also need to celebrate the positives.  Many positives were talked about earlier.  Many of us will have seen the amazing images and footage of the basking sharks swimming off the west coast over recent weeks.  This species was once brought to the brink of extinction owing to commercial hunting but now, with that pressure having been removed and with NGOs working to monitor and protect the species, it would appear to be starting to recover.  We are now being treated with the inspirational spectacles we saw online.  We need to take this success and build on it with the creation of marine national parks, marine conservation zones and management plans to protect and enhance this still-endangered species.  We need to resource properly the agencies and NGOs to undertake this important work.  When we talk about rewilding our environment, we need to be talking about these success stories.  We are giving a species some space and protection to find its ecological balance again, which means it can thrive.  Ireland has the potential to have an amazing natural environment, one that we can connect with, enjoy and be proud of.</p> <p> When Wicklow County Council declared the emergency last year, I was talking to two young boys in my constituency, Se&aacute;n and Conn, who had been campaigning for the declaration.  They were very worried about the environment and the direction we were going in.  They asked me why politicians always say they will aim to do something and why they cannot just do it.  When it comes to protecting our environment and biodiversity in Ireland, it is time we just did it.</p></speech>

You have to aim in order to do.  It is important to say that.</p> <p>My track record on heritage for which I increased the budget by 15% last year demonstrates my commitment to this area.</p> <p> The Deputy has gone through a number of different issues.  There were six fires in County Wicklow.  I acknowledge that she welcomes that drones will now be used.  It is important to note that if the National Parks and Wildlife Service had not been on duty, there would have been multiples of that number of fires in Wicklow alone.  Last weekend, the Department, with other partners, covered all threatened areas with the drones and we will continue to do that.  We work continuously to enhance, as the Deputy mentioned, the resources available to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p> <p> Regarding the buzzards, members of the public locally were aware of the poisoning with carbofuran, which is extremely toxic and dangerous to human beings and has been a banned substance since, I believe, June 2009.  However, people buy it illegally.  There were therefore two crimes, namely, the purchase of the substance and the deliberate poisoning in such a malicious act.  NGOs were involved and eventually the matter became public knowledge.  However, because wildlife crime, in particular poisoning, is notoriously difficult to prosecute, the Garda had specifically asked us not to raise the matter publicly because they did not want to jeopardise the chances of success.  That is why, even though the incident occurred in January, it only came to light recently.  We are still in that process.  We have had a lot of success, as I mentioned, in trying to tackle these types of crimes.  Wildfires are also a type of crime, and we have had prosecutions in that regard.  I appreciate that the Deputy is from Wicklow and is particularly conscious of this issue.  In Wicklow 418 ha were burned.  Preliminary investigations indicate this was done for agricultural purposes.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and my Department have supplied cross-compliance to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

The darkness of the pandemic has drawn us to parks, canals and other amenities to which we would not normally be drawn, and that is a very good thing.  There is a new appreciation for our surroundings, which is also a really good thing.  Canals such as the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal are probably being more used than ever because they are good amenities, they are near people's houses and there are no cars in their immediate vicinity.</p>  <p>  Many people will holiday in Ireland this summer.  The vast majority of people will not travel outside of the State.  Will the Department consider making the cultural and heritage sites in the State available to families at concessionary rates or free of charge?  These sites are quite expensive for families.  Will the Department consider making sites owned by the State free of charge to families who present at them?</p></speech>

I am not sure whether he was here earlier when I mentioned caf&eacute;s, franchises and so forth on historical sites.  There has been a huge loss of revenue for that sector, and the Heritage Council has carried out a number of surveys in which we have seen that.  Some of the sites are free; some are not.  There has been increased awareness about heritage, so it would be good to see families continue to use such sites.  As the Deputy said, most people will staycation, to use that word, over the coming months.</p> <p>Although the national parks and reserves have been open the entire time, the centres have not.  We will always consider everything but this needs to be put in the context of resources and the fact that there has already been a demonstrative impact on the economics of heritage in general.  The point Deputy Gino Kenny is making is really that we should give a boost to or kick-start it.  Obviously, we are considering all of those options.</p></speech>

In recent months, car access has been restricted in the Phoenix Park.  I think the Phoenix Park is the second largest city park in the world.  Central Park in New York is the biggest, although I might not be correct on that.  Anyway, it is an amazing amenity in the city of Dublin.  Will the Minister review the use of cars, especially around the side roads of the Phoenix Park?  Obviously, the main thoroughfare should be available for car use.  Will the Minister consider banning cars from certain roads in the Phoenix Park?</p></speech>

My understanding is that it would be primarily the responsibility of Dublin City Council in terms of car parking.  It would not be via my Department.  It does not come within my remit.  Certainly, it is something the Deputy could raise with the local authority in terms of car parks, etc.</p></speech>

Would the State support the idea of having gatherings in public spaces where physical distancing is adhered to?  There could be performances by poets and singers and so on in spaces such as the Phoenix Park on a small scale that adhere to physical distancing as instructed by the authorities.</p></speech>

The Deputy may wish to contact the OPW about the previous issue.</p>  <p>  While it is good that we have many artists using online media to showcase their work, it is not desirable in the long-term and we want to see artists able to perform in an outdoor space such as the Phoenix Park or other such places.  Obviously, that can be explored.  We are constantly in contact with the Arts Council, which primarily deals with artists, in respect of how we can do that.</p></speech>

First, I wish to pay tribute to the National Famine Commemoration committee volunteers.  The committee has done an extraordinary amount of campaigning work and has pushed for proper appropriate commemoration of the Famine.  Part of the work has involved pushing for a full recognised State day with a consistent date in the calendar.  A Bill relating to this matter passed Second Stage in the previous D&aacute;il.  The Famine was commemorated last Sunday and the Minister was present.  Will the National Famine Commemoration Day be brought under the remit of the Minister and that of her Department?  Will we have a fixed day that will be consistently the same every year?  I understand that it will be the third Sunday of May each year.</p>  <p>  A reply to a parliamentary question suggests that the event will be held in Buncrana, County Donegal, in 2021.  Will the Minister confirm that the event will be held on the third Sunday in May in Buncrana next year?</p></speech>

Last year we were in Sligo and although it rained for the entire afternoon, it was very poignant.  The Taoiseach attended with me last year.</p> <p> It is an important commemoration and I felt this year it received much more attention.  That may well be as a result of Covid-19 and the fact that people relate, to a certain extent, more with the Famine than they used to.  People often saw it as something abstract that happened between 1845 and 1849 and which did not have any impact on a day-to-day basis.  Now people realise that one can die not from dysentery, smallpox or famine fever, as they did more than 100 years ago, but from Covid-19.  It is why the commemoration was such a success.</p> <p> This falls under my remit and I was very pleased with the attention it got this year.  It would be wrong to say the Famine, to a certain extent, has been neglected but perhaps it is not in people's consciousness in the way that it should be.  This year people realised how poignant and important it is to commemorate it.  Our commemorations this year primarily focus on Cork and I launched that programme on 2 January.  We are trying to work with Cork City Council and Cork County Council to commemorate the election of Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain and some of the assassinations in Cork.  Other commemorations will take place later in the year, including a commemoration of the burning of Cork.  We will be doing everything we can to work with people to commemorate adequately in a socially distancing world.</p></speech>

The matter I raise was also raised five and ten years ago in this Chamber and we are still no further along.  Moore Street is the birthplace of the Irish Republic.  The lanes and buildings that surround the street reverberate with the heroism of the people who were out in 1916.  The Moore Street battlefield site was the location of the final stand of many of the volunteers who fought in the GPO in 1916 and they came under heavy machine gun fire in the laneways around Moore Street.  They set up the final headquarters of the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic and the final council of war.  Moore Street is also wonderfully rich in architecture, with one of the last extant 18th century streetscapes in Dublin.  People will also know it is populated by a rich trading culture and when I was young the Moore Street trading culture was synonymous with Dublin culture.</p><p>The actions of the people out on Moore Street in 1916 were the precursor to the independence of this State and, I hope, on some sunny day the northern state as well.  The freedoms that we hold in this country are as a result of the heroism and actions of these men and women.  Interestingly enough, the Minister holds office in large part because of the actions of the people who were out in 1916.  There would be no Fine Gael Government in place today if not for the actions of the men and women out in 1916 and the action that took place on Moore Street.</p><p>Moore Street offers an opportunity as well as it is just off O'Connell Street and ideally located to serve as a vibrant new historical, cultural and trading quarter.  There are opportunities both for commercial interests and a successfully strengthened and rejuvenated street trading system.  I do not know if the Minister read <i>The Irish Times</i>today but Mr. Justice Max Barrett, a High Court judge, has stated that Moore Street is now a byword for urban neglect.</p> <p>Shockingly, after ten years of Fine Gael in government, the most important battlefield of the Republic is shrouded in grime and dereliction.  It is a place where people urinate and defecate and traders are assaulted.  Is it not an incredible indictment of our society and of the Government's actions over the past ten years that the birthplace of the Republic has become an open latrine?  It is so frustrating because this discussion has been had in this Chamber over the past ten years.  There have been expert groups, committees, reports, forums and never-ending discussions in Leinster House about Moore Street, but the net result of what the Minister and her predecessors have done is that Moore Street is still an isolated area of dereliction.  Will she implement the agreed recommendations of the Moore Street advisory group?</p> <p> I will focus on another matter relating to Moore Street.  It has been reported that a significant archaeological discovery of a midden has been found underneath the street.  It has been reported that this midden is Wood Quay II and could be one of the richest archaeological finds in the city in the past 30 years.  Courtney Deery has compiled reports on the midden, copies of which, I understand, are in the Department's possession.  Given the discovery's importance, will the Minister make a digital copy of the reports available to me and other Deputies?  Specifically, we are looking for "2016:713 - 14-16 Moore Street, North City, Dublin 1, Dublin".  Its author is Ms Linzi Simpson and the licence number is E004536; C494.  A second document is "2014:603 - 14-17 Moore Street, Dublin, Dublin", again authored by Ms Linzi Simpson, with the licence number of E004536 C392/C494.  I am giving this level of detail because I am worried that we will get another document that will not contain the specific information we need.</p> <p> The State owns the buildings of 14-17 Moore Street.  There is nothing stopping the Government from carefully renovating them and creating a heritage centre befitting the men and women of 1916, one that would rejuvenate the street and bring traders and other people back to it.  Will the Minister commit to doing this?</p> <p> There has been a radical collapse in the retail trade internationally, not just because of Covid-19, but as a result of the migration of retail from the high street to the Internet.  We know that the developer behind the battlefield site is in difficulty.  I am concerned that we have left the rejuvenation of Moore Street to be developer-dependent.  If it remains so, it will stay isolated and in dereliction.  Will the Government take responsibility and purchase the battlefield site?  Is it not time for the Government to become the engine of the site's rejuvenation rather than the agent of its dereliction?</p> <p> My final question on heritage relates to the Croppies Acre, a mass grave for the Irish rebel casualties of the 1798 rebellion.  The National Graves Association maintains that it was used to bury veterans of that conflict well afterwards, including Matthew Tone, brother of Theobald Wolfe Tone, and Bartholomew Teeling, who was hanged in Provost's Prison.  I understand there is a Fine Gael councillor on Dublin City Council who wishes to build a playground on it.  What next?  Are we going to build a caf&eacute; on Arbour Hill?  Are we going to build a gym in Glasnevin?  Can we not at this stage state that it is a nonsense to treat an important heritage site like the Croppies Acre in this manner?</p> <p> Galway 2020 events have been cancelled for many reasons over the past year and Galway City Council has been paid a significant amount of money for licences for events that never took place.  Will the council return that money to Galway 2020 and what has been the cost to the taxpayer to date?</p></speech>

I would give them my gratitude in that regard.</p><p>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  Moore Street does not have an extant 18th century streetscape.  The only surviving 18th century buildings on that street which are largely intact and have verifiable remnants of the Rising are the national monuments at 14-17 Moore Street, which the Deputy mentioned.</p><p>I do not propose to comment on the letter from Mr. Justice Barrett.

The Deputy and I have engaged many times over the last few years on the issue of Moore Street, in particular when he was spokesperson in another party.  My intention is to have the conservation of the national monument buildings, 14-17 Moore Street, completed as soon as possible, along with the 1916 commemorative quarter and overall redevelopment of the north inner city.  The National Monuments Service, the Office of Public Works, OPW, my Department and other agencies are liaising to progress the plans for the presentation of the monument to the public.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned Galway 2020.  This Government is fully committed to providing all of the funding it promised for Galway 2020, which amounts to &euro;15 million in total.  I have spoken at the EU Council of Culture Ministers on the issue, including the possibility of European Culture Programme funding for it into the future.  One of the main issues in regard to Galway 2020 is the legacy project.  We hope to do at least half of the programme later this year or early next year.</p></speech>

Arts and culture are the cornerstone of our society.  Creativity is vital to our health and wellbeing.  Culture and creativity are helping people through this crisis.  People are looking to the arts for inspiration and consolation.  Expectations of financial commitment will need to be revised across all sectors in light of the significant and necessary emergencies being introduced in response to the Covid-19 crisis.  It is imperative that investment in arts and culture in Ireland is safeguarded.  Can the Minister ensure that artists and organisations can plan for next year by immediately guaranteeing that, at least, the same level of investment in the Arts Council and Culture Ireland will be committed for 2021?  Can she provide a clear road map for the doubling of arts investment by 2025, including the commitment to double investment in the Arts Council and Culture Ireland over the same period, which are the agencies that directly support artists and their work.  As per the Minister's statement in October 2019 that we are on a good trajectory and we have a good road map ahead in terms of doubling the funding by 2025 and the Government is committed to doing so, will this now happen?</p>  <p>  I have questions on other issues.  The Minister's decision to rule out a derogation for shooting pigeons during summer months has tillage farmers throughout the country and in west Cork furious.  Shooting pigeons is the only way to control their numbers and protect crops such as brassicas from ravage during the summer months.  Every year, pigeon shooters come here to help control the pigeon population.  There is no other way to control the pigeon population.  If they are not controlled they will be an even bigger problem in the future.  Will the Minister make public the scientific evidence on which she decided not to sign the derogation?  In light of the issues raised by the farmers and others, will she change her position and sign the derogation?</p> <p>In the UK, a similar rule was introduced in 2016 but was reversed afterwards.  In the event of the Minister not signing this derogation, what realistic steps can farmers and horticulture growers take to protect their crops from serious attacks by pigeons?</p> <p> I have a question for the Minister about dangerous rural secondary roadsides.  Between March and September, the verges on those roads cannot be cut.  There is a lot of confusion in this regard, although the Minister said earlier that there is no such confusion and that the roadside verges can be cut.  However, contractors who are trying to cut are being told they are not allowed to do so.  We need clarity.  There is too much confusion on this issue and the Minister is the only person who can provide clarity.  The contractors either can or cannot cut between March and September.  It is quite simple.  They are trying to save lives and stop people from having accidents.</p> <p> Finally, the islands cannot reopen until 10 August, which is understandable.  If that is the rule, we cannot argue with it.  There are eight islands in my constituency, including Heir Island, Whiddy Island, Bere Island and Sherkin Island.  Most of our islands are dependent on tourism.  What is the plan for the people living there and how they will survive if the islands are closed until 10 August?  It will be a very slow reopening, so they will lose the summer season.  What is the Department's plan, if there is one, for their survival?</p></speech>

We had a culture debate last week during which I spoke about the arts in general and outlined in considerable detail the amount of funding we have given to the arts sector over the past number of years.  People often talk about 2008 as a benchmark in terms of the amount of money going to the Arts Council, which was approximately &euro;82 million at that time.  My Department gave &euro;80 million to the council this year and we had an overall 2% increase in culture spending.  That budget was negotiated with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in the context of Brexit happening.</p><p>We are now in a situation where we have a Covid-19 crisis and, as the Deputy knows, a projected deficit of &euro;30 billion this year and &euro;14 billion next year.  More than 1.1 million people are now availing of social welfare supports.  That has to be taken into account.  The National Campaign for the Arts, NCFA, and other arts organisations lobby the Government and my Department seeking more funding, and I understand that.  I understand that every sector has representative bodies and it is their job to lobby Government.  All I can say to the Deputy at the moment is that if I am still <i>in situ</i>in my Department, and it is probably unlikely that I will be, I certainly will do all I can.  I always have done so and I managed to increase funding significantly for the arts overall.</p></speech>

From a farming point of view, the farming community has already taken a major hit.  I am delighted to see that common sense has prevailed on this issue.  After speaking to the Minister earlier, I think it must come from her big Limerick connections, which are great to know about.  It will make it a lot easier for me to be coming for extra bits and pieces for Limerick knowing that she has so close a connection to the place.</p>  <p>  An issue was brought to my attention during the week which I want the Minister to check out and give clarity on.  I understand the CEOs and senior management of some heritage sites have been paid their full salary since the start of the Covid-19 crisis.  This was up to last week.  Since last week, they have decided they are going to take a reduction in their pay, plus the Covid payment.  I highlighted this in a tourism meeting that was chaired by Deputy Carey.  Since then, I have been getting inklings that they are trying to backdate the payments and are running for the hills.  Will the Minister confirm whether some of the CEOs and senior management of heritage sites have been taking a full salary even though there have been no visitors to any of the sites?</p> <p>If CEOs and senior management have been doing this, I want full disclosure.  At a time when there are no visitors to some of these heritage sites, how can we justify paying a full wage?  I ask the Minister to answer that question.</p></speech>

I am not sure exactly who the Deputy is alluding to and I should not comment in any event.  I do not have the information he seeks.  Some of the sites in question are also probably not under my remit.  They could be under the remit of the OPW or they may be independent tourism sites.  Tourism, <i>per se</i>, is not under my remit, which is more focused on heritage.  I suggest Deputy O'Donoghue direct his question to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="21:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100075#EEEE00300"><p>I will redirect my question.  I will also contact the Minister with the names of the sites that have come to my attention.  They are heritage sites.  The Minister can then determine whether they fall under her remit.  If it is the case that these CEOs have taken their salaries and the sites fall under the remit of the Minister, I want full disclosure with regard to any CEOs and senior managers who have taken funding.</p>  <p>  The second point I intended raising concerned wood pigeons and has already been dealt with.  The common sense approach that has been taken is welcome.  </p></speech>

We would not have been in a position, because of Covid-19, to deal with all those applications.  For this reason, I reinstated the derogation for the summer months.</p></speech>

I am minded of the statement that being born in a stable does not make one a horse.</p>  <p>  I want to discuss two issues with the Minister separately, if she does not mind.  The first concerns the decision on wood pigeons, which I am glad to note the Minister has reversed.  There is a perception among some people that those who shoot and, to a lesser extent, those who fish do not particularly care about nature.  In fact, they are often the people who care most about nature and conservation.  Notwithstanding that the Minister has reversed her decision, I ask her to publish the advice upon which that decision was based.  It is important that we see exactly what the position is, lest the issue evolve or return next year.  I also ask the Minister not to make this type of change in future without entering into consultation in advance, where possible.  I appreciate that emergencies sometimes occur and consultation is not possible, but perhaps this was not one of those situations.</p></speech>

We can be fully transparent on that advice, which is in direct contrast to what tillage farmers believe and what many Deputies have said to me recently.  The Deputy is correct that public consultation is extremely important and should be undertaken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="21:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100075#EEEE00700"><p>The other matter I wish to raise concerns UNESCO-designated sites, of which there are several in Ireland.  There is a proposal concerning a site that is close to me, not only physically but also because I care a great deal about it.  Five early monastic sites, the better known being Durrow, Inis Cealtra and Clonmacnoise, were included in a proposal submitted to UNESCO by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government that was in power with other parties until 2011.  Very little happened afterwards.  I asked numerous questions in the House of one of the Minister's predecessors but got very few answers.  I know the Minister may not have an answer to this question right now and I am not expecting her to be aware of matters such as this.</p> <p>As I had received very few answers, I went to the UNESCO headquarters in Paris.  The staff I met there stated that they have heard nothing from Ireland for many years on this issue.</p> <p> Although I could be wrong, I understand that one of the problems is that these five early monastic sites are in different local authority areas.  A UNESCO designation would be very welcome because it would protect the sites, but it would also have planning implications for the area around the sites.  One no more expects to see a shopping mall alongside the famous ancient city of Ephesus in Turkey than one expects to see a Clonmacnoise shopping experience.  It is to be hoped that that will not come about any time soon.  Some local authorities are reluctant to co-operate as much as one might expect due to the planning implications.  If that is the case with some of these sites, is there a case to be made for splitting them up?  If one or two of the local authorities do not wish to take part in this process and departmental officials or the Minister are not in a position to persuade it or them that the greater good would be to take part, perhaps we could proceed with the other sites.  I ask the Minister to consider that proposal.</p> <p> There are many advantages that derive from UNESCO designation, such as the protection of the site.  Obviously, Skellig Michael has been protected as a result of the efforts of the Minister's Department as well as its UNESCO designation.  Such a designation puts it on the international tourist map.  I would like that to happen with Inis Cealtra, colloquially known as Holy Island, which is a beautiful monastic island on Lough Derg.  There is a lot of scope to move forward on the matter.  If the Minister does not have the answers before her now, I ask that she provide them to me in writing.</p></speech>

Applications can be accepted until 31 March.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Skellig Michael is a world heritage site.  As I stated, it is important in terms of tourism.  There are certain criteria that such sites must fulfil, including that they have something very special about them.

That might indicate the problem with heritage in Ireland: much of it is the responsibility of the OPW while other areas are the responsibility of the Department and so on.  I will come to that in a few minutes.</p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue of the National Famine Commemoration Day.  It is vitally important and should be considered.  The Famine should, perhaps, hold a more important place in the national psyche.  It has had far-reaching impacts and still impacts on us today because of the decline in population.</p> <p>The population never reached a level which would allow us to develop businesses that could grow to a certain size and then move to markets outside, as most other European countries were able to do over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries.  The Famine had an enormous impact, and it continues to have an impact to this day.  In that context, it is something we should look at.  We must also remember the psychological impact on our people and our heritage too.</p> <p> I want to speak briefly about the wildfires that occurred right across the country in recent weeks.  North-west Donegal was particularly badly hit and somebody was arrested on suspicion of starting a wildfire.  How many wildfires are started deliberately and how many are natural occurrences?  In some countries, particularly the US, a lot of wildfires happen naturally as part of the life cycle of forests.  How much of that happens in Ireland?  Do we have any figures on that?  Is it something that is considered by the OPW?  A register of fires, as mentioned by Deputy Whitmore, might go some way towards helping us collate that information.</p> <p> Finally, I wanted to ask about the reopening of heritage sites and then realised that many of those I thought of as heritage sites in Donegal are actually OPW sites, which is part of the problem.  These sites need to reopen because they are an integral part of rural Ireland's tourism product, not to mention their use by local people.  They need to be carefully managed and reopened as a matter of priority.  I am thinking of places like Donegal Castle which is used by the local community and is also the location for a Famine commemoration every year, which illustrates the importance of heritage from both a tourism and local community perspective.</p></speech>

I can get more details for the Deputy but I know that since the restrictions came into place on 12 March there have been seven wildfires.  One occurred in Killarney and the other six in Wicklow.  I am not personally aware of the fire in Donegal.  The Deputy referred to a register of fires but we already have one within the Department.  We keep track of all fires.  Some of the fires in Wicklow seem to have been for agricultural purposes.  However, sometimes wildfires are not for such purposes and are set deliberately.  I do not know if the Deputy was here earlier when we talked about the use of drones.  We are conducting one of the biggest eye-in-the-sky operations in an effort to clamp down on this type of activity.  The sheer scale of the land involved and the remoteness of the locations causes difficulties.  It is impossible for all of the rangers to be everywhere all of the time.  Most of them are on patrol until 9 p.m. and most fires take place in the afternoon or early evening.</p>  <p>  On the opening of heritage sites, under the road map most of the visitor sites, cafes and so on will reopen on 29 June but we will be very much guided by public health advice on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100078#LLLL00300"><p>The Covid-19 pandemic will continue to present a challenge on many fronts, not least in the workplace.  At the launch of the national return to work safely protocol, I emphasised the overriding need for collaboration and co-operation at all levels between State agencies, employers and employees, as well as representative bodies.</p> <p>We saw this in the development of the protocol.  The same collaboration and co-operation remain the key to success in the workplace.  I know there is a strong desire for employers and employees to get back to work and do so safely.  The vast majority of businesses want to protect their staff and customers.  Many even closed early to do this.  They have adhered to the public health guidance so far and there is no reason to believe this will change.  Similarly, the vast majority of employees want to go back to work and the steps and measures outlined in the protocol provide the framework for every workplace.</p> <p> Compliance with the protocol is being led by the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, which has overall responsibility for ensuring the health and safety and welfare at work of all workers.  It is there to provide advice and support to employers and employees on how they implement Covid-19 measures in the workplace.  Its approach is to work with businesses collaboratively to iron out any issues.  However, where needed, HSA inspectors will be able to take appropriate enforcement action.  The HSA is deploying all of its available inspectors across sectors to carry out spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the protocol.  The HSA inspectors will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors who already have environmental health, agricultural or other workplace and business inspection responsibilities.  The number of additional resources working with the HSA will be in the hundreds from throughout the system.  Compliance with the return to work safely protocol will become part of their normal inspection regime.  It will start shortly, with approximately 200 officers from the environmental health service.  This number will increase steadily as officials from other parts of the system, with varying sectoral inspection and oversight responsibilities, are brought on board in line with the Government road map.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has given a commitment that inspectors from his Department will work with the HSA to ensure the implementation of the protocol in workplaces.  Clearly, the Government will not be found wanting in resourcing the important role.</p> <p> With regard to outbreaks of Covid-19 in meat processing plants, this is first and foremost a public health matter and has been led by the HSE.  As a result, a HSE-led national outbreak control team for Covid-19 outbreaks in meat processing plants is in place and is reporting to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The national outbreak control team has input from professionals in public health, environmental health, occupational health, health and safety and animal welfare.  The HSA is a member of this team and up to 20 May had participated in three national outbreak control team meetings.</p> <p> In accordance with the HSA's role in ensuring compliance with the return to work safely protocol, inspectors from the HSA are undertaking inspections in a wide range of workplaces and industry sectors.  Between Monday and Wednesday evening, more than 240 on-site compliance inspections were carried out.  While the HSA does not give details of individual inspections, I can confirm that meat processing plants are included in these numbers.  I can also confirm that Covid-19 complaints have been received about meat processing plants and these are being responded to as appropriate, including by on-site inspection where required.</p> <p> I remind the House that the national return to work safely protocol is a living document.  It reflects public health advice about measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19 in the community issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team.  As this advice evolves over time, the protocol will be updated.  A stakeholder forum has been established through the Labour Employment Economic Forum, LEEF, to oversee the implementation of the protocol, including any changes that have to be integrated.  It will meet tomorrow for the first time to review progress so far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1454" speakername="Michael Creed" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100079#MMMM00200"><p>Since the start of this pandemic, the protection of public health has been the Government's overriding priority.  The Government categorised farming and food production as essential services under the Covid-19 regulations.  Irish food supply chains have continued to operate effectively to ensure the security of supply of safe healthy Irish food for consumers at home and abroad.</p>  <p>In respect of Covid-19 and meat plants, as in all other aspects of the pandemic, we must all listen to the public health experts and adhere strictly to their recommendations.  We are all part of the whole-of-government response to Covid-19 and in this instance are focused on ensuring the health and safety of all workers, including staff from my Department in meat plants.  Since the start of the pandemic, my Department officials and I have had regular meetings with meat industry representatives.  At all times we have emphasised that their priority must be safeguarding human health and following HSE guidelines at all levels of operation.  Meat industry representatives have outlined to my Department the type of measures put in place in plants, including, for example, the extension of operating hours, reduced throughput rates at individual plants, the provision of additional PPE, the installation of Perspex screens, temperature checks on entry and the provision of additional facilities to support physical distancing measures.  Because meat plants remained open as an essential part of the food chain, these measures were put in place in an evolving situation with new information and advice emerging on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>When a cluster of cases of Covid-19 does arise in a meat plant, as with clusters arising in any workplace setting, the matter is dealt with by a HSE-led local outbreak control team.  The control team then works in close co-ordination with local plant management to put in place measures to contain the outbreak.  I understand that there has been good and constructive engagement between meat plant management and the HSE local control team in these cases.  As the number of clusters arising in meat plants increased, a national outbreak control team reporting through the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, was established.  The group's remit is to oversee and co-ordinate the approach to the prevention and management of the Covid-19 outbreaks in meat plants in Ireland.  The group is chaired by the HSE, with a range of participants, including my Department.  The first output from the group was a guidance document which issued to all meat processing facilities last Friday, 15 May.  This document has been published on the websites of the HPSC and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It provides guidance on the necessary facilities, processes and management required to minimise the risk of Covid-19 for all workers in meat plants.  Many of the specific recommendations may already be in place in meat plants.  Nonetheless, I am pleased to see detailed guidance specifically tailored to the meat industry.  This guidance is detailed; it covers, <i>inter alia</i>, infection prevention and control measures to prevent cases and control outbreaks, screening processes on entry to the workplace, hand-washing facilities, workstation requirements and canteen facilities, steps to be taken when an individual case is suspected or confirmed, additional steps to be taken when an outbreak has occurred and engagement and communication with staff.<br/><br/>To be clear, my Department's statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is to ensure that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine-approved meat plants operate in compliance with the European Union's food hygiene legislation and animal health and welfare standards.  Approximately 250 veterinary and technical staff from my Department are routinely involved in supervising, regulating and controlling these standards at Department-approved meat plants.  A total of 149 meat premises are approved by my Department, with specific approvals for activities including slaughtering, deboning and-or cold storage of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry.  Of these, the Department has a permanent presence at the 49 premises which slaughter animals and carries out risk-based inspections and controls at the remaining approved meat premises.<br/><br/>As we know, in the context of the pandemic, primary responsibility for public health policy and implementation rests with the Department of Health and the HSE.  Responsibility for health and safety in the workplace rests with the Health and Safety Authority under the auspices of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  As part of the whole-of-government response to the pandemic, my Department will continue to contribute to the HSE-chaired national outbreak control team and will provide any support required to the HSE at local and national level.  My Department has assisted in the dissemination of the HSE guidance to the Department-approved meat plants.  In addition, my Department has sought an update from plant management on the measures which have been put in place in each plant to implement these guidelines.  To this end, along with the statutory role in respect of food safety, animal welfare and animal health, my Department will support the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority in monitoring the effective implementation of the guidance in Department-approved meat plants.</p> <p>I reiterate that the protection of public health must be our overriding concern, that is, the health of the workers within the factories, including my own staff, the health of the wider communities in which the workers reside, and the health of the general population.  My key message to the industry and to all stakeholders in the agrifood sector is that we must maintain our vigilance, and as more sectors return to work and as life takes on some semblance of normality, all parties must continue to implement and adhere to the public health guidelines for the benefit of all.</p></speech>

It is very disappointing, however, that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris is not in the Chamber.  Given that we are here tonight to talk about the impact of Covid-19 infections in meat plants, in neither of their statements did the Ministers give an up-to-date position to the House on the number of positive cases or the number of clusters in meat factories throughout the State currently.  This is a glaring omission in both of the Ministers' submissions before the House.  Will at least one Minister outline in their response an immediate update for the House on that?</p>  <p>  It is clear and obvious that many mistakes have been made in how this issue has been handled.  I ask both Ministers to clarify if they agree there have been mistakes in this regard.  How can the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, be satisfied that there have been no Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspections of meat plants, given that we are aware of some 900 cases to date?  How can the Minister be satisfied there were no HSA inspections up to Tuesday, which is the information we are currently aware of?</p>  <p>  On testing and how it is taking place, will the Ministers clarify what are the turnaround times for testing in factories?  Are employees given absolute priority in how this is happening?  How on earth can it be right that when testing takes place, factories do not temporarily close for a deep clean until the results come back?  It is essential that the results are back as quickly as possible, which can be done within 48 hours, but why are factories not closed temporarily during this period to ensure a proper read and assessment of infection levels can be got, and to ensure that anyone returning to work has results back and is negative?  Many lessons must be learned here, and especially as other factories in other sectors across the country will be returning to work in the period ahead.  The Government has to be upfront about the mistakes that were made and ensure they are not repeated.</p></speech>

The rapid increase in transmission of Covid-19 in meat factories is a very serious concern.  It is a concern to the health of employees and to the wider agrifood sector, of which meat processing plays a key role.  Maintaining the food supply chain is essential, but so too is the health of employees in meat processing plants.  They play an integral role in facilitating this chain.</p>  <p>  According to the latest figures from NPHET, the number of positive cases in meat plants has increased by more than 300 to 828.  Four of those major meat processing plants are in my constituency: ABP Meats in Cahir and Nenagh; Ashbourne Meat Processors in Roscrea; and Rosderra Meats in Roscrea.  Could we have figures for the number of cases in those individual plants?</p>  <p>  I have further queries for the Minister, Deputy Creed, which fall under the remit of his Department, one of which concerns a boatload of cattle destined for Algeria this week.  There is huge dismay among the farming community that this boat has now gone to France to be filled with cattle.  It was delayed a week previously and now it has been cancelled.  This is the only forum in which we have the opportunity to ask these questions.  We need a full report as to how this boat was not filled with Irish cattle at a time when we need competition in the marketplace like never before.  This was the first time in a long number of years where heavy cattle had an outlet live from this country.  It is a huge disappointment to livestock producers that this boat has now left our shores.</p>  <p>  I shall now turn to how Covid-19 affects the greyhound industry.</p> <p>The greyhound industry is very disappointed that the date for the resumption of dog racing has not been brought forward like that of horse racing.  We welcome the fact that horse racing is to resume behind closed doors on 8 June, but managers of dog tracks throughout the country assure me they can adhere to social distancing.  They cannot understand why at this juncture they have been divorced from the horse racing industry.  I ask that the decision be reviewed and that dog racing resume on the same date as horse racing.</p></speech>

That is a bit contradictory in light of this debate.</p>  <p>  We in Fianna F&aacute;il believe we need to look at stringent measures to reduce the transmission of Covid-19 in meat factories and to protect the employees.  Despite the efforts of some of the meat factories to introduce new safety measures, it needs to be acknowledged that the number of confirmed cases continues to rise.  Will the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, clarify, with up-to-date figures, how many suspected cases there are in meat factories nationally?  Of these suspected cases, how many were confirmed Covid cases?  How many of these cases led to hospitalisation?  Will the Minister also provide this breakdown specific to the Kepak plant in the Watergrasshill area, which she will know is the location of one of the clusters mentioned in the media last week?</p>  <p>  Finally, I ask the Minister, Deputy Creed, to give a commitment to the essential workers in our meat plants that in those factories where confirmed cases exist, those facilities will be deep-cleaned for health and safety purposes, and that any suspected case will be tested expeditiously, given the grave situation the workers find themselves in.</p></speech>

It is factories today, but it could be some other type of enterprise tomorrow.  Will the Minister tell us whether the inspectors now enforce a regime that means that people work at a social distance from one another where that is physically possible or otherwise take strong steps to reduce the risk of infection?</p>  <p>  Do we know whether the main transmission of the infection was within the factories or outside them?  Has an analysis been done as to whether it happened through social contact outside the factories or because of the way the employees were working within the factory premises?  If it happened within the factory premises, we should review the workplace guidelines not only for meat factories but for all types of factories to ensure people are safe in their place of work.</p></speech>

Given that almost 900 cases of Covid-19 have been detected in meat factories, how many calls were made and emails sent from the Minister's staff on the ground to the Department?  Surely there is some paper trail that shows the number of phone calls of concern.</p>  <p>  What planning have the Minister and his officials co-ordinated to mitigate a second wave and to prevent the collapse of the sector?  What exactly is the Department doing in that regard?</p>  <p>  Are the private vets who are contracted by the Department self-isolating from their communities or are they still working freely in rural Ireland?  What checks and balances, best practices and guidelines has the Minister's Department put in place to protect the people of rural Ireland from the spread of Covid in their communities?</p></speech>

This information will be subject to ongoing validation and updating.  It is not the case that it is all happening at once.  Some 60% of the 879 people who were infected are back at work.  I wanted to give the Deputies that information.</p> <p> The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, developed this protocol in line with IBEC, Chambers Ireland, the construction sector and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They all came together and the protocol that was developed is a baseline guide for all employers.  The HSA is responsible for the protocol and it has all the power necessary to carry out inspections and to take action if necessary.  However, the HSA is initially working with employers and employees to resolve any problems and iron out any issues.  The number of inspections the HSA has carried out in recent days is 240 and it has said that in the majority of places inspected it has found that employers have been complying with the protocol.  As expected, many employers are doing the right thing and they are ensuring that all of the necessary procedures are put in place to protect their workers.  Since 18 May, the HSA has found a high level of compliance with the protocol across all sectors.  It has also inspected meat plants and is happy everything is working well.</p></speech>

As my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has confirmed, he identified 828 cases and 16 clusters in the meat industry.  It is interesting that from the point of view of definitions, a cluster is identified as a place where there are two or more confirmed cases.</p>  <p>  Deputy McConalogue made the point that many mistakes were made.  It is true to say that this is a constantly evolving situation and that is evident if one looks at the various communications about which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v inquired and which were sent to the management of the meat factories.  The first communication was sent on 18 March and detailed the issue meat management plants were dealing with.  A line in that communication stated: "There is currently little evidence that people who are without symptoms are infectious to others."  Further communication sent on 9 May stated: "While people are most likely to pass on the infection when they have symptoms, current information suggests that some infected people spread the virus to others prior to developing or displaying symptoms themselves."  The point I am making is that this has been a constantly evolving situation.  All of the actors, including workers, my Department's staff and management in meat plants have been responding and reacting all the time to communications and to greater levels of knowledge that are developing in respect of these matters.  I would not identify them as mistakes.  Everybody involved was acting in the context of their best endeavours but information was constantly being improved upon.  As the information available changed, so too did the responses.  I have outlined some of the responses that were made.</p>  <p>  The question of closing down plants for the purposes of deep cleaning has been raised.  These are issues that will ultimately be decided upon by the outbreak control team.</p> <p>It is interesting to recall the words of the Chief Medical Officer, Dr Holohan, on 15 May: "We don't think there's a justification at this moment in time to be issuing a recommendation that all meat processing plants should close."  There is authority to do so, however, if closure, a deep clean or any other action is deemed necessary.  My Department's staff, now working in conjunction with the Health and Safety Authority, will oversee compliance in this regard, but generally speaking we have found that there is willingness among management to co-operate.</p> <p> Deputy Cahill raised a number of issues.  The road map is the road map and I have nothing further to add on the opening up of any sector of society in that context.  On live exports, I am as disappointed as anybody else but my function in the Department is to ensure the hard-won markets we get are kept open to us by virtue of our compliance with the health certificate we agree with the countries concerned.</p> <p> With regard to figures for individual plants, the Deputy will appreciate that this detail is never divulged, as has been the protocol all along the line.  I do not have access to it.  Deputy McConalogue alluded to the fact that I had not given figures.  I do not get the figures.  They are not reported to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I got the figures from the announcement of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, today because it is in his area that the figures are collated.  They are not notified to my Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="22:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100084#RRRRR00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputies Carthy and Kerrane.</p>  <p>  What we have here is a mess.  There has been a massive escalation, with 880 cases confirmed.  It is very worrying for the workers, in respect of their health and jobs, and other workers who are awaiting test results.  I have been raising this with the Minister since Easter week and he has continually told me that he, his officials in the plants and other officials are sure all precautions are being taken.  Whoever is telling the Minister this is telling him a load of bull.  None of it tallies with the circumstances in many meat processing plants.  Whatever about people wearing masks, some must be wearing blindfolds because what is being said does not tally with what workers have been telling me for the past seven weeks.</p>  <p>  Some factories have taken the correct action and preventive measures, and I applaud them for doing so, but others have not.  That is the reality.  In Rosderra Meats in Roscrea, the first case appeared on 20 March.  The unfortunate worker almost lost his life.  He was critically ill.  No testing was done at the time of close contacts of the worker.  I have spoken to the families of other workers in the infected cluster.  Testing of all workers was not done until 24 April and 25 April, a full five weeks later.  After the tests were carried out, workers were sent back in to the production line without having their results.  In some cases, they did not receive them until the following Wednesday.  On the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, many of the workers continued to work.  They turned out to be infected and they in turn infected other workers.  One worker who became extremely ill with Covid was confined to bed and was seriously ill but company management still continued to contact him to ask him to come back to work because they were short of workers because so many were out sick.</p>  <p>  In Edenderry, the first case was in early April.  Even when the cluster comprised ten cases, all workers were still not tested.  When they were tested last week - I raised the issue of testing with the Minister three weeks ago today in the D&aacute;il - they were sent back to the production line without having the all clear, never mind a deep clean or anything else.  This is crazy stuff.  I have been talking to workers and their families about this and I noted they are very concerned.  If I heard the Minister correctly on RT&Eacute; on Sunday, he said that workers should not go back to work until they have the all clear.  He mentioned who has been consulted but the ordinary workers in the plants are not being consulted.  Management might have been.  Worse still, many workers are being told they can do it or go home.  That is what they have been told in the past.  They have had to battle to get basic personal protective equipment.  I am told that, in many cases, social distancing was only implemented prior to inspections.</p>  <p>  In the Kildare chilling plant, where the Minister's officials are, one of those officials has gone out sick with Covid.  No temperature testing has been done there up to the past couple of days.  I checked again this morning.  The HSE-led inspection teams carried out no inspections until this week.  That has been confirmed, and confirmed again here today.  None of what was required was done.  Management in some factories seemed to know exactly when inspections were going to take place.  That needs to be cleared up.</p>  <p>  I have some straight questions on this.  Will the Minister make it mandatory for all workers in meat plants to have their temperature taken daily?  Will he state the number of Covid-related inspections to date?  If a worker tests positive in a factory, will it be mandatory for all workers to be tested and put back on the production lines only when they have the all-clear?</p> <p>Is it mandatory that all workers have PPE and, if so, when did that requirement come into place?  The Minister's officials have engaged with management and owners.  Will they now engage with the ordinary workers and the shop stewards on the production lines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="22:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100085#SSSS00200"><p>The question I am asked more often than any other is why it always appears that there is one set of rules for meat factories to abide by and a different set for everybody else.  We have had discussions on beef importation and so on, but this week we learned that the Covid-19 test results of some workers were conveyed to their employers, meat factories in this instance, before the employees themselves.  Has the Minister investigated in exactly how many cases this has happened?  Does he agree that this behaviour is absolutely scandalous?  We know the practice has been suspended, but the Government has not come out and said it should not have happened.  Will the Minister do that now?</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the guidelines the Minister for Health has used to excuse himself from this debate.  Regardless of how it is dressed up, there is no excuse for a Minister for Health to refuse to attend.  The Ceann Comhairle sat through two full sessions today.  Obviously, he is getting different health advice from that given to the Minister for Health.  What has happened is simply not good enough.</p>  <p>  When something affects the meat plants, little things always seem to work their way.  We heard about the cattle exports being stopped in the past seven days, yet not a single factory has been closed down for a prolonged period.  The guidelines the Minister for Health cited in the context of his refusal to attend state that if all of us spend more than two hours - even if those two hours are spread out - in this Chamber, in circumstances whereby we are all physically distanced, and if one of us contracts Covid-19, then we all have to self-isolate for 14 days.  That is a million miles away from the standards operating in the beef plants, in respect of which, as Deputy Stanley just pointed out, there are all sorts of conflicting reports.</p>  <p>  As for PPE, are face masks being provided to workers?  An email I received today from a constituent in Cavan-Monaghan tells me that in the food production plant where they work, 95% of employees are not observing, and cannot observe, social distancing, and that face masks are not being provided.  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine ensure that this is not the case?</p>  <p>  I must ask again about the HSA.  Exactly how many inspections have taken place in meat plants?  When did they take place?  The Minister said this situation is constantly evolving.  However, as Deputy Stanley stated, almost from the moment Covid-19 arrived on our shores it has been highlighted that meat plants would be particularly susceptible to clusters.  Up until now, the correct action that is required has not been taken.  I ask both Ministers present, in the absence of the Minister for Health, to take steps to ensure that that is now corrected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="22:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100085#SSSS00300"><p>I contacted the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 4 May, having been contacted by a constituent who was worried sick for her elderly parents who lived near a meat processing plant, given rumours at that time of positive cases in the plant.  The Minister's response was to take a total hands-off approach.  He stated in his correspondence to me, and has stated a number of times since, that it is a matter for meat plant businesses to ensure that necessary protection protocols are in place.  We all know Covid-19 is a public health matter, but there is also a responsibility for the Minister in all this.  We know that outbreaks in meat processing plants impact not only the individual employee but also his or her family and entire communities.  It is not good enough to leave factories to put protocols in place, hope for the best and leave it at that.  The Minister might have faith in a lot of these meat processing plants, but I do not think that faith is shared by many other people.</p> <p>The Minister also mentioned in his correspondence to me the 250 veterinary and technical staff that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine deploys in meat processing plants.  We know their role up to now has been around animal welfare, health and safety of food, hygiene and all of that.  Have these Department employees had their responsibilities extended to supervise the health and safety of employees?  Is that ongoing now?  It is a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question.<br/><br/>According to the chief executive of the Health and Safety Authority, we learned this week in the committee, and we now know, that no inspections of meat processing plants took place despite complaints.  It seems highly strange to me that in all this time the HSA has been inspecting premises but it has not been inspecting meat processing plants despite complaints.  I hope the Minister will agree that this is highly concerning.  I know of a factory where positive cases were identified in April.  The HSA wrote to all staff at the time.  Would that not have been a time for the HSA to go into that plant to check the protocols and see what was in place for the protection of those employees?<br/><br/>I welcome the fact that inspections have now begun.  I hope that the vast majority of inspections carried out by the HSA are unannounced.  I hope that where protocols are seen to be absent the plant is revisited some days later.  Again, the majority of these inspections should be unannounced.<br/><br/>Is the Minister aware of a letter issued to all factory employees across the country by one meat processing plant?  Part of this letter states that it had been brought to the attention of the plant &quot;by local Gardai that a small number of our employees are not adhering to social distancing outside of the workplace and have not been properly self isolating when required to do so in accordance with the guidelines.&quot;  The letter continues:</p><blockquote>	We have also heard that some employees have been arranging large parties at weekends, which is not allowed and unacceptable. </blockquote> <p>That to me reads of an employer passing the buck to employees.  It reads to me of an employer shifting the blame and it is no way to treat workers.  I hope that the Minister will see it the same way.<br/><br/>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine should acknowledge in the House that no plan was put in place in time for meat processing plants and that this has had devastating consequences for families, employees and communities.  Recent weeks have shown that the disregard factories have shown to farmers in this country for a long time is in some cases also shown to employees.  I think when all this passes there is work to do when it comes to employees' rights in these meat processing factories.</p></speech>

It is up to the employer to advise the HSE.  Then the national outbreak control team engages through the local outbreak response teams.  That is the protocol if there is an outbreak in a workplace.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to the Health and Safety Authority.  I do not have the exact number of inspections in meat plants.  That information is confidential to the authority officials and they do not share that information with me.  However, I can say that since last Monday they have had 240 inspections in an overall mix of businesses.  Included in those 240 inspections were meat plants.</p></speech>

With every individual who contracts the virus and every industry grappling with the consequences, there is a challenge.  Everybody is doing their best, including those workers deemed to be essential by this House when it approved the regulations.  It should be acknowledged that these people have done fantastic work in keeping food supply chains going.  My Department has had ongoing engagement with meat plants and there were 11 engagements since early March, with four involving me, and the rest involving Department officials.  Since the end of February, there has been ongoing engagement with representative bodies and executives.  It has always been about ensuring that in keeping the food supply chain going, the welfare of the employees is put front and centre.  If somebody is involved in running a business and wants to keep it functioning, it is clearly in that person's interest to keep those employees safe.  To argue there is some kind of conspiracy with employers to damn their workers with Covid-19 would surely be counter-intuitive.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carthy railed against the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for not being here tonight but I heard the Deputy speak today when the Minister was present.  He walked out of the Chamber and refused to ask the Minister a question.</p></speech>

I welcome the protocols published over a week ago and I ask the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, about their implementation.  My understanding is there is an assumption that everybody wants to protect staff, employees and customers.  I assume the reports are of a positive engagement around the protocols but perhaps the Minister can update us on that.  I ask that the HSA take the approach of working with employers to give guidance so there is no fear when the authority is to be contacted; the opposite should be true.  I accept, as the Minister, Deputy Creed, has said, that employers want to protect their staff.  I assume if they contact the HSA, the authority will provide guidance and advice and it will work with employers.  It should not just be assumed that the HSA exists to catch out employers but rather that it is there to help.  We want staff to be protected and there should be no cover-up.</p>  <p>  There will be an extra cost to all employers, not just in meat factories, from putting in place these protections.  When is it hoped that the grants announced a few days ago will be up and running?  Are we still on track for other businesses to access those grants, including those for restarting businesses?</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Creed, said there was ongoing engagement with different stakeholders and he has had regular meetings with industry representatives.  Will he consider visiting a factory to indicate confidence in what we are doing here and the procedures being put in place?  It is important to send out that message.  Everybody wants to know about this and, naturally, we are watching the different sectors that are opening first, as well as those that remained open.  It would indicate confidence if the Minister could visit a facility and let us know about his engagement.</p>  <p>  The protocols and guidelines are in place but there is some confusion around the guidance here.  We get our own advice and every place must get its own advice.  I presume the protocols in place can be updated as we go along based on feedback from different sectors.</p></speech>

This protocol concerns employers and employees working together.  It has been developed on the basis of collaboration between, among others, the unions, employers, IBEC and ICTU.  We have all worked together, as have the HSA, the HSE and the officials in all the different Departments.</p> <p>This protocol has been a collaborative effort and I expect the same will apply in the workplace.  There are many employers who shut down their premises early to protect their employees, and I have no doubt that they will continue to protect their employees and put in place the necessary protocols.</p> <p> This is a living document.  As the public health advice on various issues changes, it will be reviewed and the necessary changes made.  The situation will be monitored.  A stakeholder forum has been established through the Labour Employment Economic Forum, LEEF, which will oversee the implementation of the protocol, including any change that may be introduced along the way.  If there are concerns from employers or employees, those can be brought together through the relevant organisations.  The protocol can be reviewed and we are happy to work with everyone.</p> <p> The Deputy mentioned how some businesses had to adopt new protocols to adhere to the new rules.  A grant called the restart grant is available and applications for it to local authorities can start tomorrow.  It is a minimum of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000, depending on the rates one was due to pay last year.  There will be a simple, online, one-page form, the grant will be paid through the local authorities and it will open for applications tomorrow.</p></speech>

I am conscious that I am straying into the jurisdiction of the Department of Health, but it is my information that, as the Minister, Deputy Harris, put on the record today, the local HSE teams that dealt with outbreaks initially and the local and national outbreak control teams that were subsequently established have had the authority to prescribe all and every action deemed necessary to protect the workers in question, up to and including closure of the plants.  I mean deep clean, PPE, temperature testing and whatever else is deemed necessary.  The feedback-----</p></speech>

Communication with plants has been a movable feast because there were different communications on 18 March, 27 March, 9 May, which was the protocol to which the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, alluded, 15 May, which was the first specific guidance to meat plants, and 19 May, entailing Covid-19 checklists, etc.  There have been different communications that we expect all plants to respond to.  No one could have hit the ground running on day one with the kind of actions that were only communicated to the plants by, for example, the national outbreak control team on 15 May.  In fact, early communication on Covid-19 was much milder.  There has been a learning process for all of the actors involved.</p>  <p>  To reassure the House, the teams have the authority to invoke whatever is deemed necessary.  Included in this are other agencies, for example, the HSA and my Department's staff, who are working to ensure that the requisite measures are implemented.</p>  <p>  It is unfortunate that Deputy Kerrane, who raised a question in the previous round, has left before I had a chance to reply.  She made a point about my staff.  Obviously, there is ongoing engagement between those of my staff who are in the locations in question and the Department via the chief veterinary officer, the deputy chief veterinary officer, etc.  This reflects the dynamics of the communications.  They have been working with local management as our eyes and ears to encourage management to take the necessary steps and so on.  The feedback is that all of those plants are responding.  Some respond on day one, others on day two, but all of them have been responding, including to subsequent communications issued to them.  That is as it should be.</p>  <p>  To answer the Minister of State, Deputy English, I have visited a plant and seen at first hand the efforts being made.</p> <p>I am not sure if any of the Members who are so critical have taken time to visit plants.  With regard to deep cleaning, anybody with a knowledge of the food industry will know that the level of biosecurity in the food industry generally is extraordinarily high.  It is far easier to walk into a hospital than it is to walk into a food plant or food business of any sort because of the biosecurity measures that are part and parcel of the food industry.  This has been enhanced by the actions that are necessary as a consequence of Covid-19.</p> <p> This is a global phenomenon in meat plants.  We are grappling with it.  As mentioned earlier today by the Minister, Deputy Harris, it is reassuring to know that of the 828 cases that are confirmed in the meat industry - 828 being the cumulative figure - 60% are back at work.  I hope that the remaining balance of cases will recover and have the opportunity to return to work as well.  We cannot guarantee anything.  This is an insidious virus that is difficult to combat but we are doing everything possible collectively to ensure that we protect workers and keep food supply chains functioning as well, but only functioning where the primacy of the health and welfare of those working in the industry is protected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1574" speakername="Francis Noel Duffy" time="23:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100089#WWWW00200"><p>I thank the Ministers for their statements.  Meat processing facilities have become one of the worst hit workplaces in Ireland and around the world during Covid-19.  The issue will only get worse now that their production has increased for the summer period.  As already mentioned, figures from the national public health emergency team, NPHET, show that there are a total of 828 cases in the meat processing plants.  Despite the figures and a number of complaints no inspections have been carried out by the Health and Safety Authority or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am aware that HSE outbreak control teams have been sent to each of the clusters in the meat processing plants.  Can the Minister clarify the specific functions of this group, what plans are in place to prevent further spread of the virus and where within the plants the virus has been detected?</p>  <p>  Representatives from migrant organisations and union representatives have raised the issue of migrant workers at meat processing plants.  They have made it clear that migrants in these working conditions are being disproportionately impacted by the virus.  Some migrant workers cannot adhere to social distancing guidance at home due often to cramped living arrangements with non-relatives as a result of their low wages.  Complaints have been made to Migrant Rights Centre Ireland by workers in various meat processing facilities who feel their safety at work is being neglected.  They also feel that the owners of these plants have higher priorities than worker safety.  This raises a series of questions.  What clarity can the Minister provide with respect to measures currently taking place within these plants to ensure social distancing regulations can be adhered to?  Will he ensure the shutdown of plants for a two week period where Covid-19 has been detected to allow for deep cleaning and are there contingencies if closures become widespread?  Crucially, in situations where plants are closed due to Covid-19 will the Minister ensure workers are paid for that period as many employment contracts are without sick pay schemes or similar benefits?</p>  <p>  There have been reports of the Garda visiting meat processing plants to warn workers that breaches of social distancing guidelines and regulations will not be tolerated.  Many of these workers are on low paid contracts resulting in them having to live in extremely cramped conditions with non-relatives and sometimes with colleagues or workers from other meat processing plants.  This increases the risk of the virus spreading and makes adherence to the HSE guidelines impossible.  Will the Minister comment on the issue of workers in the meat processing sector who have contracted the virus but are not in a position to self-isolate and adhere to social distance guidelines due to their living in cramped conditions with non-relatives?</p> <p> Some of my colleagues will know that I was raised in the market town of Carrickmacross, where I fondly remember wandering around the cattle market on Fridays, looking curiously at the animals in their stalls and the hustle and bustle of the auction house.  I also recall the relatively open nature of the slaughter of animals in the local butcher's shop.  However, over the years, this sector has become overly industrialised.  While there have been efforts made to improve animal welfare, there have been no similar efforts to improve the welfare of farmers and the industry's workforce.  This is an industry that appears to treat its livestock better than it treats it people.</p> <p> As matters stand, three companies control 65% of the traditional Irish beef processing market.  The IFA and other farmer representative organisations have accused the industry of cartel-like behaviour.  These companies have continued to amass huge profits and market share at the expense of our farmers.  The organic beef market is in even worse shape, with only two processors, both of which are controlled by a single majority shareholder.  It is clear that we need to shift our focus to create a circular economy that would allow for local and community-led production.  Not only would this make the whole industry more sustainable, it would also allow our farmers more control of the market, shortening the supply chain as a result and increasing community income.</p> <p> Ireland has recently enjoyed success in the creation of local businesses in similar areas.  In recent decades, we have seen a huge increase in the number of micro breweries and distilleries, where before there was only a handful of big players.  The State has given the needed support for that industry to prosper and generate sustainable local business.  It is possible to buy locally sourced and slaughtered products in many parts of the country, and this creates sustainable jobs for our communities and high-quality food for consumers.  We have also seen success with dairy farmers having access to co-operatives.  The recent crisis has made it abundantly clear that changes like these, and more, need to be made to improve the working conditions in our beef industry.  After consulting the independent research conducted by the IFA, I ask the Minister, if beef processing is so profitable, why have we not seen the emergence of successful beef farmer co-operatives?  What is Teagasc doing to give beef farmers support and assistance to improve their efficiency, sustainability and profitability?  Finally, considering that there is high transparency when it comes to cattle prices, I ask the Minister if data on the prices paid to the processors by the retailers can be made public.</p></speech>

On the issue of work permits where workers come in from abroad, the general operative employment permits for the meat sector have a number of conditions attached concerning pay and hours of work.  In addition to those conditions, the employer applicant must provide the Department with a signed declaration that the company will ensure the foreign national employee has access to suitable accommodation and training, including language training.  When the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which is the inspectorate in this regard, carries out a compliance check in relation to these general operative permits, the inspector will inquire, as part of the inspection, in order to confirm that conditions are met in respect of accommodation and language training.  Permits for the occupation of meat deboner do not carry these conditions, but the salary threshold for that occupation is higher and stands at &euro;27,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  Since January 2019, 17 employers associated with meat processing have been inspected by the WRC.  In six of those cases, contraventions of legislation were detected and three have been approved for prosecution, with inquiries ongoing in the other three cases.  No breaches of the language training or accommodation conditions were detected.  In addition, the HSA has all the necessary powers to take action in such matters.  The first thing it wants to do is to work with employers and employees, but the authority has all the powers it needs to go into any place of work and close it down if that is what it deems necessary to do.  I want to make clear that it has those powers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-21a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1454" speakername="Michael Creed" time="23:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052100091#YYYY00100"><p>That was a wide-ranging contribution on Covid-19.  If the Deputy would like me to give chapter and verse on what we are doing for the beef industry, I draw his attention, for example, to a simple item called the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, aimed at improving the genetic merit of the herd, thereby improving its environmental and financial efficiency.  That is just one scheme.  Several new schemes opened this year to deliver direct income support to the beef sector as well.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's observation about the lack of a co-operative structure in the meat processing industry.  There are plants for sale and I would like to see farmers perhaps organise themselves in a co-operative manner.  It is not a closed shop.  Entry into the processing sector is open to anybody.  Farmers have made a successful venture into dairy co-operatives.  It must be said, however, that farmers were previously involved in co-operative efforts in the meat industry, but they exited it pretty quickly and financially scarred by the experience, I think.  That is the historical record.  The industry is open, however, to anyone who wants to enter it.</p>  <p>  I will make one point in conclusion.  The Deputy stated that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine was not doing any inspections.  That is to misunderstand the statutory role we have.  We have 250 staff who in many ways, outside of their statutory responsibility, are our eyes and ears in these plants.  They have been engaging with our senior management in the Department, but also with local management in stating the appropriate steps that have been communicated and the things that should be done.  By and large, the feedback has been that meat plant management have responded accordingly.  Though we may not have a statutory role, and we will be working now in a more formalised engagement with the HSA through our 250 staff, in the interim those staff have been playing a constructive role in working in tandem with local management to deliver the kind of measures necessary to protect workers.</p></speech>

I start by echoing our support for the call SIPTU has made for a taskforce for the farm to fork process for the meat industry.  We believe the return to work protocol document is strong.  We have major concerns, however, about how it is going to be implemented across several sectors, one being the meat and food sector.</p>  <p>  The HSA and Patricia King of ICTU were at the third session of the Covid-19 committee on Tuesday.  It became clear that the number of inspectors available is totally inadequate, particularly in the regions.  In the south west and north west, we have nowhere near enough inspectors to ensure this return to work protocol is hammered home and becomes an effective document.  I say that because it is a worthy and impressive document when one holds it in one's hand.  The proof is in the pudding, however, and that will be when we see its application in the workplace.  We echo that call from SIPTU.  Does the Minister agree with it and will he agree to establish immediately a task force for a farm to fork working group?</p>  <p>  The second topic I want to focus on is migrant workers.  Three weeks ago, we stood here and, among other things, we spoke about matters concerning the Keelings issue, as it was discussed at the time, including issues regarding how migrant workers are accommodated.  We have had three weeks of increased cases of Covid-19 for workers in the meat industry.  I thank the Migrants Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, for providing me with some data for tonight's debate.  According to SIPTU, 70% to 90% of workers in meat processing plants are migrant workers.  If the Minister responds to any one of my questions, I ask him to respond to this one.  Does he believe that what has evolved through the Covid-19 crisis regarding migrant workers has reached a threshold where we need a further inspection or investigative regime to examine their pay, conditions and rights?  Does the Minister believe that a working group should be set up to examine the conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector?  I ask that because I, like many Members at the start of this crisis, stood up here and praised the food industry for being able to deliver full shelves of food and even coping with the spike in purchasing and panic buying that took place at the start.</p> <p>If I had known then what I know now, or been aware of the questions subsequently raised with me, I would have been somewhat more circumspect in my praise.  We have lost confidence in how the meat industry is treating its workers.  I wish to know, as I am sure Deputies Stanley, Br&iacute;d Smith and others also do, when we go into a store to buy meat, which processors are treating and paying their workers well, allowing them access to trade unions and advocacy groups and accommodating them well and safely.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, stated that the processors are passing tests, but some are not passing them.  My party and I believe they are treating their workers poorly.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, stated and the Minister, Deputy Creed, repeated that up to 60% or 70% of workers who were infected with coronavirus have returned to work.  I have no confidence that this is true.  These workers are tied to their employers for their permits and right to work.  They fear that if they do not go back to work, they will have no work to go back to.  There are similarities to the situation in direct provision, where there are concerns that people in direct provision are afraid to state that they have symptoms because they do not wish to be moved to another part of the country, away from whatever few support systems they may have, such as family, friends or a key worker in their current centre.</p> <p> Some of the quotes attributed to workers are really frightening.  One stated that if the disease was in animals, the factories would have to close, but when it affects workers, the factories can do what they want.   Another stated that there was no social distancing and that workers had to go through areas where everyone was practically on top of each other, sneezing or coughing.  Workers were not given masks or gloves.  Rather, they had to buy their own.  People were scared and it was unsafe.  Staff were given one mask each per week and had to bring it home and wash it at the end of each day.  That information provided by workers is enough to breach any threshold needed for a working group or inspection body to examine how migrant workers are treated in this industry.  There have been too many questions across too many aspects of the work for that not to happen.</p> <p> The Minister has a great opportunity to tackle this issue and to commit to doing so.  I acknowledge that it will be a longer piece of work, but there is a perception, right or wrong, that the Minister is backing the few stakeholders who control this &euro;2.4 billion or &euro;2.5 billion industry rather than backing the workers.</p> <p> These are vulnerable migrant workers who are open to exploitation.  It is possible that some are not being exploited, but others may be suffering exploitation.  We need to find out.  I am of the view that they are being exploited.  The Minister has an opportunity to back them by setting up a working group with officials from his Department, representatives of the trade union movement, advocacy groups and the HSE to begin work that will make Ireland the gold standard in the EU and perhaps the world in terms of how we treat migrant workers across all sectors of society.  He could start with the meat and wider food industry.  This is his opportunity.  A cloud of shame has been cast over the industry during this crisis.</p></speech>

They are not tied to any one employer.  If they wish to work for somebody else, they may do so.  Only in the region of 15% of these workers are on work permits.  They too have full employment rights and, because of the work permit system, they earn more than the minimum wage.  They may change employer if they so wish.  It is important to state that all of these workers have rights in that regard.</p></speech>

He referred to 70% to 90% of them being migrant workers.  We need to deal in facts.  The largest ethnic group working in the meat industry here comprises Irish people.  The overwhelming majority of people working in Irish meat plants are citizens of Ireland or other European Union countries.  As the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, stated, there is a minority of workers who are migrant workers on work permits.  As she pointed out, it is important to note that there are terms and conditions regarding issues such as wages for such employees.  Their wages are above the minimum wage requirement.</p> <p>They obviously have access to the same employment rights legal framework as every other worker.</p> <p> The Deputy's proposal about convening a task force has a familiar ring to it in the context of another task force in my Department on beef matters.  I am really disappointed and shocked he would say that he does not accept the figures published by the Minister for Health regarding the number of meat workers who have been contaminated and have gone back to work.  The Deputy is entitled to his own opinion but he is not entitled to his own facts.  These are the facts as confirmed by the HSE.  If we start undermining confidence in the figures that are published on these matters then we are on a hiding to nothing.  We can disagree on the interpretation of facts but the facts are that 60% of the 828 workers are back at work.  Any one case is a tragedy for the individual and his or her family and we need to work to ensure that there are no more cases.  I have replied to the request from SIPTU indicating that I do not intend to convene such a task force because the welfare of these workers in the context of Covid-19 is adequately provided for through the national outbreak team.  The latter has access to experts in the disciplines of public health, occupational health, environmental health, health and safety, as well as to the veterinary expertise within my own Department.  These are the disciplines that are needed around the table, informing the decisions that need to be taken in individual plants, up to and including closure if that is what the experts determine is necessary.</p></speech>

I did not get clear answers so I am back again, unfortunately, discussing the same issues and asking almost exactly the same questions.</p>  <p>  I am very new to politics.  I grew up on a dairy farm in West Cork which, like many, became unviable when milk quotas were lifted.  Now we are operating, albeit at a loss, in beef production.  In my lifetime, I have seen transformative change in Irish agriculture and the consequences for farmers and our wider communities.  I went on to study it and the more I learned and experienced, the more questions I had.  Why, for example, is the agrifood sector constantly moving in an unsustainable direction that continues to erode farmers&rsquo; and other workers&rsquo; rights, weakens our food security and causes irreparable damage to the land?  Who benefits?  It does not take long to realise that how our land is managed and who gains from it is the result of political choices.  Change can only come about when there is the political will to do so and this inspired me to engage in politics.  Having made it to this Chamber, with all that entails, I am sure the Minister can empathise with how frustrating it is for me to now realise how difficult it seems to be to get a straight answer in here.  I am asking the Minister, respectfully, to answer my questions this time.</p>  <p>  First, does he agree that the power of the beef processing sector needs to be tackled?  If so, what is he doing about it?  The power of the beef lobby is often mentioned in this Chamber, with references made to cartel-like practices, the ever-decreasing prices for farmers and the disgraceful treatment of workers.  Too often discussion regarding clusters in meat processing plants have focused on where some workers are from, a divisive us-and-them narrative.  If there is an us-versus-them, the "us" is farmers, consumers, butchers, as well as Irish and migrant workers while the "them" is an industry dominated by a small number of players who reap most of the rewards.  It is no coincidence that these clusters are in the mega-industrialised segment of the agrifood sector.  The global industrialisation of farming has contributed to the creation of viruses and the spread of this pandemic.  There are no clusters in small abattoirs, in butcher shops, or on small farms, whereas intensive farming relies on big meat processing plants.  I note that the Minister has acknowledged the current problem in beef plants but will he also acknowledge the bigger, more fundamental problems that have led to this one?</p>  <p>  My second question is as follows: does the Minister acknowledge how unsustainable our current practices are and what does he plan to do about it?</p> <p>Ensuring a food system is secure and safe involves more than ensuring stock is on shelves.  It is about reducing our total reliance on imports and shortening supply chains.  The sector should prioritise local economies, connecting producers and consumers, and protecting farmers and workers.  Only then can Irish people be confident that we have an ethical, safe food system.</p> <p> My next point is addressed to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  It is disappointing that it has taken this crisis and the health of workers for the conditions in meat processing factories to be seriously looked at.  The clusters of Covid-19 in meat plants have occurred despite warnings from workers and representative organisations.  These clusters were avoidable, as they were in direct provision centres, if warnings had been heeded.</p> <p> At the best of times, workers in this sector get low wages for physically demanding work and no proper sick pay.  Now, today, when the Minister and I are recommended to only spend two hours, socially distanced, in this large room, staff in meat plants certainly are not doing that.  They are working nearly on top of each other, in dangerous conditions, for long shifts.  In addition, there are a disproportionate number of migrants working in this industry, with non-EU workers&rsquo; residency depending on their job.  They have limited access to social welfare and some 10% have very little or no English, and they are not being heard.  These workers are incredibly vulnerable and we are obliged to ask if this vulnerability contributed to the clusters of Covid-19.  Why were calls for greater regulation and restrictions ignored?  Where were health inspectors and why were resources not available in plain English and other languages?</p> <p> The State and big business might be happy for this situation to continue but I and many of my constituents are not.  We want to know that our food is produced in a safe, ethical and fair way.  Workers deserve more protection, farmers deserve to be paid properly and the consumer deserves greater transparency.  Does the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, agree that workers' rights should be protected in meat processing plants?  If so, what is she doing about it?</p></speech>

On the power of the beef sector, we have taken specific actions to try to redress the balance.  The Deputy might be aware that we have been advocating for and have successfully established a number of producer organisations, for example.  The constant refrain regarding the beef sector has been that when an individual farmer rocks up outside a meat plant, he is a price taker.  We have been trying to sustain and financially support beef farmers in establishing producer organisations in order that they can work together collectively and, thereby, secure a better price by being able to have a critical mass in the marketplace.  That is a relatively new phenomenon.  It is not a panacea but they are part of the architecture in most other European countries and they deliver greater balance to farmers in an equation that has probably been unfairly tilted against them.</p></speech>

There is what is called the EU's unfair trading practices, UTP, directive, which we are transposing into national law.  In the context of that transposition, we went out to public consultation and one of the issues which we have attached to the implementation of the directive is a regulator for the sector, which will look at the dominance of the meat industry and see how, if possible, that dominance can be curtailed to the benefit of both the consumer and the primary producer.  They are two practical steps in terms of restoring some balance along the supply chain.</p></speech>

We have a fixed period within which we transpose the directive into national law.  We were doing it as quickly as possible.  As the directive was only completed at the end of 2019, we are losing no time on it.  The producer organisations are already up and running and I encourage farmers to join one, if they have not already done so.</p>  <p>  On the issue of sustainability, that is core to everything the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is about, notwithstanding some of the commentary that would suggest we are blindly indifferent.  As a result of the fact that we are so export oriented, we are acutely conscious of the legal framework within which we operate and the fact that if we do not meet specific targets, there are significant financial penalties.</p> <p>We are aware of the obligations to hand on the planet to future generations in the most sustainable way possible.  We are also acutely conscious that premium prices are available in the marketplace to which we are exporting if we can move further and further up the value chain.  This is why we have been working with Bord Bia through Origin Green to ensure the sustainability programme we are pursuing is not just a green sticker on an Irish product but that it is audited and verifiable.  It is not often recognised that these Bord Bia programmes are verifiable and audited and that they stand up to scrutiny.  This is part of the sustainability.  We are global leaders in the sustainability of our dairy industry.  Ireland and New Zealand are the most competitive in terms of carbon efficiency for dairy.  We are fifth in Europe in terms of beef.  We can do an awful lot more in this regard and this is the journey we are on because of the climate action plan the Government has published and the implementation of the targets in the road map.</p></speech>

We have inspections by the HSA and the WRC.  Workers in the meat sector enjoy the benefits of all employment rights.  It does not matter where they come from; they have access to all of the supports Irish workers enjoy.  If, for some reason, some of them must take time off they receive full illness benefits.  They have the exact same rights as all Irish workers.</p></speech>

We are very careful that they get paid more than the minimum wage.  In certain sectors they get paid considerably more than it.  In particular, meat boners receive &euro;27,000 per annum.  The WRC is the inspectorate that checks the conditions of employees.  They are being taken care of.</p></speech>

I want to address what I believe is the situation.  I believe the Minister has failed utterly to take seriously any warnings from Deputies in the House, to investigate them or to enforce basic health and safety regulations in the largest meat processors in the State.  The figures are quite breathtaking.  There are 16 clusters and this week, Dr. Colm Henry told us that 860 workers are infected.  The repeated attempt to state that 55% to 60% of them have returned to work is an attempt to minimise this stark statistic.</p>  <p>  On 30 April, the Minister was asked in the House about the situation in certain meat plants.  At the time he knew there were six clusters and that hundreds of workers were infected but he spent most of his time speaking about the supports and the capital and investment grants the Government was making available to the wider industry.  His key contribution was to state, "Our primary concern was to make sure that as we approach peak production, we keep processing capacity functioning".  To Deputy Stanley, the Minister said he did not want the message to go out that the factories were letting in the virus and letting it spread.  To Deputy Paul Murphy, he said that it was certainly not the case, on the basis of information available to him, that unsafe practices were taking place.  The Minister also said this is a pandemic and people get infected by one source or another.  Despite examples from Deputies he continued to defend these plants.  The Minister also stated there was nothing to suggest that the allegation that there were risks because of unsafe practices was actually true.  He stated it was a smear tactic dressed up as a concern, which was regrettable.  Today he has reiterated that the protection of public health has to be our overriding concern.  The Minister's chief concern then and now is to defend the owners of the major industries, such as the likes of Larry Goodman with his &euro;170 million profits per annum, Dawn Meats and Liffey Meats.  All of the big beef processors are being defended in disguise in here.</p> <p>On 6 May, the study from the US showed that wherever there are clusters in meat plants, within a 15-mile radius the community is twice as badly affected as other areas of the country.  The HSE needs to investigate that study, apply it to where meat plants are located in this country and check out what is happening with the communities around them.  On 8 May, we found that there are 566 cases of Covid in ten clusters in meat processing facilities.  Dr. Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer, had told us that of all workplace clusters, the meat industry is by far the worst.  We are three weeks on from the Minister's defence of the meat factory owners, when he more or less said that if people get infected one way or the other, it is nobody's fault, not his, not that of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, nor that of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  Perhaps it is their own fault, as was suggested in respect of another cohort of unfortunates who were infected in clusters in direct provision.  Perhaps it is their own fault because they were in unsafe work practices.  I want the Minister to tell us today whether his primary concern is for the health of the workers and the safety of the community.  Will he now apologise for misleading this House three weeks ago and will he apologise to those 800-plus workers who have suffered because all the regulatory bodies in this country have failed them?  The priority was really on the needs of the big beef barons to export the meat they were producing.  I call on the Minister now to do what the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is calling for and close those meat plants where clusters exist, to allow for deep cleaning and realignment in those factories, and to allow for safe practices to exist.  If the HSA will not tell the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, what meat plants it has examined, perhaps it will tell the Minister, Deputy Creed.</p></speech>

I certainly would not be comparing Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith to the devil, far from it.  However, I think she has selectively quoted what I said.  The priority agreed by this House was that the agrifood sector was an essential service and that it was crucial to keep supermarket shelves stocked, to keep people with a supply of safe food.  It was agreed collectively in this House that these people do essential work.  However, I always said that in so doing, the primacy of those workers' health and welfare was not to be compromised.  The record will show that on multiple occasions, at any time I have been asked questions about this issue.  The Deputy may say that I have or the Government has failed utterly and I suspect nothing that I can say here will change her mind about that.  We will agree to differ.  However, I think there should be some reassurance, perhaps if the Deputy is open to being reassured, that the HSE is, in terms of the outbreak control team both at local and national level-----</p></speech>

Three weeks ago, he accused me in this House of smearing the meat processing plants because I raised with him complaints from the meat factory workers and their unions and I called for them to be inspected by the Health and Safety Authority.  Does the Minister now accept that the Health and Safety Authority should have inspected the plants in April when the complaints were made?  Will he, please, withdraw his allegation that I was unfairly smearing the meat plants?</p></speech>

That is the case.  What I said, I stand over.  The Deputy's assertion is based on some logic which escapes me, to the effect that in some way it is beneficial for management to ensure the inefficiency of their processing operation by facilitating the contraction of Covid-19 by their workforce.  That surely is self-evidently not in the interest of management, the owners or the workers.  What I have clearly stated all along is that keeping food supply chains working through these essential workers, while important, is secondary to the welfare of these workers.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Creed, should withdraw the comments from three weeks ago.  The Minister should apologise to the meat factory workers of the country for not listening to their warnings and for not calling for inspections.  There were no HSA inspections of meat factories or of any other workplace in the entire country until Monday of this week.  It was zero.  Then we had 80 on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  In the last week alone we had 328 confirmed cases of meat factory workers contracting Covid-19.  That is almost 40% of all cases in the last week.  It is a catastrophic crisis.  It was preventable and the Minister was warned about it.  Instead of intervening, however, and instead of enforcing the guidelines the Minister and his Department looked the other way.  People could die as a consequence of that negligence.</p>  <p>  I will give the example I gave three weeks ago, which is Moyvalley Meats.  Three weeks ago the Minister, Deputy Creed, received an email from someone from inside that plant with information that staff with Covid-19 symptoms were working alongside healthy staff.  The Minister's office told them it was not an issue for his Department and pointed them to the HSE.  The HSE said that handling of breaches of the guidelines was not an issue for it and pointed them to the Garda.  The Garda did not know what to do about it.  This story is repeated everywhere.  For a month the HSA said that it had nothing to do with it and the HSE said exactly the same.  Since then that workplace is a Covid-19 cluster but I am told there has still been no inspection by a health and safety inspector.  To this day the workers say that the guidelines are still being broken.  I appeal to the Minister to not repeat the mistakes.  Enough mistakes have been made.  The Minister refused to accept it.  Incredibly, the Minister appears today unable to answer the question about how many inspections have taken place.  My mind is blown by the idea that the Minister would attend this debate knowing we were going to discuss meat factories, and not have that basic information.  I ask the Minister to not dismiss this appeal, to take it seriously and to intervene now to make sure Moyvalley Meats and the other factories are inspected immediately.</p></speech>

Much of this criticism is merited, and some of the criticism is exaggerated.  I find it hard to believe, as the Minister just said, that any meat industry owner or management would willingly be negligent to the extent that they would endanger their workforce.  The industry is now operating under exceptional circumstances.  Coping with the virus is a new and unexpected encounter for everyone.  We should assess the failures and weaknesses in the industry in a calm and measured way so that lessons can be learned.  We need to ensure that examples of effective best practice in protecting the health of workers are universally applied across all meat plants.  As Members of this House we have a responsibility to be accurate, to be fair and to be realistic in our appraisal of the meat industry sector and its performance in dealing with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I cannot speak with authority on what is happening in plants across the country but I can speak with knowledge on events at Rosderra Meats in Roscrea, which is in my constituency.  I was contacted by a number of workers and by my local councillor, Shane Lee, bringing to my attention the incidents of Covid-19 within the Rosderra factory and the local community in Roscrea.</p> <p>From the outset, our primary objective was to protect the health and welfare of the workforce.</p> <p> I worked closely with Councillor Lee to highlight to management the legitimate fears and concerns of the workers and also of the community and residents of Roscrea.  After discussions with senior management at the plant to ascertain the extent of the problem, I contacted the directors of the company.  I was advised that everything possible was being done to contain and control the spread of the virus.  This included a wide range of precautionary measures that were put in place in accordance with the guidelines.</p> <p> The company agreed to my suggestion to call in the HSE and conduct blanket testing.  This was conducted at the weekend of 24 and 25 April.  Six days later the laboratory results confirmed an unacceptable level of Covid infection in the workplace.  I was aware from my discussions with the directors that they were disturbed at the outcome.  They were determined to stop the spread of the virus and were deeply concerned that the virus was having a detrimental impact on the health of their workers.  Its impact was sapping energy and wreaking havoc with a hitherto busy and successful production line.  The company wanted to halt the virus in its tracks and was prepared to do whatever it took to bring it under control.  It sought professional advice, followed best practice and implemented every recommendation.  The HSE later confirmed that its personnel received total co-operation, had unrestricted access to the factory and was continuously monitoring the situation.</p> <p> On being advised of the identity of positive cases, those employees, together with close contacts, were put into immediate HSE-protocol self-isolation, away from the plant in their own accommodation.  Production was scaled back significantly in line with available staff.  Staff have since returned to work on a gradual basis and following the HSE protocol on self-isolation, Rosderra is almost back to full operational capacity.</p> <p> The safety and welfare of employees is of the utmost importance to this and other companies and they continue to be extremely vigilant with their protective measures for infection control including: providing a constant supply of PPE, that is, visors, masks and goggles; extending and reorganising canteens to facilitate adequate social distancing at break-times; having extended washing facilities in changing rooms; increasing the number of hand-sanitising stations, which were already at a high level as befitting a food production plant; and reconfiguring its operations to facilitate social distancing or partitioning workspaces where appropriate.  All employees have been informed not to come to work if feeling ill or experiencing Covid symptoms, and the company has trained and briefed all staff in their relevant languages on Covid-19-related issues, including Covid-19-related financial support measures. </p> <p> The vast majority of workers understand the serious nature of the situation and the absolute necessity to comply with every precautionary measure.  A minority, through carelessness or naivety, jeopardise their fellow workers and families by non-conforming actions.  These people need to be educated about the fact that this virus is at its best dangerous and at its worst deadly.</p> <p> We should be mindful of the fact that the company employs 440 people at its Roscrea plant.  It is vital to the local economy and makes a huge financial contribution to a town struggling for survival.  As the company is operating to international best standards, it has valuable export contracts to China, Japan, the USA, Canada and Australia.  It is, therefore, very important for the company to protect its hard-earned international reputation.  Conscious of these factors, I deliberately did not make any public comment or resort to big-bang publicity.  I decided the best approach in the workers' interest was to work with management to ensure the company got the full support of the State agencies in its efforts to curb the spread of the virus.</p> <p> The current predicament of the workforce or future job security is not well served by blame games.</p> <p>Condemnation serves no useful purpose and does nothing to improve the position of the workforce.  This is not a time to set management and workers against each other.  This is a time to work together to resist the common enemy, Covid-19.  I am on the side of keeping workers safe while also keeping their jobs safe.  There will be a future after Covid-19.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests to ensure that Rosderra Meats is part of that future.  In Tipperary we are also fortunate to have the contribution to our economy of other meat plants in Roscrea, Nenagh and Cahir and we value and appreciate them.</p> <p> I have made submissions to the Minister on lifting the restrictions on the greyhound racing sector.  This is a particularly important business and pastime in rural Ireland.  All of the protocols and procedures are in place for a safe reopening of our greyhound racing tracks.  I am satisfied that the Minister and his officials understand the necessity to reopen greyhound activities as soon as possible.  I ask that he expedite this decision in consultation with NPHET.  I would like to have the Minister's views on this matter first.</p></speech>

Every sector that is subject to the strictures of the road map that has been published is anxious to have the white flag raised for them at an earlier date.  I am aware of the interests of the greyhound sector in that regard.  I do not want to mislead anybody and it is not an easy ask but we are engaged with the sector and I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</p>  <p>  By way of response to the Deputy's observations on his constituency experience, I will not comment on an individual case but what I take from it is the co-operation that existed between the meat plant involved and the HSE.  Whereas I cannot answer for every individual plant, the feedback I am getting from my staff, who are in every one of these plants, is similar.  They are getting co-operation from management and the feedback from the HSE is equally reassuring.  Regrettably, that is not sufficient to say that the virus will not breach the best biosecurity measures that everybody collectively working in the best interests of worker welfare puts up.  It is, however, reassuring to know there is a unity of purpose.  Hopefully, for every individual who has been contaminated, there will be a successful outcome and recovery.  I also hope we can collectively try to halt the march of the virus, which is particularly insidious and difficult to contain.</p></speech>

I fully respect it is impossible for the Minister or anyone else to have all of the answers.  Every effort has to be made to keep the food chain open, especially when farmers are going through such a serious financial crisis.  I thank each and every meat plant worker for keeping the meat chain open by working through this crisis.</p>  <p>  On 19 March, I raised in this House the worries of the people of Castletownbere that some of the fishermen on foreign fishing vessels offloading fish could have the virus.  We saw last week that my worries were justified as a Spanish-registered trawler offloaded fish in Castletownbere and most of its crew had the coronavirus.  Some of them had the virus even before they left Spain but it was not reported ahead in Castletownbere.  This has to stop.  The people of Castletownbere and its surrounds have to be satisfied that all necessary protective measures are in place when foreign vessels arrive in their port.  Some health testing measures must be in place at the ports when fishermen have to leave their vessels.  I am delighted to see that Staunton Foods of Timoleague in west Cork, one of the country's biggest pork processing plants with 200 employees, has reported that it is coronavirus free.  Well done to the management there for doing its best to protect its staff.  I also hope this is the case with ABP in Bandon, which has more than 250 staff from Bandon and its surrounds.</p>  <p>  An issue that has arisen with Covid-19 clusters in meat factories is that of the accommodation of workers, many of whom are low-paid and are sharing living accommodation.</p> <p>What steps are being taken to ensure the guidelines on social isolation can be adhered to in this instance?</p> <p> To ease the worry of the consumer, I can state there are excellent Irish meat products sold in west Cork and throughout the country in butcher shops and ordinary grocery shops.  I have been told that if some members of staff have the coronavirus in a meat factory, they cannot pass it on via the meat products.  Is this the case?</p></speech>

People should be reassured that there is no evidence whatsoever to support the claim that they can.</p>  <p>  I am really disappointed that the Deputy would raise again in this forum the issue of Spanish fishermen, especially when the Irish fishing fleet, particularly the whitefish fleet he alluded to that fishes in Castletownbere in what are very difficult market circumstances, is trying to get its product into Spain.  The kinds of events we saw targeting the Spanish boats that were landing their product to have it processed in the co-operative in Castletownbere are extremely regrettable and damaging to our national interest.</p>  <p>  On the issue of social isolation, there are supports available to those who cannot self-isolate effectively.  There is support available from the HSE to explore.</p></speech>

The fact was that a Spanish-registered vessel left Spain when people on board had the coronavirus, and then it stopped in Castletownbere.  I have never said they cannot come into Castletownbere or any other port in Ireland; I asked what measures we have in place to protect the people of Castletownbere and its surrounds, or the people in any port in this country.  That is what I asked continuously.  On 19 March, I mentioned it here, and I asked the question again today.  I will not have any Minister or anyone else tell me I cannot raise an issue like this.  I will continue to do so.  The Minister has a duty to explain what measures we have in place.  If he cannot, he obviously has none in place.</p></speech>

I have never been so disappointed in the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, for not getting back to Deputies.

I asked her for help because I had information that would help her to help others but she believed she was above everyone and did not even acknowledge us.</p>  <p>  Limerick has stood up to the test and has offered help around this country.  I had to contact Ministers to tell them there was a company in Limerick making masks that was exporting to Germany.  They did not even know they had this within their grasp.  Now the company is producing masks for the HSE, and many staff in the HSE will now not wear any other mask because of the inferior material in the masks from elsewhere.  The Ministers never looked to home first; they looked to foreign shores because they did not know what they had themselves.</p>  <p>  There is a wonderful international company in west Limerick that helps the likes of the beef sector, on which everyone, including the farmers, is so dependent.  In this regard, I contacted the Ministers again, yet I got no call back.</p> <p>This product screens people when they walk up to a door.  It is an Irish product.  It screens them and tells them their temperature, and the door will not open if their temperature is too high, so they are not welcome if they are sick.  This is a product an Irish company has and yet again, it has not been picked up on.  I have brought it to the attention of the House again.  I mentioned it to the Minister for Health today.  In fairness to him, I cannot say enough of the help he has given to me and others and the information he has come back with; he was not too busy.</p> <p> No aid has been given to the farmers.  Livestock is selling at &euro;100 less per head due to Covid.  Farmers got hit for another &euro;100 due to Brexit.  Prior to the pandemic, cattle were selling at &euro;3.70 per kilogram and rising.  Now they are selling at &euro;3.40 per kilogram.  Overall, there has been a reduction of 80 cent per kilogram over the past two years.  Who can suffer these reductions?  Yes, steaks are selling to the public.  Steak makes up 10% of the quantity of the animal but 30% of its value.  Farmers can only claim the Covid-19 payment if they cease trading.  Is that not comical?  Something better than that would be expected in order to support our farmers.  What can the Minister do for the farmers?</p></speech>

The HSE did make visits but the chair of the HSA confirmed it made no visits.  The visits by the HSE were only in the context of dealing with an outbreak.  There were complaints but there were no visits whatsoever up to that point.  It came as a surprise to many Deputies to learn that the HSE gave results of people's tests to the meat factory bosses before it gave them to the workers themselves.  However, none of these factors will come as a surprise to the ordinary farmers of Ireland, who are well aware of the clout of meat factories and the beef barons in this State.  I am not suggesting that the Minister's Government is the first to have genuflected before the altar of the beef barons; it is just the latest Government to do so.</p> <p>There is a long history of tribunals and abuses of power by that sector.  That will continue for a long period.  This is simply emblematic of it.</p> <p> We have regulations in place.  We have strict separation of church and State in this country.  People are free to engage in public worship.  Public health is not a reason to confine that or limit it under the Constitution, yet we do so.  We say that a person can go to the funeral of a friend only if no one else is going.  How a person is supposed to know who else is going to a funeral before going himself, I do not know.  It seems a slightly unusual regulation, but that is what we do.  We have even closed the churches but we certainly will not interfere with the power of the beef barons in this State.</p> <p> I would not like to encroach upon the time of Deputy Fitzmaurice, who has eight minutes.</p></speech>

I want quick-fire answers to questions on different issues.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, said that if more than two people were diagnosed in a factory, or any business for that matter, the company was to contact the HSE.  What are the consequences if a company does not do that?</p>  <p>  Second, the role of the Health and Safety Authority has been brought up here many times.  Every year, we get different numbers of farm visits and all the different things.  Is it possible for the HSA to state that from 1 March to 20 May its staff had inspections in X number of meat plants in this country?  We do not want to know the names of the plants.  Is it possible to give that information for every Deputy who has brought up this matter so far?</p>  <p>  My next questions are for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Is it wise to have family members of factory workers who have come into contact with the virus and are isolating still working in the factory even though they live in the same house?  Why were the details about nursing homes announced in some areas to help ensure that we all batten down the hatches for a cluster, whereas information about factories was kept so far away?</p>  <p>  I will raise some points that related to the whole Covid-19 issue.  The price of cattle was brought up earlier.  Bulls have been sold during the past month at &euro;3.20 per kilogram.  Farmers are losing money.  Is the Minister going to bring in a beef exceptional aid measure?</p>  <p>  There are 1,400 trained and responsible people in Ireland.  The Minister is aware that there are probably 3,000 to 4,000 people from whom farmers get dosing stuff and fluking worms and all of that.  There is a problem coming down the line.  Is the Minister supportive of those people?  Will a resolution be found?  Can we still get our dosing stuff beside the mart where the shop was?  Are we going to lose those jobs?  I know the Minister is sending a letter to Europe.  Will he back those people?</p>  <p>  The next question is for both Ministers.  There are 12,000 people in the forestry sector.  We are talking about hitting climate targets and all of that.  At the moment, we have a company that can sell timber to the United Kingdom but it cannot get a felling licence.  Can anyone shed light on this?  What is going on in the forestry service?</p>  <p>  I know there have been court cases and problems.  I know the Minister had to get ecologists.  There is a backlog.  There are problems for businesses and a great many jobs are at risk.  Fine Gael is talking to the Green Party, which wants trees almost everywhere. The farmers of this country are being kicked up and down the road but when it came to Covid-19 they fed the country.  Since the planes stopped, at least the weather got good, even though the farmers are still farming.  What is going to be done for the forestry sector?  It is at crisis point.  The Government will not get near the targets we have set.  There is nothing coming out of the Department.  There is chaos in it.  I am not blaming the Minister but someone has to take the reins in there now.  We are losing jobs and exports.  From talking to the timber merchants, it is clear they are in serious trouble at the moment.</p></speech>

I am delighted to hear Deputy Fitzmaurice's support for the forestry sector.  We have difficulties in respect of licensing.  There have been a series of legal cases both domestically and in the European courts.  In effect, these have forced us to reconstruct our licensing process - to rebuild the process legally.  I am satisfied that we are making progress with the backlog.</p> <p>It is not helped by the constant appealing of licences we are issuing but we are making efforts to try to expedite the process, including the manner in which people are entitled to appeal.  It is affecting licences for felling, forestry roads and planting etc.  I appreciate the Deputy's support and concern in that regard.</p> <p> We have an EU directive on veterinary medicines that the Deputy has alluded to and we must transpose that into Irish law.  We are anxious to do that in a responsible fashion and we will engage with the sectors affected by it.  The previous speaker alluded to price when speaking about supports for the beef sector.  He might want to check the most recent prices but notwithstanding that, they are still significantly challenged.  As the Deputy is aware, the beef data and genomics programme amounts to approximately &euro;40 million and apart from that we are introducing an enhanced beef environmental efficiency programme, which will put in the region of another &euro;40 million into the sector.  That is on top of the beef exceptional aid measure that we had last year.</p> <p> With respect to isolation measures, I am trespassing on areas that are not germane to my Department's jurisdiction but my understanding is that if it is not possible to self-isolate, there is a centralised facility available with the assistance of the HSE.  It may be challenging to isolate in some domestic circumstances.</p></speech>
