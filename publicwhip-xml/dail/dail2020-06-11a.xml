    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100003#A00300"><p>It is now more than 100 days since the first recorded case of Covid-19 in our State, 92 days since the first person died from the virus, and 91 days since we instituted the first set of measures to suppress its spread and protect as many people as possible from its deadly power.  Today, as always, we think of the 1,695 people who, as of last night, have died from or with Covid-19, and a further 537 who have died in Northern Ireland.  Their lives shone brightly, and were brought to an end before their time.  As an Oireachtas, we seek to honour their lives as we mourn their deaths.</p>  <p>  In total, 25,231 people in the Republic of Ireland have been diagnosed with Covid-19, of whom 92% have recovered fully, with more on the mend.  Some 367,780 tests have been carried out, including 19,364 in the past week, of which 185 were positive, resulting in a positivity rate of less than 1% for the first time.  That is down from a peak of 20% back in April.  This rate continues to decline and is very encouraging.  It indicates that the easing of restrictions on our economy and people has not enabled the virus to make a comeback, at least not so far. </p> <p>Last Thursday when I spoke in the D&aacute;il, we had 47 new cases recorded the evening before.  Yesterday evening, the figure was 19.  This time last week, we had 36 people in intensive care units.  That number is now down to 29.  There were 165 in hospital with Covid-19 last week and that number is now down to 92.</p> <p> It is 42 days since we published the roadmap to reopen our country and four days since we moved into phase 2-plus, enabling us to take small but meaningful steps to where we want to be when this is over.  The Government is now conducting extensive work, with the help of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, on the revised phase 3 and phase 4 of the roadmap so we can have the country almost fully opened by the middle of July instead of the middle of August as originally planned.  However, some measures, such as public health advice and bans on mass gatherings, may need to continue for some time.</p> <p> As these are still the early stages, it is too soon to evaluate how phase 2-plus is going but the early indications are favourable.  As a country, we are optimistic but cautious  We are hopeful while avoiding unnecessary risk.  In the fine balancing act that our lives have become, we are getting things right more often than not.  Our plan is working and we shall stick to it.  It all depends, of course, on us continuing to keep the virus under control and there is always a risk that it might make a comeback but the past couple of days have been quite encouraging, notwithstanding the daily tragedy of new notified deaths to the Department of Health.</p> <p> We are continuing to secure and stockpile supplies of personal protective equipment, PPE, in case there is a second wave in the future and to improve testing and tracing turnaround times.  In this way, we can deal with resurgences locally without having to bring in major restrictions across the country again.</p> <p> As part of phase 2, the Cabinet made a decision to get childcare services reopened because so much of our recovery depends on it.  From 29 June, childcare services can reopen to ensure that one more obstacle is removed from stressed and anxious parents.  We are, of course, all aware that very many childcare services close in July and August but we anticipate that the vast majority of those that usually open for the summer months will reopen at the end of June.  Whether it is health or social care workers, or parents unable to return to work otherwise, the reopening of childcare centres provides reassurance and makes what they do possible.  It is also necessary to ensure that vulnerable children, as well as those who are homeless, experiencing poverty or disadvantage or child welfare issues, are looked out for.  I extend my thanks to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, and her officials, for the work that they have done to make all this possible.</p> <p> Thanks to everyone's hard work in pushing back the spread of the virus, it is now safe to implement a summer programme for children with special educational needs and disadvantaged children.  There will be a particular emphasis on social inclusion programmes such as the school completion programme, as well as numeracy and literacy programmes for schools in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme.  I believe it is right and appropriate that we are prioritising those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  It is also right that students with special educational needs benefit from the opportunities provided by the programme and do not miss out on this year.</p> <p> In line with public health guidance, the summer programme will be a home-based and school-based one and will be supported by the HSE, as well as the Department of Education and Skills.  Much will depend on schools, teachers and special needs assistants choosing to participate.  I know that everyone will do what they can to make sure this works but I appeal to school teachers and special needs assistants to participate because we cannot do this without them.</p> <p> The focus of the programme will be on students and young people with complex needs, including those who have significant behavioural, social, emotional and sensory difficulties. Children with Down's syndrome will be included and will be able to participate and benefit from what is on offer.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will bring specific proposals to Cabinet tomorrow for approval.</p> <p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as ucht na h&iacute;obairt&iacute; m&oacute;ra a rinne an pobal chun scaipeadh an v&iacute;ris a ch&uacute;ng&uacute; agus daoine eile a chosaint.

Mar chuid de sin, t&aacute;imid ag plean&aacute;il turas&oacute;ireacht agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; f&aacute;ilteachais a atos&uacute; ar an 29 Meitheamh.  N&iacute;l an samhradh caillte againn agus m&aacute; choinn&iacute;onn muid orainn ag d&eacute;anamh na ruda&iacute; cearta, is f&eacute;idir linn a bheith d&oacute;chasach faoi cad at&aacute; in ann d&uacute;inn.</p> <p> A Cheann Comhairle, when we began phase 1 of the roadmap, the Health and Safety Authority initiated a new national programme of inspections to ensure the safety of employees and customers when shops and businesses reopened.  Between 18 May and 5 June, over 1,200 inspections were carried out by the authority with more than 1,000 relating specifically to the return to work protocol.  These inspections were completed across a range of industry sectors including construction, which counted for close to half of all inspections.  An initial analysis of specific Covid-19 inspections shows that employers are generally taking a responsible and proactive approach.  Approximately three quarters of employers had a response plan in place.  Eight in ten had completed employee induction training and nine in ten had Covid control measures in place.  The HSA checklists and templates to drive implementation of the protocol have now been downloaded over 30,000 times.  I want to thank employers, employees, business organisations and trade unions for their contribution and for helping us to get back to work and to get businesses open.  The HSA is now working on further material for lead worker representatives and supporting a range of stakeholder groups as they seek to develop their own plans for a safe return.</p> <p> I know that this pandemic has hit some sections of society harder than others.  Some of those who could least withstand it have suffered the most.  Last Friday, the Government considered the impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities, Travellers, members of the Roma community and vulnerable migrants, among others.  We know the Garda has charged over 100 men with domestic abuse offences in recent weeks and that unfortunately, for some, the message of "stay at home" meant they could not stay safe because their homes are not safe places.  To all those living in fear because of domestic abuse or having experienced violence, I am deeply sorry that the restrictions have made things more difficult for you, but there are people available to help.  The Garda is just a phone call away or, if you want to talk to someone first, please reach out to family and friends or call one of the Government-supported helplines.  The Department of Justice and Equality is carrying out an analysis of the gender implications of the pandemic and this work will inform the next iteration of the social implications report and shape the actions we will take to help those most at risk.</p> <p> A Cheann Comhairle, as Professor Philip Nolan explained to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response on Tuesday, the Government's strategy is not one of mitigation; it is one of suppression, suppressing the virus to very low levels, to zero if possible, by keeping the R number well below one.  Unfortunately, as he noted, no strategy utterly insulates us from the risk of the virus re-emerging in our society.  We share an open land border with Northern Ireland, which has unrestricted travel with Great Britain, and that is a Westminster competence, not a Stormont one.  Our society, economy and personal liberties are European and we are deeply integrated with the European Union.  Indeed, we are European citizens.  Closing ourselves off from the rest of the world is not an option for Ireland in the medium to long term.  We need to be prepared for the risk of imported cases as we reopen slowly to other countries.  We need a testing and tracing system capable of identifying new cases, new clusters and a resurgence of the virus quickly so we can contain it and do not need to return to a national lockdown.  I am confident we can do that.  When we make our decisions, whether to restrict the way we live at the start of this emergency or to reopen our country now, we have at all times followed the fundamental principle of protecting lives and not doing harm.  We know there are many types of harm.  It is lost lives but it can also be lost livelihoods.  It is the damage to our children's education, the impact of a prolonged period of isolation on our mental health or the harm caused by delaying treatment for non-Covid-related illnesses or diseases, also known as secondary deaths.</p> <p>In the weeks ahead, we will continue to follow this approach of minimising harm and protecting lives as we work to rebuild our economy, reopen our country and realise our vision for a safe, secure and sustainable new way of living.  As always, I welcome Members' comments, questions and suggestions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100006#D00200"><p>Over the past three and a half months, more than 2,232 people have died on this island due to Covid-19.  Our first thoughts must be with their families and loved ones, especially those of the 39 people who have passed away since this day last week.  The sheer scale and pace of the impact of a pandemic such as this have not been experienced for 100 years and it continues to impact on nearly every corner of the world.  When we look back at the accumulated figures for cases since early March there is no question that a severe response was required both here and internationally.  For the purposes of deciding what we do now and in the coming weeks, the obvious focus has to be on the number of cases that are still active and those who are struggling to overcome the disease.  According to yesterday&rsquo;s statistics, in 92% of all positive cases it has been confirmed that a full recovery has been achieved.  Our hospitals are operating well within capacity and there is no urgent or likely risk that they will be overwhelmed.</p>  <p>  By every reasonable measure, it has been correct that major elements of the severe lockdown required in March are now being unwound, just as they have been in most of Europe.  However there are serious issues which we have to address concerning how we move forward and how we tackle the social and economic impact of the pandemic.  We should acknowledge the concerns raised in the letter published earlier this week from a significant number of scientists about the pace of reopening, as well as the clarifications which have come since then and the opposing views which also been aired.  I have often said that it is important to have challenging voices in this debate.  These scientists urged a level of caution which is unusual in terms of the advice being followed in countries comparable to Ireland.  Clearly, this links directly to a concern that people might believe that the threat is over and would allow a significant increase in transmission.  The evidence from countries which are far more advanced than Ireland in reopening is that there are two keys to preventing a significant increase in transmission.  The first is to do everything possible to reinforce appropriate behaviour and the second is to be able to rapidly test, trace and isolate when symptoms emerge.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that there is significant work to be done in both areas.</p>  <p>  As we have said for some time, the emphasis in public policy and communication needs to be on more than explaining restrictions.  It must encourage people to act appropriately irrespective of the level of restrictions.  Once people are able to leave their homes, it does not matter much how far from their home they are allowed to travel, what matters is how they behave when they travel.  We should all be concerned that public perception of how people are complying with restrictions has fallen in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  It is long past time to require masks to be worn in various settings.  Both the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have said that masks should be used in public transport, shops and similar settings.  There is no evidence of masks causing harm and mounting evidence of them preventing the spread of the virus.  This is because masks both physically limit the virus and, crucially, encourage greater awareness of proper behaviour.  The messaging has not been clear enough up to now.  The idea that one can only require masks if the state provides them is absurd.  They are cheap to make and every country which introduced rules on face covering has been able to implement them without discrimination and without state schemes.  In the weekly research published yesterday, 84% of people said they would wear a face covering if required, but only 28% said they were using a mask.  </p>  <p>  We must also be unambiguous in saying that we have the capacity to rapidly test, trace and isolate new cases.  While the number of close contacts per case has risen slightly, it is only a small fraction of the figure from March.  If we have the proper capacities in place, we can move forward.</p>  <p>  We still have not received a proper report on estimates of untreated illness and other factors which relate to assessing the impact of restrictions.</p> <p>After three and a half months, the secondary impacts of the response to the pandemic have started to become clearer and require our attention.  Mental health research has shown that up to one in five people can suffer a significant level of psychological trauma during major emergencies, including pandemics.  The Department of Health's weekly research has shown high levels of stress, which is consistent with this.  We need an urgent plan for how to increase mental health supports immediately and in the coming months.</p> <p> We also need to move more rapidly to achieve greater clarity on what will happen with schools.  In many countries, special needs services have been maintained or have been reopened.  I believe every Deputy will understand how the families of children with special needs urgently want a commitment concerning July.  I know the Government and the Minister are working on this.  For these children and their families, the lack of the expert and structured supports, which are only available in the school setting, is having a deep impact on them.  They are rightly calling for everything possible to be done to avoid their children losing more than six months of essential support.  Distance learning is not an option for them.  To be fair, many teachers have continued with such an approach since the schools closed but only the teachers and assistants working in schools have the expertise the children require.  A bit more clarity is required in that regard.  In his speech, the Taoiseach mentioned that we are dependent on teachers and those involved in childcare coming forward.  We would like to know if there is ongoing engagement with the profession and what is the likelihood of the services coming together.</p> <p> While this week's loosening of restrictions on some businesses has been very welcome, we need to realise that our businesses, and in particular our small businesses, are caught in their biggest ever crisis.  We still have roughly a million people receiving some sort of pandemic-related support and the numbers are coming down exceptionally slowly.  In many cases, industries are coming forward with plans for how they can safely reopen and they are desperate for more urgent engagement with their concerns.  Hairdressers are looking at measures throughout Europe which have enabled reopening and want to implement them here.  They deserve a comprehensive reply.  I know the Government is engaging with them.  The nation awaits developments in that regard with bated breath.  Some are more challenged than others, while some can manage it a bit more than others.</p> <p> Our SME sector as a whole needs a systematic plan for how to get back on its feet.  Measures announced to date are welcome, but they have barely scratched the surface of the challenge of preventing pandemic costs being a millstone around the neck of Irish business for years to come.  Ultimately, a major series of financial, legislative and policy measures is required to help us recover from this pandemic.  As we saw last week in Germany, the pandemic has changed the basic rules of what level of intervention should be considered and the role of government in leading recovery.  Yesterday's childcare measures are welcome but they may not go far enough.  The continuation of the wage subsidy scheme in this sector is an imperative and protecting the viability of existing childcare providers is paramount, in particular so as to enable a full retention of qualified childcare workers in the sector.</p> <p> Is l&eacute;ir f&oacute;s go bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im faoi leith ann maidir leis na gn&oacute;tha&iacute; beaga ar fud na t&iacute;re.  T&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; ann plean cuimsitheach a chur ar f&aacute;il agus gach taca&iacute;ocht is f&eacute;idir a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh.  Caithfimid beartais airgeadais, taca&iacute;ochta&iacute;, agus polasaithe a chur i bhfeidhm chun dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna at&aacute; ag na gn&oacute;tha&iacute; seo fadhbanna.  T&oacute;g, mar shampla, na gruagair&iacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil siad i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an Rialtas i l&aacute;thair na huaire agus t&aacute; pleananna acu chun dul i mbun oibre ar&iacute;s agus t&aacute; an t&iacute;r ag feitheamh ar cad a tharl&oacute;idh.</p> <p> Ireland needs a comprehensive and urgent strategy for recovery and this is something that will not come while we have a caretaker Government and a barely half-functioning Parliament.  There have been comments in recent days suggesting that even if a majority of Members of this House elect a Government it will somehow be a conspiracy against the people.  The aggressive populist tropes involved in this are not something which can distract us.</p> <p> Is l&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn go bhfuil g&eacute;argh&aacute; chun Rialtas a chur le ch&eacute;ile sa t&iacute;r um an dtaca seo.  T&aacute; fadhbanna ollmh&oacute;ra amach romhainn.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le h&eacute;inne &eacute; sin a sh&eacute;anadh.  T&aacute; g&aacute; le Rialtas le tromlach sa Pharlaimint seo agus beidh an Rialtas sin daonlathach.  T&aacute; polasa&iacute; faoi leith ag gach aon ghr&uacute;pa sa Pharlaimint seo agus is rud n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha go dtagann p&aacute;irtithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la le ch&eacute;ile ar mhaithe le pobal na t&iacute;re.</p> <p>My party continues to work with others in urgency and good faith to try to form a government that our country clearly needs.  Should a government be agreed, it will have both democratic legitimacy and a democratic imperative to act.  We have not even begun the work of recovery.  To genuinely move to the next stage of the response to the pandemic and to plan and implement recovery, we need a fully-functioning government working collectively and implementing an ambitious plan of recovery.  For our part, we will do everything possible to make sure that this happens with genuine urgency and that we begin to show people that our country will recover.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100008#F00200"><p>I begin by remembering every soul lost to this virus, sending sympathies to their families, friends and communities, extending our solidarity to those who are sick at this time and wishing them a full recovery, and acknowledging the heroic efforts of workers on the front line, particularly within our health services.  Today, as we are towards the tail end of Carer's Week, I particularly acknowledge the work of carers and home carers - people whose effort, very quietly carried out, has meant that people and families have some comfort and support in incredibly difficult circumstances.  These are people to whom we all owe a huge debt of gratitude and I sincerely hope, as the crisis abates and as we move back into normality of some sort, that their efforts will be continuously acknowledged because often they believe that they are left behind and forgotten.</p>  <p>  I have raised with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions the need for a plan for the provision of childcare.  By a plan, I mean one that is workable, realistic and sustainable, a plan that meets the real world needs of children and parents, and a plan formulated through proper consultation with childcare professionals and experts.  As we meet today, there is still considerable alarm and stress for parents.  There is undoubted confusion, and some anger, within the childcare sector and I have to tell the Taoiseach that these will not have been changed or abated by the Government's disappointing announcement yesterday.  The measures announced do not constitute a plan.  They do not comprise a solution.  At best, they might be described as a stopgap, a makeshift collection of short-term measures that inevitably lead parents and childcare providers back to the very same problems that we face today - those being a lack of investment, capacity problems, fees so high that they equate to a second mortgage and, of course, the precarious work and low pay of childcare workers.  Despite all of yesterday's fanfare, the truth is that under the Government's childcare package many childcare providers will be forced to either close their doors come September or see a situation where parents face another hike in childcare fees.  Families already struggle with the cost of childcare and I think we can all agree that another increase would be simply unbearable.  Under the Government's plan, many childcare workers may be forced on to the dole.  That is the reality and it is not fair.  In fact, it is mind-boggling that the Government cannot seem to grasp that childcare is absolutely vital to our society and to the building of a modern economy.  One cannot send thousands of people back to work without an answer to their childcare needs.</p>  <p>  An hour ago, some of us stood with a large group of women outside the D&aacute;il.  These women came seeking the extension of maternity leave for three months.  It is a common sense proposal.  The mothers are concerned about the availability of childcare for their young babies.  Many of them have not yet had the opportunity to introduce their new arrivals to their wider family circle and, indeed, to their grandparents.  Maternity leave benefit must be extended for mothers whose claim expires in the course of this pandemic.  That needs to be part of a plan and the Taoiseach needs to go back to the drawing board.  He needs to bring forward a workable real plan that goes beyond September and one that will command the confidence of parents and childcare professionals alike.</p> <p> Another area causing deep distress for many parents, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, is the matter of educational provision for children with special needs.  It is now two weeks until July, and still we have an ongoing lack of clarity regarding summer provision, which is quite astonishing.  I am sure that, like me, many Deputies saw the report on RT&Eacute; last week that featured parents at their wits' end trying to provide round-the-clock care to their children.  They heartbreakingly described their children as forgotten and left behind.  Too many families throughout the State are in this distressing situation.  The development and progress of these children have been badly affected since school closures.</p> <p> Cuireann siad s&iacute;os ar a gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; amhail is go bhfuil dearmad d&eacute;anta orthu agus go bhfuil siad f&aacute;gtha ar gc&uacute;l.  F&aacute;gadh an iomarca teaghlach tr&iacute;d an St&aacute;t sa ch&aacute;s seo.  Bh&iacute; drochthionchar ar fhorbairt agus ar dhul chun cinn na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; seo &oacute; d&uacute;nadh a gcuid scoileanna.</p> <p> One parent in the report - Angelina Hynes - described the impact on her daughter, Zoe.  She said Zoe bites her arm in frustration and eats her clothes.  Her daughter no longer engages and is not the child she was nine weeks ago.  She used to be able to spoon-feed herself, thanks to the hard work and dedication of her teachers, and that has now stopped entirely.  These children, we all agree, need support, their specialised routines and expert care.  The parents and children need the Government to act.  There are concerns already, even before the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, has announced his scheme, as to whether it will answer problems in respect of protocols and organised transport and there is a deep worry surrounding the issue of insurance.</p> <p> I am at this stage genuinely concerned that the Government fails to grasp the enormous strain that parents and families are under.  It seems that it is content to roll along, providing sticking plaster and half-baked fixes, while parents and families are left in limbo.  Will the Taoiseach go back and bring forward a real plan, that is, one that in real terms allows childcare providers to reopen their doors, ensures the jobs of childcare workers and their incomes, and ensures that parents can access childcare at affordable rates?  Will he provide within that plan for a three-month extension to maternity leave?  Will he tell us that the scheme to be announced tomorrow for summer provision will answer the concerns about protocols, transport and the issue of insurance?</p></speech>

As she said, these concerns exist before the announcement has been made.  I anticipate and hope that should the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, get approval for the summer programme tomorrow, they will be able to answer questions and allay any concerns that people have tomorrow.  In fairness to them, they cannot do that until they have Government or Cabinet approval for the summer programme.</p>  <p>  On childcare, we have a good plan in place.  It has been largely, although not universally, well received and it will facilitate the reopening of childcare centres for the months of July and August.  There is a reopening grant, there are capital grants to carry out works to childcare centres, and there is also a wage subsidy, with the Government paying roughly 70% of the wages in the sector during that period.  I agree that a longer-term plan will be needed to apply from September onwards, but it is our view that, at least as of now, that should be a matter for the new Government, and there have been discussions about childcare among the parties willing to form a Government.  The Deputy's party has given up on any attempt to form a Government and it will not have a say or a role in that.  The parties forming a Government will have a say and will, of course, consult the sector, as they should.</p>  <p>  In respect of maternity leave and maternity benefit, we are happy to consider any proposals being made.  In the Deputy's initial contribution, she mentioned maternity benefit and later she mentioned maternity leave, but they are not the same.  Paternity benefit and paternity leave, as well as parental benefit and parental leave, will also have to come into the mix because sometimes, although not commonly, the man is the main carer in a one-parent family. </p> <p>If the Deputy has proposals that are comprehensive, however, we would be very happy to examine them.</p></speech>

I urge the Taoiseach to consider this and deliver on it very quickly.  It is just plain common sense.  One should think about what it is like to bring home a newborn in these circumstances, isolated from family and with all the concerns that emerge in that scenario.  There is concern over whether very young children, babies, will be able to get childcare places.  I wish to press the Taoiseach on this.  I ask him to make progress on it.  I have made the point to him that his childcare plan is not a proper one, and I am disappointed that, on reflection, he cannot see that as an obvious fact.</p>  <p>  On special provision, the Taoiseach should bear in mind that weeks ago there was to be a scheme involving special needs assistants and supports for the children involved and their families, but it came to nothing.  I appeal to the Taoiseach not to disappoint the families and children again.  They are in dire straits.  They need a scheme that they can really access and one that delivers the real supports they desperately need.  I hope the scheme announced tomorrow will answer the concerns I have raised and many others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="12:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100010#H00300"><p>Two days ago, George Floyd was buried.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the African-American people who have been under the knee of suppression for so long.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.  The Black Lives Matter movement is strengthening and correctly building a community response to what needs to be done in the United States but we would all agree that our support for it is best reflected in what we do to counter racism in our own country.  I was glad to see yesterday that the Taoiseach had an online meeting with Irish people of colour to talk about how we should use this special moment to eliminate racism in this country.  I want to know the Taoiseach's thoughts on what we can do specifically in this regard.</p>  <p>  It was interesting to read relevant articles on this subject in the newspapers today.  There was a story about Le Ch&eacute;ile secondary school, Tyrellstown.  In a sense, it was a good story in that it was about integration.  It was about a black Irish teacher showing how it can be done and how we can integrate and rid ourselves of the scourge of racism.  The statistics were interesting, however.  One in ten of our children is from a non-Irish or new Irish background but only one in 20 of our teachers is.  We know from our constituencies that, increasingly, there is segregation in our school system, whereby certain schools take all the pupils from the new communities while others pretty much take none.  Therefore, if we are serious about this issue, should we not commit to ensuring our education system is fully integrated so there will be no segregation and separation as pupils start out in the school system?  Is that not one thing we could commit to trying to do?</p>  <p>  In a newspaper today there was a story by a young Irishman, Sean Gallen, who gave his experience of being othered and, from the age of six, being given that name, "You nigger".  He explained how this completely undermines people.  Friends and relations of colour in this country, Travellers and members of other minorities, speak of the same experience.  It is real.</p>  <p>  It is interesting to consider policing in this regard.  We must make sure that policing, as it evolves, will be blind to colour, ethnicity, postcode, or where someone comes from.  Again, we should look at the statistics.  One in ten people is new Irish but only one in 200 garda&iacute; is from a new Irish ethnic background.  A second commitment to change could be to ensure our society does not continue to fall foul of the lack of security for all people in the country.</p> <p>I hope we are coming to really address the third matter, which is how we treat those who are most vulnerable.  If people are seeking asylum or refuge here, we must immediately end the processes where we put them in conditions in direct provision that fundamentally undermine their mental health and ability to make this country their home if they are approved to stay here.  The way we are doing things fundamentally undermines their health, so it must stop and change.  I welcome the sense I have from parties across this House that this is something we can all commit to doing.  We must look to be the very best we can in accepting and welcoming asylum seekers to our country, acting quickly in deciding their status and treating them with real care and respect while they are here when and if they stay.</p> <p> The fourth matter is probably the most complex.  This relates to how we manage online communications where some overt racism and extremism can be seen.  As politicians, we are aware of it and can see certain strands but, to be honest, these are not the worst.  We have a special responsibility because we are the European, Middle Eastern and African headquarters for most of the social platforms where much of this hate speech, often racist in tone and terrifying, is becoming evident.  We must work with the companies to ensure they have duty of care stitched into their business models.  It is not possible to police every online communication on every social media network but the business models, regulatory systems, ethos and ethics, along with rules and punitive measures, should be in place to ensure we do not see what has been a characteristic of these online platforms, which is division and derision, becoming acceptable in our daily lives.</p> <p> I hope to give the Taoiseach as much time as possible to reply as I am keen to hear his views.  Do we not need to ensure that we as a country have the maxim that my security is maximised when my neighbour's security is protected too, and that our security is best guaranteed when prosperity is shared across this country?  We should set ourselves the target of being the country with the least divergence in wealth and income as best we can.  Such matters are often the root of these fearful racist tendencies and instincts; communities can sometimes feel they are being left behind, which breeds resentment and fear of "other" or "new".</p> <p> We must ensure the new communities can get a leg up and are not relying on a separate "black" economy - literal in this case - where people may not be paid properly and working conditions are not as good.  We will manage this matter best by tackling racism and creating a social justice economy that guarantees everybody's security and prosperity.  In doing so, we will remove the scourge of "othering" and creating a basic divergence that facilitates the racism that exists in our country.  Let us not pretend racism does not exist here.  It is our job to try to help remove it.  I am interested to hear how the Taoiseach's conversation went yesterday and if he agrees with those kinds of measures.</p></speech>

We all agree, accept and understand that racism exists in every society.  It may take different forms but that makes it no less real.  Sadly, Ireland is by no means immune to the scourge of racism.</p>  <p>  I had a very good engagement yesterday, as the Deputy mentioned, with Irish people who are black and of colour.  That Zoom call went on for over an hour as a forum to hear from them and share our collective experience of racism in Ireland.  There were ideas aired that could be pursued and one certainly concerns education and ensuring we educate children better in schools and throughout the educational cycle about what is racism, how to identify it and how to deal with it.  An interesting point from the conversation was that much of the education now around racism tells people what not to say and how a word or name should not be used, but many people feel this to be disabling.  They do not know what they should say.  How do we talk about the elephant in the room, which may be race?  That is part of what we must do.</p> <p> We need a reform of our incitement to hatred laws.  That work was started by the outgoing Government.  I hope it will be completed by the next one to modernise our hate speech and hate crime laws.</p> <p> Work under way that needs to be completed by the next Government is the creation of an online safety commissioner and a proper infrastructure, legally underpinned, to require social media platforms to take down material that is racist, offensive or incites violence or hatred in any way.  </p> <p> One point I strongly agree with the Deputy on is the need to set a target to have a number of people from ethnic minorities in areas of the public service.  We have a health service that is very diverse, although less so as one goes up towards the senior positions, not so much in the Garda, the Defence Forces, the education sector, as the Deputy mentioned, and not at all in the Civil Service, which is very white, including the Department of Justice and Equality, for example.  That needs to change.  We need to have a target for people who come from ethnic minority backgrounds but also dedicated recruitment campaigns to encourage people because we need to ensure that a generation of young people of colour growing up in Ireland see black and brown school principals, judges and perhaps Cinn Comhairle in the future.  Who knows?  Visibility and opportunity is very important.</p> <p> On direct provision, as I said in the House previously, I agree that much of the accommodation is substandard and that needs to change.  It would not be honest to say that we can immediately end it.  We need to be honest about that.  It has been in place for 20 years, nine years under my party and, let us not forget, four years under the Green Party.  If we could provide own-door, self-catering accommodation to 7,000 people tomorrow we probably would but we cannot do that.  Also, we do not know how many will come into the country this year, next year and other years but I do believe we should try to phase it out.</p> <p> On income inequality, I agree it can drive racism.  We are one of the few countries in recent years that has actually reduced income inequality.  We should be proud of having achieved that as a country.  Poverty has fallen every year for the past five years, as has deprivation.  That needs to continue and as we have demonstrated in the past five years, the best way to reduce poverty and income inequality is job creation and opportunity.  That is what needs to be reinforced.  We must ensure that we do not go backwards in terms of our commitment to job creation and providing people with opportunities to advance themselves.</p></speech>

I witnessed it again directly this week.  Our condolences to all of those who have lost loved ones.</p>  <p>  I have six questions for the Taoiseach, some of which I would say will require only brief answers.  I will put them to him and give him time to answer.  I want to start by complimenting the Taoiseach, which is rare in this House.  It is not always the case that Governments listen to Opposition parties and take on board what they are saying but I have seen evidence, whether directly in this House, through committees or through direct conversations with some Ministers - I say "some" in inverted commas - that suggestions put forward have been taken on board.  I welcome that.  Some time ago, I suggested that the phasing out of the restrictions should be brought down from five phases to four.  The Taoiseach announced that last week.  I welcome that also.</p>  <p>  On the roadmap my former employers in F&aacute;ilte Ireland brought out during the week, to be fair, they made a good stab at it, so to speak.  It is not their fault but it is unimplementable and not viable for most businesses.  Tens of thousands of people are depending on that changing by 29 June.  It all hangs around the 2 m versus 1 m distance question.  If we are going where we are going with the virus, thanks to all the work that has been done, I would encourage the Taoiseach to announce that in advance to give businesses time to prepare.  The same applies to personal services as regards hairdressing and so on.  I believe that we are very much dependent on reducing the 2 m to 1 m in respect of the entire tourism and hospitality sector so I would encourage the Taoiseach to do that and give businesses time to prepare.  That is my first question, which I ask the Taoiseach to consider.</p>  <p>  While the Taoiseach is in listening mode I have two more questions, one of which is on the flu vaccine, which I have asked about previously.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider that in the coming calendar year - this may be for two years but particularly as a one-off for this year coming - we would give the flu vaccine to everybody free of charge.  It works out at approximately &euro;10 million per each additional half a million people.  It would depend on the number of people that take it up.  Obviously, we need to ensure that those working professionally in the health service need to take the flu vaccine but we cannot face into flu season while dealing with Covid at the same time.</p> <p>I would be happy enough if the Taoiseach would just consider it.  I think everybody in the House would support it.  It is just common sense.  I encourage the Taoiseach to take this action.</p> <p> The handling of the commentary with regard to face masks has been an absolute and chronic disaster.  There has been commentary from NPHET and many very eminent experts in disease control, etc., but it has been a disaster.  My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, proposed giving a communication to everyone in the country.  The Taoiseach should do this.  Workers need to be respected.  Nobody should get on public transport without a mask, full stop.  People should wear masks in retail outlets to protect workers.  They deserve respect and to be protected.  I suggest a once-off communication to everybody in the country that would provide examples of masks.  In Catalonia, everyone can get a mask in the pharmacy for free and, in addition, can buy one for less than a euro.  I ask the Taoiseach to please consider that.</p> <p> With regard to the health service generally, he said last week that the board of the HSE would release a new plan for non-Covid healthcare.  I have been raising this issue here for five or six weeks but we still do not have that plan.  That is not acceptable.  This is the biggest issue in our country.  Ireland Thinks has pointed out that one in three people is not going to appointments with doctors until he or she feels the Covid situation has passed.  Where is the plan?  Is the issue that the parameters set by NPHET with regard to whether a social distance of 1 m or 2 m must be maintained are so strict that they would cause a crisis in healthcare?  Is that why the board does not want to publish the plan?  Is it that such a plan would demonstrate the number of appointments that would have to be dropped and that the percentage of people who would be given appointments would be very low as a result of not decreasing the distance to 1 m?  Is that the reason?</p> <p> With regard to cancer screening, Dr. Doireann O'Leary was in contact with me.  She is aghast that screening services are not operating.  GP services are operating.  Such services could easily send on smears.  Where is the plan in this regard?  We have spent years fighting and saying that screening saves lives.  It is not saving lives at the moment and there is no urgency about the issue.  I ask the Taoiseach to answer that point.</p> <p> I have two final quick questions.  What is the Taoiseach's personal view on maintaining the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?  Does he believe we should have such a Department?</p> <p> I know he will not be able to fully answer my final question but I would like his opinion.  There is an individual from our country who, according to the High Court, is a very senior figure in organised crime on a global scale.  According to the Criminal Assets Bureau, he has controlled and managed the operations of the Kinahan organised crime group for some time.  He is now rebranding himself as a boxing promoter in the Middle East.  One of the most famous individuals involved in that sport has described him as a smart, able and honest man.  Our country has to intervene with the United Arab Emirates through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of this individual.  We owe it to the victims of that cartel.  Our country needs to do this and to do it today.  We also need to communicate very strongly with certain sports broadcasters, sports companies and other companies involved in this matter.  This is an important juncture.  I ask the Taoiseach to highlight, through the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, how important this issue is to us because of the parasitical, criminal activities of this individual and all associated with him.</p></speech>

I do not want to say too much about it but I was rather taken aback to see Tyson Fury dropping the name of the person the Deputy mentioned in a video the other day as if he was not a person with quite a chequered history in this State and elsewhere.</p> <p>While I cannot comment on a particular Garda operation, I can certainly assure the Deputy that there has been contact between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the authorities in the United Arab Emirates about that matter.</p> <p> On the 2 m and 1 m issue, as I mentioned previously, everybody acknowledges that 2 m is better than 1 m.  A distance of 1 m or more gives the person approximately 70% protection and it is closer to 95% at 2 m.  We also appreciate that there are certain circumstances where that may not be viable.  The virus being so successfully suppressed in our community now allows us to re-examine that, and NPHET is doing some work on that in consultation with us.</p> <p> Regarding the flu vaccine, the Minister for Health has announced the biggest expansion ever of the flu vaccination programme.  Children will get the vaccine this autumn, for example, as will many more vulnerable groups.  We will consider the Deputy's proposal of making it universal.  I have not seen the merits and demerits of that, but it is something worth considering.</p> <p> The advice on face masks and face coverings is very simple.  It is that one should wear a face mask or face covering when using public transport or when in a crowded indoor place such as a supermarket.  People should be aware that it is not a magic shield or an alternative to physical distancing, hand washing or other things, but it can help in terms of additionality.  It should be worn properly.  People should wash their hands before putting it on, cover their nose and mouth and should not wear it around the neck like a scarf because it is a mask.  We will have to launch a new public information campaign to reinforce that.  However, there were revised guidelines from the WHO just in the last few days so we want to ensure that we launch a public information campaign that does not change in a week or two when new advice arrives.  We want to get it right.</p> <p> My understanding from the Minister for Health is that screening will resume over the summer, starting with smear taking and cervical screening.  It is not yet confirmed, but that is certainly the intention.</p> <p> As regards the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, that Department was established by my party and the Deputy's party when they formed a Government in 2011.  It has been a positive and progressive development, ensuring that the rights of children are now enshrined in the Constitution, mandatory reporting became a reality, Tusla was established and the national childcare scheme was implemented.  It is a good thing that we have had a Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Bear in mind, however, that when a new Department is created it comes at a cost.  The Department of Defence ceased to be a stand-alone Department as a consequence and the community, rural and Gaeltacht Department disappeared.  There were negative consequences of that.  Under the Constitution, one of the constraints one works under is that there can be any number of Departments but there can only be 15 senior Ministers.  It is pretty meaningless to call for a new Department to be created or for a Department to be retained if one does not say which 15 one wants, because then one is not being entirely honest with people.  I always ask anyone calling for a new Department to be established to say which one he or she wishes to be merged or abolished.  The same applies the other way around too.</p></speech>

In the sea of what has been confusing messaging on a host of measures, not least face coverings although the Taoiseach has addressed that to some degree today, it is fair to say that people are also confused about the realistic prospect, or not, of air travel in the near future.  Michael O'Leary has been omnipresent, telling everyone who will listen that Ryanair has everything sorted and is restoring 40% of its flights from 1 July.  Ryanair is proudly announcing on its website that travel restrictions are lifted and that it is open for holidays from &euro;39.99.</p>  <p>  I had a good look at the website and nowhere does it refer to the Government restrictions that have been imposed regarding the need to self-isolate for two weeks upon landing, or the fact that a mandatory form must be completed on which one gives an address at which one may be contacted.  We have to be realistic.  Where somebody goes away for a week's holiday, is he or she really going to take three weeks off, isolate for two weeks and not return to work?  It is similar for somebody who goes on a business trip for a few days.  We must be realistic about this.  From 1 July, the scale of this issue becomes much bigger.</p>  <p>We all agree that had travel restrictions been in place in March when we had a large influx of visitors from northern Italy, we may have had a considerably reduced number of infections.  Indeed, we may well have had avoidable deaths.</p> <p> The aim of the roadmap is to reopen as much as possible, as soon as possible and as safely as possible.  While that is fine, a quick and reliable method of testing and tracing becomes critically important in ensuring we do not regress.  Accordingly, we need to carefully manage risk and travel is one of the main risks.</p> <p> Last week, the House was told by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that social distancing will occur on airlines where possible.  The phrase, "where possible" could mean limiting the number of passengers or separating people where the flights are not fully booked.  What happens in cases where they are fully booked?  Ultimately, who decides that and how is it policed?  Are we happy that those decisions are being made by a particular airline or has the Government plans to manage this?</p> <p> Michael O'Leary's business is flying people and making a profit.  Our business is about keeping people safe.  The two are not necessarily in keeping with one another.  We cannot be complacent about the potential growth of the virus becoming resurgent.  In the US, for example, just six weeks ago, there were seven states where the R number was greater than one.  Today, there are 15 states where the R number is greater than one.  That signals that the virus is expanding.  The UK's top government scientist appeared to acknowledge, at least in private, that the R number appears to be above one there.  Daily flights from 1 July to London, Birmingham, Manchester and many other UK destinations, however, are now being advertised.</p> <p> With a small number of flights, it is possible to test and trace.  If that is scaled up dramatically, then it requires a significantly scaled up testing and tracing operation.  Who will do that?  Is that being planned for?  When it comes to testing at airports, bearing in mind that hospitals do tests and give results within ten minutes from start to finish, is that an option?  If so, could that not be used in other settings?  Is it about cost?  Is it about reliability when hospitals see them as reliable tests?  There is talk of air corridors, as well as places and locations where testing is done at airports.  What is the approach?</p> <p> In addition to the confusion about face coverings, although that seems to be fairly clear with regard to air travel, we are being told that they will be mandatory on flights.  How is that going to be policed?  There are nervous flyers and children on flights, for example.  These are very mixed messages.</p> <p> The ideal would be to eliminate the virus.  Failing that, the best we can do is to manage it and keep it to an absolute minimum.  Travel is such an important part of that.  Our airlines are a really important industry, which I acknowledge.  However, they have to operate safely.  Who is making the decision on this?  Is it being made by the airlines or is the Government policing this?  With increased flights, will the Taoiseach tell the House how it is intended to manage the risks?  Will it be scaled up?  If so, who will do it?  Is it not self-evident that testing at airports and ports must happen?</p></speech>

The decisions we make will be co-ordinated with the European Commission and with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA.  We need to bear in mind that we are all EU citizens.  EU citizens have the freedom to travel, work and study anywhere in the European Union.  We can bring in limitations based on public health but they have to be justified.</p>  <p>  In terms of foreign travel - by foreign travel I mean travel off the island of Ireland - our advice is that people should not engage in any unnecessary travel.  The message is clear.  It is there any time one turns on the TV.  One should stay local, not leave one's county and not go more than 20 km from one's home unless one has to.  That certainly says one should not travel abroad.</p>  <p>  Anyone entering the country through our ports and airports has to sign a passenger locator form.  It is an offence to fill it in falsely.</p> <p>People are strongly advised to self-isolate for 14 days.  The plan is to establish air bridges with other countries that have a similar level of viral suppression.  We have not agreed any of them yet but that is the plan.  Consideration is being given to testing at airports and ports but there are limitations.  The cost of the test is not low.  There is the inevitability of false negatives, since people in the early stages of the disease may not test positive but may spread it within days.  A 14 day self-isolation period is still the safe route.</p></speech>

Are there limits on the number of people allowed to board a flight?  If not, is it really possible to socially distance if the flight is full?  A number of weeks ago, we saw photographs of an Aer Lingus flight from Belfast at the height of the pandemic here.  That is the kind of thing that we are likely to see.  We all want the least amount of restriction but where people have put in so much effort, not least front-line workers and people who have cocooned for months, we cannot ignore the risks from particular locations where the R-nought is high.  That has to be managed.  When one turns on the radio, one hears, almost in the same group of advertisements about Government restrictions, about flights.  One has to remember that flights go in two directions and people will be coming to this country from places where there is a higher rate of infection than there is here.  How that is managed is critically important.  Will the Taoiseach tell us about the scaling up of testing and tracing in the context of an increased number of people coming into this country by airports and ferry ports?</p></speech>

It can be used if we need to do so in the future.  The future will involve making sure that we have a very strong testing and tracing capacity, so that any important cases and new clusters are identified quickly and can be stamped on quickly, so that they do not spread and we do not have to engage in any more lockdowns.  What the Deputy says is absolutely correct about social distancing on planes and in airports being extremely difficult to achieve, so that is another place where people would be advised to wear masks.  We do not have any air bridges yet, so we are advising people not to come here and not to fly out of the country.  To give an idea of the countries where there is a similar number of low cases to here, there were 16 in Ireland yesterday, 15 in Finland and ten in Greece.  In countries such as those, the number of new cases is very low and therefore the risk of journeys between those countries would be very low.  It can change quickly.  We thought Portugal was one of them and there were 400 cases in Portugal yesterday.  It is still a changing picture.</p></speech>

I give a shout-out to the thousands of Debenhams workers who are protesting outside closed stores today.  We should remember the impact on their lives too.  I have something to give to the Taoiseach, so he should chalk it up, because it is not often that he will get anything from me.  I will leave it at the desk in front of the Ceann Comhairle for the Taoiseach to collect.  It is a petition from more than 25,000 of our citizens, who are calling for the extension of maternity leave and benefit for women who are currently on maternity leave.  As was mentioned earlier, we met them outside the D&aacute;il this morning and they handed over this petition.  I thank those new mothers for the work that they have put into it.  I thank Uplift and the National Women's Council for supporting them.  I am sure, as a doctor, that the Taoiseach understands the stress and anxiety that new mothers face in having to return to work in normal circumstances.</p> <p>In these circumstances that stress and anxiety are enormous.  They also face the possibility of having absolutely no childcare, with no option of relying on their families.</p> <p> I raised this issue with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It seems that this is a parcel that is being passed around.  I welcome the opportunity to address the Taoiseach on this.  Before he answers, I want to say that I do not accept the excuse that this requires primary legislation.  I welcome the extension of the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme to those on maternity leave, introduced in this House a week or two ago.  That requires retrospective legislation.  The same can be done with this.  I do not accept that we cannot do it.  The cost of extending this to all those mothers who would be entitled to it for three months which was quoted to me by Deputy Regina Doherty, some &euro;134 million, is a pittance compared to what we are prepared to pay out to industry or what we normally pay out to the greyhound and horse racing industries.  The contribution to society of these mothers and their babies is well worth it.</p> <p> This would be a brave move by the Taoiseach.  There is a similar campaign in Britain.  The Taoiseach could take the lead.  Does he have the political will to make sure that this happens and that legislation is introduced retrospectively?  Rather than putting this stress, anxiety and worry upon these families, will he allow them to stay on maternity leave with benefits for an extra three months?  He should remember that many of these new mothers are lone parents.  They really need the financial assistance that goes with the extended leave.  It is not a question of taking unpaid leave or relying on parental leave.  They need to be treated as a special case during the Covid-19 crisis.  Any excuse concerning legislation is unacceptable.  We have extended and changed legislation relating to evictions, planning laws, labour laws and employment laws.  This can be done for the mothers and children of this country, who are worth every penny and every move the Taoiseach can make.</p></speech>

I will give it full and meaningful consideration over the next couple of days.  I mean that.  A lot of the legislation the Deputy mentioned was passed when we had a properly constituted Seanad.  We do not have one now, so we are not in a position to enact primary legislation.  This may require that.  We cannot always bring in retrospective legislation.  The leave aspect would be justice legislation and the benefit aspect would be social protection legislation.  We will give it due consideration.  I am aware of the strength of feeling behind the campaign and I can certainly see the benefits of extending maternity leave and maternity benefit for families who had a newborn in the last couple of months.</p>  <p>  I am always nervous when reading stories in the newspapers that relate to scientific papers because they are often not reported correctly.  However, I read an interesting story in the papers today showing that there had been a significant decrease in the number of babies of low birth weight born in University Maternity Hospital Limerick.  That is really interesting because a few weeks ago we worried that the increase in stress and anxiety during this period would have negative health impacts.  I think it has, but this positive health impact is a silver lining.  It seems that the lockdown has led to a different lifestyle, resulting in fewer babies being born with a low birth weight.  That is really significant but it is only one study.  We would not want to read too much into it but it is interesting.</p></speech>

That is not true.  The Taoiseach has played with words in order to hide the reality of the cuts he is planning but the press statement issued by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection last Friday and updated today is clear.  It says "For those whose prior employment earnings were up to &euro;199.99 per week... the PUP rate will be &euro;203 per week".  That means huge cuts in income for many lone parents and others who had part-time jobs bringing in less than &euro;200 per week but also had income from social welfare.</p> <p>Those hard-pressed families will end up substantially worse off, with some losing almost half their income.  That will also add to the horrific increases in food poverty reported today.</p> <p> I will give some examples.  Emma was working two days a week for eight hours on &euro;12 an hour and she has one child.  She was previously earning &euro;192 a week from her job and got &euro;225.50 a week in jobseeker's transitional payment.  Her total weekly income was &euro;417.50.  When she lost her job because of the pandemic, that was reduced to &euro;350 a week on the PUP.  From the end of June, however, her PUP will be cut to &euro;203.  She will have to move back to the jobseeker's transitional payment and her income will, therefore, be reduced to &euro;239 a week.  That is a drop from &euro;401 a week to &euro;239 a week.  It is a cruel cut that will mean she will be unable to afford to pay her rent, through no fault of her own.  Let us also take John, who was previously working two days a week on minimum wage and earning &euro;161.60 a week.  He was also getting &euro;130 in jobseeker's allowance for the three days he was not working.  His total income was just over &euro;290, but now the Government is cutting him to &euro;203 a week - a drop of approximately one third in his income.  </p> <p> I could give many more examples, including students who work part time in January and February, but full time at this time of the year and who rely on that income to pay their way through college, and seasonal workers who work part time in the off season, through no choice of their own, and rely on the income they make working full time during the summer.  Will the Taoiseach correct the record and accept that many people will be worse off if the cut to the PUP is proceeded with and will he agree, therefore, to withdraw the cut?  </p></speech>

What I said, however, was that nobody would be worse off than they were before the pandemic as a consequence of the decision being made.  I did not say that no one would be worse off than they were before the pandemic.  Many people are worse off than they were before the pandemic.  Most people who have lost their jobs, for example, are, sadly, worse off than they were before the pandemic.  The average weekly wage in Ireland in the first quarter of this year was &euro;800.  We were seeing some significant and welcome wage growth in Ireland before the pandemic, up to &euro;800 a week.  An average person, therefore, who was earning &euro;800 a week and who has lost his or her job is now on &euro;350 a week.</p>  <p>  Many people, therefore, are much worse off than they were before the pandemic hit.  That would be true of people on the wage subsidy as well.  The solution is not welfare; the solution is jobs and getting people back to work and into work, so they can earn much more than can ever be offered under the welfare system.  There are people who were on the PUP who would be better off on regular welfare payments, including for example, the one-parent family payment, jobseeker's payments, particularly if they have dependants, and the option is there for them to apply for those payments.</p></speech>

That is the impression that the Taoiseach gave to people.  He suggested that those people would not lose out as a result of the cuts and that is not the truth.  The truth is that many people are going to be worse off as a consequence of the Government's decision.  Some people will lose up to 50% of their income.  It is an incredibly cruel cut to make, particularly in the context of food poverty, etc..  This is in line with the Taoiseach's kicking down with the "Welfare cheats cheat us all" campaign based on bogus figures and spin.  It is right wing populism going after bogeymen, including people who supposedly won the Lotto, who obviously have not, and preparing the way to cut PUP for everybody.  The Taoiseach should withdraw the cut.</p></speech>

We have the same welfare system as we had before the pandemic.  It is internationally and independently adjudicated to be one of the more generous welfare systems in the world and one of the most successful in redistributing income.  That welfare system is not being cut.  We layered something new on top of it, and that was the PUP.</p></speech>

They have put their lives at risk to care for the sick and get us where we are today.  Unfortunately, some of them lost their lives and I offer my condolences to their families and the families of all those who have lost a loved one due to the coronavirus.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Government and all who have played a part in flattening the curve in recent months.<br/><br/>Parents of children with severe or profound disabilities still have no certainty regarding a return to education for their children.  These children, who thrive and progress in the school environment, have now been at home for 13 weeks.  Distance learning is not an option and, unfortunately, many of them have regressed in terms of their education and behaviour since the lockdown began.  Life has been extremely difficult for their parents during this time and they have advocated for the July provision to take place in a school-based setting.  I am aware that the July education programme was debated with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, in the Chamber yesterday.  He stated that the issue would be discussed at the Cabinet meeting on Friday, following which he would give an update.<br/><br/>I am aware of schools in Galway that are ready to open for the scheme but have not received any communication from the Department of Education and Skills.  Special needs schools are very different from mainstream schools.  They operate with small numbers and staff with responsibility for the care and hygiene of the children already practise infection control protocols.  In many ways, they are among the schools best placed and ready to reopen.  Parents of these children need a firm commitment on a date on which schools will reopen.  I ask that such a commitment be given after Friday's Cabinet meeting.<br/><br/>Businesses have just started to reopen and will need support for the weeks and months ahead.  They need short-term and direct financial support, as well as long-term access to low-cost capital.  When businesses closed their doors many of them, especially those in the tourism and hospitality sectors, lost their cash flow immediately.  They were viable businesses that were trading successfully and it is critical that we get them up and running again.  The small and medium enterprise sector employs almost 1 million people.  The hospitality sector employs more than 260,000 people, including 27,000 in Galway alone.  Tourism will be the last industry to recover, which puts thousands of jobs at risk.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>reported today that foreign visitors to Ireland will fall by 10 million this year.  If we assume that each of these tourists would have spent an average of &euro;1,000, the loss to the economy, particularly the hospitality sector, amounts to &euro;1 billion.  Galway alone is down &euro;200 million in lost revenue as a result of the cancellation of the Galway races, the Galway Arts Festival and all events associated with the European Capital of Culture 2020.  I compliment the chief executive of Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture, Ms Patricia Philbin, and all her staff on the excellent work they have done in preparing for Galway 2020.  It is unfortunate the event had to be cancelled. <br/><br/>The following measures should be considered to kick-start the SME and hospitality sectors.  I ask for the suspension, as opposed to deferral, of all rates for a 12-month period, a zero VAT rate to overcome challenges in the short-term and help businesses get up and running more quickly, and a return to the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector up to the end of the 2022 season.  <br/><br/>The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was established in 2009 to bail out the banks and ultimately save the Irish economy.  Something similar needs to be done to keep businesses viable until a vaccine becomes widely available, businesses can operate at normal capacity and tourists can travel freely.  Irish businesses and taxpayers bailed out the banks at a cost of more than &euro;100 billion.  It is now time for the SME and hospitality sectors to be supported to get our economy back on track.  If these businesses cannot reopen due to cash flow problems, many thousands of people will be out of work in the long term.  The timing of the lockdown in the middle of March coincided with the start of the tourism season for the hotel and tourism industry.  As such, many of the regular summer staff were not on the payroll on 29 February and could not avail of the wage subsidy scheme.  I ask that this matter be examined to see what support or grant scheme can be put in place to help seasonal businesses to rehire their staff. <br/><br/>Another major issue for the hospitality sector, one which was raised earlier, is the 2 m social distancing rule. </p> <p>According to media reports, if this rule is left in place, 84,000 fewer jobs will be filled in the hospitality sector.  It will have a devastating impact on many businesses which will be unable to open.</p> <p> Earlier this week, I met with a number of local hoteliers from across Galway city and county who employ thousands of people.  The 2 m social distancing rule was one of the biggest issues of concern.  These businesses are now actively preparing for reopening and if the 2 m rule is going to change, a decision needs to be made quickly before money is spent renovating and preparing for 2 m social distancing.  These businesses do not have the cash flow to change their premises around again if social distancing is reduced from 2 m to 1 m in a couple of weeks' time.  I note that the Taoiseach takes advice from medical experts but I ask that he would consider reducing the social distancing rule from 2 m to 1 m, which is in line with the World Health Organization guidelines and is similar to what is being implemented in other European countries.</p> <p> In summary, my questions to the Taoiseach are as follows.  After Friday's Cabinet meeting, will a firm commitment be given on a reopening date for special schools so that they can operate the July provision programme in a school-based setting for children with severe and profound disabilities?  Will commercial and VAT rates be suspended with a view to kick-starting our economy and getting businesses up and running again?  Can a scheme similar to the wage subsidy scheme be introduced for seasonal workers in the hospitality sector to help retain their employment?  Can the 2 m social distancing rule be reduced to 1 m, in line with the World Health Organization guidelines?</p></speech>

The plan as of now for the summer programme is that the Minister for Heath, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, will bring their proposals to Cabinet tomorrow.  All things going to plan, we will sign off on that tomorrow, they will make the announcement and hopefully that will answer any questions or allay any concerns that people have.  I absolutely understand the stress that parents with children who have special needs are under at the moment.  I spoke to some of them who are very much at the end of their tethers and we have been working hard for the past couple of weeks to put something in place so that those children get the education and stimulation they need over the summer period, both home-based and school-based.  That is what we are working towards.</p>  <p>  On Galway 2020, I share in the sentiment of Deputy Grealish's words.  I do not think anybody could have endured the amount of bad luck that Galway 2020 has.  It was going to be great.  I was excited about it and the Government was happy to support it financially.  We could not do the launch because of a storm and then along came a pandemic which meant we could not do it at all.  I do not know if it can be done but perhaps there is some way that we can do it next year or the year after, or something like that, and make it even better than it would have been in 2020.  It is a shame that the city and country lost out on that.</p>  <p>  On the question about business, there is a three-month rates waiver in place.  That is not a deferral, it is a waiver.  There is a reopening grant of up to &euro;10,000 available to businesses.  There is also the wage subsidy scheme which has now been extended to August which will pay a big part of the wage bill for businesses reopening.  There is also access to low-cost loans.</p>  <p>  On seasonal workers, we did consider what the Deputy suggested but it is not something we believe we can do.  It is one thing to put in place a wage subsidy for somebody who was on the payroll but it is quite a different thing to put in place a wage subsidy for somebody who thinks that they might have been on the payroll.  It is hard to assess that.</p>  <p>  Supports have been put in place for business and by no means is everything that has been announced the end of the matter.  We appreciate that more will need to be done to help businesses reopen and survive in the coming months.  We are examining other measures and are happy to hear people's suggestions in that regard.  One thing we cannot do is a 0% VAT rate.  There is an EU VAT directive and, unless that changes, one cannot introduce any new zero-rated VAT goods or services.  Rates can be reduced but not to zero in those cases.  One can only have a certain number of rates.  Businesses really need demand more than a low VAT rate.  They need footfall and people spending money.  We will need a domestic tourism campaign to encourage people to take a break or holiday at home over the summer period if they can afford to do so.  We also need to encourage people to spend in local shops again because, while many people have seen their incomes badly hit by the pandemic, there is a whole other group of people who did not lose their jobs and have been accumulating savings over the past couple of weeks and months.  The best thing that those people can do when the economy reopens is to spend money in the economy and they should be encouraged to do so because, by their doing so, other people will be able to get back to work.</p> <p>I would hate to see what happened during the last recession happen again, where people who did have a bit of money were almost afraid to spend it.  We need the reverse of that and to encourage those who can to spend money in the economy in order that others who do not have money can get back to work and do the same.</p></speech>

In Kerry we are no different.  Kerry County Council, along with its elected members, is putting in place town centre mobility plans ensuring social distancing is in place on our footpaths and so on.  The council also is looking at allowing street furniture for caf&eacute;s, restaurants and pubs to use to ensure they can increase capacity while maintaining social distancing rules.  What can the Taoiseach do, together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, to help?  At present people are not to consume alcohol outside or near a premises from which it is purchased.  Can these laws be relaxed, temporarily even, to allow for the next weeks and months?</p>  <p>  On Tuesday at our meeting, together with the other leaders, I raised the issue of hairdressers, barbers and beauticians.  I am glad at what is being spoken about since yesterday.  I acknowledge the gratitude expressed by the Taoiseach at that meeting for the good presentation given by the Irish Hairdressers Federation, which I know influenced the Government's decision strongly.  I would like the Taoiseach to make a statement to the House outlining exactly what the Government is now proposing in this regard.</p>  <p>  Also at that meeting on Tuesday, I raised the issue of the 2 m rule.  I appreciate Deputy Grealish raising this as well.  In the county I represent which, of course, as I continuously say, is the tourism capital of the world, the retention of the 2 m rule will have a very serious negative impact on our opportunities to get people back to work.  Obviously, I respect that any decision the Taoiseach makes will be done in close conjunction with those giving him health advice.  However, I ask him and the Government to look very closely at the 2 m rule and the potential for going down to 1 m.  It would mean thousands of jobs, not just in the county of Kerry but throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  It has been raised by others, but I have been asked by many parents of children with special educational requirements to raise the July provision and the issue of special schools and allowing for the teaching of our children who are challenged with regard to getting their education, and that the Government would do and be seen to do everything it can for that special category of young students who need help. in conjunction with their parents.</p></speech>

I may not have picked up exactly right on people consuming alcohol outdoors or on the street.  My understanding is that it is not against the law.  There may be by-laws in certain counties or city areas but in terms of national law, drinking alcohol in a public place in Ireland is not illegal.  Being drunk and disorderly is; that is an entirely different thing.  Just having the one pint, perhaps, or maybe two or three glasses is not against the law.</p></speech>

On the 2 m rule, as I mentioned earlier, while there are different advices from different bodies, everyone agrees that a distance of 2 m is safer than one of 1 m and a distance of 3 m would be safer again.  A distance of 1 m provides about 70% or 80% protection from somebody who is carrying the virus.  A distance of 2 m provides closer to 95% protection.  We should be honest with people that if we are going to go from 2 m to 1 m, that is an additional risk.  It is much less of a risk than it was a few weeks ago when the virus was circulating in the community to a much greater extent than it is now.  It would be a calculated risk to go from 2 m to 1 m.  The risk of not doing it also exists, as the Deputy has mentioned.  Being unable to open schools fully has consequences too.  Not being able to open the hospitality sector properly and a potential 80,000 people not being able to get back to work has consequences, not just economic but also health consequences.</p> <p>Work is being done involving the HPSC and Departments to calculate and quantify that risk so that if we make a decision to change the advice or make exceptions to it that we know the risk.  It is a risk analysis and we expect to have it concluded next week.</p></speech>

However, those over 66 years are still neglected.  They are not looking for much, all they wanted was the difference between their pension and the Covid payment.  They have played and continue to play a big part in our society.</p>  <p>  Mobile businesses have been badly affected.  There are many from bread vans and the milkmen to readymix and block drivers and the many services, such as those who come to our houses with fresh fish.  However, because they are mobile and do not pay rates they get nothing.  It is very unfair.  I was astounded to hear the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, say that they were in a better position to deal with it than others.  How could they be?  They have been stopped dead in their tracks and have had no income.  It is very bad.</p>  <p>  On childcare, I do not know why the fabulous array of community centres up and down the country cannot be used.  They are in almost every community, thanks to Government grants and also teams of volunteers which enabled them.  Community halls should be used for childcare.  They are used in some places, such as in my own village where the na&iacute;onra uses the community hall.</p>  <p>  The matter of barbers was raised by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae recently.  The Taoiseach has also received a letter from Willie Walsh, a wonderful barber in Clonmel.  They need to get going.  There was a bit of a story in the newspaper this morning but there is no clarity.  Will the Taoiseach direct NPHET in relation to barbers, especially, and hairdressers?  I know it takes a bit longer to do the ladies' hair than it does men's.  The black market is thriving and it is killing our economy and those businesses such as the one I mentioned and many more, including Liam Wall in Cahir, which are open 40 years.  They are providing good employment and have invested in their premises so that they can work safely and well.</p>  <p>  Some 50% of the private bus companies who bring our children to school are Bus &Eacute;ireann contractors.  They are getting 50% of their income which is necessary and a help but there are a large group of people - I know many of them such as Denny Whelan in Cahir - who provide bus services to families who cannot get the service from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  They have the very same insurance and standards, the bus has to be DOE tested and everything, and rightly so, but they are not getting a penny.  They cannot afford this.  We need them to come back in September when the schools reopen.</p>  <p>  July provision was mentioned.  It is awful.  I welcome that some GAA pitches are open for a limited time for people to use them.  These people have been stuck in their houses.</p>  <p>  Some 74,000 people responded to the call to help Ireland through the HSE and our hospitals, but only 140 were employed.  What is wrong?  There was such a spirit of the people.  The 74,000 was whittled down because some were not qualified.  Yet, we are still spending huge money on private hospitals.  I know we had to take them over, I supported that, but they should have been given back June because of the numbers waiting for all sorts of tests, such as CervicalCheck or BreastCheck and prostate cancer.  There are ads on the radio supporting the hospice with the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny.  The Taoiseach might get a job if he is out of a job next week, if Miche&aacute;l takes over from him.  So many people are waiting for so many operations, with capacity going to waste.  The queues will be massive during winter.</p>  <p>  I refer to the Revenue Commissioners.  Applications for grants are stacking up as people are told that if their taxes are not up to date, they cannot get them.  Revenue should show some lenience with tax this year.  Everything just closed overnight and people were unable to do their books and have no revenue to pay their tax.  There should be some understanding by Revenue about this year's taxation.  Long-term arrears are a different story, but they should get a break over the current year. </p></speech>

The HSE is now trying to negotiate a new arrangement with the private hospitals to allow them to step in if, for some reason, we need the beds at a later stage and also to use the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to get some necessary work done for public patients.</p> <p> Regarding the Be On Call For Ireland campaign, a large number of people expressed an interest.  Quite a large number were not suitably qualified.  Quite a large number already worked in health and social care, for example, in nursing homes.  Rather than moving them to hospitals we wanted to keep them in the nursing homes for reasons people will understand.  What also happened there as well is that a lot of people were recruited locally anyway, rather than going through the HSE central system, which can be quite cumbersome.  At local hospital and community level, managers were empowered to recruit locally and in a lot of cases that is how it was done instead of through the central system.</p></speech>

There is an urgent necessity in that regard.  I confess to a conflict of interest regarding this matter.  We are talking about a minimum of 25,000 people, not to mention the linked companies, industries and small businesses.  We do need certainty. They have shown that they can comply with whatever rules are necessary.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the fact that there will be some certainty tomorrow on the July provision.  I have raised it many times with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Today, ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; meabhairshl&aacute;inte.  Is &aacute;bhar &eacute; at&aacute; an-ghar do mo chro&iacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ardaithe go mion minic agam &oacute; 2016.  Faraor g&eacute;ar, t&aacute; orm &eacute; a ard&uacute; ar&iacute;s inniu.  I wish to raise mental health.  I will allow the Taoiseach a minute or two to answer because it is a very net issue regarding A Vision for Change.  The roadmap has been mentioned very often in regard to Covid.  We have had a roadmap for mental health services.  I prefer to call it a vision, and indeed that is the title, A Vision for Change.  The journey started in 1984 with a document called Planning for the Future, because we realised that the model was not suitable.  Then it took more than 20 years to get A Vision for Change, which is absolutely visionary.  I have an utter sense of frustration in relation to this matter and I have highlighted it repeatedly.  At the time A Vision for Change was published, it was recognised that no Government &ndash; not just the current Government &ndash; could be trusted and, therefore, an independent monitoring body was set up.  It sat for two different periods and it did an excellent job.  I have asked the Taoiseach repeatedly why he cannot reinstate the independent monitoring body to show his bona fides if nothing else while he waits for the review, the renewal or whatever it is called of A Vision for Change.  Since 2016, I have made nearly the same speech and implored the Taoiseach to do something.  First, we found out that there was a review of the literature, which took a short period.  In fact, the date on it is February 2017, but it was not published until July 2017.  Then we got another approach, in that we were told there would be a review or a refresh.  In the meantime, the core point has been the absence of an independent monitoring body to review the implementation of A Vision for Change and whatever necessary changes were needed.  I will stop to allow the Taoiseach to respond.  How much is spent on mental health?  I am asking him a very net question about an independent monitoring body.</p></speech>

I am going to tell her because I think it is important.  Back in 2012 only about &euro;700 million a year was spent on mental health.  This year, for the first time it will be more than &euro;1 billion.  Since my party came to office, there has been a 44% increase in funding for mental health.  Unfortunately, I doubt that future Governments will be able to do quite as well as that but I have no doubt that they will try.</p>  <p>  A Vision for Change ran out in 2016.  There is a successor document, which was approved by the Cabinet last Thursday.  The Minister of State, Jim Daly, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, intend to publish that, I think, next week.  That will really inform the actions of the next Government.  There is a commitment to establishing an independent monitoring body in the document.</p> <p>The plan is to publish the new refreshed document, already approved by Cabinet, next week and to allow the new Government to establish an independent monitoring body for that to hold our feet to the fire and to make sure that it gets implemented.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the Taoiseach that A Vision for Change ran out.  The date ran out - 2006 to 2016 - but the vision contained therein and the implementation, and what they set out on every sector, and the fact that it was a partnership with the community and with families, and to rebalance the power in the mental health sector, was all clearly set out.  None of that is stated.  The problem is it was not implemented.</p>  <p>  I welcome the good news.

I did so last week as well.  In the intervening period, I have spoken to many small business owners who speak about an escalating crisis in the sector.  Time and time again, I have spoken to both the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, about the mounting wall of debt that many of these businesses are facing.  The Government put loan schemes in place.  These are useful, but interest rates are too high and loans mean that these businesses are piling debt upon debt.  Many of them cannot afford to do this.  The average SME carries between &euro;7,000 and &euro;8,000 extra in debt because of Covid.  Many of them, of course, know that when they reopen, it could take six, or maybe even 12, months before they return to their previous trading position and in the meantime, they will be struggling just to stay afloat.</p>  <p>  As I said, the Government has its loan scheme in place and its restart grant, but the take-up is low.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has committed &euro;250 million but many SMEs will only be able to access the minimum amount of &euro;2,000 because of rates paid last year.  If one contrasts our response to that of Germany, it has &euro;50 billion in federal grants  pledged to SMEs.  The equivalent for Ireland would be &euro;2.9 billion.  We are talking about &euro;250 million in grant aid.  That is one tenth what Germany is allocating.  I want to know why is there a reluctance to step in to support businesses that account for 65% of all employment and 31% of our exports.</p>  <p>  Also, I raised with the Taoiseach on the last occasion the issue of those businesses that do not pay rates - the wedding industry, the tour operators, the man in the van, the man in the bus, the plumber or the electrician.  The Taoiseach stated he would look at that and I ask whether he can confirm that he will.</p>  <p>  As often happens in this country, we have an economy within an economy.  The three regional assemblies have compiled a report on the impact of Covid.  It is not good for any region but it is particularly grim for the north west and the Border.  I will highlight one particular statistic that reflects overall what is in this report.  The report looked at 64 settlements throughout the country and their exposure to significant economic disruption caused by Covid-19.  The two top towns are Bundoran in Donegal, at 75%, and Strandhill in Sligo, at 70%.  Carrick-on-Shannon comes 17th - mostly in Leitrim and a tiny bit in Roscommon - out of 64.  The report makes it clear that the economic impact of Covid is more severely felt in the north west and the Border and we can see the impact in smaller towns and villages.  What I am saying to the Taoiseach is we cannot wait any longer because if we wait too long, viable businesses become vulnerable and vulnerable businesses are likely to close.</p> <p> At EU level, the unthinkable has happened.  The fiscal rules have been relaxed.  They were written in blood and we had a referendum on them here, yet France, Germany and Denmark all recognise they have to support their businesses with state aid.  Will the Taoiseach please commit to a significant upgrading and increasing of the supports already in place for SMEs?</p></speech>

We are certainly not being shy when it comes to spending and borrowing money on behalf of future generations to get us through this crisis.  There is in place a rates waiver for three months, tax liabilities are being warehoused, and there is a reopening grant of up to &euro;10,000.  The uptake is high, not low, and we will have to put more money into it because it is so high.  There are debt deferral mechanisms from the banks, low-cost loans available and a whole plethora of other grants, including online trading grants and grants from the local enterprise offices.  We are examining other additional measures and that work is being done by the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  I am interested in what the Deputy said about Germany.  I did not know that and it is significant information for me.  If it is grants and loans, we are in a similar space, but if what Germany is doing is all grants, it is doing a lot more than us.  I would be interested in hearing any more information on that the Deputy can share with me.</p>  <p>  On businesses and sole traders that are not rateable, which the Deputy raised with me last week, we are examining that.  The reopening grant is based on a rebate of a business's rates, and because such businesses do not pay rates, they do not qualify.  We are looking at a different mechanism, of maybe giving them back some of their income tax from a previous year as a means to help them get their business going again. That is what we are examining with regard to that.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I wish to express my sympathy to the families and friends of those who have been lost to this disease since I was last in this House. Our thoughts are with each and every one of them at this very difficult time.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, we decided as a Government that we could proceed with phase 2 of our roadmap and we could also bring in some additional measures.  As always, our decision was informed by the data on the status of the Covid-19 disease in our country and by the public health advice that we received from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  As part of this phase we can now meet in our homes in groups of up to six people and we can strengthen again the private bonds that hold our society together.  A maximum of 15 people can now meet outdoors for organised sporting, cultural and social events and through this we can begin, with caution and care, to rebuild the public life of our country.</p>  <p>  The number of people who can attend funerals and cremation ceremonies has been increased to 25.  This is an important issue which many colleagues in this House raised with me.  The inability of friends and sometimes of family to be able to stand with those most directly bereaved at a funeral or cremation service has been one of the most difficult and painful aspects of this pandemic.  Our communities found thoughtful ways to show their support and solidarity to those who were mourning despite the limits and it is our hope that the extra number of people who can now attend these services will provide further comfort at such a sad time.</p> <p>Clearly, we have now moved as a country from a message of stay home to stay local, which means that we are asking people to remain within 20 km of their home or within their county boundary.  We are able to make this change because our collective actions as a country have managed to suppress this virus.  However, we absolutely must remain cautious and continue to restrict our movements as much as possible so we do not lose the hard-won progress we have made.</p> <p> I would like to update the House today, as I do every week, about the R-nought.  I have been advised by the chair of the modelling group, Professor Phillip Nolan, that the R-nought is estimated to be between 0.4 and 0.8.  I am told by Professor Nolan that we can be confident it remains below 1 this week.  I am also very encouragingly told that there is no evidence that it is increasing or decreasing, but it is staying remarkably stable.  Again this is a testament to the huge efforts of people in this country.</p> <p> We have also continued to see a reduction in the number of patients with Covid-19 in hospitals, with a welcome fall to just 75 people in Irish hospitals today with Covid-19 confirmed in the latest published numbers and 29 people in our intensive care units.  Of course, I am conscious that when we quote numbers that behind each of them is a patient, a person, a loved one, and we send each and every one of them our best wishes, particularly those in the ICUs fighting for their lives.  We look forward to more people being successfully and safely discharged from our intensive care units.  This is a trend we have to maintain.  I suggest that there are six key ways in which we can all help to do that during this new phase.</p> <p> The first of these concerns close contacts.  We are obviously able to meet more people again and this is great.  It is something we have worked very hard for.  We have missed people, missed family, and missed friends, but there is a responsibility on every single one of us to minimise the number of close contacts we meet.  Now is not the time for people to be increasing their social circles.  It is not the time for people to be meeting their second cousin once removed.  Now is the time to consider who are core contacts one has really missed in one's life, the couple of key family members or close friends.  They are the people I am going to see.  I am not going to see people beyond that socially in phase 2.  I am also asking people to keep a list of those they have met for contact tracing purposes.  If, God forbid, a person gets Covid he or she should have a list, jotted down as a note or put in his or her phone of the people he or she met that day so that we can very quickly contact trace anybody who he or she have come in contact with.</p> <p> The second point I want to make is that outdoors is better than indoors.  While the guidelines now provide for indoor visits and with Irish weather that is perfectly understandably and possibly necessary, I want to encourage people to remember that meeting outdoors entails less risk and is a better choice.  Even if people are meeting indoors, meeting in a well-ventilated area does lessen one's risk as well.</p> <p> My third point is about self-isolation, and it is a really important point.  Irish people, as we heard Dr. Cillian De Gascun say in the Special Committee on the Covid-19 Response earlier in the week, are really good for going to work when they are sick.  People get up in the morning, they have a temperature and a bit of a headache, they take two paracetamol and off they go for the day.  We need that habit to stop.  If a person feels sick we need him or her to immediately self-isolate if he or she has any of the symptoms of Covid-19.  People should not put it off, they should not wait and should not hesitate to contact their GP.  We have seen - and this is one of the concerning trends in the last week - a growing number of household clusters and that is concerning.  They are small numbers so far.  I think it was six one week and 16 in the past week, but that makes the advice on self-isolation even more important.  We do not want a man or woman in a house to feel sick, to delay self-isolating within the house, and then by the time he or she contacts the GP, all of a sudden two or three people in the home have Covid-19, so the self-isolation advice is very important.</p> <p> The fourth piece of advice relates to the 2 m distance.  As we begin to move around a little bit more the importance of social distancing remains high - in fact, it is more important than ever.  The Special Committee on the Covid-19 Response heard today from the World Health Organization and the message is clear that social distancing and staying apart saves lives.  People can have the debate about 1 m versus 2 m until the cows come home, the reality is that 2 m is safer than 1 m, and the public health advice is 2 m.  I ask people to keep that 2 m distance in their social engagements to help save lives.  Continuing to control this aspect of our personal behaviour will be essential to controlling the behaviour of the virus.</p> <p> My fifth message is to stay local.  Thankfully, we are now seeing a number of counties in Ireland which have not had a confirmed case of Covid-19 in quite a few days.  Deputy Feighan may speak later to remind us about County Sligo.  I think it is a county that has not had a case of Covid in three weeks.  There are others beginning to get there.  I think County Kerry may not have had one in three weeks as well.  I am going from memory, but there are a couple of counties that have not seen a case in three weeks.  There are some which have not seen a case in two weeks, and there is a number that have not seen one in a week.  This is good and this is real progress, but it is so important that we use phase 2 to continue to weaken the grip of the virus, and we are asking people to stay local, stay within their own county, to limit the potential for the virus to spread or reseed across our country.</p> <p> The sixth point I want to make is on face coverings and I want to be crystal clear on this.</p> <p>From a public health point of view, the clear public health advice is that they should be worn on public transport and in enclosed indoor spaces, such as shops.  We will be launching a further public awareness campaign on this very shortly.</p> <p> People asked me whether we are going to change the law in this regard.  We do not have plans to change it.  We did not change it, however, to say people needed to cough into their elbow; we just got used to it.  We did not change the law to say we should wash our hands for 20 seconds but we got really good at it.  We have not even changed the laws in regard to the 2 m restriction on occasion.  Therefore, this is about behavioural change.  I accept that the evidence, and maybe even the messaging on this, has changed over time.  Perhaps it has been confusing for people and has not got through in the clear way it needs to.  Let us be very clear, therefore, that starting from today, face coverings are recommended.  People should wear one on public transport and in shops and other enclosed areas unless they have a medical reason not to do so or are under the age of 13.  That is an important message.  We all need to come together and the Government has a big role to play in a public awareness campaign on this.</p> <p> My final point is on hand-washing and cough etiquette.  People are more than familiar with these.  We have got really good at these but it cannot be said often enough that, in phase 2, they will be among the most important behaviours we can embrace to protect ourselves.  The virus can live on our hands but if we wash them regularly and frequently, it makes it much harder for it to survive.  These are the simple, basic, important things we can all do to stay safe while we try so hard to find a balance, the sweet spot, or a way of living safely alongside the virus.  While we are working to get the numbers down and have a reproduction rate as close to zero as possible, and while the virus is still here, we have to try to get back to some degree of normality.  That requires us all to work out a way to live safely alongside it.</p> <p> We have all been particularly mindful of the impact of this pandemic on both children and older people during the earlier phases of the response.  It is very welcome that NPHET was, I hope, able to recommend measures to make life a little better and easier for those two groups.  </p> <p> The protection and well-being of those in our nursing homes continues to be my priority.  For that reason, I am particularly pleased our success in pushing back this disease has allowed us to bring forward, to 15 June, the phased resumption of indoor visiting at residential care facilities.  This has to be done safely.  Normal nursing home visiting is not resuming next week, and I know nursing home owners would want me to say that.  What we are trying to do is determine whether we can, on compassionate grounds and understanding that people are lonely, allow a degree of visiting.  It has to be done safely and in alignment with the guidance.  As I said to a nursing home owner, I would much rather be standing here defending the individual for not allowing a visit next week than explaining why a cluster was allowed to develop in his or her nursing home again.  Therefore, we need to proceed with caution.  I fully get that people are dying to see their loved ones, but we have got to get this right.</p> <p> Planning for the delivery of non-Covid care is well-advanced.  The HSE CEO has confirmed to me that a framework document will be published next week.  The reintroduction of services will be across acute hospital and community settings and planned for the reality where we have to treat both Covid and non-Covid patients simultaneously in a context of heightened safety measures and reduced capacity.</p> <p> I know colleagues in this House have been particularly concerned about the restart of screening services, as have I, and I am pleased the HSE has confirmed that there will be restart dates for each of the four programmes by the end of June.  We are making great progress and we should all be proud of the collective contribution every citizen has made but we must continue to be cautious. </p> <p> On 5 June, the director general of the World Health Organization said that for countries that have seen reductions in the level of disease, the biggest threat is now complacency.  As much as we would wish it, we cannot now decide we have done our bit and the threat is gone.  As a country, we have suppressed the virus because of the willingness of the majority of our population to change their everyday behaviour and maintain the change.  That remains our massive ongoing challenge.</p></speech>

I am going to take the first five minutes for an exchange with the Minister.</p>  <p>  Last week, we discussed the ongoing closure of the screening programmes.  The Minister just referred to them again.  He said at the time that screening would recommence as soon as possible.  I believe those are the words the National Screening Service gave to him.  Given that general practitioners can now take smear tests, "as soon as possible" would mean that CervicalCheck screening should restart now, but that is not what is happening.  Two days ago, the National Screening Service provided a detailed update as to what is happening.  As the Minister said, the service will not announce the restart dates until the end of this month even though general practitioners say they can start now.</p> <p>Screening is expected to have begun a phased reintroduction by the end of summer but that means hundreds of thousands of people are not going to be screened at the same time as doctors are saying they are ready to do that screening.  This morning on the radio the clinical director of BreastCheck said she was not in a position to give any kind of indication as to when it hopes to resume full service.</p> <p> The approach also seems to suggest screening will not start until symptomatic cases are dealt with.  The national bowel cancer screening service has indicated there is a backlog of several months just to provide care to people already identified as being at high risk.  The implication seems to be that screening will not be reopened until this backlog is dealt with.  The logic, therefore, for CervicalCheck and bowel cancer screening seems to be that because we cannot provide the post-screening care, we will simply not screen people, which worries me greatly.  It seems to take away from the patient the option of sourcing other care somewhere else.  It seems to defy logic to say that because we cannot provide the care, we will not even tell people if they are at a high risk.</p> <p> Is the Minister satisfied with the timeline of starting these processes at the end of the summer?  If GPs are saying they can do cervical cancer screening now, why are we waiting several months?  What level of capacity from the private hospitals is being brought in to provide the downstream care, such as colonoscopy, histopathology and colposcopy? </p></speech>

As he knows, the four national screening programmes - BreastCheck, CervicalCheck, BowelScreen and Diabetic RetinaScreen - were paused in March in line with public health advice.  Such programmes were paused in many countries around the world, including Northern Ireland on this island, as well.  This was done to protect patients and staff.  It is important to say people who were in the system at the time of the pause have continued to be treated.  With BreastCheck, for example, women who have been screened continue to have their assessments completed and treatment plans mapped and surgeries continue to be scheduled.  For CervicalCheck, colposcopy assessments and follow-up treatments continue for women who were screened before the pause.</p>  <p>  I am glad to be able to inform the House that the four screening programmes are finalising plans to restart their work.  I am satisfied that this week we have more information than we had last week and we are really getting to a point where the screening programmes can say that by the end of this month, restart dates for each of the four programmes will be announced, and also that screening is expected to have begun with a phased reintroduction by the end of the summer.</p>  <p>  I can also share with the House that the National Screening Service has said to me, probably for the reasons outlined by the Deputy, that CervicalCheck and the Diabetic RetinaScreen are expected to restart first and they will be followed by BreastCheck and BowelScreen respectively.  There is much work going on to modify screening units and this must be completed before the restart, along with the final analysis on the effects of the Covid-19 measures and the pace and throughput of the screening cohort.  Screening invitations will be issued on a phased basis according to clinical priority.</p>  <p>  Like the Deputy, I will not be satisfied until these programmes are back up and running but I am satisfied that there is an incredible amount of work being done by very dedicated clinicians.  We are now seeing engagement with patient advocacy groups that we may not have seen a couple of weeks back and it is important to keep that information flow going.</p></speech>

Mental health specialists are confirming an increase in the number of people presenting with depression, anxiety, self-harm and other mental illnesses.  I have been warning for some time now in this Chamber the impact of the lockdown on people's daily routines, not being able to see loved ones and not being able to grieve in a humane way, as well as the loss of jobs and businesses and the effects on front-line workers of witnessing first-hand the many distressing events of the past couple of months.  These are all taking their toll on people, from the very young to the very old.</p>  <p>  Family resource centres are reporting a significant increase in demand for parent and family supports for counselling and mental health services.  The latest Central Statistics Office data indicate young adults feel more downhearted, depressed and anxious, while risky behaviour is increasing.  The number of people rating overall life satisfaction as "high" fell to just 12.2%.  We do not need statistics to tell us what everyone is seeing every day.  People are struggling and for some that struggle is getting more exhausting.  The fourth wave of a pandemic is the mental health wave and that is rapidly turning into a tsunami that is already breaking on the shores of this country.</p> <p>I welcome the intention to publish the refreshed A Vision for Change but that is a ten-year plan.  We need to see a cross-departmental mental health task force up and running straight away.  We have one for tourism but not mental health.  Will that task force be established and, if so, when?</p> <p> On the issue of respite, I would like to know the reason we have a timeframe for the opening of pubs and restaurants but not respite services.  There has not been even an indication yet of when that will happen.  Carers are exhausted.</p></speech>

In the interests of time I will revert to him on the issue of respite in writing but I take the point that carers are exhausted.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, is working with the HSE specifically in respect of a summer programme that I hope will see some day respite, in the first instance, for children.  I will come back to the Deputy with a more detailed note on that.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the work Deputy Browne has been doing in the whole area of mental health, as he said, at the request of the Oireachtas last Thursday evening, I received Government approval for the new A Vision for Change, Sharing the Vision - a Revised Mental Health Policy for Everyone.  It is my understanding that the document will be launched tomorrow.  The Minister of State, Jim Daly, has been briefing stakeholders in advance of that launch.  Once we launch that document, we need to respond to Deputy Browne's challenge, which he has been putting to us for some weeks in the House, in respect of what we can do immediately in terms of a task force.  I have heard from Mental Health Reform and others.  I do not want to speak for them but they wanted to make clear that any such task force would be aligned with the new A Vision for Change document.  I believe we will be in a position to do that.</p>  <p>  We will also launch next week a new crisis text line, which will be Ireland's first ever 24-7 text service.  It is aimed in particular at younger people and teenagers.  I will not take up any more time on that now but the launch of the new A Vision for Change tomorrow will be an important step in establishing the task force.</p></speech>

As we are all aware, nursing, care and residential homes bore the brunt of deaths caused by the pandemic, with 62% of deaths occurring in that sector.  As we prepare for a possible second surge of the pandemic, we must learn from the past three months.  Test, trace and isolate is the mantra for success.  I have called for and raised with the Minister recently the importance and necessity for regular testing in nursing and residential homes. </p>  <p> Today, Dr. David Nabarro, the World Health Organization special envoy, attended the D&aacute;il Special Committee on Covid-19 Response by video link.  When I asked him about regular testing he stated: "Taking a comprehensive approach, to include frequent testing and paying real attention to what is happening inside these facilities, will help to reduce the risk and maintain the health of the residents."  He also stated that consideration should be given to "virus testing quite frequently, perhaps at weekly intervals or even more often if there is a concern."  I also asked him about the high number of deaths in this sector and he specified that Ireland is certainly at the upper end of the spectrum in that regard.  To be fair, he also said that not all countries release all their figures in the way we do here.  To reiterate, regular testing will provide some degree of reassurance for those in nursing and residential homes and their carers and families.  We must learn lessons.  If the Minister would give me an update on how we intend going forward, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I, too, listened to Dr. Nabarro today and he rightly highlighted the challenges and tragedies in respect of the passing of people in nursing homes from Covid-19.  He also said that Ireland has a very honest accounting of the numbers, which I do not think many countries can say when it comes to care homes.  He also said that we have the widest circle of inclusion of all of the countries he had studied.  Not to take away from the tragedy, I believe it is to the credit of our public health experts that we are shining a light and not ignoring the massive challenge that exists when it comes to nursing homes.</p>  <p>  Deputy Butler is right when it comes to testing.  This is a key issue.  Last week, NPHET recommended that all healthcare workers in all nursing homes - public, private and voluntary - be tested weekly for the next four weeks.  That is a very important development, which has been welcomed by nursing home staff and owners.  The HSE was due to publish a type of single operating procedure to ensure there is standardisation and clarity as to how this was to happen.  That was due either yesterday or today.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Jim Daly, will meet the HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland on this issue this evening.</p></speech>

I am sure he was not expecting this question today.  Sixteen years ago, there was a vision for providing the women of the Border and midlands region with a new model of maternity care.  On 5 July 2004, the midwifery led units in Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda opened their doors.  Since then, thousands of babies have been born under the compassionate and professional watch of midwives.</p> <p>The many mothers to whom I have spoken who have used the service in Cavan General Hospital have highlighted the exceptional quality of antenatal and postnatal care offered by the midwifery led unit, MLU.</p> <p> As the Minister will be aware, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, launched the national maternity strategy in 2016.  This recommended that MLUs be established in each of the 19 maternity hospitals in Ireland.  Why then would the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, group even suggest a merger or realignment, which would ultimately limit the choice for women?  It flies in the face of the national maternity strategy.</p> <p> I will ask the Minister to address a number of really important questions.  Has he received any correspondence from the RCSI group relating to such an alignment?  Will he assure the women of the Border region and the midlands who want this service that he will support it into the future and will not support any closure of the facility?  Will he explain why there appears to be a lack of support for the midwifery led unit in Cavan when the unit in Drogheda is thriving?  Will he assure women that bookings will reopen?  It is my understanding that, as of 1 June, they have been closed.  Will he commit to demanding answers from the CEO of the RCSI as to why such terrible uncertainty and doubt has been created around the future of the MLU in Cavan?  Most importantly, 10,000 women have signed a petition to ensure that the MLU in Cavan is not only saved, but promoted, supported and assisted long into the future.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy.  I want this unit to remain open.  I am meeting tomorrow with midwives from Cavan General Hospital and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  As the Deputy rightly said, the national maternity strategy is very clear in this regard.  Women need more choice with regard to birth and pregnancy.  Midwife and community-led schemes are very important and fundamental parts of the national maternity strategy.  My Department was not informed of any intention to merge the services.  On 5 June, the national women and infants programme applied for a drawdown of the new development funding being provided for maternity services in 2020.  Included in this funding is funding for an advanced midwifery practitioner in Cavan to provide additional senior midwifery expertise.  I absolutely intend to meet with the RCSI group.  This cannot go ahead.  I will update the Deputy after tomorrow's meeting.</p></speech>

Walking around the city, however, one would have to wonder if that is true.  It is clear that the key challenge in respect of Covid-19 transmission relates to those at the presymptomatic stage.  We heard this morning from Dr. Nabarro that masks can play an important role as part of a package of measures.  The current messaging on this matter has been confusing.  Members of the public are calling their Deputies and asking whether one is to wear a medical mask or a face covering, when one wears one and when the other, and how one stores and carries masks.  The wearing of face masks was recommended by NPHET more than six weeks ago but now, in mid-June, very few people are wearing them.  We urgently need a publicity campaign to promote the correct use of face masks.  We do not need the enforcement measures that have been introduced in other countries.  Irish people have proven that they are more than willing to follow clear guidelines.  I urge the Minister to implement a campaign to communicate a clear message with regard to the use of face masks.</p></speech>

We need such a public awareness campaign.  I take the implicit and fair criticism that the messaging in this regard has been confused.  This is possibly because so many different people and experts have an opinion on the matter.  It is the clear view of our public health experts, of NPHET and of Government that one should wear non-medical face coverings when one is on public transport, when in indoor public areas including retail outlets, when visiting the homes of those who are cocooning, when visiting residential care facilities, or when in an indoor work environment in which it is difficult to maintain a distance of 2 m.  We will implement a public awareness campaign in this regard.</p></speech>

We will take five minutes each.  I will raise two issues with the Minister.  The first is the issue of carers, which has previously been mentioned.  They are obviously a vital group in our society but they have not got the appreciation they deserve over the past three months.  They have taken on incredible responsibility and been under incredible pressure without the normal respite support they would expect.</p> <p>That ranges from children with disabilities to looking after parents with a range of disability challenges.  It is important that we take this opportunity to acknowledge the vital role they play.  If there is going to be a full five-year D&aacute;il term, we must do better for carers overall, but now they need to know when respite services will be reinstated in their communities and when they will get a break in terms of schools and community and health facilities in their areas.  I ask the Minister to respond to that.  Although I probably do not need to say this to him, I take this opportunity to express to them the appreciation of the Oireachtas at this time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100032#HH00200"><p>I join the Deputy in expressing my appreciation to all family carers.  Family carers have had to do even more caring during the pandemic.  Services were closed for public health reasons and to keep their loved ones safe, but a huge burden comes with that.  I share the Deputy's view that we must do more for family carers.  If this D&aacute;il lasts four or five more years, God willing, one of the interesting things that whoever is involved in programme for Government talks should consider is the carer's guarantee and some of the commitments carers are seeking in that regard, which I believe should and could be delivered by this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Regarding disability services, and respite care fits in that space, I have engaged with a number of disability organisations and service providers over the last number of weeks and my understanding is that they are working with the HSE to have reopening plans for the end of this month.  I expect there will be clarity by the end of this month.  Regarding children with disabilities specifically, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, has been working hard to try to put in place a summer programme that is not just the traditional July provision, although that is very important, but to expand it for children who would not usually qualify, and also to examine how it could be a health and education programme.  Subject to Cabinet consideration of this tomorrow, I hope the Minister will be in a position to make some announcements then.</p></speech>

I will take the opportunity to give the example of my home county of Donegal, with which we are both familiar.  Letterkenny University Hospital is the sixth largest hospital in the State and a major acute hospital.  Let us consider the situation before this crisis occurred.  There were 17,000 people from the county on waiting lists for inpatient and outpatient procedures and appointments.  If one includes Sligo hospital, it is one in eight of the county's population on waiting lists, and the lists are growing all the time.  The acute stroke unit was delayed.  The Minister will be familiar with the campaign for the diabetes centre of excellence.  We have the numbers of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients in Donegal so there should be a centre of excellence at that hospital.  Then there is the reopening of all the beds in the short stay wards.  All of these, and I could go on, were delayed because of the recruitment embargo that was in place.  There is also the trolley crisis.  There was an average of 19 people on trolleys in the emergency department every day over a period of years.</p>  <p>  We must do better.  I have given the example of Donegal but that is the case across the State.  What are the Minister's plans or what is his vision for the next Government to have the necessary investment in nurses, doctors and beds and to move forward with the transition to Sl&aacute;intecare?  The vision is positive and we all subscribe to it, but where will the investment come from?  What assurance can the Minister give today?  People are concerned when they listen to the debates on the radio that this crisis has taken away the resources required to turn our health service.  One thing we must learn from this crisis is that we can never again have the health service we had going into the crisis.  We must have a very different health service.  Can the Minister give a reassurance on that today?</p></speech>

The advice I would give to the Oireachtas, whoever is Minister for Health and whoever is in Government is that we must do two things.  We will have to put the capacity in place, and that means beds and staff.  The second thing that Covid-19 will make us do is what we should have been doing anyway, which is new models of care.  That involves hospital avoidance, keeping people in the community and telemedicine.  I have had some interesting meetings over the past week with the INMO, SIPTU, and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  They are up for it, as are disability services providers.  It is models of care alongside capacity.</p> <p>I accept this will require significant investment in Donegal as well.</p></speech>

The 221 Plus CervicalCheck patient support group is concerned about the delay in establishing the tribunal.  Its establishment by the Minister for Health was delayed due to the Covid-19 lockdown.  The support group knows the Department of Health is working on a plan to reschedule its establishment but is anxious to get some clarity as to when exactly that will happen.  Will the Minister give an update on the establishment of the tribunal and an idea of when it will be formed?</p>  <p>  I am going to get a bit parochial with the next couple of issues I am going to raise.  There are serious concerns among locals regarding the Department's plan for St. Brigid's hospital, Carrick-on-Suir, and when it will revert to its pre-Covid-19 role as a community palliative care and respite service hospital.  It was designated as a step-down care facility for Covid patients but has been empty now for several weeks and the staff have been redeployed.  I already raised this issue with the Minister on 20 May but did not receive confirmation as to when St. Brigid's will re-open.  This hospital not only covers south Tipperary but also south Kilkenny and north Waterford.  Will the Minister clarify when St. Brigid's will be reopened as a community hospital?</p>  <p>  I want to raise the issue of the underutilisation of the primary care centre in Carrick-on-Suir, which opened in 2018 but has several empty rooms at present.</p>  <p>  In my home town, Cashel, there are ongoing concerns with the Government's plan for Our Lady's Hospital.  Again, I raised this with the Minister on 20 May.  He confirmed that patients from St. Patrick's Hospital were moving to Our Lady's on an interim basis.  The closure of the hospital in 2007 was a huge loss to the region and has increased pressure on Clonmel general hospital.  Will the Minister confirm the long-term plans for both Our Lady's and St. Patrick's hospitals in Cashel and make a statement to that effect?</p>  <p>  St. Michael's mental health unit in Clonmel is another area of concern, which I have already raised with the Department.  Tipperary has a lack of dedicated mental health services.  Last September, there was a protest in Clonmel over the lack of mental health beds in Tipperary.  I reiterate the call for the reopening of a dedicated mental health unit in Clonmel.  A county the size of Tipperary having no full-time mental health services is crazy and unfair.  Will the Minister confirm that, following the recent refurbishment of St. Michael's, it will be reopened as a dedicated mental health service after the Covid crisis?</p>  <p>  University Hospital Limerick has consistently had one of highest levels of overcrowding, an issue which will return post Covid if nothing is done.  A solution for this for both the people of north Tipperary and Limerick would be the restoration of full emergency department services in Nenagh hospital.  This would reduce the pressure on Limerick, while providing the people in north Tipperary with emergency department services in their own area.  Opening field hospitals cannot be accepted as a long-term solution to overcrowding in Limerick.  What plans are in place to address the problems of overcrowding in Limerick emergency department post Covid-19?  Will he commit to the restoration of emergency department services in Nenagh?</p>  <p>  It does not entirely come under the Minister's brief but the opening of playgrounds so soon will create problems that will affect each county council.  The Minister made the point earlier of only meeting people when it is important to do so.  In Cashel, there is a new playground with 150 youngsters running around it.  I do not believe that is important at this stage.  If the virus spreads in these settings, who will be responsible?  There is a major health risk with the actions of opening them up so soon.  It is unfair on councils to speed it up like the Government has done and be unclear as to who will supervise the openings.  Will the Minister make it clear who will be responsible if a child or a parent contracts the virus under the circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100033#JJ00300"><p>I was deeply concerned to learn at the weekend of plans to merge the midwifery-led unit in Cavan General Hospital with the consultancy led services there.  I have been reliably informed that the unit has been closed to anyone who wished to book this facility from 1 June 2020.  While women who were booked prior to that date will be facilitated, anybody attempting to make a booking after that date has been told to make alternative arrangements.  It is unclear as to why this decision was taken and if there was any prior discussion within the hospital, the hospital group or the HSE.</p> <p>I know there was no consultation locally with women in the area, midwives, or the representative organisations - the INMO or the Midwives Association of Ireland.</p> <p> I thank the Minister for his prompt response to my letter of representation on this issue and welcome the fact that he and his Department do not support any decision to downgrade or close the MLU in Cavan.  If this unit is closed, it will have a critical impact on the well-being of pregnant women and Cavan and Monaghan, and indeed much further afield, as many women choose to travel to Cavan to have their babies in the MLU.  The loss or downgrading of this essential service will severely limit the choices for women in pregnancy care.  Those very limits were the reason for the development of the national maternity strategy in the first place.  The strategy, which was launched in January 2016, clearly advocates the expansion of MLUs, not their closure.  The plan to close the unit is totally contrary to the strategy and it is a retrograde step.  Consultant-led care is more costly and less effective for low risk women.  The situation in the North is different.  Eight MLUs are in operation across the Six Counties, with plans in place for the provision of additional units.  That is an average of more than one unit per county.  By contrast, we have two in the South, with one in Cavan and one in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Louth.</p> <p> This is not the first time that the Cavan unit has been threatened with closure.  In 2011, there were plans in place to close the unit as part of a so-called cost-cutting measure.  Will the Minister please clarify the position regarding the MLU in Cavan?  What is the reason that bookings for the Cavan MLU have been stopped from 1 June onwards?  Why was there no consultation with women locally?  Will the Minister give assurances to not only keep the MLU open in Cavan but to adequately ensure its promotion going forward, particularly as the level of support that Cavan has received is considerably less than the MLU in Drogheda?  The national maternity strategy needs to be rolled out and a cornerstone of that is to increase the number of MLUs operating in the State.  That needs to be a priority for any future Government, particularly since many highly experienced Irish midwives have been forced to emigrate.  Now is the time to bring them home and enhance maternity services in Ireland for all expectant mothers.</p> <p> I also have a question on cervical smear testing.  Ms Naomi Thornton Ryan has started a petition to request an immediate reinstatement of this testing.  She has no way of getting the petition to the Minister and so asked us to raise this with him today, to seek a commitment to reinstate cervical cancer screening as soon as possible on her behalf and the 31,000 other people who have signed the petition.</p></speech>

I thank Naomi.  In the interests of time, I think the Deputy will have heard my comments in the House earlier but I will revert to Naomi directly too.  The Deputy is dead right that services have to be developed in line with policy.  This House and the Government set policy.  The policy is that there should be more MLUs in Ireland, not fewer.  The people responsible for the delivery of the health services need to follow the policy.  There was no discussion about the closure of this facility with my Department, and this facility will not be allowed to close, because it is against the wishes of this House, which supports the national maternity strategy.  I have made it very clear that I have asked for a full report through the national women and infants health programme.  My Department does not support it, they do not support it and the INMO does not support it.  I will meet the INMO tomorrow, and specifically midwives from Cavan.  I suggest that we have a meeting of Oireachtas Members from Cavan-Monaghan on a cross-party basis next week.  I will be in touch with the Deputy about that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Browne kindly said that I could respond in writing on the range of issues raised relating to Tipperary, St. Brigid's, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, St. Michael's, Nenagh and Limerick.  I will respond in writing about each of those.  I need to return to Government with a start date for the CervicalCheck tribunal, but I am happy to share with this House that I would like to see that start around the end of this month.  I need a Government decision on a commencement date.</p>  <p>  On the issue of playgrounds, I find it somewhat frustrating that nobody in this House raised any concerns about opening golf clubs.  In fact, everybody asked me to open more golf clubs quicker and to let people drive across the country to go to a golf club.  Everybody is upset about opening a few swings and slides.  I think it says a lot about our value system in this country and the lobby group that golf clubs have versus the lobby group that children have.  Parents supervise their kids.  They do not want the local authority to become mums and dads to their daughters or sons.  They just want the local authority to clean the slides and swings, and keep an eye on the place.</p></speech>

What will be the procedures for all hospital admissions from now on?  I refer also to those patients who will be admitted to private hospitals from 1 July.  What relationship will exist between private hospitals and the HSE as they continue to reduce the incidence of the virus? </p> <p> The second issue I want to touch on is the development of elective care facilities and hospitals, three of which have been identified in the Project Ireland 2040 programme.  One of those is in Cork.  I raised this recently at a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  We still have not identified a site.  I fully accept that a lot of things were parked in the past three months because priority was given to providing care to those who had contracted coronavirus.  We need extra hospital capacity now more than ever.  When can we proceed with identifying the site and going through the planning process for the Cork facility and the other elective hospitals?</p></speech>

It is very kind of him.  People have been working extraordinarily hard.  He raised the important issue of the testing strategy for hospitals, that is, who is to be tested, the criteria for being tested and what we do about the testing of staff and patients.  Those are key questions.  I understand the clinical adviser for acute hospitals in the HSE has drafted a paper on this.  It was first discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, last week.  Either it is meeting to consider the matter further as we speak or the meeting has just ended.  I expect to have some answers on NPHET's decision shortly.  It made a decision on the testing of nursing homes last week.  This week we are returning to the issue of hospitals, including both public and private hospitals.  I will revert to the Deputy when I have been updated on the NPHET meeting after this session.</p>  <p>  On the issue of elective hospitals, as the Deputy fairly acknowledges, a lot of things were put on hold to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  The executive director of my Department's Sl&aacute;intecare office is now prioritising recommendations to a new Government on how to kick-start several elements of Sl&aacute;intecare.  That will obviously be a matter for a new Government with a new programme for Government.  I am here in a caretaking capacity to decide what to proceed with next, but I would certainly like to see the hospital in Cork move forward.  Cork is an area that really needs capacity, as Deputy Burke has pointed out to me on many occasions.  That will become more rather than less important in light of the need to deal with Covid-19 alongside non-Covid-19 care.</p></speech>

I have met these traders several times and I will meet them again later this afternoon.  They want certainty about when they will be able to reopen.  Earlier is obviously better.  Can the Minister provide an update on the process?  I understand it will be considered by NPHET.  When will this happen?  When does the Minister expect a decision in this area?  Apart from the concerns of the hair salon and barbershop owners, the Minister will appreciate that multitudes are going around with hair down to their knees.  It is one area that people want to get back to, in Limerick in particular.</p></speech>

The Ceann Comhairle was possibly too generous to Members of this House when he described everyone as very well kept.</p> <p>I was certainly not in the Chamber at the time.  I know this is a serious issue, especially for the people for whom this sector provides a livelihood.  This industry employs many people in towns, villages and cities across the country.  As with every other industry, it wants certainty about when it will be possible to get back to work.  I also know that for many people getting their hair done has a mental health element as well.  Many of our older citizens get their hair done every week, not because their hair needs to be done every week, but because it is part of feeling good about ourselves.  I acknowledge the health and well-being aspect of doing that as well.  </p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, there was a plan to have a phase 3, 4 and 5 of the roadmap.  It has been recommended by NPHET, however, that it could be possible to do that in two phases rather than three.  We are now looking at what belongs in each phase and NPHET will provide guidance to the Government on that.  I presume it may have started consideration today, and it is likely the Government will consider this matter next week.  I hope, therefore, that by the end of next week, we will have a direct answer to the question as to what phases each of the remaining sectors will fit.  </p></speech>

I had an unusual request last week from a constituent who wanted to know when social dancing in Ireland could return in the context of strict guidelines.

I will have to revert to Deputy Feighan and his constituent on that matter.  Under phase 2 of the plan, people are able to socialise again, while being asked to keep a distance.  It is safe to dance as long as it is possible to stay 2 m away from the other person.</p></speech>

That will be fantastic news for jobs and for people throughout my constituency.</p>  <p>  The public have been reassured throughout this crisis by the flow of information coming from the HSE, NPHET, the Minister and his Department.  Releasing data on the number of cases by county made it clear this crisis affected every part of our country.  The HSE went one step further and released approximate locations for every reported case.  This confirmed to any sceptics that we needed to follow the expert advice, regardless of which village or town we live in.  We are, thankfully, now in a very different phase of the crisis and the number of new infections is dwindling.  </p>  <p>  Will the Minister commit to publishing data on the number of days since there has been a positive diagnosis for Covid-19 in every county in Ireland?  Will he also commit to updating those data weekly?  That level of detail would reassure counties free from Covid-19 that their efforts have borne fruit and provide hope to other counties that if we continue to follow the public health advice, we will be on a path out of this crisis.</p></speech>

We have to keep bringing people with us and explain why we are asking them to make such serious changes in their lives and bear with serious restrictions.  The Deputy is also right that we are now seeing several counties that have not had a case in several days.  I think County Sligo leads the league table and has been without new cases for 22 days, from the information I saw yesterday.  I think County Kerry might have reached three weeks.  There are several counties that, thankfully, have not seen a case in some time.  That is one of the reasons we are asking people to stay local, so that by the time we get to phase 2, we will have further weakened the grip of this virus on many parts of our country.  I will certainly ask the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, if it is possible to do as Deputy Higgins suggested.  It is a very sensible and helpful suggestion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100036#MM00800"><p>I acknowledge the work of the Minister, his Department, the HSE, NPHET and all the front-line workers who have brought us to this happy day.  It is wonderful to be able to talk about things such as hairdressing and dancing.  That is very encouraging compared to where we were some months ago.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I acknowledge the work of Women's Aid, the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, the rape crisis centres and women refuges.  While vastly under-resourced, they are working to deal with the fallout from Covid-19 due to gender-based violence.  I attended a seminar this morning and listened to harrowing stories of violence towards women and children.  It is important that we acknowledge the vital work of these organisations from a health and mental health perspective and to ensure, whatever parties are in Government in some weeks' time, that these organisations are adequately resourced to do their work.</p>  <p>With regard to testing technologies, we currently seem mostly to be using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR.  What other testing technologies should or could be used?  Are more efficient testing technologies being used in other countries?</p> <p> I have heard of a number of incidents where dentists are in some cases no longer able to take on medical card cases due to the cost of PPE.  This cost is not recoupable to dentists under the medical card scheme and if this is the case, it is contributing to poor health outcomes for medical card holders, many of whom are in need of urgent dental treatment following the easing of restrictions.  One dentist, in responding to a medical card patient, said that the cost involved in buying correct PPE to protect staff and patients and the extra time, investment and labour involved in providing a safe environment for all has overwhelmed the dental profession.  Is this the case?  If so, it needs to be corrected as a matter of urgency.  Is funding an issue?  The world's largest plane landed in Shannon Airport yesterday, delivering PPE.  Perhaps some of that could be used to help the dental profession.</p> <p> What are the Minister's views on the letter signed by 1,000 academic and scientists in regard to crushing the curve?  It seems to make a compelling case given how painstakingly close we are to eliminating the virus in Ireland.  The notion of opening everything up and being in a position to open our schools and colleges fully is surely where we want to be instead of 20% opening, partial opening of cafes, and no live music, arts or cultural gatherings.  Should more consideration be given to this and should we look towards New Zealand given the hard work we have put in to get to this point? </p> <p> The Minister has addressed the issue of face coverings, and it has been discussed on a number of occasions.  I ask that he, in any public awareness campaigns, place a specific focus on homemade face coverings, because they are useful.  I am aware that Dr. De Gascun was not terribly supportive of it at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response on Tuesday, but there are many templates available to make them.  I have them hanging beside our keys in the hall.  They should become a part of daily life, putting them into the wash in the evening and including them as part of our routine.</p> <p> One of the side effects of the crisis is that many couples have had to postpone their wedding celebrations, with many having rescheduled to the end of July and August.  The guidance provided by the Government is that small weddings could take place in phase 4 from 20 July and larger weddings in phase 5 from 10 August.  Presumably, when coming up with this guidance, the Government had some approximate numbers on what "small" or "larger" meant.  The Minister will appreciate that planning a wedding takes some time, and telling a couple at the start of phase 4 on 20 July they can have a wedding of 25 people will be of little use.  If he cannot give an indication today on what constitutes a small or larger gathering, can he at least give a date by which the Government will provide this detail?  The Government has seen fit, since 8 June, to allow more than 25 mourners at funerals.  It would be fitting to give couples this certainty.</p> <p> My own town of Kilkenny is twinned with a municipality in Italy called Formigine, and I was talking with its mayor, Ms Maria Costi, last week.  They were at the epicentre of Covid-19 in Italy but were able to host weddings in the town hall last week.  Weddings are a fantastic and happy occasion, so guidance on that would be useful.</p></speech>

There are a couple of important issues.  With regard to domestic and gender-based violence, I thank the organisations that have been doing incredible work alongside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I visited the National Ambulance Service some weeks ago at the height of this pandemic and they were experiencing an increase in calls related to domestic violence.  For many of us, our home is a place of safety and well-being.  For some people, sadly, when they close their own door it is anything but.  I share the Deputy's views that the next programme for Government and the Oireachtas has a huge body of work to do in supporting those organisations.  A broader conversation is needed on consent and how we raise our kids, and there is a big societal issue as well, but perhaps that is a discussion for another day.</p>  <p>  The issue of other tests is one we always considered, including more rapid tests.  NPHET, commissioned HIQA, as the Deputy will be aware, to do a health technology assessment to examine the alternative diagnostic approaches for the detection of Covid-19.  These alternative approaches included an antigen detection test, the detection of antibodies and other rapid tests.  Work is currently under way internationally to validate the analytical performance of the different diagnostic tests.</p> <p>Until that clinical performance becomes clearer, we cannot recommend them but we are always keeping that under review and the Deputy is right to raise the matter.<br/><br/>On the issue of personal protective equipment, PPE, and dentists, I met with representatives of the Irish Dental Association on 8 May and 15 May.  My officials met with them on 26 May.  My Department is continuing to engage with them and I spoke to the CEO of the HSE yesterday about this.  The Deputy referred to the aeroplane, the world's largest, landing in Shannon.  It is a stark reminder of the situation we are in that the biggest aeroplane in the world only contained enough PPE for 12 and a half days, or three and a half days at the height of this pandemic so far.  That gives one a sense of the scale of the situation.  We need to have a conversation about PPE as we go forward and who is responsible for providing it and the likes.  We are continuing to engage with dentists but I accept it is a real challenge for them and I would like to see us help.<br/><br/>I read the letter from the 1,000 scientists and academics.  I am not sure that they are all scientists and academics but it was a letter from 1,000 people, including many eminent scientists and academics.  When one reads that letter, we are not as far apart as perhaps has been suggested.  What they suggest is to keep following the public health advice, crush the curve, do everything to get as close to zero as possible and not to rush things, which is sensible.  That letter also highlighted the all-island approach which is very important.  I had a quad meeting with the First Minister, deputy First Minister, health minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, as well as the T&aacute;naiste, this week.  We must continue to ensure we are as closely aligned as possible and that is a big part of the approach we must take.<br/><br/>I fully agree with the Deputy about homemade face coverings.  To be clear, the view of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is that homemade face coverings have a value.  That does not apply in a hospital setting where, obviously, we need medical-grade masks for people working in the health service and other settings but it does apply for the Deputy or me getting onto a bus or train, or going into a supermarket.  The idea is that a mask is not a magic shield and does not stop the wearer getting the virus but it does make it harder for a person's droplets to transmit to me or <i>vice versa</i>.  The mask catches droplets and there is clear value in that.  It is an additional hygiene measure, not an alternative.  It is also a visual reminder and aid to all of us.  The view is that homemade masks have a role.  We have put up videos as to how to make them and they can be made with socks and T-shirts.  They need to have certain layers and the likes.  We need to extend that awareness campaign beyond social media and get the message out through more traditional advertising forms.<br/><br/>The question of weddings is a hard one.  People plan the happiest day of their life for a long period of time.  It is a big day and a considerable amount of work goes into them.  The arrival of the pandemic has meant that the best laid plans have been thrown up in the air.  We have stated, as the Deputy rightly said, that 25 people can attend a funeral but that only relates to the church part of the service and not to the reception afterwards.  We are not yet at a point where we can recommend the gathering indoors of more than six people.  I hope that if we keep this pandemic in a good place we will be able to provide clarity on the matter.  My intention, and I have been clear with NPHET on this, is to be in a position where we can answer that question when we publish the next iteration of the roadmap, the contents of phases 3 and 4.  Even if it is bad news, we need to let people know so that they can make their own decisions.  I have said publicly, in an effort to be helpful, that we are a fair while away from it being safe to carry out the traditional wedding of 100-odd people in our country.</p></speech>

I was deeply worried by that but I told myself that the Minister has been working hard so I should give him a chance.  In the phases outlined by NPHET, the analysis shows that the team and the Government make decisions based on five criteria, one of which is secondary morbidity and mortality.  I asked the Minister last week what modelling the Government has done that it can share with us regarding morbidity and mortality rates for non-Covid-19 healthcare and deaths and the impacts that has on people's health.  Given that is one of the five criteria, modelling of that sort is being done day-to-day and week-to-week because otherwise the decision-making methodology is flawed.  I hope that is not the case because I agreed with the decisions that were made in the most recent phase.  What modelling is being done?  How many people are being affected across services?  What is the impact on morbidity and mortality by healthcare area, geography and age profile?  I am sure the Minister has all that information for us this week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100038#OO00300"><p>Truthfully, I do not have that information but I get what the Deputy is saying and I have a way of getting the information for him.  I submit a report to the Government about phasing every three weeks and I will see what I can share with the Deputy on that matter in writing.  I will also share it with the House.  We do look at the different categories.  So far as secondary mortality and morbidity are concerned, and the Deputy will agree with me on this, those are very hard at this stage to detect with any degree of certainty.</p> <p>The longer it takes to resume certain services, the greater the impact would be on secondary morbidity, which I think is the issue the Deputy is getting at.  I do not want to eat into his time.  I have seen a draft of the resumption of non-Covid care plan from the HSE.  The HSE very kindly shared a draft with my Department.  There was a meeting between my Department and the HSE yesterday on this.  The final version will go to the HSE board, probably next Wednesday, and will be published by the HSE.  I am telling the Deputy this because within that, quite a bit of analysis has been done on the loss of care from Covid, that is, what we are losing out on today in terms of services that would have been provided.  I should be in a position to share that with the Deputy next week.  </p></speech>

First, criteria have to be based on something.  This fifth criterion, what is it based on, if the Minister can actually tell us?  He has made decisions but he cannot tell us what quantitative or qualitative data he is using to make such decisions.  That is very worrying.  These are the five criteria locked in stone, and for this one we have no quantitative or qualitative data that the Minister can share.  Second, on the HSE plan, why are we waiting?  This has been going on for a month now.  I have been told the plan is going to be published.  Last week, the Minister said it was going to the HSE board.  The Taoiseach also said it was going to the HSE board.  It has not gone to the HSE board.  The independence of the HSE board is something I have raised here on numerous occasions.  I have concerns.  Is the issue trying to link up this plan with potential changes in the next phases as regards 2 m versus 1 m?  There is an impact on health services in that regard.  Is there a concern that they do not want to publish the plan because the volume of services will be so low that the public will really understand how deep a crisis we are going to have in non-Covid healthcare provision?  Why is there such a delay?  Why have we been promised for the past four weeks that a plan was going to be published?  My colleagues and I used to question the HSE on this.  That was all dropped politely a few weeks ago.  We were told about this before it was dropped but we still do not have it.  Where is it?  What is the delay?  What modelling is being done?  What statistics, qualitative and quantitative, are being used?  It is all very shady and deeply concerning because we have no transparency here.</p></speech>

I would not like to see that dropped.  I thought it was quite a useful engagement and would support ensuring that it happens again.  What I am saying to the Deputy is that we already know there are impacts in terms of secondary morbidity and secondary mortality from Covid.  We just talked about it in respect of the potential risks of domestic violence.  We have talked about it in connection with mental health and screening.  At this stage, it is very hard to be definitive about the scale of all of that because it is very much interlinked with how quickly we can get the services recommenced and how we can continue to keep the virus down.  That is the point I was making.</p>  <p>  The HSE board is independent and is doing an excellent job.  It is a very good board.</p></speech>

It exists.  It has done that.  It is right and proper, though, that it interact with my Department on this from a policy perspective, making sure it is aligned with policy and with the service plan.  It may require us to amend the service plan because levels that the HSE legally committed to delivering in terms of services may not now be deliverable.  There is a lot of work already under way.  The HSE intends to publish the plan next week.</p></speech>

I understand the final version is going to the board of the HSE on Wednesday.  As the Deputy reminded me from day one, it is the HSE's plan to publish.  I make the point that non-Covid care has resumed in many areas.  I am not going to read out a long list and eat into the Deputy's time.  That can be seen in the fact that there are far fewer vacant beds in our health service this week than there were last week.</p></speech>

The Minister knows I wish to know when the tribunal will start.  I have spoken to all the advocates and I do not buy the plan to bring back screening.  It does not make sense to delay cervical cancer screening until the end of the month and see no reason it has not already commenced.  Clinicians have told me there is no reason.  I quoted Dr. Doireann O'Leary earlier.  GPs can do smear tests and GP practices are engaging with people full time.  I do not understand why those who do screening cannot do so.  It is a big problem.</p> <p> Earlier, the Taoiseach took on board two of my suggestions relating to a vaccine for everyone in the country and face coverings.  He made commitments to consider them, which I appreciate.  </p> <p> The capital plan has obviously been impacted.  I have asked many questions on various projects.  When will the Minister publish a new updated capital plan?  Will he do so in the next couple of weeks?  I seek the status of the national maternity hospital, the children's hospital and various projects around the country.  I re-emphasise the need for a new maternity hospital in Limerick.  </p> <p> Has the Minister considered legislation or an order relating to the wearing of face masks in settings such as public transport?  How many doses of the flu vaccine are on order?  The HSE needs to prepare to ramp up supply if it is to be given to everyone in the country.  A time lag is involved in that.  What is being done regarding the HPV vaccine?  I have long been a passionate proponent of the need for a second dose.  There must be a plan to ensure the period between the two doses is not so long as to make it unusable.  </p> <p> For five weeks in a row, I have raised the matter of people with intellectual disabilities.  I am convinced that the 1 m and 2 m social distancing recommendation will be key for many services outside and inside the health sector on 29 June.  People with intellectual disabilities, children and adults, are really regressing.  Can we get services to them soon, please?</p></speech>

It will have to make some big key decisions on the capital plan.  There is only so much we can do in this interregnum.  We have pushed the boat out on A Vision for Change because it was important but at some point the new Government must take over.  Of course there will have to be revisions to capital plans.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for his advocacy on the flu vaccine.  He was very effective on this and we will see where it brings us.  I will ask the HSE to ensure that it is able to order sufficient samples.  </p>  <p>  I fully accept the Deputy's bona fides on cervical screening.  It will be one of the first screening programmes to recommence.  I continue to engage weekly with the national screening service. </p>  <p>  On intellectual disabilities, specifically children, I hope the Minister for Education and Skills and the Government will have positive news on some supports for those families tomorrow.  Based on my engagement with organisations, there should be restart plans for adult services by the end of this month.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100040#QQ00300"><p>I have given the Minister notice of my intention to raise an urgent and serious matter with him today.  It concerns the brain tumour research study proposed by Beaumont Hospital and Genomics Medicine Ireland, a commercial company that intends to use the DNA from brain tissue samples obtained from tumour patients.  Research in this area is critically important but it should be carried out under the auspices of a State body, which ensures appropriate regulation, transparency and public buy-in with a specific public benefit remit.  Ireland is an outlier in not taking such an approach.  It is proposed that these samples would be used to create large DNA databases to which access will be sold for commercial purposes.  This project raises huge ethical, privacy and public interest issues.  The proposal was comprehensively rejected by the Health Research Consent Declaration Committee, the body charged with making decisions on these key issues.</p> <p>However, a subsequent appeal of this decision was, puzzlingly and worryingly, upheld.  The handling of this issue by the State has been questionable, to say the least.  Under the proposal, GMI is not required to obtain consent from patients or the families of the deceased.  Instead, against all best practice, an opt-out arrangement was agreed with a limited requirement for newspaper advertising and a deadline of tomorrow, 12 June.  As the Minister is aware, that period has coincided with Covid-19 and because of that public awareness of this significant proposal is very limited.  Therefore, given all of the concerns and big question marks around the probity, data protection and ethical aspects of this proposal, I am making an urgent appeal to the Minister here today to extend tomorrow's deadline for patients and their families to opt out in order to ensure adequate public awareness.  I hope the Minister will accede to this request.</p></speech>

I am informed that the regulations do not permit me, as Minister, to amend the decisions or vary the conditions.  However, I want to say very clearly on the record of this House that I believe the deadline should be extended.  I note that the Health Research Consent Declaration Committee very kindly sent me a copy of the letter it sent to Deputy Shortall where it outlined the process.  I believe it sent the letter today.  It has now also written to the people involved in the project highlighting this issue and ascertaining if they would amend the time period.  They should amend the time period.  I support Deputy Shortall in her call in regard to this.  I do not want to eat up the rest of the Deputy's time explaining the public health tests that would have been applied, the independence of the group etc., but the principal point the Deputy makes is that where there is an opt-out rather than an opt-in, there is a greater burden on those carrying out the research to make sure that everybody who wishes to opt out has the ability to do that.  I think Deputy Shortall's concern is that that may not have been the case and I share her view in that regard.</p></speech>

Given that Beaumont Hospital is a State-funded body, will he undertake to pick up the telephone to the hospital today to speak to the person or section responsible and request very seriously that the deadline be extended?  There are lots of questions around this entire project.  I have serious concerns about it but the most urgent aspect is that the deadline needs to be extended.  Will the Minister undertake to do that today?</p></speech>

I will undertake that my office will make contact today with the HSE and Beaumont Hospital to outline our view.  I could say more but in the interests of time I do not think the Deputy would wish me to.  The health research regulations do provide for an independent and diverse health research consent declaration committee and an independent appeals panel, which has to have regard to the evidence before it, and it sets the safeguards and the time limits and the regulations do say that I cannot intervene in any of that.</p></speech>

A couple of weeks ago I raised with the Minister here the funding crisis facing many disability organisations for various reasons, Covid obviously, but also resulting from the &euro;20 million cut that took place earlier this year in January.  Two weeks ago in this House the Minister stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Being blunt and honest, they will not be in a position to achieve [this cut] and I have made that clear to them.  We need to look at how we can formalise that and provide them with peace of mind in that regard in the coming days. </blockquote>  <p>That was two weeks ago.  Does the Minister now have clarification and hopefully good news on that?</p></speech>

My Department is currently, as we do on a number of matters, engaging with other Departments.  I truthfully hope to be able to bring the matter to a successful conclusion very shortly but I do not believe that 1% can be achieved this year.</p> <p>I want to provide them with the peace of mind of a letter confirming that.  I cannot say to the Deputy today I have it but I am really very close.</p></speech>

I hope I am correct in that and that there will be news soon.</p>  <p>  The third issue I want to raise is the question of Citywest.  The HSE is paying at least &euro;25 million for the use of the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre as an isolation facility and field hospital and it has the use of that facility up to the end of October.  Earlier, the Minister referred to the long-promised HSE roadmap.  I am concerned that we are running out of time in the arrangement with the private hospitals.  There are beds there that should be completely used to best effect but Citywest also should be.  We are paying good and substantial public money for it and we need to utilise that facility.  Thankfully, we did not see the surge and the intended use was not required, although I would like to get further information on what the isolation rooms were used for.  The reality is there is a hotel now with 756 bedrooms in it and there are also 300 beds in the field hospital.  At a time when there are long waiting lists for all kinds of health services, there are more than 1,000 beds being paid for which are lying empty.  Can the Minister tell us how will the Citywest convention centre be used, given that it is under the control of the HSE until the end of October and how will the field hospital of 300 beds there be used?  Can the Minister combine that with the roadmap from the HSE and the capacity within private hospitals at present?  Can the Minister ensure that that massive costly facility is utilised to the maximum?</p></speech>

The low occupancy rates to date are a direct impact of the public health measures we had.  I remember standing in what would have been that field hospital in Citywest with the Taoiseach and the CEO of the HSE, thinking "It is great we have it but I hope we never have to use this."</p>  <p>  We do, as the Deputy rightly says, have use of this facility until at least the end of October.  A decision has to be made by 23 June as to whether to extend that beyond that date.  The Department has been preparing for all potential scenarios and there have been talks between the Department, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to alternative site uses in the event of a low surge requirement, which we now have, and there is due to be an alternative use strategy presented to my Department by the HSE next week.  I accept we have it until the end of October.  There has to be better use.  We also need to make a decision on whether we will need it through the winter period and that will very much depend on how compelling is the case the HSE puts forward in terms of what it will use it for.  It is a hotel.  Largely speaking, it is not a clinical environment.  When it comes to step-down facilities and providing people with convalescence and the likes, we often do not have enough capacity.  That, to me, seems like an option worth exploring but next week the HSE is due to present its alternative use strategy.</p></speech>

One sees it often in the private sector where somebody goes in for elective surgery, he or she is only in for one night or possibly two nights, and then goes in to another facility, which is often a hotel.  We should be maximising the use of that.  It is shocking to see facilities like this lying idle at a time when so many more services are required for people on waiting lists.</p></speech>

I refer to the 70,000 people who bravely volunteered for the Be On Call for Ireland initiative.  I asked a question recently of the Minister which was passed on to the HSE about the cost of using CPL and agencies like that.</p></speech>

I simply did not get an answer.  I got other answers but not the answer about how much it cost.  What I was told, which is fairly extraordinary, is that of the 70,000 people who applied for the Be On Call for Ireland programme, 111 have been recruited.</p> <p>That is pitiful.  It is against a background of a dire need for increased staffing for Covid and non-Covid care, where we were already in a chronic situation in terms of capacity with poor levels of staffing before Covid, and we have additional needs.  These agencies have managed to recruit 111 people.  Some 663 people are job-ready and available for employment when they are required, which suggests we are deliberately not employing people even though they are qualified to do the job . We are just sort of keeping them on hold, which is extraordinary.  Insofar as there was an explanation as to why we had gone through these agencies, it was because it would threaten the stability of the existing HSE payroll structure, which is just nonsense.</p> <p> Will the Minister shed any light on this pitiful failure by these agencies, the refusal to recruit people through Be On Call for Ireland, and that bogus explanation as to why we use these agencies in the first place?</p></speech>

I had not directly seen the query but now that the Deputy has brought it to my attention, we will follow up on that and revert to him.</p>  <p>  When we talk about HSE recruitment, Be On Call for Ireland and the like, we have to look at the total number of people who have been hired through the different doors and routes.  I do not want to use up all the Deputy's time but, for example, some people who have applied for Be On Call for Ireland might also have directly applied to the HSE's national recruitment campaign, which hired 1,412 people.  We hired 1,082 student nurses and midwives as healthcare assistants, that is, not as students but as healthcare assistants.  We hired 80 additional medical scientists, we rehired 98 other people, and we hired 926 new doctors.  We have 1,976 people who have been successful at interview for Be On Call for Ireland and will now be placed.</p>  <p>  When I add up all the figures I read out, it brings me to a total of 4,574 additional people who have been hired or are in the process of being placed as a result of our recruitment campaign.  Thankfully, we have not needed everybody in the way we thought or feared we might, but we will still need additional people for non-Covid care.</p></speech>

This is a centre for the vulnerable and elderly where there were no Covid cases, which suggests it is not a bad place, yet the charity is saying the centre has to close because it cannot afford to come up to HIQA requirements.  It is unacceptable that the Sisters of Charity, for reasons best known to themselves, will close a nursing home for the vulnerable, the blind and the elderly.  For whatever reason, that should not be allowed to happen and the State should step in and take over that nursing home.</p></speech>

A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>entitled &quot;Ireland facing a 'tsunami' of mental health problems&quot;, cited international evidence to show that the pandemic has served to intensify the mental health crisis in other countries.  In the United States, for example, 45% of people with suicidal thoughts recently had explicitly linked them to Covid-19.  Maynooth university and the centre for global health at Trinity College Dublin recently released the first wave of the Irish Covid-19 psychological study.  The survey found 41% of respondents reporting feelings of loneliness, 23% with clinically meaningful levels of depression, 20% with clinically meaningful levels of anxiety and 18% with clinically meaningful levels of post-traumatic stress disorder.  A recent article in <i>The Irish News</i>estimated that Ireland was among the top 20 countries in the world most likely to experience a surge in mental health cases as a result of the pandemic.</p> <p>All of this comes on top of circumstances in which mental health services are already creaking at the joints from pressure from demand in the context of underfunding.  For example, in the child and adult mental health service, CAMHS, there are 2,200 on the waiting list according to the last figures we have, which are from 2019.  In my area, Cork&ndash;Kerry, there are 162 who have been waiting for the services for a year or even more.</p> <p> Are our mental health services fit for purpose?  I do not mean in any way to question the work of the staff, both the paid staff and volunteers, who do heroic work, but even heroic work does not necessarily cut it when a mere 6% of the public health budget goes towards mental health services.  This contrasts with the expenditure in many European countries, which spend at least double that or more.  As a result, there is considerable over-reliance on the voluntary and charity sector, a sector that is uniquely exposed to this crisis.  An example is the way in which fundraising has been affected.  We saw what happened with Darkness into Light.  Charities are expecting to lose income in the order of up to 40% this year, and 54% of charities are concerned they may be unable to continue providing services for more than six months.  What we have is a genuine double whammy.  On the one hand, there are underfunded services that were already creaking at the seams before Covid and that are now hit with a funding crisis, and on the other hand there is what was described in the article, namely, a tsunami of mental health problems.  This adds up to a really difficult situation that cries out for urgent action by the State.</p> <p> I would argue two points, in particular, the first being that there is a need for an immediate doubling of the State's mental health expenditure as a first step.  Second, there is a need to establish an Irish national health service that fully integrates the voluntary and charitable sectors.</p> <p> Will the Minister comment on the mental health crisis we are facing as we move out of lockdown?  Second, what is his position on the two issues I have raised, namely, the need for radical increases in expenditure and the need for a public health service to cover mental health?</p></speech>

I am conscious that people watching this debate, like all others, could be experiencing mental health challenges.  There is support available.  There is a very useful website, <i>yourmentalhealth.ie</i>, that can direct people to the supports.  I would encourage anybody in need of supports to reach out.</p><p>The Deputy was right to highlight this matter.  A very serious mental health challenge will emerge from this crisis.  People have lost so much certainty in their lives and so much that they had hoped for has now been cast in doubt, at least temporarily.  That is why I took the unusual decision, during an interregnum last week, or this day last week, to ask the Government for permission to publish the new A  Vision for Change, Sharing the Vision, our new ten-year mental health policy.  One would usually wait for a new Government to do this but every Deputy said we should get on with it and publish it.  The document will be launched formally by the Minister of State, Jim Daly, tomorrow.  Key to the policy &mdash; this is my advice to the next Government and this Oireachtas &mdash; will have to be the implementation structure.  That is where the last document, A Vision for Change, fell down.  It will be a matter of the implementation structure and, possibly and respectfully, an Oireachtas mental health committee.</p><p>I agree there is a real challenge associated with this.  Next week we will be launching a crisis text line, Ireland's first ever 24-7 crisis text line, aimed particularly at younger people with mental health issues.  We have provided some additional funding.  The Deputies will have noted the additional funding for Pieta House, &euro;114,000 more per month to provide 300 additional counselling hours a month for high-risk clients, in addition to some funding for extra online supports.  It is about more than that, however.  It will be about how we deal with a whole-of-society mental health challenge arising from the Covid pandemic.  I do not disagree with much of what the Deputy said.</p></speech>

That democratic vote has been parked for what is now one third of a year.  We are experiencing an unprecedented democratic deficit in this State.</p> <p>Many people outside the Leinster House bubble are shocked at the slow pace of the seemingly never-ending negotiations that now seem to be stalling and getting nowhere.  I am using a couple of seconds at the start of my contribution again to urge the parties currently involved in negotiations to speed up the process and make a decision rapidly.  It is a very dangerous position for many reasons.</p> <p> We owe front-line workers a huge debt of gratitude because of the work they have been doing and a similar debt to the public for adhering to the requests from medical experts and pushing down the incidence of the disease to a manageable level.  Some significant sections of Irish society have been left behind, however.  There is no doubt that children with special needs have been left behind.  Elderly people in nursing homes have similarly been left behind while staff in those homes have been crying out for personal protective equipment, oxygen supplies and extra staffing.  There is no doubt that people in direct provision centres have been left behind, as well as workers in meat factories and hospital staff.</p> <p> A section of society will probably suffer most from what is happening but we could do something radical about it right now.  It may be the case that people who have had their health services suspended or stopped because of this Covid-19 crisis could be the section of society most affected by it.  They are not included in current daily statistics but I have no doubt that they will be included some day.</p> <p> Deputy Alan Kelly asked both a few minutes ago and last week the level of forecasting and modelling done by the Government to identify morbidity and mortality arising from the lack of health services in so many areas.  He got no answer today in the same way he got no answer last week.  I can provide the answer.  There is absolutely no modelling or forecasting being done.  I asked the HSE that question three weeks ago and it indicated it was involved in no such forecasting or modelling of the level of morbidity and mortality arising from a lack of services.</p> <p> I have no doubt that at the start of the crisis, we saw a shocking wave emerging from Europe and coming in our direction and it was necessary to prepare all the hospital services to be reoriented to this crisis.  Given the figures we have seen throughout society, there is absolutely no excuse for us not to try to reorient back the services, as best we can, to the areas they are needed.</p> <p> I raise the matter of cancer screening.  I spoke to a woman this morning who was meant to get a skin cancer test done in April to check if there had been any changes in her skin but that was postponed until June and the appointment has now been put back to December.  Obviously, many people in such a position will find themselves materially worse off from a health perspective by the end of this year and into the next year.</p> <p> We in Aont&uacute; have been highly vocal in repeatedly raising the issue of cancer screening.  A decision was made in March to cancel breast and cervical cancer screenings but was the Minister involved in making that decision?  When asked, the HSE indicated this happened on foot of Government advice.  Did the Minister know a decision had been made on cancellation of cancer screening services?  Why did the Minister not tell the House about that decision?  When I looked back on the press statements made by the Government, that information is not there.  Will the Minister answer those questions first?</p></speech>

First, the Deputy does not need to tell me that it has been 124 days since the general election.  I thought, come what may, after the general election life would move on and we would have a Government but I have been barely home since.  I am well aware it has been 124 days since the election.  The Deputy engaged in talks but there is a great irony in that many people in the House did not darken our door or talk to anybody about forming a Government.  Perhaps they should reflect on that, rather than attack those us trying to continue in government while trying to form a new Government.  We are well aware of the need for a new Government and this country needs that new Government quickly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy makes a fair point in highlighting a number of groups of people for whom this pandemic has been particularly challenging.</p> <p>Lockdown is tough on everybody but it is not equally tough.  What this global pandemic has done, and it is a global pandemic, is highlight the inequalities that exist in society.  I have a bit of advice for the next Government and for this Oireachtas.  We would want to get serious about tackling those inequalities.  When it comes to the fact that so many people in this House wrote-----</p></speech>

I am not sure I have got an answer to the four specific questions I asked but I will move on to the next section.  We know from a document that was referenced in yesterday's <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>that up to 200,000 women are waiting for screenings.  The chief executive of the National Screening Service, NSS, has warned that when the screening restarts the capacity will only allow for approximately 50% of the number of people to be able to be screened with regards the pre-Covid levels.  That is deeply worrying because not only do many people have this long wait, it also means that by the time we get through that backlog many months will have passed.  What measures has the Minister taken, or will he take, to make sure that we have the necessary capacity to address the cancer screening backlog that has arisen?</p><p>I have a couple more questions on that.  The last statement from the National Screening Service website was updated on 5 May.  It is not acceptable that many women are sitting at home deeply concerned with regard to their well-being and these delays.  I would be grateful if the Minister would ensure that the NSS publishes updates on its website more frequently so that people could get clear information on it.</p><p>A good deal of information is emerging with regard to nursing homes and care homes here.  There is a long list of decisions that were made which have led to those who are most vulnerable in our society being the most exposed in this crisis.  I cannot think of another situation in the history of Ireland where more people died in institutions.  Care champions have echoed a request by Aont&uacute; recently for a full public investigation into what happened in nursing homes.  Will the Minister commit to a full public investigation here today?</p></speech>

I have already told the House today that by the end of this month the National Screening Service will outline the restart dates for each of the four screening programmes.  I fully agree with the Deputy that it is not acceptable that the website has not been updated since 5 May.  I know they have been engaging with the Irish Cancer Society, the Marie Keating Foundation, the 221 Plus group and the National Women's Council but I agree that website should be updated.</p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of nursing homes, the villain here is the virus.  We have a virus that has killed more than 400,000 people across the world and it is a virus that is extremely infectious.  When it gets into residential settings it can be extremely difficult and deadly for people of a certain age.  When this pandemic is over there will be a time to reflect on all the measures we put in place and, indeed, the lessons to be learned, and there must be lessons learned from a pandemic.  I note what Dr. Nabarro told the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response today, chaired by Deputy McNamara.  He said that when it comes to Ireland and care homes, our numbers are very honest.  That is a reflection of what he might think of the numbers in other countries in regard to the counting of fatalities in nursing homes.  He also said that in all of the countries he studied he had never seen a wider circle of inclusion in terms of what is included in Covid-19 statistics on nursing homes.</p></speech>

We must achieve a quicker turnaround.  There are still cases of people getting tested and then waiting considerably too long for their results.  We need quicker turnarounds.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on that issue.</p> <p> With regard to hospital waiting lists, because of what has happened, both our private and public hospitals have been shut down for the very important ordinary routine work hospitals have to do.  We already had massive waiting lists for cataract treatments, hip and knee operations and all of the other procedures that need to be undertaken but they are now really backed up.  We need to start dealing with that job of work and getting through those lists.  There are people at home today who are going blind or who are in severe pain while waiting for hip and knee operations.  I ask the Minister to make a statement as to how we can better use our hospitals to get through the lists more quickly and in a more timely fashion than ever before.</p> <p> I was very thankful to him for something.  We are in a very unusual position in County Kerry in that we have a public hospital and a private hospital, both of which are excellent and which are in sight of each other.  We are one of only a few places in the country in that situation.  I was personally very thankful to the Minister for meeting with the excellent manager of the Bon Secours private hospital in Tralee.  At that meeting, we discussed many different methods by which the two hospitals could work together in a more connected way.  I would like the Minister to expand on that.  I want the HSE to work on that and to make those hospitals work better because I know that they can.  I ask the Minister to make a statement in that regard.</p> <p> Everyone in the country is complimenting our healthcare workers, and rightly so.  I want the Minister, however, to do a very special thing.  It is an unusual thing to ask but I want him to stop praising our nurses and other healthcare professionals and instead to start paying them.  I want them to be paid the money they are owed.  I want the pay agreements that were in place to be honoured.  I ask the Minister to specifically make a statement explaining why catering staff, who are very important people, have not had a pay increase for 12 or 13 years, because I cannot understand it.  If we do not have catering staff working in the kitchens, hospital will not function properly.  It is not right or proper.  The Minister knows how much inflation has increased over the past ten, 12 and 13 years.  Those people have not got &euro;1 extra in pay in all those years.  That is wrong.  I want the Minister to make a statement on that.</p> <p> I also want him to clarify the situation as regards beauty and hair salons.  I asked the Taoiseach about this matter earlier this afternoon.  I would like the Minister to elaborate.  What is the Government now saying to the proprietors of beauty salons, hairdressers and barber shops?   When are they going to be allowed to open and to function properly?</p></speech>

There is, however, a very serious point here.  There are many people who want to go back to work and make a living and who employ people in every town and village.  As I said earlier, there is also a mental health aspect to this issue.  There are people, particularly older people, who get their hair done once a week not necessarily because they need to but because it makes them feel good.  That is also important.  The Government is now considering what will go into each of the remaining two phases - and we hope it will be two phases.  We will take the advice of NPHET in that regard.  It is likely that Government will make a decision on the matter at our meeting towards the end of next week.  I will keep the Deputy informed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand why I do not intend to stop praising healthcare workers, but I take his point.  They want more than applause and platitudes.  I have had some very good meetings this week.  Two were with the INMO, and one was with SIPTU.  I will have another with the INMO tomorrow and one with the IMO.  Recognising these staff will be a job of work for the next Government.</p>  <p>  The issue of catering staff is an important point.  I was made aware of a pay agreement that was not being honoured.  I believe it related to a private sector arrangement.  That was a disgraceful act.  I take the Deputy's point but it will fall to the next Government to resolve any pay issues.  Some 124 days on from the election, we are hopeful that a new Government will be formed.</p>  <p>  May I write to the Deputy with regard to waiting lists?  He is not wrong.  With regard to testing and tracing, there has been significant progress on turnaround times but he is right; we should never get complacent. </p> <p>We have to keep doing better in this regard.  I will keep in touch with the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

We will have plenty of sun.</p>  <p>  We need definite answers about St. Brigid's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir.  We are told that the staff were needed in Cashel.  The Minister can correct me, but I understand more than 74,000 people applied to work in HSE front-line services - fair dues to them - and only a paltry 140 or so were employed so why do the staff of St. Brigid's have to go to Cashel?  I am delighted to see Cashel open.  The Minister visited it with me and others and he saw its pristine state.  Some &euro;22 million had been spent on it.  Now it is reopened.  We are delighted and we send good wishes to the patients who moved into St. Patrick's, the staff, their families and all the care workers.  However, what will happen post Covid-19?  Will it be kept open as a hospital?  There should be no more lame excuses that it was not fit, that people could not go up the stairs and whatever else.  That cannot be allowed.</p>  <p>  I refer to BreastCheck, the cervical smear tests and all the other tests.  People are waiting anxiously.  We see the Minister's former leader advocating for the hospice, and fair dues to him.  People with prostate cancer have been advised to check and have tests such as bowel smearing, but all that has stopped.  People are getting worried and sick.  The stress of it is making them sick.  It is compounding the mental health issues, and they must be dealt with.  Early intervention services have just been abandoned for the past three or four months.  They were bad anyway, but they are vital to children and to adults with disabilities if they are new cases presenting.  We had difficulty last year opening St. Rita's in Clonmel and we want to have an assurance it will open this summer.</p>  <p>  July provision is going to start; it must.  Let us picture a family who has a young man or woman at home with severe and profound disabilities.  These people have been in contact with me.  Thankfully, some of the soccer and GAA pitches are open this week and they can go there for a limited time.  They need that.  They were incarcerated for three months and did not even get to have a trip on the bus with their siblings.  That routine was very important to them.  Will the Minister respond on that?</p>  <p>  I have also asked about mental health.  The Minister mentioned mental health and us not getting our hair cut.  Mine is not growing much anyway so I might have to get the 10:10:20 for it.  I know barbers whose mental health is suffering.  Their job is to get up for work, the banter, the service and the customer.  Customers are being dealt with in the black market.  It is simply appalling and the black market is expanding all the time.  William Walsh in Clonmel has set up his salon.  One goes into something like a telephone box and one is disinfected going in and leaving.  There are gowns and everything else.  He is a very professional man and he needs to get back to work.  Work is his therapy and it is what he wants to do.</p>  <p>  On the private hospitals, we had to sign up and I supported it, but the contract should have been changed this month.  If it had cost money, so be it.  Let them get back to work.  I will not even talk about Citywest Hotel.  It is an appalling vista to have that amount paid for an empty building and a field hospital.  We thought we would need them.  Thank God, we did not, so we must get them back to work and in use.  The queues are getting longer.  I plead with the Minister to do that.  I also plead with him to insist with NPHET tomorrow to let barbers and such places open.  That includes the pubs.  Let them go back to 1 m because they cannot survive and they might not reopen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100048#YY00400"><p>The Deputy makes a valid point about barbers.  I have been listening to them in the media recently and heard about the big efforts they have been making to adapt their premises.  I heard them talk about bringing one or two customers in at a time.  They are going to great lengths and I hope we can make progress on this.  As a Government, we must consider the public health advice and I have outlined the timeline in that regard.  On pubs, we have been clear about the types that might be able to open, which is those that effectively operate as restaurants.  However, let us be clear.  Nobody wants to have the pub or restaurant where there is a big outbreak of Covid-19.  That is not good for business either, and it is not good for the health of people in the community.  We have made much progress and saved many lives so we cannot go backwards.  It is a balance.  Good, strong public health policy will help our economy, businesses and people, but I have heard the Deputy's comments on that.</p>  <p>  I hope we will have news tomorrow on the July provision.  I also hope that it will be broader than just the traditional July provision and that my Department and the HSE will also play a role in providing therapies and supports for the reasons the Deputy outlined in terms of early intervention services.  I hope to have good news in that regard tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I will always prefer to stand here as Minister for Health and take flak for the private hospitals and Citywest Hotel not being as busy rather than stand here and wonder, first, why we did not have them, second, why we ran out of ventilators and, third, why we did not have a field hospital.  Thank God we did not need them.  If we had to pay some money for that safety net as, effectively, an insurance policy, it was worth every cent.  Most taxpayers in the country will agree with that.  However, we now must look at the strategy for the future because we are in a different place.</p>  <p>  I have already commented on screening.  I should point out that anybody who has symptoms should come forward and not wait for a screening test.  If somebody has a symptom of cancer, the health service is open today.  He or she should ring the GP today.</p>  <p>  I will write to the Deputy about St. Brigid's.</p></speech>

I welcome the decision to review the contracts in question at the end of June.  I have raised it many times already.</p><p>The Minister described the virus as a villain.  I do not think it is helpful to contribute human characteristics to a virus.  A virus is a virus.  It is a matter of our reaction to that virus and how we deal with it.  The Minister spoke about highlighting inequality.  Many of us have highlighted inequality repeatedly in this Chamber, pointing out its effects on health, the effects of no housing on health and so on.  In March, when we started our journey on this pandemic, I highlighted the letter that most of us received from F&oacute;rsa on the appalling conditions of primary care facilities which are not fit for purpose.</p><p>Merlin Park hospital in Galway was set up in 1950, thanks to the work of No&euml;l Browne and his small team.  In this context, it is interesting that it was set up as the first dedicated TB hospital.  It is now practically empty.  I have pointed this out to the Minister.  Its rehab centre has been shut down.  Not alone has its rehab been shut down, the patients were put into the private Bon Secours Hospital.  When I asked the Minister on the last occasion about this, he gave me some figures and said he would come back to me about the Galway Clinic, Doughiska.  That has not happened, unfortunately.  I understand the Minister is busy but he might come back on that.</p><p>Last week, in the course of representations, a person, who has given me permission to raise his case today, ended up in Limerick hospital because of fog and so on.  He could not get back into Galway.  Why?  There was no bed in Galway.  We have all these contradictory stories.  I have a letter here actually still confirming no bed.  I think things are changing today.</p><p>We have Merlin Park half empty.  We have Doughiska with a 20% occupancy.  We have Bon Secours filled with public patients from the public hospital.  These are all contradictions.  We have the front pages of the <i>Galway Advertiser</i>encouraging people to go into hospital but then we have no bed available.  I am finding it difficult to get my head around it.</p><p>What in God's name is behind the decision to shut down the rehab unit in Merlin Park hospital?  The Minister might recall the whole debacle over two operating theatres in Galway.  I read out letters from consultants, not known for their radicalism, speaking about a catastrophic situation and a catastrophic orthopaedic waiting list with unimaginable suffering.  That is the context in which we are shutting down Merlin Park.</p></speech>

I think we all do in our own way.  Certainly my comments describing the virus as a villain related to the fact that sometimes in this place there can be a culture of blame, such as blaming NPHET or blaming the HSE.  From my experience, everyone has been working 24-7 to do their very best against the challenge of the virus.</p>  <p>  I offer my sincere apologies that we did not revert to the Deputy on her specific query on Merlin Park hospital.  We will, of course, do that.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's legitimate point about the reopening of services and why are we not using them, the HSE's non-Covid care plan, which is being worked through with all the hospital groups, is due to go to its board for final approval next Wednesday and to be published next week.  I take the point we need to get many of these services back up and running.  I also, by the way, believe that the Merlin Park site could well be the home of the new elective hospital that Galway badly needs.  That will be a matter for the new Government.  We will have the HSE's non-Covid care plan next week which will be about turning back on some of the non-Covid services including those-----</p></speech>

My own family benefited from it.  It has been closed down to benefit the private hospital to justify the Minister's contract that we never saw because it is commercially sensitive.  To try to understand this, really it is like something from Kafka.  We put its public patients into a private hospital.  It is mind-boggling.  I am not here to blame but I am certainly here to have a better public health system, as well as better public housing.  That simply is not happening, however.  We have more of a language that is twisted and turned.</p>  <p>  How do I explain to people in Galway that the rehab unit in Merlin Park is closed down while some of its patients are in the Bon Secours Hospital?  By its own admission, the Bon Secours Hospital is not set up as a rehab centre.  We have nurses from Merlin Park going into University Hospital Galway every day, going from ward to ward with no sense of building up a relationship with patients.</p> <p>I have five seconds left so I will leave it.  I have made my point and the Minister might come back to me about the specific issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100050#AAA00200"><p>On 19 March 2020, this House gave the Minister draconian powers.  We debated aspects of them.  Like all draconian powers, they were circumscribed and limited to specific circumstances.  They were, by order, to declare an area or region in the State to be an area where there is known or thought to be sustained human transmission of Covid-19, or from which there is a high risk of importation of infection or contamination with Covid-19 by travel from that area.  When making such an order, under the section the Minister was required to have regard to the Chief Medical Officer.  On 7 April, having sought the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, the Minister declared that the State, being every area or region, was an area where there is known or thought to be sustained human transmission of Covid-19.  Exactly six weeks later, on 19 May, the Chief Medical Officer, sitting just behind where the Minister is now, told the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, "In broad terms, we have effectively extinguished it from the community in general, right across the country."</p>  <p>  On Tuesday, Dr. Cillian De Gascun and Professor Philip Nolan, both members of NPHET, accepted that there are areas in which there is neither known nor thought to be sustained human transmission of Covid-19 at present.  If that is the case, what is the basis in law or in fact for the existence of the affected areas order in respect of those specific areas, which the Minister made on 7 April and which forms the basis for further restrictions?  The Minister joked about Kerry and Sligo at the start of this session being areas where there has not been transmission for a long time.  Clare is another area where there has not been much transmission for a long time.  I accept that in a small country like Ireland, it is very difficult to differentiate one area from another, but merely because it is difficult to differentiate does not make it lawful to impose restrictions if the legal basis does not exist for those restrictions.  Has the Minister recently sought the advice of the Chief Medical Officer or the Attorney General for the ongoing restrictions, which state that in each and every area and region of this State, there is known or thought to be sustained human transmission of Covid-19?  If there is not sustained transmission, there is not, in my respectful view, a basis in law to maintain restrictions.</p>  <p>  I accept that there are distinctions between areas and this is very difficult in Ireland.  One of the most basis aspects of the rule of law is that public officials should exercise their powers in good faith and not exceed their powers.  It is very important that we are sure of that.  The Minister mentioned funerals and said the new regulations allow up to 25 people to go to a funeral.  I looked at those regulations, which are the Minister's regulations.  There is only one mention of the word funeral, and that is to allow persons who provide accommodation to accommodate people going to a funeral.  There is no restriction on any religious activity in these regulations.  I expect it is because any restriction on religious activity may be unconstitutional.  Public health is not a basis to restrict worship in Ireland.  In theory, we have always operated a separation of church and State in this country.  It is certainly provided for in the Constitution.  There are limitations on what a Government can do to interfere with worship in this State as provided for in the Constitution.  I urge the Minister to move away from laws which are unenforceable.  It slipped out into the media that the movement restrictions in these regulations are not, will not or cannot be enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Minister should move towards addressing the general health regime.  The Minister says help is available for people who have mental health issues.  In the mid-west, after 2 a.m., there is no crisis nurse in University Hospital Limerick to deal with mental health patients who arrive.  There is none at any time in Ennis.  During the general election, we had a boy who was moved from Ennis to Limerick and back, and went on social media, desperate for help.</p> <p>That situation has only been exacerbated by Covid-19.  The Minister knows this himself; I am not telling him something he does not know.  We desperately need to move into these areas.  There is a boy in Clare whose parents had to go to the High Court to get an order so that he would receive electroconvulsive therapy, ECT.  He has severe autism and needs this treatment to prevent his deterioration.  They got that order from the High Court on 23 April but they are still waiting.  I have not brought this to the Minister's attention previously but I will pass the specifics on to him.</p> <p> Lastly, we agree on the need to move our care for our elderly away from congregated settings in nursing homes and towards an alternative path of home care.  However, home care assistants have not been paid in respect of cancelled hours since the beginning of June. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100052#FFF00400"><p>I am pleased to update the House this afternoon.</p>  <p>  It is no secret that progress in the future partnership negotiations has been disappointing.  The fourth round, which finished last Friday, did not yield any significant progress.  The EU's approach to the talks is based on our published mandate and that mandate is underpinned by the political declaration agreed by the EU and the UK last October.  The political declaration sets out the shared ambitions of the UK and the EU for a comprehensive future partnership agreement.  This would be a partnership across a range of issues including a free trade agreement, FTA, on goods with zero tariffs and quotas.  It would be a partnership with robust level playing-field commitments which ensures open and fair competition and takes into account our economic connectedness and geographic proximity.  It is disappointing to see that the UK distanced itself from the declaration in areas such as fisheries and on level playing-field commitments on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change and relevant tax matters.  Furthermore, the UK is unwilling even to discuss areas set out in the political declaration like foreign policy or development co-operation.</p>  <p>  The political declaration is not an EU document nor is it some EU wish list.  This is a document the UK negotiated with the EU.  It is a document the British Government signed up to.  The UK is saying that it is only seeking what the EU has given to other partners and therefore cannot accept the EU's approach on issues like level playing field, governance and fisheries.  However, taken together, the UK's asks go considerably beyond precedent.  In a number of areas, their asks amount to maintaining some of the rights of the Single Market but without the obligations membership brings.  The EU has consistently recognised the UK's right to its own sovereignty.  We accept that there will be healthy competition between the EU and the UK.  However, it is in the interests of both sides that our future partnership is comprehensive with strong commitments to prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages.  We are a nation of traders.  Irish companies export to over 160 countries.  We are not afraid of robust competition but trade should be open and should be fair.  Openness and fairness are at the heart of our level playing-field provision.  The EU is simply asking the UK to meet our shared commitment to uphold common high standards and to avoid dumping.</p>  <p>  Fishing is another area of importance for this House and Members of this House.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, very clearly understands how vital the sector is for communities across the island.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, was one of a number of EU fisheries ministers who recently met Mr. Michel Barnier and reiterated their support for the mandate.  While it is now unlikely that a fisheries agreement will be concluded by 1 July, the EU has continued to seek a sustainable and balanced agreement.  I will continue engaging with UK ministers myself, as will the T&aacute;naiste, in order to convey these concerns and stress the importance of moving ahead and operationalising the protocol on Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  We live in an uncertain world.  Many would wish to see the transition period extended but in truth this is unlikely.  Publicly and privately, the UK is saying there will be no extension.  Without the extension, the transition period ends in less than seven months.  I am confident that the two sides can reach an agreement.  However, getting there will require follow-through on the commitments made under the political declaration and the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.  Everyone also needs to be aware that, whatever the outcome of these talks, Ireland&rsquo;s trading relationship with the UK will change.  Given the limited progress in negotiations to date and, separately, uncertainty due to Covid-19, the Government will now intensify its Brexit-preparedness work. </p> <p>We will base our approach on two scenarios: first a limited free trade agreement, FTA, in goods, with an accompanying fisheries agreement and second a hard Brexit, in which there is essentially no EU-UK trade deal.  This is not about admitting defeat, this is about risk management.  Ireland still supports the closet possible relationship between the EU and the UK, but we must be prepared.  We continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary for the reintroduction of controls at our ports and airports.  We are engaging with our partners to ensure that the UK land bridge remains an effective route to market and the Oireachtas will be asked to consider a new Brexit omnibus Bill, most likely in the autumn.  We will work with the business sector in preparation for new trading environments after the transition period ends.  Regardless of outcome there will be a substantial impact for supply chains and trade flows.  We will provide support for businesses that must address new customs, rules of origin, regulatory and SPS processes.  Businesses are of course finding the current competing demands from Covid-19 very difficult, but I would urge everybody to review and renew their Brexit plans and if they have not started to do so, to begin now.</p> <p> The Withdrawal Agreement and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland ensures that we will avoid a hard border on the island and that the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are protected and also the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland's place in it are safeguarded.  Full implementation of the agreement and the protocol is an EU priority and Ireland maintains close contact with the task force on this matter.  The Joint Committee and the Specialised Committees under the Withdrawal Agreement have met on one occasion each.  The Joint Committee will meet again tomorrow and Ireland will again be represented.  On 20 May the UK published its own approach to implementing the protocol.  The paper has some positive elements to it and I welcome the clear recognition of the need for checks on agri-foods entering Northern Ireland and for the new border control post infrastructure.  However, the paper is vague on other issues such as customs, tariffs and VAT.  What we need now is for the UK to provide the technical detail necessary to make the protocol fully operational by the end of the transition period at the end of the year.  Progress on implementation will provide certainty not just to citizens but also to business.  It will create the confidence that we need across the EU to try to build our future partnership.</p> <p> It is now time to take stock of the overall negotiations.  It is very clear from recent contacts with my EU counterparts that the EU remains united in our support for the Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier.  I believe that the two sides can reach an agreement, however it is still important for us to prepare for the changes that January will inevitably bring.</p> <p> Brexit is not just a business matter either.  Individuals need to understand how Brexit impacts their lives and so we will continue our public outreach to inform and advise citizens.  It is, however, worth reaffirming that the common travel area will be maintained in all circumstances.  The closest possible relationship between the EU and UK is clearly in Ireland's strongest interests and so too is a strong UK-Ireland relationship.  The high level of engagements around Covid-19 further highlighted to all of us the importance of working together.  I and our team remain committed to enhancing this relationship in all areas.  The Oireachtas approach to Brexit has been consistent across all parties.  We understood early on the challenges that Brexit would bring to this island.  As we face into the next phase this support remains vital.</p></speech>

Deputy Haughey for Fianna F&aacute;il is sharing with a number of colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100053#GGG00300"><p>That is correct.  I am going to ask three questions in two and a half minutes and hopefully the Minister of State can reply in that time.  A hard or no-deal Brexit is now looking increasingly likely.  This will have serious consequences for businesses and SMEs already struggling due to Covid-19.  There seem to be several disagreements between the EU and the UK in the negotiations.  These include the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, fisheries, level playing field provisions and the overall governance structure of the future relationship.  The assessment of Michel Barnier at the conclusion of round four of the negotiations 5 June was not very optimistic.  Every effort should be made, even at this late stage to try to persuade the UK to seek an extension of the transition period and I note what the Minister of State had to say in that regard.</p>  <p>  If there is no extension to the transition period, as looks likely, it is clear that the Oireachtas will be required to enact additional Brexit legislation.  Can the Minister of State confirm that a new Brexit omnibus Bill is being prepared?  Given that a significant amount of work will be needed across Government Departments on this, will she confirm that this matter is being given the urgency that it requires, so we can look forward to a new Brexit omnibus Bill?</p> <p>Second, what is the position concerning the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol?  This protocol is essential for the protection of the peace process, among other things.  Is the UK backsliding on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol?  As Michel Barnier said, we need to "move from aspiration to operation".  We all agree with that statement.  </p> <p> Third, what has been done to prepare vulnerable sectors of our economy, businesses, SMEs and individuals, for the disruption and change coming their way as a result of Brexit?  Is this work being given added impetus now that a hard Brexit is very much on the horizon?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100054#HHH00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and his brevity.  Regarding legislation, I confirm that drafting is being done on a new Brexit omnibus Bill.  Departments have highlighted that there will be a need to introduce or renew some legislation come 1 January next year, particularly if there is no deal.  That is why that has started.  We also brought a memorandum to the Cabinet two weeks ago, which has advised and asked all Departments to start engaging with their own industries and sectors, not just regarding new legislation but also further work or support that might be needed, based on the two scenarios I have outlined.  Some elements of the previous legislation can be enacted, but the vast majority of it was based on a no-deal scenario and that will need to be updated and amended.  My understanding, once we have a new Government in place, is that we will bring this legislation before the House.  We will then have an opportunity to debate it and, hopefully, pass it in time.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Northern Ireland protocol, I am not saying there is any backsliding.  However, what has been presented so far is not adequate and does not provide enough information.  It is very welcome that the UK has presented a paper.  It is also welcome that it has eventually been acknowledged that there will have to be some form of checks on goods going from Britain into Northern Ireland, particularly sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, and animal products.  As I mentioned earlier, however, there is not much in the paper regarding issues concerning customs, tariffs and VAT.</p>  <p>  Another issue we have highlighted, and that I have highlighted to many of my European colleagues, is the reference to the backstop being temporary.  As we know, the backstop will be there unless and until another mechanism is put in place.  That was agreed as part of the agreement in the context of the Northern Ireland protocol, so it is important that it is acknowledged that this is something that will be put in place, unless another mechanism is there to implement different measures.  </p>  <p>  Regarding what is being done to prepare businesses, we are in a difficult scenario at the moment with businesses very much focused on Covid-19.  That was relayed to us two weeks ago when we held the first Brexit stakeholders forum since the pandemic took over.  We are trying to get businesses to rethink and re-engage in respect of how prepared they are for Brexit.  The focus of businesses now, of course, is on surviving and not thriving.  In saying that, many businesses that will get back on track by the end of the year could be faced with new implications from a no-deal trade arrangement.  It is important, therefore, that businesses are aware of that prospect and that they start thinking of how that might impact on them.  </p>  <p>  It is also important, however, that much work was done before Covid-19.  Last year, more than 102,000 businesses were contacted by the Revenue and more than 65,000 now have an economic operators registration and identification, EORI, number, which is important in trading.  That represents approximately 95% of EU-UK trade.  In addition, many supports were also put in place, and while many of them have been repurposed for Covid-19, we know that with a new Government and a new budget on the way, more financial supports will have to be put in place.  </p></speech>

Given the backdrop of negative comments and analysis, we cannot, unfortunately, be confident of progress.  The findings in the recent report of the British think tank, The UK in a Changing Europe, refer to time being short, the gap between the two sides and the negative economic impact and ramifications of a no-deal outcome.</p>  <p>  On the specific issue of the Northern Ireland protocol, it was stated that there has been some progress by Britain in meeting its commitments to have the agreed arrangements up and running by the end of the year but, worryingly, it was also stated that there is still much detail to be clarified.</p> <p>Businesses, especially small businesses, will struggle to be ready.  Local businesses in my constituency and across the Border region are already struggling to survive.  We have seen them do outstanding work in recent days and weeks to get back to work and exit the lockdown while protecting as many jobs and livelihoods as possible.  Local communities have rallied to support local retailers and businesses by shopping local and supporting local producers.  This could all be washed away by a hard 31 December British crash-out that drags Northern Ireland out against its will, without necessary preparations by the Tory Government in Westminster.  The only hint of a plan that Prime Minister Johnson and his Government have is to do nothing, and hope the EU's attitude to the UK might change when Germany takes the EU Presidency.  It is not possible to overstate the scale of the damage that would follow a hard 31 December crash-out.  If the worst-case-scenario emerges, our region and communities effectively would be held hostage and used as leverage by a Tory party driven by Brexit madness.  This would not be the action of a good neighbour.  The Government needs to urgently and immediately prepare for the worst, to help businesses prepare for an economic shock, as my colleague Deputy Haughey referred to, and work closely with our colleagues in Northern Ireland to ensure we stand with businesses and communities on both sides of the Border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100055#JJJ00200"><p>If media coverage is anything to go by, many people would be forgiven for thinking that Brexit has gone away since the outbreak of Covid-19.  If anything, Covid-19 has proven that different governmental responses can have a profound impact on how these two islands connect, trade, operate, and indeed, survive.</p>  <p>  Some 40% of retail stores in Dublin city belong to UK retail chains.  Workers employed in these companies are at risk of cheaper operations and lower employment standards in the UK.  Of course, both we and the EU must protect our Single Market and its standards.  If the UK is allowed to pitch itself as a low-tax, low-wage economy with access to the Single Market, Irish workers will be in trouble.  We saw the different governmental responses to Debenhams workers with regard to Covid-19.  UK stores in some cases remained open but Irish stores closed.  We know that, in many ways, Debenhams used Covid-19 as an excuse to lay off its workers.  I urge the Government to continue its pressure on Debenhams and its shareholders to ensure workers are treated fairly.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Haughey said, Fianna F&aacute;il believes the UK should extend the transition period but it seems unwilling to do so.  If there is no extension, are we ready?  We cannot tolerate a hard border under any circumstances but equally, we cannot tolerate the dilution of the rights of workers and the industries they work in.  The Government must, and I pay credit to it for doing it, continue to hold the UK accountable for the promises it made in the withdrawal agreement, not least because of the Irish citizens in counties Tyrone, Fermanagh, Armagh, Down, Antrim and Derry.</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy we are doing everything to try to be ready to protect and work with businesses by putting supports in place to assist them through their own processes and by making sure we have the right infrastructure at our ports and airports and that the right officials are in place, as well as the legislation.</p>  <p>  We also are working with our colleagues within the European Commission because while there is work we can do here, there is a European-wide preparedness that needs to happen, particularly around the land bridge.  In that regard, we have presented a paper in France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium, as well as to our German colleagues.  </p>  <p>  A lot of work is ongoing.  Until we know exactly what the scenario looks like from the end of the year and how those measures need to be implemented, we will not know fully how to proceed.  Our focus is to try and get the best possible outcome and the best trade deal possible in order that we can negate any negative outcomes.</p></speech>

One of them is its "Sea for Yourself" campaign, which focuses on promoting fish and shellfish found in UK waters.  It is even going so far as to urge people to change their Friday-night fish and chips habits so they are eating locally-sourced battered Dover sole instead of battered cod; a very expensive alternative as I understand it.</p> <p>Brexit represents an existential threat to the fishing industry in Ireland and my county of Wexford.  It has the potential to be a hammer blow to an industry already reeling from Covid-19.  On average, 34% of Irish fishery landings are taken from UK waters and for some fishermen, the proportion is even higher.  The future for fishermen and their families is uncertain and their livelihoods are at serious risk.  Michel Barnier has said the UK is attempting to pick and choose the most attractive elements of the Single Market without the obligations.  Two weeks ago, it was reported that the Irish fishing industry could potentially see a significant slump in some fish quotas if the UK prevails in its ambitions in the Brexit fisheries negotiations.  Support needs to be sought from the EU to protect our fishermen's livelihoods.  Can the Minister of State provide an update on this?  Has she spoken to Michel Barnier and urged him not to give ground - or sea in this case - on the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100056#KKK00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will outline the Irish and EU approach to negotiations.  It is clear that if we are to make progress on an overall trade deal, progress must be made on fisheries.  It is an extremely important issue for us, other member states and the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who was a fisheries minister and has made every effort to engage with our sectors, industries and representative groups and those across all member states that will be impacted.</p>  <p>  Ireland's main goal and objective is to protect the interests of the Irish fleet, its access to British waters and the quota share it currently enjoys in those waters.  The overall EU position seeks to uphold continued levels of reciprocal access and stable quotas.  As the Deputy pointed out, the UK is taking a different approach.  It continues to stress it is a coastal independent state and seeks an agreement under which a new deal would be negotiated every year.  We hear that one of the reasons people voted for Brexit was to move away from red tape and these kinds of challenging issues, paperwork and having to negotiate so many deals.  The idea that a fishing deal would be negotiated every year does not make sense to me or much of the negotiating team.  We need the UK and EU to come together, use their best endeavours and try to conclude and ratify a new fisheries agreement by the end of this year.  We will do everything in our power to ensure that Irish interests are represented in that regard.</p></speech>

In fact, even if the EU seeks an extension, the UK will not agree to it.  Business are already suffering because of Covid-19 and a no-deal Brexit will be even more detrimental on the back of Covid-19.  Many of the supports and packages that were originally put in place have been repurposed to deal with struggling businesses under a Covid-19 arrangement.  I am conscious that the time will not allow the Minister of State to give me an answer now but I ask her to revert to me on what exactly her Department, in conjunction with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, is going to do for businesses that will be most adversely affected by a no-deal Brexit scenario and what supports will be available for them.  The supports required will need to be made available on much more favourable terms than those that have been provided for businesses struggling as a result of Covid-19.</p></speech>

We will take seven, four and four minutes, respectively.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that we live in an uncertain world.  That is certainly true but when it comes to Brexit, it feels more like Groundhog Day.  We are again seeing the British Government trying to have its cake and eat it when it comes to a future trade agreement.  It wants to be outside the club but enjoy all of the benefits.  We are going around having circular arguments on all these issues and all the while, the clock is ticking.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the possibility of an extension of the transition period.  A number of other Deputies have stated that is not something the British Government wants or that the European Union has called for.  There is uncertainty at play and Covid-19 has interrupted negotiations to some degree.  A majority of MLAs in the North have backed a motion for an extension to the transition period.</p> <p>The business Brexit group in the North, which represents 90% of the North's businesses, has itself called for an extension of the transition period.  They have cited a number of concerns, including a lack of technical detail, a lack of time to prepare and a lack of engagement with the British Government and others.  Bearing all of this in mind, has the Irish Government taken a position on an extension of the transition period?  Has it lobbied the EU and the British Government?</p> <p> The British Government has proposed an intensive session of negotiations in July on the basis of the current status of the four negotiating rounds, which means no agreement on substantive issues, including the level playing field, governance, fisheries, and judicial and policing co-operation, which would include the European courts as well.  It seems unlikely that the EU will agree to such an intensive session until the two sides are closer on all of those issues.  The Minister of State might give us the Government's position on the matter.  The clock is ticking and businesses are worried.  </p> <p> There is a more fundamental question, and I want to give the Minister of State time to respond.  There is growing concern about the British Government position.  Nobody knows if this is more of the sabre-rattling and gamesmanship that we have seen up to now.  There is a feeling that they are not as serious about finding an agreement as we and our European partners are.  We also know that the EU is stepping up its preparations for a no-deal outcome.  The Minister of State mentioned the possibility of a second Brexit omnibus Bill.  What was absent from that latest Bill and from all of the responses so far, for reasons I accept that the Government put on the table at the time, was what happens at the Border in such a scenario.  We need to know that now.  As the Minister of State said, it is seven months away.  What are the plans for the Border and what will the Government's response be in the context of a no-deal outcome, which we know is back on the table now as a live possibility?</p></speech>

As recently as today, I am informed that having looked at any other possible avenues, there is no way to extend it beyond 30 June.  It has to be done as set out through the withdrawal agreement.  Time is certainly ticking and we are not led to believe the UK will change its position on that.  It is welcome that the Executive in Northern Ireland and the Administrations in Scotland and Wales have, all three, sought an extension.  It is unfortunate that they potentially are not being listened to.  Our position is very clear and I think most European member states, if not all I have spoken to, would very much welcome an extension given the challenges we are facing not just on this but Covid also, as the Deputy said.</p>  <p>  On the British Government's proposing intensive discussions, there is a high-level meeting due to take place at the European Council next week.  Because of Covid-19, the focus will very much be on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the next generation fund, which is being proposed.  My understanding is that the Presidency, which is now under the chairmanship of our Croatian colleagues, will be very much focused on agreeing these issues, as the German Presidency will be.  My understanding is that we will have a high-level meeting with the UK towards the end of this month but beyond that, the timeframe for July is yet to be decided.  Obviously we would like to get as much discussion in as soon as possible but there are other items on the agenda as well.  It is important that the UK acknowledges that as well.  </p>  <p>  As to whether the British are serious, the Northern Ireland protocol has been agreed.  It is a legal document.  It has been signed off on.  What we want to see and what needs to happen between now and the end of the year, separate from any free trade agreement, is for the UK to come forward with further detail.  It is welcome that they have brought forward some form of detail, however it is still lacking in many areas, as I have outlined previously, including VAT and other structures, particularly on SPS goods or animal products coming into Northern Ireland through mainland UK.</p></speech>

The EU is stepping up its preparations for a no-deal outcome.  I referred to the second omnibus Bill.  People will be concerned about what will happen at the Border.  We have not had clarity on that from the Irish Government yet.  In the minute she has left, the Minister of State might be able to provide some clarity.</p></speech>

We expect the UK to fulfil its obligations.  We spent two and a half, if not three, years negotiating an agreement which ensures that we do not have to reintroduce any infrastructure at the Border.  This means we can protect the Good Friday Agreement and the progress we have made in co-operation North and South and between Ireland and the UK in protecting the Single Market.  It is clear that it is now about implementing the withdrawal agreement.  The preparation that the EU is talking about is for a no trade deal outcome.  That is what we are focused on.  Now is the time for the UK to bring forward further detail.  I understand that tomorrow's meeting is only an hour long and the discussion will not only cover the Northern Ireland protocol, but also citizens' rights.  We will have to wait and see how much can be dealt with tomorrow but we still need them to do a great deal of work.</p></speech>

However, I come from north Louth where, with south Armagh, there is not a great level of, shall we say, respect for the British Government or trust in it what it will do.  That leads to certain difficulties.  Everyone is very worried about the trade impacts if the Irish protocol does not come into operation and if we do not have mitigation.  Hard border infrastructure is also a worry.  In recent years, there has been activity on Forkhill mountain, where there was once a major British army installation that was an absolute eyesore.  When some of the bases were removed, what some would term surveillance equipment - telecommunications equipment, cameras and whatever - remained and it is still very secure.  I visited the site today with a councillor from south Armagh to see it with my own eyes.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this matter to the attention of the British Government so that we can find out exactly what this activity involves.  For three days last week, there was a significant amount of activity by police and others in civilian-type vans.  That also happened in October.  At the time, a Sinn F&eacute;in representative who was dealing with the policing board was told that British army engineers had visited the site.  We would like to know what exactly is going on.  While I am not saying the British Government and British army will give that information, we wish to put the matter on the record.  I want people to be concerned about what will happen in the Border region when we cannot rule out that Britain will crash out of the EU.  I can provided additional information but I ask the Minister of State to bring this matter to whatever forum she can to try to get answers from the British Government.  In addition, plans are needed for how Ireland would respond in the event of a hard border, which would be an absolute disaster.  Sinn F&eacute;in's long-term solution for our interaction with the British Administration on this island will come as no surprise to anyone.</p></speech>

That is why we fought so hard to ensure the Northern Ireland protocol was agreed.  It has been agreed and it is an international peace treaty.  I would like to think the UK would not turn its back on an international peace treaty when it is looking to forge new relationships and sign similar documents with other countries around the world.  The UK has committed to the agreement and is saying it wants to implement it.  We are saying that the information it has given to date does not go far enough.  It is very clear what needs to be done.  We need the UK to provide that information so that it can be implemented at the end of the year.  We will not countenance any kind of reintroduction of a border on this island.</p></speech>

I wish to raise one particular sector, which is the tourism sector, and its vulnerability to a no-deal Brexit or a bad-deal Brexit and its fears of being plunged into what would be essentially an economic abyss.  One individual described it to me as a perfect storm that they are not entirely convinced that they can face or survive.  What plans has the Department put in place in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure that this sector and those sectors indirectly associated it will be insulated in the event of a bad Brexit or a no-deal Brexit?</p>  <p>  Britain accounted for almost a third of holidaymakers on the island of Ireland in 2018 and of all our markets, they are the ones that are most likely to holiday in off-peak months.  It is clear that they do not mind our climate.  It is something they are very familiar with and something that draws them here.  However, they are also active visitors and that is why Longford-Westmeath is in such a predicament.  They are culturally curious.  They explore our historical sites and they engage with multiple activities while they are here.  In the midlands in 2017, some 2,018 tourists spent &euro;85 million, 93,000 holidaymakers spent &euro;27 million, and 15,000 trips from the North equated to &euro;4 million in spending.  This is a huge market in the midlands.</p>  <p>  Tourism operators tell me that initially when they encouraged tourists to go to the midlands, they were more inclined to go to Galway, Cork or Dublin but when they bring tourists to Longford-Westmeath they are smitten.  They fall under the charm of an area that is absolutely unique and offers a great variety of heritage, activities, history and culture.  Whether it is the stunning beauty of the Shannon, equestrian events or water sports, they discover that the centre of this country is a precious gem.  The majority of these British tourists come back time and time again and they bring their friends and families.</p>  <p>  Despite the good efforts and the work that has been done in promoting tourism in my area it is in a very precarious position.  It has enormous potential to continue expanding as a destination in its own right but a bad Brexit or a no-deal Brexit would profoundly impact tourism growth across Longford-Westmeath.  In addition, there are the jobs that go with that and the add-on economics that come into our little towns and villages.  We need policies that will mitigate the adverse consequences of our largest tourism market leaving the EU.  Have the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport been in contact with our colleagues in Stormont to ensure that these priorities and others that have been put forward are discussed and that a united position is proposed that enables the entire tourism sector on this island to have the best chance to thrive and to remain profitable for the foreseeable future?</p>  <p>  This vital sector has expressed to me its opinion that tourism is not being treated with the same urgency and importance as other sectors of the economy.  It says the Government and State agencies responsible for the development of the agrifood sector and manufacturing have produced programmes and business supports that have made additional funding available to mitigate the challenges that they face, yet tourism appears to have been left behind in terms of strategic and practical support frameworks.  Will the Minister of State indicate the overarching tourism support policy aimed at dealing with the consequences of Brexit, to equip those in the tourism sector to meet and be prepared for the challenges that they will most certainly face?</p></speech>

As a people we have always held a special attachment to home and many of our people have returned home during this crisis.</p>  <p>  As a new Deputy, I am inspired by the incredible work of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State in response to Brexit and our approach to negotiations.  Mayo, as with many other counties, has significant ties with the UK, be it through family, friends, enterprise and aviation links between our two islands.  Thankfully, a joint commitment to the common travel area has been reaffirmed and we have good clarity going forward.</p> <p>As the Minister may be aware, Ireland West Airport Knock has temporarily suspended operations due to Covid-19.  I am looking forward to this crucial facility reopening as soon as possible but I should point out that many of the airport's high-volume routes are to the UK.</p> <p> I mention our airport as, typically, at this time of year, many Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la would experience an influx of passport-related requests.  I acknowledge the passport express service is widely available through post offices and the passport online application process is making strong use of modern technology.  However, I feel there is added pressure on people in Connacht who may require emergency passport applications due to bereavement or emergencies overseas.  For obvious reasons, the passport offices in Dublin and Cork are much quieter this summer compared to other years.  Nonetheless, as the number of applicants will pick up in future, I wish to ask the Minister whether any thought has been given to opening a passport office in the western region.  Ideally, a new passport office would serve travellers from Ireland West Airport Knock, as well as Shannon Airport.</p> <p> In addition, as I mentioned, the wider western region has a high reliance on the agriculture and fisheries sector.  I also would appreciate it were the Minister of State to provide an update on Brexit and the EU-Mercosur trade agreements.  The latter is an issue constantly being brought up by many farmers I speak to and their local representative bodies.</p></speech>

First, in response to the Deputy's question about the additional offices, maybe that is something I could come back to him on.  As Members will be aware, our passport offices have been closed except for emergency passports that are bring processed at the moment.  As of this week, our online passport facility has been opened.  There is a backlog that the officials are working on.  As of this week, we have 520 staff who are now back working to try to process those as quickly as possible.  As the Deputy can imagine, for any Department or company, that is a huge amount of people.  We are thankful for them and for the work that they are doing.  I certainly will come back to the Deputy on the specific question.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Mercosur deal, this is obviously something that has been ongoing for some time.  We and all other member states are now examining the agreement that was reached.  This will take some time to see the implications, not only for the agricultural sector but for all other industries as well.  We will come back with our own response and reflections on that as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I suppose we have been talking <i>ad nauseam</i>about Brexit for nearly five years.  It came as a huge shock to people in the UK, as well as in this country and around Europe.  When the people voted in the United Kingdom for Brexit, it was a sovereign decision of the United Kingdom.  The then Government was anxious that we could influence Irish citizens who were voting there that it was in our best interests for the United Kingdom to stay.  Unfortunately, due to various promises and miscalculations, as well as misinformation, the people voted but that was their decision.  It has a knock-on effect that we must mitigate against.  I wish that the United Kingdom would stay in the EU and perhaps that can happen.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and all the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the work they have done to try to mitigate those issues.</p><p>I remember the first time we in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were asked what we thought of Brexit.  I always said that we looked on Brexit as the British accidentally shooting themselves in our foot and that is exactly what is happening.  It has a knock-on effect on this country.</p><p>I note the ardent Brexiteer Nigel Farage is leaving the talk show on LBC with immediate effect.  He has been three years on LBC.  He has been working there five days a week, talking about the Brexit position.  It reminds me of the live prank of a man named Mark, who phoned in to the Nigel Farage show and said he was an ardent remainer, he believed in the European project and believed that staying in the European Union was best for the UK.  Then something monumental happened.  Nodding, Mr. Farage asked Mark what happened and Mark responded.  He said, &quot;I was kicked in the head by a horse.&quot;</p> <p>That is, effectively, what has happened to our country.  We are suffering from concussion, having been effectively kicked in the head by a horse.  It is not so funny for Ireland, however, because we have to deal with the implications.  The Good Friday Agreement was not even talked about in the referendum campaign and now the island of Ireland is coming back under discussion.  The island and the Good Friday Agreement were not discussed, and now the issues of the island of Ireland and the Border are coming back to haunt us.</p> <p> I am conscious of the Minister of State's time and the energy she has put in.  What are her views on what is happening now or will happen in the coming weeks and months?</p></speech>

There is a huge volume of work to be done, and it is very disappointing that after four rounds of negotiations, we seem to have made little progress.  We need to remain focused.  As an EU 27, we need to remain strong with our mandate and that which has been given to Michel Barnier, and stick to the political declaration, as agreed by the UK.  In case that does not translate into a future trading relationship, we need to ensure we are prepared as much as possible.  We will ensure, therefore, that over the next few months, every effort is made not just to try to reach an agreement but also to ensure that if that is not the case, we will be as prepared as we can be.</p>  <p>  We need to remain optimistic and to do everything we can to try to reach an agreement, but time is running out and we need to be realistic.  The shorter the time we have, the more difficult it will become.</p></speech>

Whatever happens, I hope those friendships - cross-party, North-South and east-west - will be maintained.  The implementation of the Good Friday Agreement happened in this House and I thank Deputy Crowe for his leadership during the negotiations.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge the work done by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We need to have more engagements and political interaction like that assembly, the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association and the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

At every stage where it was possible, I have highlighted the need, not just in a European recovery fund but also in the next MFF for flexibility and room to be able to respond to the challenge of Brexit.  A few other member states have also raised the matter consistently.  There should be enough room within not just the &euro;1.1 trillion that has been put forward as the next MFF but also the &euro;750 billion recovery fund.</p></speech>

It is estimated that 80% or 90% of the UK's environmental laws and regulations emanate from EU directives, which were significantly stronger than many of the steps the UK had taken before that.  The British Parliament is currently dealing with an environment Bill to replace many of the EU directives.  As we have discussed and seen, there has been quite a bit of backsliding by the UK on many of its commitments, particularly the level playing field approach.</p> <p>The reality is that this will affect environmental regulation quite significantly.  The UK environment Bill does not have a no-recession clause, opening up the prospect of further backsliding and further unlevelling of the playing field regarding environmental law and how it will affect both countries.</p> <p> The reality is that we on this island have a homogenous and inseparable ecosystem.  Whatever happens with a border, be it hard or soft, the rivers, other waterways and nature do not really respect it and do what they want.  Damage done on one side will leak over and affect the other.  It will undermine the level playing field.</p> <p> Last year at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, Ms Alison Hough, representing the environmental pillar, called for island-wide regulation and cross-border environmental regulation.  Obviously, if there are to be difficulties with the UK holding up its end of the deal it has already signed and if there is to be backsliding regarding the level playing field, they will be problematic.  I would love to hear from the Minister of State our position and that of the EU on ensuring effective cross-Border regulation of the environment and on the protection of the homogenous and inseparable island-wide ecosystem.</p></speech>

Environmental issues in the fight against climate change should play an important role in the negotiations.  I refer in particular to how we are to address the need for the level playing field.  It has to be central to any future partnership agreement.  This is something all member states have said time and again.  The political declaration already agreed by the EU and UK provides a very clear vision as to how the level playing field could address a future relationship.  It is clear that the provisions are designed to try to prevent a distortion of trade and unfair competitive advantages and to ensure we have a sustainable and long-lasting relationship in this context.  The political declaration explicitly refers to environmental standards and climate change as areas that need to be covered in this.  What we want to see are strong protections for environmental standards.  We believe the partnership we are trying to negotiate should reflect that the EU and UK share a common biosphere.  With respect to cross-Border pollution, we have been very strong on this, and we have tried to make sure in every step of the process, be it in negotiating the Northern Ireland protocol or in determining what happens next, that representatives of the environmental pillar are around the table with us and fully aware of what we are doing.  We are aware of the work that needs to be done.</p>  <p>  In the fight against climate change, we have tried to ensure the partnership will firmly reaffirm both parties' commitments to various international agreements, particularly the Paris Agreement.  We want to see effective relationships in place regarding carbon pricing and emissions trading.  It appears, however, that the UK has much lower ambitions in this area.  When it comes to a level playing field, the UK is saying consistently that it is not going to lower its standards.  At the same time, it does not seem to want to come to the table to agree a minimum standard.  Obviously this is where there are difficulties.  Our position remains that there needs to be a strong and effective arrangement in place when it comes to environment and climate issues.  This is very clearly reflected already in the EU's legal mandate.  A lot of work has been done.  The outline is very clear.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Northern Ireland protocol, we expect it will be implemented as agreed.  That will, in effect, address the North&ndash;South issues also.</p></speech>

I am anxious this afternoon to allow the Minister of State time to expand on her views on the exact position in the Brexit talks.  I seek her personal assessment.  There is a public face but it is now really crunch time for informing the House what she has discerned on the likely outcomes of the talks.</p>  <p>  For years since the UK vote, we have been absorbed across this island in preparing our economy and people for whatever will result from the people's vote in the UK to exit the European Union.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we know the current UK Government has the most extreme views on what the Brexit vote was to mean.  It is much more extreme than the people who voted for Brexit intended.  It also has the most hostile views to the institutions of the EU itself, which filters out in its utterances.</p> <p> Covid-19 has meant our focus on the oncoming end-of-year and end-of-transition period has greatly diminished for obvious and understandable reasons.  Meanwhile, the UK seems to have reverted to the original "have your cake and eat it" demand.  Despite the last minute agreement at the end of last year, including the political declaration we thought was a solution, the UK has now reverted to what is, in essence, a demand for quota-free and tariff-free access to our Single Market without any adherence to the governing rules of that market, which of course is demonstrably impossible.</p> <p> During the previous debate on Brexit, the T&aacute;naiste did not accept my pessimism - I would love to be dissuaded of it - about the likelihood of a no-deal result at the end of this year.  I have a number of questions for the Minister of State and I would like to come back in after she answers, so I ask her to be as succinct as possible.  What is her current assessment of the negotiations and how does she see them unfolding?  She gave a brief answer when she said she was optimistic but in truth what are her thoughts on what is happening and likely to happen?</p> <p> She referenced the announced Covid-19 supports through the Next Generation EU fund.  This is the &euro;750 billion to "repair and prepare the next generation", according to the European Commission.  Ireland and Belgium have asked for the Brexit considerations to be taken into account; this is instead of what I understand is simply a snapshot of our economic performance before Covid-19.  Where are we in that regard and is it true that the allocation from the &euro;750 billion earmarked for us is &euro;3 billion?  How much of that is to be a direct grant from the total grant of &euro;310 billion and how much is to be a loan from the total of &euro;250 billion that will be made available for loans?</p> <p> My third question relates to fisheries.  Will fisheries in all eventualities and circumstances remain part of the general trade discussions?  Will the Minister of State give an assurance to the House that Ireland will not allow it to be detached and negotiated separately?</p> <p> Fourth, in preparing for Brexit, will the Government ensure capital through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is available to prepare us to overcome the obvious barriers that will exist with land bridge UK?  In particular we must ensure a better direct access point from ferry points like Rosslare Europort to continental ports in order to relieve the pressure on the European land bridge.</p> <p> I might add a fifth question.  The Minister of State spoke about a paper being prepared on the topic of the land bridge but I had not heard that previously.  Will she provide us with access to that paper?</p></speech>

With respect to my view on where we are and saying I am optimistic, I am optimistic an agreement can be reached by the end of the year but I am not optimistic that it can be as close and comprehensive as we would like it to be.  That is based on the fact that after four rounds of negotiations, little progress has been made.  We must be realistic.  The EU must be strong in the mandate we have set out, based on an agreement that has been reached and signed by the UK.</p> <p>I am optimistic that we can reach an agreement but I am not as optimistic that it can be at the level and the quality that we would wish.</p> <p> In terms of the &euro;750 billion, we are still analysing the breakdown and what that means for us.  Obviously, it is very welcome.  We had sought an ambitious programme that would be a mixture of loans and grants, which would be targeted to get to not just the member states but the industries that specifically needed it.  In that regard, we welcome it but we have questions.  The Deputy mentioned the allocation.  The allocation method is specifically based on a snapshot of a pre-Covid environment.  If the Deputy looks at our economy in January and our economy now, he will see two very different pictures.</p></speech>

In discussions with my European colleagues I have flagged our concern about the allocation method and the fact that it is clearly a screenshot of a much healthier looking economy or environment than where we are now.  As I said, we have specifically raised the need for that flexibility to respond to any Brexit scenario or shock later this year and I believe that has been taken into account.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy in terms of fisheries.  Two weeks ago, when Michel Barnier came before the committee, the Minister, and all other fisheries ministers agreed that we cannot, and should not, stray from the mandate that was given that fisheries remain firmly part of the overall discussions and the overall trade deal and that without progress on fisheries, there cannot be progress on an overall trade deal and <i>vice versa</i>.  That is our position and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine made that very clear at the most recent meeting.</p><p>In terms of connectivity, first and foremost, our priority is to try to make sure that there is an agreement in place in respect of the land bridge.  The fact that the UK has agreed to accept the common transit convention is extremely helpful.  It means that goods coming from mainland Europe to Ireland will, hopefully, be able to pass through much quicker without having to go through the ins and outs of normal checks.  At the same time, it is important that we have more direct routes.  The <i>MV W.B. Yeats</i>- I always get the names mixed up - the largest roll-on-roll-off ferry, was added last year in addition to two more routes that were added.  We are consistently trying to increase our capacity but if more is needed later on this year, depending on what happens, we are in constant contact with the various ferry companies to see where we could expand.  Some of the direct routes will work for business and industries.  Some of them will not, and that is the reason the land bridge is equally as important.</p></speech>

It is a separate issue entirely but one that was raised earlier today and I want to put it to a Minister from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The whole country is focused on an issue that arose with the Kinahan organisation sponsoring an international boxing tournament.  The Taoiseach has said that official representations had been made to the Government of the United Arab Emirates to stop that.  If the Minister of State has the time, she might outline exactly what representations have been made and the response that has been got to date.</p></speech>

One of the concerns we had about the previous omnibus Bill, for a very understandable reason, was that such a large, comprehensive Bill was very late coming to us.  If, as the Minister has said, this Bill is already in drafting, presumably, heads have been prepared.  Could those heads be circulated to the Opposition parties so that we can be prepared for it?</p></speech>

That is serious.  It is my view that the strategy of the UK in this process has always been to run down the clock to ensure that a comprehensive agreement cannot be reached.  They do not want a comprehensive, quality agreement on a level playing field that would ensure protection of workers' rights and environmental standards.  That was one of the points of Brexit from their point of view.  The situation that they have effectively engineered is suiting their interests.  They want a minimal agreement and as little time as possible in which to conclude that.  That is the position we are in at the moment.</p> <p>I will ask three separate questions.  Two relate to the Northern Ireland protocol.  On that issue, weak implementation of the protocol poses a risk.  It could affect the integrity of our produce and goods and have an impact on us.  The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, recently said that the UK continues to backtrack on the commitments it has undertaken.  Is the Minister of State of the view that this applies to the Northern Ireland protocol?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100065#TTT00200"><p>While I am not saying it is impossible, I am not as optimistic that we will secure the close and comprehensive deal we would like.  I would not say that the UK is backtracking on what has been agreed but we have not seen enough information thus far to know that the protocol can be fully implemented.  I certainly welcome the fact that the UK has published a paper and that it has said that there will need to be checks on certain goods moving into Northern Ireland from the UK.  I welcome the progress that has been made in other areas and the focus on the infrastructure needed in the North.  At the same time, I am concerned about wording which refers to the protocol as being temporary and about the paper potentially being more targeted at individual domestic audiences.  We now need further detail to be sure that the protocol can be fully implemented by the end of the year.  I do not think the UK is backtracking.  It has given a very clear commitment to Northern Ireland, to the peace process and to the implementation of this protocol.  We fully accept that but we now need to see further detail from the UK in order that we can be sure this can be implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100065#TTT00300"><p>It has been said that the Achilles heel of the Northern Ireland protocol is that it is to be implemented by the UK.  That is one of its key weaknesses.  On this issue, in the paper the UK has published it has sought to revise the text already agreed in respect of the Northern Ireland protocol.  It has changed the language used so that instead of referring to goods which are "at risk" of entering the EU market it refers to goods that are at "a genuine and substantial risk" of doing so.  That is a very significant change.  Goods which are at risk of entering the EU Single Market through Ireland can be very broadly defined and effectively include everything except finished consumer goods, which one can be sure will go to a supermarket in Northern Ireland.  Goods which pose a genuine and substantial risk of doing so means something very different.  The UK is therefore seeking to revise the text.  Does the Minister of State agree that there can be no dilution of the protocol which has already been agreed?  Is the new wording used by the UK, which seeks to revise the text already agreed in respect of the Northern Ireland protocol from "risk" to "genuine and substantial risk", acceptable to the Irish Government?  Is this attempt to reword the protocol already agreed acceptable?  How can we be 100% confident that the protocol will hold in the event of a no-deal Brexit given the UK's attempts to redefine it?</p></speech>

It is not open to reinterpretation or change; it is there to be implemented.  The protocol goes into great detail as to what needs to be done and as to how it can be implemented to ensure that not only the integrity of the Single Market is protected, but also relations on this island.  The UK has presented this paper as an initial position.  It is not set in stone and, as I have said, it will not necessarily be the final document.  The final document is the protocol that was agreed last year.  Neither we nor the Commission will accept any rewording, renegotiation or reinterpretation.  The joint committee has been put in place to oversee implementation, not to change the protocol in any way, shape or form.  We are very clear on that.  The wording is agreed.  How it is to be implemented is very clearly set out in a legal document.  It is now a matter of implementing it.</p></speech>

I appreciate that, if we do end up in a no-deal situation, the protocol will remain in place.</p> <p>However, if the UK Government is trying to revise it, are we in a situation where we are quite exposed with the Northern Ireland protocol and the consequences that can have for us with regard to the integrity of our produce and goods and the integrity of the Single Market?  Does the Minister of State not accept that the UK's attempts to change the wording from &quot;at risk&quot; to goods where there is a &quot;genuine and substantial risk&quot;, which in technical terms is a clear difference, is an attempt at backtracking?<br/><br/>I have a final question after the Minister of State replies.</p></speech>

As to any attempt, if that is what it is, I am not saying that is what it is.  The UK has said it is committed to implementing the Northern Ireland protocol in full.  We are very clear how that can be done and what needs to be done to do that.  This is a document produced by the UK.  It is not the document that was agreed.  There is a clear legal document as to how this can be implemented and we now need the UK to do that.  Any attempt to reword, renegotiate or reinterpret what has already been agreed will not be accepted by Ireland or the EU.</p></speech>

That is an acceptable summation in that regard.  My summation of that is the UK's attempt to backtrack on the Northern Ireland protocol will not be accepted by the Irish Government.  They are my words, not the Minister of State's.</p>  <p>  There are media reports that Brexit will not be discussed in detail at the European Council on 19 June.  Given the critical importance and the fact that negotiations are not going well, can the Minister of State confirm that it will be discussed in detail and that the Government is pushing for that?</p></speech>

However, Michel Barnier will brief the General Affairs Council, which I and the T&aacute;naiste will attend next week, and there is also to be a high level conference or meeting with the UK by the end of this month, separate to any European Council meeting.  There certainly will be a meeting this month but it is unlikely to be discussed at the European Council.  There will be an engagement but it will be later this month.</p></speech>

He stated that the Attorney General's advice is that it is not compatible with EU law.  That is very refutable.

I thank her for her honesty and candour in keeping us updated with the truth, regardless of how unpalatable it may actually be.</p><p>On the UK land bridge, obviously every Member will be aware that the most efficient way to move goods from Ireland to continental Europe is via the UK land mass.  It is encouraging and welcome that the UK looks like it will agree to a kind of a fast-track system where sealed Irish freight containers could move through the UK quickly with a minimum of fuss on to France and beyond.  My big concern, one that many people share, is the bottleneck that will happen in Dover.  On 1 or 2 January next year, there will be total gridlock there.  It has the potential to undermine this trade route for Irish business.</p><p>Following on from Deputy Howlin's comments, how much progress has been made in identifying shipping routes and shipping capacity from this island directly to the Continent?  The Minister of State referred to the <i>MV W.B. Yeats</i>.  How many routes will be available?  How many ships will be involved?  Does she have specific details?  If she does, it would be great to get them.</p></speech>

As the Deputy mentioned, the UK's accession to the Convention on common transit is welcome.  That will allow EU goods and Irish goods to transit through the UK without undergoing many of the customs import and export formalities on entry to and exit from the UK.  This issue is discussed regularly.  We have presented a paper to our colleagues in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark to try to ensure that we have a functioning mechanism in place when the goods land on mainland Europe, such that they can pass through as quickly as possible.  We cannot predict what will happen between Dover and Calais or at the Eurotunnel, but we will engage with our UK colleagues to try to ensure that there is as effective a route as possible.</p><p>With regard to the overall progress and work being done to try to secure other access routes, I mentioned the<i>MV W.B Yeats</i>, but we also have two Brexit-buster ships, which were launched last year between Dublin and Rotterdam, and Dublin and Zeebrugge.  These ships were added as well as the <i>MV W.B. Yeats</i>.  We will continue to engage with the shipping companies, industry stakeholders and hauliers to make sure that there is additional capacity where they need it.  One has to take into account that some of these ships operate for 20 hours, 40 hours or 60 hours, and if there are perishable goods, whether food, flowers and so on, the longer trip will not work, so that is where the land bridge is most important.  We continuously engage with EU colleagues and we will work with the UK to try to ensure that we have as quick a route as possible and that the land bridge works as effectively as possible.</p></speech>

My second question relates to Brexit infrastructure in Ireland.  Most people will accept that the UK has a lot to improve on with regard to facilities from 1 January next year.  That is beyond our control because it is the UK's prerogative.  What is within our control is the facilities, be it port or airport facilities, that we have in Ireland.  Will the Minister of State outline how much investment and development has taken place over the past 12 months to get our ports and airports Brexit-ready?  What are the plans for the next seven months to make sure that we are Brexit-ready on 1 January next year?</p></speech>

It is probably one of the most visual elements of the preparations that we have done over the past while.  Significant work has gone in to preparing us for a no-deal Brexit and for the fact that Brexit will mean change, even with a comprehensive future relationship.  Work is complete on a number of facilities in Dublin Port, including 24 inspection bays, an additional Revenue turnaround shed, eight seal, check and transit booths, parking for 128 HGVs, and a live animal border control post.  Work is ongoing on a number of additional projects, including alterations to existing facilities, and at some additional sites.  There is a plan for a new site that covers an area of approximately 5.4 ha.  It includes inspection facilities for customs, SPS, and health checks, import and export offices, and some 250 additional HGV parking bays.  A step was taken today where the OPW published a notice that it is lodging an environmental impact assessment with An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding these additional sites in Dublin Port.</p>  <p>  Work on a border control post at Rosslare Europort is complete, with 38 HGV parking spaces, two seal, check and transit lanes for inspection bays, a Revenue turnaround shed, an export office and other offices.  Much is done but work is continuing to try to enhance the live animal border control post inspection facilities that have been put in place.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that work is complete at Dublin Airport, including the border control post facility with seven inspection rooms.  We have ambient chilled and freezer storage areas and office accommodation for 20 staff.  Substantial work has been done, with significant investment and building, and staff who will be needed to manage these being hired.  Work is still ongoing and the objective is to try to get this work finished as quickly as possible.  Covid-19 has created a challenge for us in this regard but anything that cannot be put in place permanently will of course be put in place temporarily by the end of this year as work continues.</p></speech>

We know that the issue of fisheries will be a major bone of contention between the EU and UK negotiating teams.  If we can agree a fisheries protocol, it will probably be cobbled together at the last minute.  The Irish Naval Service will be the people who monitor, enforce and police that agreement.  I am concerned by this because last week the Minister of State with responsibility for defence agreed that two of our naval ships, approximately a quarter of our fleet, are in Cork Harbour unable to put to sea for want of sailors.  Still more worrying was the confirmation by the Minister of State that 45 sailors, the equivalent of a ship's company, had prematurely retired in the first five months of this year.  This will place huge pressure on our ability to monitor and police this fisheries agreement.  I totally appreciate that this is probably outside the Minister of State's area of speciality, but if she or the T&aacute;naiste could provide a written answer to my question, I would greatly appreciate it.  Does the outgoing Government - and will the incoming Government - recognise, the urgency of the situation in the Naval Service, and can remedial action be taken as soon as possible?</p></speech>

It is strange to hear the word "Brexit" now when we are so used to hearing about Covid.  We have had a dose of Brexit for God knows how long.  We had Brexit for breakfast, dinner and supper but now we have Covid-19.  I am glad to get the chance to ask the Minister of State what actions are being taken behind the scenes and what support we are getting from our so-called friends in Europe.  The Taoiseach made great play of the backstop more than two years ago.  What is really happening?  Farmers, business people and shopkeepers have all been hugely affected by Covid-19.  Brexit is simmering away beneath the surface all the time.  It is as though the gas range under the kettle has been turned down but not turned off.  It will be reignited, which will have a huge impact on the economy, especially agriculture and exports.</p>  <p>  What engagement has the Minister of State had with the farming organisations in the South?  Has she had any engagement with similar organisations in the North?  Has she had any contact with the new organisation, the Independent Farmers of Ireland, which seems to be the one that really wants to represent farmers?  To be frank, some of the other farming organisations are a bit too close to the Government.  They have been that way for several years.  The same is true for many of the trade unions.  It is a big merry-go-round.  The people who those organisations are meant to represent are not represented at all.  Has the Minister of State had any engagement with farming and trade organisations in Northern Ireland?  What engagement has she had with the Irish Road Haulage Association?  This organisation represents a very important part of our infrastructure, responsible for moving our goods from Ireland to places all over the world.</p>  <p>  The previous speaker mentioned ports.  It is very important that they are ready.  This is not the Minister of State's area, but my constituency is affected by the N24 project running from Limerick to Waterford.  That project has been shelved.  It is vital for several reasons, including connectivity from Shannon Foynes Port in Limerick to Rosslare Europort.  It is a hugely important piece of infrastructure.  It will be more important than ever when Brexit happens.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would answer those questions about engagement and preparation.  What funding are we receiving from Europe to beef up our preparations?  </p>  <p>  Deputy Berry mentioned something about which we have known for a long time.  The Minister of State might say that it is not her area but that of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  The Army has been totally abandoned and so has the Naval Service, as Deputy Berry has rightly pointed out.  We have vessels but we have no one to operate them.  It is a shocking situation when one considers our fisheries and the defence of our national sovereignty.</p></speech>

As has been outlined by many people today, several sectors are most likely to be hardest hit by Brexit and are already feeling the implications of Brexit and the uncertainty that surrounds it.  The farming community is probably the most likely to be hardest hit, particularly if there is no trade deal and there is an imposition of tariffs and additional costs and challenges in trading with the UK.  Acknowledging that, throughout this process we have tried to ensure we have engaged with all the farming and fisheries representative groups to ensure that not only do they understand the work we are doing, but that we are taking information back from those groups regarding the measures we are putting in place, whether through the Departments or regarding our requests at a European level, and that we are getting that information right.  There is a constant two-way flow of information and engagement and we will continue that throughout this process until the end of the year, and well into next year and beyond.</p>  <p>  We have already put significant financial supports in place through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the past three budgets.  That acknowledged that farmers, and beef farmers in particular, are already being hit hard.  We will continue in that vein, but it is for a new Government, and a new budget this year, to provide further assistance.  </p>  <p>  One thing I have done consistently at a European level at every opportunity at the General Affairs Council, particularly when discussing the next European budget, is to raise the need for and significance of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, being maintained at current levels.  What is positive and welcome is that in the new MFF, of &euro;1.1 trillion and the next generation fund, an additional &euro;15 billion has been allocated to Pillar 2 of the CAP.  We are still examining what that means for us but there is constant engagement and we are very conscious our farmers will need additional support and we will definitely provide that for them.</p></speech>

It was an excellent committee dealing with Brexit and the issues arising from the situation in which we find ourselves.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, Brexit went off the agenda for a time while the pandemic was the most urgent thing we had to deal with as politicians.  Now, however, we are back to the reality of dealing with this Brexit situation before us.</p>  <p>  I come to what the Minister of State spoke about last in her responses, namely, supports for farmers.  I am fearful concerning soundings coming from the talks about Government formation.  I refer to some of the aspirations of one of the parties, the Green Party, and the concerns, as we will call them, which that party has regarding exports.  Many politicians from all political parties have done everything possible to build up trade for our farming communities over the years, within the EU and outside of it in Egypt and other countries.  Now, though, we are hearing soundings that live exports to non-EU countries should cease or begin to cease.  </p>  <p>  We must remember each one of us represents farmers.  Every politician elected to this House, no matter where his or her constituency is, represents farmers.  I state that because we are a farming nation.  We very much appreciate our local and international businesses, of course, as well as our tourism industry, but we are a farming nation.  Any politician that forgets that should not be a politician at all. </p>  <p>  It is our job to work hard for our farmers and to ensure we hold on to the markets we have and grow them.  We should definitely not be talking about stopping live exports to any country, be it a non-EU country or not.  I want to know what exactly is going to be put in place.  I ask that because the Minister of State knows as well as anybody that we had very good schemes in the past, such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  The original REP scheme was a good scheme for farmers and a great scheme for the countryside.  As we are talking about the green agenda, no scheme was better than REPS for our countryside because it helped farmers to undertake jobs on their farms that they might not have had the wherewithal to take on board otherwise.  </p> <p>When it comes to the provision of storage for effluent, the erection of slatted sheds, concreting yards and better cattle handling facilities, all the schemes that were in place at that time were very good.  To be honest, every scheme that has replaced them in latter years has been inferior to those which went before.  They are very much diluted.  Younger farmers entering the industry now do not have half as much available to them as young farmers had five or even 20 years ago.  </p> <p> I ask that the Minister concentrate during the negotiations and never forget we are a farming nation.  We must protect our market share of the tourism sector and all our other markets, whether it is the small shopkeeper or the bigger shop, the business people or the self-employed, but we must also remember the farmers who have always been the backbone of this country.</p></speech>

We are an exporting country.  We export approximately 90% of what we produce, including high-quality food.  It is important that we continue in that vein.  We all have ambitions when it comes to achieving and reaching climate change targets, none more so than our farmers who have always been the custodians of our land.  We must ensure in any programme for Government and any negotiations that we work with and support our farming community in every way we can.  That is something the Deputy can be assured of from my party.</p></speech>

I have questions for the Minister of State on the negotiations in respect of two issues, fishing and the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is clear how much fishing depends on UK waters and the agreement that is in place.  For high-value stocks, such as mackerel and prawns, we depend on access to UK fishing waters, with 60% of some stocks coming from UK waters.  The Minister of State is aware of this, so I am not saying anything that is new to her.  We saw in the past month that the EU was willing to move its position on fishing to get an agreement with the UK.  It was reported in the <i>EUobserver </i>that on fishing quotas where the EU indicated an agreement was a prerequisite to a broad trade deal, there has been little progress, although Brussels seemed to try to move away from that original position.  It also reported that EU countries such as France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark, which largely benefit from the current system, might nevertheless insist on a tough line.  It seems that we had to step in to stop the EU rowing back on that agreement and to ensure fishing will be linked in to the final trade agreement.  What are we going to do?  If France or one of the other countries in that group moves away from that position, we are finished, and the EU trade deal will go ahead.  </p><p>It has been reported today by Reuters that the French Parliament has put a report to the French Government on fishing, which states that the Union must continue to guarantee that fishing will not be sacrificed to save other sectors.  EU diplomats told Reuters last month the EU was willing to shift its stance on fisheries and move from the maximalist position of maintaining the current position in order to help forge a trade deal with Britain.  It is clear, therefore, that movement has taken place.  Is further movement taking place or is the Minister of State satisfied that this movement has stopped, fishing is now back in the fold and fishing stocks will be dependent on a final trade deal?  Will she categorically clear up that issue?  We are in a difficult position because we cannot rely on the Brits to look after us and I believe that, ultimately, we will not be able to rely on the European Union either.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's views.</p><p>The Minister of State indicated that under no circumstances would the Government countenance a hard Border on the island of Ireland. That is welcome, and no Government could do so.</p> <p>The British response on the Northern Ireland protocol has not been adequate, as we have said.  How can the Minister of State guarantee that the EU will not backslide on the hard border?  We have a problem because we have to push both the EU and the Brits to ensure that everyone holds to what they are doing.  We are in a difficult situation.  How is the Minister of State going to ensure that there will be no backsliding on the behalf of our EU colleagues?</p></speech>

Mr. Barnier reiterated in advance of the most recent negotiations that he has a clear mandate from the 27 member states that fisheries cannot be separated from the overall negotiations and an overall agreement cannot be reached without an agreement on fisheries.  That position was made clear by Mr. Barnier and the 27 ministers who represent the industry.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question about backsliding on behalf of the EU, I can absolutely assure him and other Deputies that the EU is foursquare behind the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.  I have spoken to 18 or 19 of my European colleagues individually in the past two weeks and they are fully aware that the Northern Ireland protocol must be implemented in full, that it cannot be amended or changed and any attempt to do so would not be accepted by them or us.  It is important not to stray from the fact that the UK has said consistently that it wants to implement the protocol and its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and what it has agreed to is there.  We obviously need the UK to bring forward the information and data that will allow it to fulfil that commitment.</p></speech>

As an MEP, I was proud at how well we were represented in the ongoing negotiations and deliberations.  The Minister of State also made a positive contribution and I thank her for it.</p>  <p>  I have been listening to the debate in my office.  While some of the issues I wanted to raise have already been raised, I will try to ask different questions about them.  I have only three questions.  The Mercosur agreement and its impact on the Irish beef industry has already been mentioned.  There is a significant and ongoing rise in emissions as more of the Amazon is felled and burned.  Apart from that, is the Council taking the impact of Brexit and the possibility of a limited free trade agreement, or perhaps even tariffs on Irish beef, into consideration when it is reviewing Mercosur?  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae spoke earlier about live exports and I add my voice to what he said.  I was pleased with the response from the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  We export east-west and north-south to the UK.  Let us take an example.  An item is exported to Liverpool and the same item is exported to Belfast.  Perhaps that latter item, or a component thereof, is then exported to mainland UK at some point.  How are those two items treated and what is the difference in exporting requirements, if I am making myself clear?</p>  <p>  My next question is about the regional impact of Brexit.  Earlier today, I quoted to the Taoiseach a recent report from the three regional assemblies which showed that the north-west and Border regions have the greatest exposure to significant economic disruption because of Covid-19.  We now have Brexit coming down the track and I strongly suggest to the Minister of State that, for businesses and sectors such as food production and agriculture, we need to keep in mind the following.  There is an economic gap between the regions to begin with and it has been exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19, as referenced by this report from the three regional assemblies.  Brexit will have a unique impact on the Border regions and the north-west of the country.</p> <p>Keeping those three things in mind, what I am asking is that the Government ensures it puts the necessary protections in place for the sectors that will be worst affected in the Border and north-west region.  </p></speech>

These events are all coming at a very inopportune time.  We have always tried to engage with the representative groups of the sectors most impacted in Northern Ireland when it came to our preparedness, but obviously there is a limit to what we can do in Northern Ireland and that is why it is so important that the Executive is up and running.  I refer also the New Decade, New Approach document which has been agreed.  It is extremely important in setting out shared goals and objectives for the entire region, not just related to Brexit but in terms of developing infrastructure and relations on this island.  We are absolutely committed to working with our colleagues in the North to try to mitigate any of the impacts not just on the Border communities but on the island of Ireland as a whole.</p>  <p>  In the scenario the Deputy painted, there are a lot of different movements.  Any movements between the UK and Northern Ireland are a matter for the UK Government.  The outcome in respect of the overall agreement between the EU and the UK will have an implication for any movements between Ireland and the UK. </p></speech>

We know the UK is leaving the customs union so there will obviously be changes there.  That is why we have tried to emphasise to business that irrespective of what outcome there is, there are going to be changes and businesses need to be prepared.  On Mercosur, we are going through a process.  Each individual member state is looking at how it could impact not just the agricultural sector but many other sectors.  We will, of course, take into account Covid and Brexit as part of that overall deliberation, which will go on for some time.</p></speech>

This evening's debate is an opportunity for Deputies to air their views on the pandemic's impact on sport.  I look forward to hearing their ideas and suggestions.</p>  <p>  I do not pretend that we have all the answers at this point, far from it.  Many questions remain to be answered.  Although considerable uncertainty still prevails for Irish sport, we are much better placed now than we were at the launch of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, which was accelerated last Friday as a result of the progress made in April and May in fighting the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the Irish sporting community was pleasantly surprised at the extent of the references to sport in the roadmap and the clarity provided for each of the five initial phases, which are now four.  It does not answer every question for every sport but it does give a vital planning framework.  We are now a few days into phase 2.  There already are nearly 20 outdoor-only sports that have restarted, in accordance with various public health requirements.  As that is about a third of all sports in Ireland, we are making headway.  There are, however, considerable challenges ahead.  No one is confidently predicting an early return to the exact situation that prevailed before the pandemic.  There certainly will be a new normal for sport. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge there is disappointment in this House and across the country that the big-attendance field sports are not covered in the early phases.  We are all missing the excitement of those big match days, all the more so given the glorious weather of recent weeks.  People may feel as though those days will never return but I wish to sound a positive note today.  There are huge challenges ahead, especially for mass gatherings, but I am convinced that solutions will be found that work for everybody, both for public health and the viability of sport.  </p>  <p>  I was encouraged to hear over the last weekend the planned resumption of intercounty GAA matches later in the year and the resumption of training by four League of Ireland clubs.</p> <p>Further afield, soccer is resuming, with limited spectators, in some European countries and rugby will shortly follow in New Zealand.  I think we can take heart at these developments.</p> <p> As with other sectors, Irish sport has been hit hard by this crisis.  The Government has taken a cross-sectoral approach where the aim has been to stabilise the situation.  The Government's overarching cross-sectoral approach to the Covid-19 pandemic was designed to ensure that economic activity recovers as quickly as possible, consistent with public health advice.</p> <p> The cross-sectoral measures introduced by the Government to date have benefited national and local sporting organisations and have been widely welcomed.  They include, in particular, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment and the series of enterprise supports ranging from liquidity funding, loan schemes and grants vouchers, as well as deferred tax payments and the deferral of commercial rates.</p> <p> As to whether further supports will be needed, I think the answer is almost certainly "Yes".  Discussions are under way but not yet concluded.  The details will need to be worked on and we will liaise closely with the sector.  Not all sports organisations have been affected to the same extent.  The most acutely affected are those with summer seasons and with a heavy reliance on gate receipts.  A targeted and focused response is clearly appropriate in these circumstances.</p> <p> Despite the current difficult situation we must continue to work towards hosting such major events as the postponed UEFA football championships.  As Members are aware, Dublin was due to host four games this year and an economic impact study commissioned by Dublin City Council indicated that up to 96,000 overseas visitors were expected to attend, delivering an economic impact of up to &euro;126 million.  UEFA sought confirmation from the governing authorities of the 12 host cities that they were willing and able to host in June and July of 2021.  The Government has reconfirmed the guarantees required and I have written to the president of UEFA confirming that Ireland will host next year's Euro 2020 matches.  The Government remains fully committed to working with all of the local organisations and with UEFA to mount a very successful UEFA Euro 2020 in Dublin in 2021.  Obviously, we live in very uncertain and trying times but the rescheduled tournament will provide a much-needed economic, social and sporting boost for the country.  I will hand over to the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="21:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100075#GGGG00200"><p>Last Friday's announcement by the Taoiseach of an acceleration in the Government's roadmap has been widely welcomed across Irish sport.  It is fair to say that there was a certain sense of relief among the population that the journey back for sport is well and truly under way.  As with so many other sectors, the world of sport, domestically and internationally, has been turned upside down as a result of Covid-19.  At the start of 2020 it was absolutely unthinkable that we would be where we are in June and to see the upheaval affecting the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games and Euro 2020 but, unfortunately, that is where we are and we are making progress in terms of the roadmap back.</p>  <p>  The accelerated roadmap has provided a much needed and welcome confidence boost to the sports sector.  As well as the return of outdoor sport, sporting bodies can now make plans for summer camps for children and teenagers.  I was delighted to see our high-performance athletes return to training on Monday at the Sport Ireland Campus and at Morton Stadium, the national sailing centre and the National Rowing Centre as well.</p>  <p>  Before the pandemic we were dealing with record levels of interest in sports capital projects throughout the country.  Although that presents funding challenges, it is nonetheless a welcome reflection of the importance that people and clubs nationwide attach to their sport and the need for improved sports facilities.  More than 12,000 projects have benefitted from sports capital funding since 1998 at a cost of almost &euro;1 billion.  The sporting landscape of Ireland has been transformed, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  The most recent sports capital round in 2018 attracted a record 2,337 applications, with allocations being announced in January, May and November of last year.  A total of more than &euro;56 million was awarded to nearly 1,700 different projects.  In recent weeks my Department has received many queries about the sports capital programme, mainly concerning the status of grant approvals.  I take the opportunity today to confirm publicly the continuing validity of prior grant approvals.  I also emphasise that it is very much business as usual for the programme.</p> <p>Club volunteers and officials in my Department working from home are busy working together to progress the drawdown of these and other outstanding grants.</p> <p> The National Sports Policy 2018-2027 contains a strong commitment to further develop our sports facilities and we remain determined to deliver on that commitment.  A review of the 2018 round is being finalised and a decision on the timing of the next round of the programme will be taken when this is complete.</p> <p> With regard to the large scale sporting infrastructure fund, LSSIF, good progress is also being made for these types of projects, which are being covered under the newly-established fund.  The Government has provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100 million for the period to 2027 for this scheme.  The scheme closed for applications in April of last year with applications initially confined to local authorities and national governing bodies of sport.  On 10 January, the Minister and I announced provisional allocations amounting to more than &euro;77 million for 25 projects under the construction stream.  Three days later, on 13 January, we announced provisional allocations of &euro;5 million for a further seven projects under the design stream of the LSSIF.  The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the successful projects will undergo a further process of due diligence.  This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies, as appropriate, to comply with the public spending code.  This work is ongoing and I look forward to seeing many of the projects progress to the construction stage in the near future.</p> <p> Sport is, thankfully, starting to resume.  However, much work remains to be done, especially on the impact of social distancing requirements and what that means for those sports that inherently involve contact.  There is also the significant issue of future mass gatherings on which so many sports depend, especially the field team sports.  Considerable work will need to be undertaken in this regard.  The importance of working through these issues collaboratively with the sector is fully appreciated and we shall continue to do that.</p> <p> I thank all of the people involved in sport in Ireland at community and national level, all the athletes and everyone who is involved for the great co-operation and collaborative approach that they have displayed throughout this period.  The sports people have helped so many communities through their volunteerism and through encouraging people to remain active.  I acknowledge all of that work that is being done because it is critically important to the response.</p></speech>

Did the Minister make contact with Sky Sports, BT Sport or any other broadcasters which we have a relationship with to get their opinion on the situation and to express our abhorrence of their association with any organisation that is causing so much harm and so much death, crime and destruction in Ireland?</p>  <p>  Can the Minister confirm that he met the FAI yesterday, and can he further confirm that they were looking for more funding?  What was that funding for and will he be providing it?  Is he satisfied that proper governance procedures were followed in the appointment of the current chairman, interim deputy CEO and CEO?  The Minister stated on the news last week, "I can't help you ... [there]", and that was a matter for Amrop.  However, the Minister will be aware, because he is always tuned in, that many have cast a complexion over the recruitment of what are the three best individuals for the jobs, as far as I am concerned - I have no axe to grind with them.  There is an obscurity in the process, which makes the new FAI look very much like an old new FAI.</p> <p>An article published today on the <i>Irish Examiner</i>'s website quotes from correspondence issued about a week ago to the FAI raising serious matters in respect of governance.  What is the Minister's position on that?  Odgers Berndtson is to advertise for a permanent CEO of the FAI tomorrow.  Will the Minister assure us that the process will be above reproach and will not have an obscure complexion like that which seemed to generate a number of candidate lists for jobs that were fluid and for which the Minister has stated he had no input?  Did Sport Ireland have input and will it have input again?  Is the recruitment firm being told to produce an expert list of candidates from which somebody will be chosen, or is the list subject to a masseur, either at Sport Ireland, the Department or some other entity, to ensure that a candidate who certain people think should get the job gets it, rather than the person who should get the job?<br/><br/>How will the Minister reconcile the FIFA and UEFA statutes in terms of having to have a majority of football directors as opposed to having an inbuilt majority, to use the Minister's own words, for the independent directors with the benefit of the casting vote?<br/><br/>What are the proposals for the League of Ireland?  Is the Minister aware that, presumably, at least some public money will be of assistance for the four-team tournament proposed by the FAI?  It happens to be the top four clubs.  Having seen the names of the independent directors recruited, I did not notice that of George Orwell, although it seems the League of Ireland is now very much a club of equals where all clubs are equal but some are more equal than others.  What about Sligo Rovers, Shelbourne Rovers, Finn Harps and Athlone Town?  All told, there is considerable concern that the new FAI, in process, procedure and governance, looks very much like the old FAI.  What does the Government propose to do about it?<br/><br/>I turn to the Federation of Irish Sports, which represents 81 national governing bodies and 29 local sports partnerships.  It has stated that for all the institutions, their funding supports have been reduced by between 60% and 100%, yet 85% of the current expenditure costs continue to be applied to them.  Will the Minister consider the establishment of a sports resilience fund, similar to that in New Zealand?What are his proposals for establishing one?  While I appreciate there is an expert group on the return to sport, will he outline whether he will set up a task force on the support for sport?<br/><br/>Finally, and I apologise that this is a transport issue, the Minister will know that I have, <i>ad nauseam</i>, asked for a clear and prompt pathway for the reopening of aviation.  He will have noted today that the European Commission clearly stated that all intra-EU restrictions are to be lifted on 15 June, which merely puts the Government's plan and pathway one month behind the curve.  Will the Minister be reviewing that?</p></speech>

I ask that Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua, Sky Sports and others involved in the fight inform themselves about the Kinahan criminal organisation.  They do not have to listen to politicians or the media, but I think they do have to listen to judgments of the Irish courts and, in particular, to a decision by Mr. Justice Hunt given in the Special Criminal Court last month.  In that decision, he referred to the Kinahan criminal organisation as an organised crime gang involved in "execution-type murders" in the context of feuds "to protect its core activities", which include "organised drugs and firearms" offences on "an international scale".</p>  <p>  I ask the people involved in this fight to inform themselves about that.  They cannot just hide from those facts because there is a great deal of money to be made.  The lives of people in inner-city Dublin, which have been decimated by the Kinahan criminal organisation, deserve to be recognised by the other people involved in the fight.  The victims of killings by the criminal organisation also need to be aware of it.</p> <p>On what needs to be done in respect of sport, one of the main negative consequences of the lockdown has been the impact of the closure of sport on young people, including children.  They thrive on sport.  All of us who played sports as youngsters know how important it is to us.  I urge the Minister, Mr. Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, to do their best to ensure we can get young people back playing sports.  Sport is great for spectators but it is more important for participants, particularly young people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="21:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100078#KKKK00200"><p>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan referred to young people and the impact of the closure of sport on them.  I commend young people for their incredible volunteerism during the lockdown.  Their sporting organisations throughout Ireland have raised thousands upon thousands of euro for charitable organisations.  In west Cork, where I am from, members of sports organisations and clubs have taken part in 5 km runs and sit-up and push-up challenges and they have raised thousands for the local community hospital there.  I take this opportunity to commend them for that.</p>  <p>  Among the most popular sports where I am from in west Cork are the equine sports of harness racing and trotting.  It is the highlight of the summer for many people.  They spend their summer Sundays harness racing.  When it was announced that racing would return in phase 2, the equine community was, of course, overjoyed, but the harness racing fraternity found out only later that the announcement did not apply to them.  Unfortunately, the return of their sport was pushed out to phase 3.  This is completely unfair and it makes absolutely no sense.</p>  <p>  I welcome the news that thoroughbred racing has returned behind closed doors.  I also welcome the news that greyhound racing has returned behind closed doors.  I called for this repeatedly.  Why, however, are harness racing and trotting being discriminated against by comparison with other sports?  Right across Europe and the rest of the globe, harness racing is treated in the same way as thoroughbred racing.  Eighteen countries across Europe treat it in the same way and are allowing races to be run behind closed doors.  Why is that not the case here?  The sad fact is that harness racing has always been treated as the poor relation of thoroughbred racing.  This needs to stop, particularly when it comes to funding.  I acknowledge that funding comes under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but the point has to be made that harness racing is always treated as the poor relation.  This inequality needs to stop.</p>  <p>  The Irish Harness Racing Association has submitted a 70-page document detailing how harness racing can resume behind closed doors.  I believe it is on the Taoiseach's desk.  Could the Minister please bring my message to the Cabinet, including the Taoiseach?  Could he please let this great sport resume behind closed doors and stop the unequal treatment of two sports that are very similar?</p></speech>

First, what discussions have taken place on insurance rebates in respect of public liability insurance pertaining to accidents of players who play every year as club members and so on?  There should be a rebate from the insurance companies.  The Department should insist on it.</p>  <p>  Second, we need to move forward fast regarding juvenile sports.  The summer is here and the children will all be off school.  They have been off school for a long time but it is vital that we ascertain whether children transmit Covid-19.  There seems to be some evidence that they do not.  Can we get the children back playing real matches, with ten, 11 or 12 players, as soon as possible and proceed from there?</p>  <p>  My third point is on club sport.  The pitches of many clubs, including football and hurling clubs but also other clubs involved in such outdoor sports, have quite big perimeters.  We need clear guidelines to the effect that if people stay apart &ndash; they are fantastic at this in the local communities &ndash; matches can be run locally with people in attendance.  At many club grounds around the country there would be no problem putting barriers 2 m or 3 m wide around the pitch to allow spectators to attend.  Let us be honest about it: sports, particularly local sports, as in two clubs playing in Kerry, are not the same without spectators.</p> <p>Will there be testing of players?  I do not know if the virus can be transmitted in the type of close contact a person might have in a football match where a person might bump another person for a second or two.  We need to test frequently and very frequently at the beginning.</p> <p> Has consideration been given by the Government to mass events and particularly the funding of temperature testing at the stiles in a number of key grounds around the country?  This is so when a crowd goes in there would be a temperature check and if anybody had an elevated temperature, he or she could be picked out.  This could be done where we take 20,000 or 30,000 people into the very big grounds we have like the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park and so on.  That might allow us to move to that phase a bit earlier.</p></speech>

On 13 May I raised with the Minister the matter of face coverings on public transport and he will have heard today about the World Health Organization recommendations.  Has the Minister changed his mind on this or will clearer guidance be given?  It is essential that face coverings be worn while a person is on public transport.</p>  <p>  The second matter relates to people over 70 who are receiving appointments from the National Driver Licence Service but who are still being turned away.  The information on the website is very unclear so I would like the Minister to look into the matter.</p>  <p>  My third comment relates to the national car test centres, where I am led to believe people are being charged a full amount instead of a recheck fee.  Will the Minister provide clarity on those matters and commit to dealing with them?  Perhaps the Department might liaise with me on that.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had a detrimental impact on elite and grassroots sports in Ireland.  We are all keen on sport and want to see it thrive or flourish.  Many clubs in my constituency have seen an impact from the crisis and missed vital training and competition opportunities.  They face serious issues of funding because of the effects of the virus and national ticket sales, media rights revenues and memberships have all dried up.  Sporting participants and volunteers have, equally, lost out in training and other regular activities.  Sport is an integral part of Irish life and our communities.  We all work hard for our clubs.  My colleague mentioned the resilience fund set up in New Zealand so I wonder will the Minister give a commitment on that.  I am thinking particularly of our elite athletes and those who will compete in Tokyo but who will have to wait another year to do so.  Will the Minister confirm what actions will be taken to support elite athletes and sporting clubs around the country?</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for the Minister and will afford him the opportunity to answer.  I commend all the sporting organisations, as I am sure everybody does, on their efforts during the Covid-19 crisis.  They really have been the backbone of the community responses.  I thank them for their sacrifice.  This goes from kids missing out on a kick about to the elite athletes missing out on the Olympics or some of the high points of their careers in some cases.  The importance of sport and sporting organisations to the social fabric of Ireland has been put up in lights and its importance spans a wide range of Departments, whether they relate to culture and heritage, health, mental health, regional and rural affairs and children.  This is not even including the business element.</p>  <p>  Many local sports clubs around the country have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and despite many local people availing of facilities in order to keep fit and exercise, many clubs are now facing financial trouble because they are unable to operate or fundraise locally.  For example, clubs may not have been able to run a lottery or hold fundraisers while clubhouses are closed.</p> <p>Will the Government make extra funding available to help sports clubs and, if so, what form will that take?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="" time="21:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100080#MMMM00200"><p>I will answer that question briefly and then hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin.  The Government is looking for a new package to help sport generally.  That will include all the national governing bodies, large and small, and it will be distributed, hopefully, to the grassroots, which are the most important in this regard.  I share the Deputy's tribute to the volunteers.  It is very important that sport at every level is supported, not just the big battalions but at a grassroots level also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="21:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100080#MMMM00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for affording the Minister and me an opportunity to respond to his questions.  We know there are some clubs that have experienced severe financial difficulty.  Some can absorb that and survive.  Some are in danger of going under.  That is the real concern.  The Department is working with its partners.  We are examining the various options and I am in close contact with the Federation of Irish Sport and individual CEOs.  I would like to see some sort of resilience fund that could be administered by Sport Ireland, perhaps through the national governing bodies.  Where there are hardship cases, the clubs in question would benefit from the fund and we would get the money to where it is needed most as quickly as possible.  We are working on that.  We are acutely aware of the severe challenges being faced.</p>  <p>  Last Friday's announcement will be useful in terms of income streams for many clubs with C&uacute;l Camps coming back, for example, in GAA circles.  Other summer camps are coming back also.  We know that will provide only a small amount of relief.  We have also engaged with insurance companies to ensure there will be cash refunds in respect of the elements that were covered during the lockdown where there was no exposure to liability.  The Minister and I met Insurance Ireland and we got a guarantee that that money will be returned in cash as would elements of the premiums that relate to those parts of the cover.</p></speech>

I have a question on gyms and swimming pools.  Many avid sports people are keen to get back to the gym or swimming pool and their routine of exercise.  Under the original roadmap, swimming pools were set to open in phase 4 while gyms were scheduled to reopen in phase 5.  Will the Minister provide an update on this plan under the reconfigured roadmap that was announced last week?  Is it the case that both these types of facility are set to reopen on 20 July?</p></speech>

We have seen an acceleration in elements of the roadmap and it is possible that we could see that in respect of gyms and swimming pools.  There is a process to go through but that is actively happening.  The expert group is closely examining those protocols and working with the various organisations.  We want to ensure there will be no undue delay in returning to sport in whatever way possible.</p></speech>

I am a member of a boxing club and I am very proud of the contribution boxing has made in communities across Ireland.  I am very proud of our amateur and professional boxers who have done so well on the world stage, in the Olympic Games and in world championships.  It is very important that the State make every effort to ensure that professional boxing is not hijacked by elements that we would not like to see involved in it and that Ireland's name continues to shine strongly on the world boxing stage.</p></speech>

I have today asked officials to draft letters to my counterpart in the UK and also to the broadcasters, Sky and BT Sport, expressing our outrage about this matter.  It is completely unacceptable.  My heart goes out to the decent volunteers and participants in boxing across the country who put in so much time and effort for their communities.  Sport Ireland has no connection with professional boxing but it wants to emphasise that in regard to amateur boxing in this country there is no question whatsoever of any link to criminality.</p>  <p>The danger is that the reputation of Irish boxing may be tarnished by this incident.  That is grossly unfair to the large number of people who do great work.  It is important to emphasise that.  We are taking this very seriously.  We are absolutely appalled by this link.</p></speech>

It is really important that it comes from this side of the House as well.  I will be very brief.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.  The work done on the ground is absolutely unparalleled.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I have been to many boxing clubs, particularly around this city, which are manned by volunteers who do incredible work for their communities.  It would be absolutely wrong and tragic if their names were to be sullied by activities which are completely and utterly unacceptable.  I take this opportunity to say "well done" to the volunteers in the world of boxing.  We will support them.  They are doing a great service.  We know they have absolutely nothing to do with what is going on elsewhere.</p></speech>

My constituency of Dublin North-West has a great number of clubs and associations which include boxing clubs, GAA clubs, soccer clubs, pigeon clubs and many more.  All have a long history and association with local communities.  Generations of families have been members of these clubs.  All make valuable contributions to the community and to the physical and mental well-being of their members.  We owe them all huge thanks for their selfless dedication and commitment to our communities.  As we begin the process of reopening society, with the prospect of clubs and associations opening their doors to members again, will the Minister assure these clubs and associations that assistance will be given to help them maintain a safe environment, in view of the threat of Covid-19, and that the necessary supports will be provided to allow them to operate in safe environments for their members and staff?  Has the Minister considered putting in place dedicated local area testing facilities to ensure that these clubs can continue to be an important part of their communities?</p>  <p>  I would also like to express my concerns with regard to the connections between sport and certain families with very serious criminal backgrounds which were mentioned by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan and my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke.  It is deplorable and needs to be tackled at the highest level.</p></speech>

I cannot speak highly enough of them.  It has always been my experience in this Ministry that these clubs are the backbone of sport.  It would be wrong if they were not a major and significant part of the recovery plan.  The expert group will give advice on the guidelines about which the Deputy talked.  Much of it will be up to the clubs.  The volunteers are fantastic people and I have absolutely no doubt that they will abide by the protocols and enforce them because they have the good and the health of the members of the clubs in mind at all times.</p></speech>

Since March, through our sports monitoring group we have been engaging with the Federation of Irish Sport, the Olympic Federation of Ireland, representatives of the national governing bodies and some representatives of athletes.  We are therefore very much aware of the challenges.  We are working with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to the supports that can be extended to sport.  As I said earlier, to get the money to the front line, where it is most needed, we will require the co-operation of the national governing bodies.  This will ensure that those who need it most will get it as soon as possible.  We are working on that process.</p></speech>

Prior to the pandemic, the League of Ireland and the clubs were making really positive progress.  The underage structures were developing really well and were coming on.</p> <p>One could start to see the benefits at underage international level.  The women's football was developing very strongly as well.  One element was the active engagement of clubs with community projects.  It is hard to match the level of community activity in which clubs were involved.  My club, Shamrock Rovers, is very much involved with local community projects and is at the heart of much of the good that happens in that community.  For example, Shamrock Rovers was very supportive of Gaza Kids to Dublin.  It is also supportive of the Homeless Period Ireland project and its end period poverty campaign.  This community engagement is reflected in all the clubs across the country.  The clubs are more than just football clubs because they are at the heart of the community.</p> <p> With the Covid-19 pandemic the clubs and the league are effectively on a ventilator in ICU.  What they need is oxygen, and in many ways the oxygen is cash flow.  The only way for League of Ireland clubs to generate cash flow is to get people coming through the turnstiles.  They will not survive without that.  They need a great deal of support.  The FAI does not have enough money, nor does the league.  I understand that the meeting today with the clubs did not go well.  There was much despondency among the clubs leaving it.  There is great concern that the existence of many clubs may be in question.  Will the Minister and Minister of State confirm and reassure clubs that no club will be allowed to go out of existence because of Covid-19?  It is important to give some assurance to clubs.</p></speech>

As the Minister and Minister of State will be aware, the fundraising efforts of sporting clubs and organisations around the country have been decimated as a result of Covid-19.  Many clubs in Mayo and throughout the country have cancelled their flagship annual fundraisers over the past three months and into the future, which will undoubtedly place significant strain on their finances.  We are all aware of the importance of sport in our communities.  In many cases, the local club is the beating heart of the community.  In times of crisis such as this our language as parliamentarians is important to generate hope for the future.  I wish to focus on the positives of recovery and growth, so I am hoping the Minister will provide clarity on the sports capital programme for 2020.  This will be the financial lifeline, more so than in any previous year, for sporting clubs and associations to grow and expand.  It is important for the clubs to be more active than ever post Covid-19 as they are the link that binds communities together.</p>  <p>  Last week, I raised with the Minister for Health the importance of flattening the mental health curve as the next Covid-19 challenge, and sport has a critical role to play.  Many people have taken up individual physical activity and we have witnessed a dramatic increase in cycling over the past three months.  Any legislation will be a matter for the next Government but I wish to raise the need to make the use of cycle helmets mandatory in Ireland.  Only a handful of countries around the world have enacted legislation making cycle helmets mandatory.  Australia was the first country to introduce legislation, followed by New Zealand and Argentina.</p> <p>I want to add Ireland to this list.  We have excellent off-road cycling facilities in Mayo such as the Great Western Greenway connecting Westport, Newport, Mulranny and Achill, as well as the Monasteries of the Moy Greenway linking Ballina and Killala, and the Castlebar Greenway linking Raheens Woods trail and the National Museum of Ireland - Country Life in Turlough.  However, not every county has the benefit of off-road cycle paths.</p> <p> Due to the recent Covid restrictions, more people have taken to cycling.  I have been contacted by local bicycle shop owners highlighting the need to promote the wearing of cycle helmets and making it a mandatory legal requirement to do so.  We have spoken much in recent months of effective public health policy.  We also need to expand the conversation to include cycle helmets to reduce acquired head injuries.</p> <p> While not for discussion today, a similar argument can be made for introducing a mandatory need for helmets when using electric scooters.  Will the Minister give serious consideration to this topic and raise it with his Department, as I will be raising this important topic again as soon as the new Government is formed?</p></speech>

It will be 32 years since Ireland beat England one-nil in Stuttgart.  I had the great pleasure of bringing a double decker bus to that city with 22 soccer supporters from Ireland.  It gave great joy and great hope to the Irish diaspora around the world, especially in the UK.  Soccer, football and sport can be a diplomatic, enjoyable and interesting way to settle differences.  Tomorrow will be a wonderful day to remember 32 years of being undefeated by our near neighbours, England, in, as some used to call it, the English game.</p>  <p>  We are talking about the League of Ireland and the various issues regarding fundraising for clubs.  Many clubs are going through serious stress and issues.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, brought in a certain grant for show societies of &euro;5,000.  It was a great injection of funds.  Many GAA, soccer and rugby clubs around the country would benefit from a similar grant or a stipend of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;5,000.  Such an injection could help many of those clubs in fundraising.</p>  <p>  Many clubs are working extremely hard fundraising and have come up with different ideas.  Years ago, one had club lotto and sponsored walks.  Recently, Enniscrone Kilglass GAA had a ticketathon to raise funds.  Geevagh GAA club had a 24-hour charity virtual relay.  My soccer club in Boyle had a 50:50 draw which was very successful.  Many people are joining it because there is a huge prize to be earned.  My local soccer club earns over &euro;1,500 a week from this draw.</p>  <p>  A local GAA club, Shannon Gaels in north Roscommon, has brought the 50:50 draw to a new reckoning with a prize divided 40:40 and the remaining 20% going to a local charity.  The local charity this week is the nursing home in Boyle.  This is an innovative development.  For clubs around the country, it is a great way of including community.  I am not advocating gambling but it is a great idea to get funds.</p>  <p>  I heard my colleague, Deputy Andrews, talk about Shamrock Rovers.  I am delighted he mentioned Shamrock Rovers because as a Sligo Rovers supporter I am sick and tired of hearing about Rovers.  There are two Rovers in this country, Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers.  In the west and north west, there is only one Rovers, Sligo Rovers.</p></speech>

I have absolute admiration and respect for him continuing in this important ministerial role during this extremely difficult time for our State and community.</p><p>I want to raise two substantive issues relating to sport.</p> <p>I join with Deputies Jim O'Callaghan, Darren O'Rourke and Ellis in expressing my already-expressed concerns about the connections with Daniel Kinahan and the major boxing fight between Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua.  I welcome the comments from the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, that he has communicated with the British authorities and with the broadcasters.  This brings up the important role of media in the coverage of this fight.  I pay credit to the Irish <i>Daily Star</i>, which has taken the extremely brave decision not to cover this fight while the involvement of Daniel Kinahan continues.  There is a lesson for international press in particular to make sure it looks through the full details of what is going on in respect of the fight preparation and who is involved.  I hope to see a change of tone and a bit of education.<br/><br/>With regard to substantive local issues in sport, I have a slightly niche one for both the Minister and Minister of State.  This September, the Aviva was due to play host to the American football classics between Navy and Notre Dame.  This was a significant game and I was very lucky to attend the previous version of this game a number of years ago, when the now Taoiseach was Minister, and to see the colour and the huge crowds that came to the country from the USA.  It was a significant boost to our economy at a much tougher time.  It is something that many of us were looking forward to, both as sports fans and from an economic and tourism point of view.  What efforts have been made to try to secure the restaging of this particular fixture?  I know the universities of Nebraska and Illinois are due to come in two years' time but there is an opportunity on many levels for this sport to be a driver for the country.  It is not just about the game itself but also the matches that happen the night before at the high school and junior college levels.  It is a substantial boost for what I admit is a minority sport, which I am fortunate to have played not so long ago and indeed for which I hold an all-Ireland winner's medal.  As much from a sporting as a tourism point of view, it has to be chased.<br/><br/>As many Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, have said, sport is so much better when one is there and crowds can enjoy it.  We see that New Zealand will have live rugby this weekend with crowds there.  There already have been soccer matches with crowds in Belgrade this week.  When we get to a position when it is safe to do it, we need protocols for people to return to enjoy sport.  It is not just about the elite athletes, participants and officials, but also the supporters who need to be enjoy it in safety and as soon as requirements allow.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Richmond for what he had to say, endorse everything he said and congratulate him for what he said this morning on the radio.  It was extremely helpful and courageous and gave a lead to many people today.</p></speech>

We are considering all the options.  We know how important it is to so many communities and clubs.  At the same time, we have a current funding issue in clubs too.  We have to weigh up all of those options.  We hope to make a decision on that as soon as possible.  With regard to the compulsory wearing of helmets, any such decision would have to include widespread consultation with cycling clubs and people who regularly cycle throughout the country.  That conversation would need to include the views of cyclists.</p>  <p>  Deputy Feighan raised finance for clubs.  We are looking at what we can do to support clubs that are in particular danger of going out of existence right now.  We are keen to explore that further and to try to help those clubs before they come to that point.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Richmond, a series of American football games are planned for Dublin.  I know how widely the economic benefits are felt.  I remember caddying for some of the Navy and Notre Dame supporters who were here in 1996 and came to Kerry after the game as well.  There is significant economic impact to the State.  The organisers are continuing to engage with officials from our Department in that regard.</p>  <p>  Tonight marks the 30th anniversary of Kevin Sheedy's goal against England, where we got a one-all draw that helped us through to the last 16 at the conclusion of that group.  That was the first game of the group.  Today is a historic day too.</p></speech>

I will leave time for questions.</p> <p>I will make my contribution in two tranches.  The Minister and Minister of State have already touched on some of the issues I wanted to talk about.  I welcome the announcement of the sports recovery action plan.  I ask the Minister of State to delve into it in a little bit more detail and outline a timeline for when he expects it to be set up.</p> <p> I emphasise the importance of local clubs.  The Minister of State spoke about channelling funding through national governing bodies, which is fair enough.  However, I am most concerned about the local level, specifically lost revenue, costs that are currently difficult to cover, the need to train Covid-19 officers and the infrastructure local clubs will need to facilitate people in the new world we now live in.  </p> <p> I emphasise two issues, namely, small grants and speed.  Small grants will open up a lot of clubs during the summer and will make their financial life a lot easier.  Can the Minister of State tell me more about them?  He praised the volunteers in various clubs highly and he is right to do so, but they would all like him to back those words with a few quid to help them out over the summer. </p> <p> I also want to talk about the national sports policy 2018-2027, launched in December 2018.  I flicked through it earlier.  It is a very comprehensive document that outlines 57 actions.  There was a plan to prioritise some of these.  I understand the sports leadership group has not met since October 2019.  Can the Minister of State say how that prioritisation is proceeding and when the priority actions can be published?  That would be a good start.  I will come back on another issue then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="22:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100085#RRRR00200"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta.  We are working very closely with the national governing bodies and the Federation of Irish Sport on the sports recovery action plan.  We have approached the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the support that we know is needed for Irish sport, at the level of national organisations and in regard to local clubs that are at risk.  We are working on that.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am very keen to ensure that the sports leadership group we established as part of the national sports policy effort plays a significant role in implementing the sports recovery action plan.  No decisions have been made on the make-up of that group, but there is already an excellent resource there.  That role could evolve into leading the recovery.  An approach based on consensus between all the key players is of great importance to Irish sport.  Thankfully, there has been a very harmonious relationship between the key stakeholders in Irish sport for some time now and a lot of good work has been done.</p>  <p>  I will get an update for the Deputy on the progress of the national sports policy 2018-2027.  The Covid-19 crisis has thrown up questions about whether that policy needs to be tweaked.  One very interesting element has emerged from this period.  We set a target whereby 50% of the population would regularly participate in sport or physical activity by 2027.  That figure has now reached 51%, up from 43% in 2018.  How can we harness the good habits that have developed in this time and change the novelty to the norm?  There is an opportunity for us to build on the behavioural change we have seen during this crisis to the benefit of future participation in sports.  Some elements of sports policy will have to be reconsidered, but I am keen for the sports leadership group to play a significant role in the future.  Along with everything else included in the policy, other expertise may be needed to assist the sports leadership group in dealing with the business element of sport and the rebuilding of finances.  I will try to get a written update for the Deputy as quickly as possible. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="22:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100085#RRRR00300"><p>I would also like to raise the issue of racism, particularly as it pertains to sport.  I bring it up because Ms Nadia Power, the Irish athlete, recently asked us to continue the conversation on racism.  We need to continue it in an appropriate and positive way.  That is the only way we will make a difference to the various ways that people of colour and people from ethnic minorities experience racism on a regular basis in Ireland, including on sporting grounds.</p> <p>We must keep that issue on the agenda and keep the discussions going in every sector.</p> <p> I will mention some examples of what has happened to some young people.  Leo Gaxha, a Kerryman, and now a young professional footballer, was told to "go back to [his] own country" while he was training in Tralee during the early weeks of the Covid-19 shutdown.  In 2018, four Sporting Ennistymon F.C. players from Traveller backgrounds temporarily quit the sport, citing a series of racial slurs during games and the failure of referees to take them seriously.  Yanis Zinedine Boulmelh, a Dubliner, was racially abused by an opponent during a game in the Leinster senior league.  The referee took no action during the game, but Yanis has said he has experienced racism for more than 12 years on the pitch.  The Westmeath GAA player, Boidu Sayeh, recently spoke up about his experience of racism and referenced a proliferation of sly comments.  Gina Akpe-Moses stated that after she had competed and gained many medals, people had asked her why we had her and said that she is not Irish.</p> <p> Many of the people speaking out are young adults, but I worry about the kids all across the country thinking of joining a team or taking up a sport.  Perhaps they are getting hassle in their sport already and might be thinking about leaving it because of racism and sly comments.  I would like the Minister and the Minister of State to comment on this issue as well, but I ask those children to tell someone, a friend, a parent, a coach or a teacher.  I ask coaches and clubs across the country to check in with their kids and ask them if they have been getting hassle and sly comments.  I also ask those clubs to not only look at who is in a club, but who is not in a club.  I ask them to look around their communities and consider who in the community is not part of a club and why.  Who does not feel comfortable approaching a club?  Who has never been asked to join a club, who is afraid to ask and who never thought about asking?</p> <p> These are the questions we can and should ask, not just regarding ethnicity, but also concerning gender and girl's and women's participation in sport, as well as the participation of people with disabilities and people with different sexual orientations.  I highlight this issue not just to point out the things that are wrong and should be better, but to highlight the broader issue of inclusion in this session, because sport, and team sports in particular, if done properly and inclusively, have enormous potential to break down barriers, help people to feel they belong and are valued and are part of the community.</p> <p> In respect of the national sports policy, what measures are being implemented to help kids in these situations?  I refer to upskilling coaches, leaders and trainers into a position where they can intervene and deal with the kinds of things that happen regularly on pitches and at various sports grounds. </p></speech>

The Deputy is right that recent events have underlined the need for those efforts to be accelerated, emphasised and redoubled.</p></speech>

When I think of sport, I think of the great opportunities that exist regarding inclusion and breaking down barriers, as the Deputy mentioned.  Unfortunately, we also hear appalling stories such as these from time to time.  The Deputy listed some of the names of those people who, unfortunately, have had to endure completely unacceptable behaviour, even if that occurs in a minority of cases.  My view is that the vast majority of sporting situations are very inclusive and are positive experiences.  The types of situations the Deputy described are appalling, unacceptable and need to be stamped out, and our sports policy is very much focused on trying to do that.</p> <p>One of the elements of the policy that we are keen to progress is to give greater capacity to organisations to deal with problems as they arise at every level and to ensure the personnel who make up those organisations are more broadly representative of our new communities.  The key part of this is to try to bring people in and extend a welcome to them in order that they will take part and become mentors in those clubs.  That is something we need to work on in the future.</p></speech>

I commend the work the Deputy has done for many years, and continues to do, in tackling racial discrimination in this sphere.  It is a credit to him and our constituency.</p>  <p>  I will ask some practical questions before making a number of comments.  Can further clarity be provided to clubs on the sports capital grant?  I am aware that this issue was raised earlier but these grants are the central plank of sports funding for many clubs, which build much of their planning and funding around them.  If the Minister of State could give further clarification on the 2020 sports capital programme, it would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>  A number of sports clubs have contacted me asking why they have been excluded from the restart grant announced by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  They are availing of the three month waiver for commercial rates but when the phasing ends and they open up they will have been five months out of business.  There is a two month lag, and they would benefit from being able to apply for the restart grant.  Will the Minister and Minister of State, in their official capacity, make representations to their ministerial colleague to allow sports clubs to apply for the grant?  The amount of money is not great in the overall scheme of things, but it is great for individual clubs and would make a huge difference in helping them get back up and running and on their feet.</p>  <p>  Is a grant or pot of money - I know there are not many of those around - still available for the local authority swimming pool programme?  If so, can changes be made to the terms of the grant to repurpose it in order to help swimming pools bounce back from the hit they have taken?</p>  <p>  One issue that has come up, and was touched on by a previous speaker, is fundraising.  We are all in awe of sports clubs and their committees, and how they constantly strive to improve, get people out playing sport, improve their facilities and raise funds.  When everything shut down that drive to raise funds continued and many clubs wanted to run online lotteries.  However, a licence had to be granted by the District Court.  I have written to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, requesting that powers be devolved to the superintendent in local Garda stations to allow licences for online lotteries to enable sports clubs to raise funds.  It was a barrier we did not know existed until this pandemic and one the Department could address.  God forbid we are ever in this situation again but it would make it easier for sports clubs to engage in this form of fundraising if superintendents had this power.  It would also have helped many clubs over the last couple of months.  I am hopeful the Minister of State will take that proposal on board.  I am interested to hear his thoughts on it.</p>  <p>  While I do not want to wade into the issue of the FAI because the League of Ireland and FAI are at a sensitive point in their discussions, the FAI has always appeared to play the central role in Irish football.  It has always put itself forward as the main actor in Irish football to the detriment of grassroots soccer, our international football team and the League of Ireland, which only exists because its clubs have pulled themselves up by their boot straps.  The League of Ireland cannot be allowed to fall off the cliff.  There is an existential crisis and a feeling of despondency in the League of Ireland.  Who can blame it for that given that it has always been treated by the FAI as last on the list and never worthy of the investment and support it requires?  My colleagues, Deputies Andrews and Feighan, spoke about the club I support, Shamrock Rovers, and what it does in the community.  We can all point to what our League of Ireland clubs do and the reach they have in their local community.  They have done all of that themselves. </p> <p>I know the Minister sees that and agrees with it but I appeal to him and his Department because not only do clubs have to get through this crisis but we need to place the League of Ireland front and centre in Irish soccer.  They combine grassroots soccer and the international stage.  We all just about remember Stuttgart and Euro 1988, Italia 1990, USA 1994 and all these marquee events but it is the Friday nights in Tallaght Stadium, the Brandywell, Turners Cross and everywhere else that soccer thrives and needs to do so for the future.  I ask the Minister to bring that back and send it, through his Department, to the FAI and everyone else.</p> <p> As a boxing fan, I add my utter disturbance and disgust at what is going on with this proposed world heavyweight title fight.  Like many other boxing fans, I have always enjoyed world title fights.  I have ordered them on television and met friends to watch them.  I will be boycotting this title fight because it is a slur on the great sport of boxing and everything it has done at amateur and professional levels.  I think of the great work of promoters such as Brian Peters and the nights they have given us in Ireland, including Bernard Dunne fights.  I think of all the senior, intermediate and junior championships I have been at, the Olympic medals Irish boxers have won and the joy the sport has given.  This casts a slur over all of that.  I was used to reading about the dark side of boxing in history books, things that happened in Madison Square Garden in the 1930s and 1940s.  To think that it is happening in 2020, and that an Irish person is being attached to it and credited with putting this fight together, being part of the sport washing that is going on, is disgusting.  We can agree on how this is an abhorrence to us all.  I add my voice to what has been said before and what will be said after I have spoken and I simply take that to the Minister and the Minister of State.  I would appreciate any answers the Minister or Minister of State can give to the questions I have asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-06-11a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="22:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061100088#UUUU00200"><p>I will try to address as many of the issues as I can.  Under the sports capital programme, we want to be as flexible as possible to people who have already been granted funding.  We know that the drawdown time might be slower than it would have been pre-Covid-19.  There will be flexibility there.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about repurposing grants within clubs.  We ask any club whose circumstances have changed whereby a new priority has arisen, for example for other capital investment, to contact the Department directly.  The Department will try to be flexible and to facilitate such requests within reason.</p>  <p>  No decision has been made about the rolling out of the new round of grants.  At the moment, our focus is on the current funding and ensuring that clubs remain in existence.  I am not sensing a massive appetite from clubs to expand right now.  I am hearing that clubs would be happy to survive in a lot of cases.  That seems to be the general thrust of where clubs are at but we are looking at the review at the moment and will try to progress things as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  We have made contact at official level with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation about the restart grant.  I certainly would have liked to see clubs involved in that and it is unfortunate that they were excluded.  As there are 6,000 clubs on the online sports capital register, OSCAR, for sports capital loans, the demands from that scheme would have been significant.  I would like the clubs to be involved and to get some sort of a grant back from what they have already paid in.  We have made those approaches at official level.</p>  <p>  The large scale sport infrastructure fund now covers swimming pools.  The old local authority swimming pool programme is now covered by the large scale fund.  In January, seven of the successful projects announced had a swimming pool element, so such projects did quite well, proportionately speaking.  That is the appropriate avenue.  No date has been decided yet for the opening of the next round of applications for the large scale fund but that will be a suitable avenue for those applications in the future.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about fundraising mechanisms and their legality.  I cannot answer him straight away.  I will ask the officials in the Department to look at and explore that to see if they can remove any red tape or snags that are there to try and give clubs that option.  I was talking to my local GAA chairman last night about the club lottery and now that people are going to shops again, there might be a chance to get that going.  We know it can be difficult to get things going online.  Some people tend to buy one annual ticket whereas if they were buying them on a weekly basis, they might buy two or three.  There are difficulties there.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I take the future of the League of Ireland seriously.</p> <p>We worked so hard at the end of last year and the start of this year to get that package of supports in place for the FAI to ensure that there would be a future for the organisation and of course the League of Ireland as well.  The supports that were provided to the FAI at the time ensured that the league would be able to continue.  Right now in our engagements with the NGBs, any support that will be going to the FAI for this period will include the requirement to support the League of Ireland as well.  I have not received a brief on how the meeting went today but I am expecting one later.  We are fully supportive of the league and want to see it flourish into the future.  A key cornerstone of rebuilding soccer in Ireland is that there would be greater emphasis on the league.</p></speech>

The loss of active sport and the coverage of sport across the various media has left a large gap.  We are all very glad to see sport returning, albeit very gradually.  It will be a long time before we see stadia full.  That has its own consequences.  We should acknowledge the work the volunteers in sport did throughout all of our communities in the non-sporting arena in supporting communities during Covid.  Such organised groups are so important and it is great to be able to call on them.  I support the call for a resilience fund.  It is absolutely essential.  Sport is a critical component of Irish life that needs to be supported.  It is essential that this includes areas of sport that have tended to do less well.  I refer to minority sports such as women's sports, for which it was always more difficult to get sponsorship, for all that this has been changing in recent years.</p>  <p>  Not having a committee system in the Oireachtas at the moment is a real problem because there are number of issues we could be dealing with, not least pre and post-Covid issues but also things like the FAI.  We had a lot of engagement at the committee in respect of it.  I also refer to the Irish Greyhound Board, although that it is under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  An Indecon report published in the past month paints a terrible picture of the sector, whose representatives have been in front of the Committee of Public Accounts in recent years.  It has received &euro;16.8 million from the Government this year and in the region of &euro;14.7 million has already been drawn down.  That report will have to be looked at.  It is the most supported sport in the country.  When we start looking at the other sports that require attention, we really have to question that.</p>  <p>  I want to ask some questions concerning the FAI.  In doing so, I want to place on record my absolute commitment to, and support for, the League of Ireland.  I recognise that there are very individual issues in that regard and the FAI has to be seen as a separate issue.  A complaint was made to FIFA and, I think, UEFA as well in recent weeks about the Government's involvement through the memorandum of understanding.  Is the memorandum of understanding nailed down?  Is it Government backed or is it a question awaiting the Minister's successor?  It is important that we get this nailed down.  On the six-six deal with the casting vote of the chairperson, did the Minister anticipate that arrangement not being voted through at the FAI council?  What progress has been made on removing people from the board who have been on it for ten or more years?</p> <p>People not moving on was one of the main issues.  We cannot miss this opportunity for a new dawn.  Covid has interrupted a lot of good work.</p> <p> Has FIFA made its view known on the six-by-six arrangement?  Is the Minister concerned that none of the new FAI committees established last year has met since?  Can he confirm that the visionary group trio from the FAI met officials from the Department yesterday?  Were their discussions about Covid relief alone or were other matters raised?</p> <p> Last month, a partner with the professional services of PricewaterhouseCoopers quit the FAI's audit risk and compliance committee citing its lack of progress.  That is a real red flag.  Will the Minister comment on that.  Important questions were raised in January by Andrew Doyle and Larry Bass.  No financial information was being made available to the finance committee.  This is the type of thing we debated last year.  It is terribly disappointing that we are starting to see the same issues arise again.</p> <p> Questions are being asked about the selection of Mr. Roy Barrett.  Did the Minister play any role in his selection?  Did he have any communications with the headhunting firm in compiling the list of nominees?</p></speech>

That said, I stand absolutely foursquare behind the chairman, Mr. Barrett.  He is doing a job which has completely and utterly disassociated him from the old guard.  The six-all division the Deputy mentioned is part of that, but I completely reject the absurd suggestion from Deputy MacSharry that there is some overlap or an association in any way between the old and the new FAI boards.  Mr. Barrett has, as far as I know, no association whatever.</p></speech>

It is obvious that there are still some reactionary forces in the FAI.  They are not in favour of this arrangement.  That is coming up on 6 July.  I do not think the delay is due to any sinister reasons, but, rather, to Covid.  We must be aware that there are still people in the FAI who are trying to delay the reforms, and I am determined that should not happen.  We should remember that the money the Government is giving the FAI, which is the Deputy's money and that of other taxpayers, is conditional upon a reformed organisation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked whether the memorandum of understanding was Government backed.  Yes, it is.  I see no reason it should be withdrawn or why there should be any give in that regard.  I cannot say what the new Government will do but I can say what this Government is doing.  The memorandum of understanding is totally backed by the Government.  The FIFA representative was there when it was signed, which is a sign of approval.  The deal was done by four bodies, with the support of the Bank of Ireland, the FAI and FIFA.</p> <p>I think the memorandum of understanding is rock solid and it will remain so.</p></speech>

We know that in January the FAI was in danger of insolvency.  It was in a critical situation.  The people who went in there had far more to lose than gain by doing so.  They need our support in order to try to get the FAI and soccer in general to a better place.  They have made some progress.  Rome was not built in a day.  As already stated, they inherited an organisation that was in a critical situation.  They have a lot of work to do.  They have not got everything done yet but progress is being made.</p></speech>

Those clubs and their activities have been badly missed in our communities and they will need ongoing supports from the Department when they reopen.</p>  <p>  There has been much talk tonight about integration and equality.  There has also been much talk in recent months about flattening the curve.  One Deputy used the term "breathtaking inequality" to described how sports capital funding is administered by the Department.  We have had some spectacular examples of that and the Minister has left us a legacy of them.  A sum of &euro;150,000 went to resurface the hockey pitch at Wesley college, a private school, and &euro;150,000 was also provided to Loreto high school Beaufort, another private school, for resurfacing a pitch.</p>  <p>  I represent a part of the inner city of Dublin that is one of the most deprived and economically disadvantaged areas in the country.  Between the two canals, there are approximately 40 clubs that require playing fields and there is no space for their teams to play on.  There is an obvious reason for this, which is that any time land is available, it is siphoned off for development by wealthy developers because it is considered to be very valuable.  I will take as an example St. Kevin's hurling club in Dolphin's Barn, which does outstanding work to integrate local youth.  It is a problem to get local kids involved and to keep them involved in sport in the area.  They have had a chunk of their pitch, which was a small enough playing space, taken from them for the development of private apartments.  That is really shameful but it can go ahead because of lax planning regulations in the city.  Let us imagine that between the two canals, there is no space for the teams put out by 40 clubs to play on.  The clubs have to travel outside their areas to access decent sporting facilities.  I would love to see us try to flatten the curve in the context of the inequality that exists in how we treat various areas and in how land, money and facilities are allocated to these very densely-populated communities in order to allow people to play sports and to facilitate and develop sports.</p>  <p>  Due to the fact that people from the clubs to which I refer have to travel outside their areas, I want the Minister to address the question of public transport.  Can he imagine, as we try to move back to what may be the new normal, hundreds adults and children from these clubs travelling on public transport, whether it is on Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann, on short or long journeys and without proper protection?  The Government is being utterly hypocritical because there is much talk that masking should be used and that it is advisable.  We heard from the WHO this morning that the suggestion that masking should be mandatory on public transport is perfectly reasonable.</p> <p>Making it mandatory would put an onus on the State to provide masks.  We are all familiar with the scenes at transport hubs in Madrid, in the cities in Italy and in places across Austria and Germany where representatives of the state stand there and hand out masks to passengers as they move in and out of public transport facilities.  That is what must be done here.</p> <p> I will use the example of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I have spoke to the Minister about this previously.  The protocols for return to work were issued on 9 May, some 33 days ago.  It was only last week that the health and safety council of Bus &Eacute;ireann finally held a Zoom meeting of all its national representatives to discuss what can be done.  What can be done has not been done and those involved have wasted 33 days in making preparations for a return to something like normality.  The Minister knows, as I do, that we will eventually have to provide more capacity on buses and that masking will be key to this.  Protecting drivers will also be key.  Some 35 drivers in the Broadstone depot alone have been sent home with symptoms of the virus.  The statistics of deaths among bus drivers in London and New York, which, I admit, are much bigger cities, are very high - 42 in London and 120 in New York.  For the sake of both passengers and those who work on buses, we need to do much more.  The Minister's role in the context of intervening with the National Transport Authority is crucial because Bus &Eacute;ireann drivers have been driving around without adequate protective screening.</p> <p> We heard recently from Professor Kingston Mills of Trinity College that what is required on public transport is proper air filtering.  I refer to a system involving the use of high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters, that will trap the virus.  The systems we have on our buses are totally inadequate and 70% of the vehicles in the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet do not have windows that passengers can open.  This means that the virus could be circulating in the are on these buses.  The situation is extremely dangerous situation and it has to be looked at with a certain urgency.</p> <p> Apart from all of the other issues to do with the lack of health and safety on buses, the Cabinet needs to address the question of sourcing masks and giving those who operate public transport hubs the capacity to issue masks in order that we can protect passengers as they move towards returning to work and, in particular, in the case to which I refer, if we want communities to have their children re-engage in sport.  To begin to move to what might be the new normal, we have to protect them as well.  This will be an important challenge that the Department must take up.</p> <p> I would also like the Minister to address the question of the breathtaking inequality in the way sports capital funding is dished out to communities.  I will take him around my constituency and show him the dearth of facilities in areas where the population is dense and, as I stated earlier, most economically deprived.  I would like to have the Minister address those two questions.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely correct.  Two private schools were each given grants of &euro;150,000.  First, as I have stated previously when the Deputy raised has raised this matter, under the weightings that were in place at that time, every local club in every constituency in Dublin got the maximum amount if its application was valid, so it did not prove to be contentious.  Second, there has been a misunderstanding recently - I do not whether it is deliberate - that the Minister moves around and makes funny decisions about these grants.  In those particular cases - exactly the same happened this year - the grants and the appeals were referred to the various Ministers as recommended by the civil servants.  It did not happen always in previous years that Ministers refused to introduce an element of discretion for themselves.  In the past two rounds, at no stage did I ever use my discretion in terms of the sports capital grants.</p></speech>

The schools came up for the grant and were signed off.  In fact, both of the private schools failed in the first round and I signed off on that.  They then won on appeal and I signed off on that.  That is how it happened.</p>  <p>  A different point the Deputy made is very fair, namely, that there would be more merit in giving the grants to disadvantaged schools.  A further change in the recent round gave a more favourable weighting to disadvantaged schools.  I would be delighted to go around the Deputy's constituency with her to see the disadvantaged schools to which she refers.  I am sure they would be eligible for the grants, and if they do not own their property or land, they will certainly be eligible for equipment grants.</p></speech>

Again, we thank our health services.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has presented significant challenges to many sectors but the Minister's portfolio of transport, tourism and sport is seeing especially significant fallout.  My questions largely relate to transport and, in particular, buses.  The Minister has acknowledged that the 2 m social distancing provision required at the moment means that only 20% of capacity can be used on a normal bus route.  If it was reduced to 1 m, there would be up to 40% capacity.  One does not have to be a genius to understand that no business can operate viably with a reduction in income of between 40% and 60% and up to 80%.  Will the Minister give assurances that his Department will continue to support the provision of moneys to the public transport sector to overcome the losses it is suffering at this time?</p>  <p>  Private bus operators run a number of scheduled services, both under public service obligations, PSOs, and in their own right.  In order for them to remain viable, they will need an income support, either per seat or per journey, in the form of some type of a capitation grant.  Otherwise, they will not be able to sustain business nor return to it.</p>  <p>  On tourism, a number of Northern Irish operators provide bus services out of Dublin Airport, for which we are very grateful because this supports tourism throughout the country.  How might this service be affected in the event of a WTO-rules Brexit outcome?</p>  <p>  In the case of the PSO contracts that exist between Bus &Eacute;ireann and private bus operators, parents and employers will need to have visibility before September as to what the situation will be with a return to operation by the providers.</p></speech>

I brought to the Cabinet last week a memo with information to the effect that we would be seeking another &euro;460 million for public transport for this year.  This is a substantial amount.  The Deputy will understand that what has happened already this year has used up the allocation.  I can assure him tonight that the services will continue and that they are not in any jeopardy whatsoever.  The Deputy can be assured that whatever the financial situation, the services are not in danger.</p></speech>

Will he consider supporting a VAT rate of 0% for the private bus and coach operators?  I am aware that he has been lobbied on this.  There is a VAT anomaly in respect of Northern Ireland, as he probably knows.  He should give the operators a level playing field and allow them to have some revenue retention in terms of their business model.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister working with the Department of Finance and the Department of Education and Skills on the issue of school buses returning?</p>  <p>  Regarding the tourism recovery task force, will the Minister consider allowing a representative of the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland to be a member?</p>  <p>  Let me move on to another area.  I do not expect an answer now but I would appreciate a written one.  The Minister recently provided &euro;15 million for sea transport to the ferry operators.  I understand the supports did not extend to some of the ferry operations with regard to the provision of services to facilitate the ports.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to me detailing the expenditure heads and recipients of the funding.</p>  <p>  On outdoor sport, we have been given a lift with the return this weekend and next week of Gaelic games, soccer and such sports.  As a juveniles coach, I believe it is great news for kids and others involved.  Maybe the Minister will indicate when he believes the clubs that depend on gate revenue will see spectators in attendance again.</p>  <p>  May I highlight what has already been said in the House today regarding boxing?  Everybody in this House and, I am sure, the public at large are appalled at the rebranding of a high-level member of an Irish drug cartel alleged to be involved in murder and serious crime as an international promoter of boxing renown.  I hope the Minister's departmental officials are doing everything they can to liaise with the amateur boxing associations to make sure this gentleman and his contacts are not liaising with our amateur boxers or acting as agents for them.  We should certainly be making a very principled stand on that.</p>  <p>  With regard to tourism and hospitality, we heard from Dr. David Nabarro of the WHO this morning.  It appeared to have been suggested with regard to bar food and restaurant servings that a large component will have to involve self-service.  Can the Minister say anything on the economic planning that might give comfort to the many thousands of small business owners and employers in the tourism and hospitality sector?</p>  <p>  Sun holidays look unviable for many this year.  Has the Minister's Department considered any significant communications campaign to try to highlight the idea of Irish staycations and to build support for buy-Irish and stay-in-Ireland campaigns for the tourism sector this year?</p></speech>

He is very prolific.  Well done.  I will do what I can.

Once we have made the appointments, it is up to it to do what it can and, presumably, invite people in.</p> <p>There is always a large number of bodies that feel they should be represented when we set up these groups.  It is a very good group that the Deputy suggests but there are other people on the body who can represent those interests very adequately.</p> <p> On Brexit, I think the cross-Border bus service can and will continue without any Brexit deal.  We had all the arrangements for buses and the Enterprise train service in place and ready last time for a no-deal Brexit and I presume they persist.  I cannot speak to what will happen in December or the months to come but those provisions will be ready if a no-deal scenario emerges.  I will revert to the Deputy on the ferry operators and any other questions he asked.</p> <p> I will comment on the staycations and the tourist and hospitality sector before bringing in the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin.  The outlook for staycations is far better than it was six weeks or even three weeks ago.  There is a great impetus for people to open and they are doing so.  Six weeks or five weeks ago people were not looking forward to holidays here at all and it was said that tourism was dead but there is life in the tourism industry as a result of the lifting of restrictions.</p></speech>

We will require the guidance of NPHET on mass gatherings.  We are aware of how important it is for sporting organisations to have people in attendance at live events but we do not know how much we will be able to permit as time goes on.  If we can continue in the right direction with respect to new cases and containing the virus as we have done, I hope there will be some scope in the matter for the second half of the year.</p>  <p>  With regard to the boxing matter, I informed the House earlier that I have asked officials to draft correspondence to broadcasters, including BT and Sky, as well as to my counterpart in the UK, to express our outrage.  I am very concerned about the reputation of boxing in this country and particularly the confusion that may arise with amateur boxing, for example.  It is very unfair on those involved.</p>  <p>  We are looking for the lowest possible rate for the tourism and hospitality sector as we know it would bring a major advantage to the industry.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a major campaign planned to encourage people to holiday at home this year, and the acceleration of the roadmap has facilitated that.</p></speech>

The Minister, Mr. Ross, and, I am certain, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, have visited his hotel during their time in the Oireachtas.  He has indicated that he has written to the energy regulator as over &euro;9,000 has been wasted by being taken from him in the form of fixed standing charges, site charges, skip charges, wastage, and charges of minimum demand for electricity and gas over the last three months.  The hotel is closed and although the reception is open, it is not open to the public.  There are people answering the phones.  He is being hit with these standing charges so are there any relevant emergency rules in this regard?  Where is the regulator in this when utility companies can charge &euro;9,000 in these circumstances?  That is savage money.</p>  <p>  Insurance is an even bigger problem because the business pays &euro;100,000 per annum for the year running from January to December.  The business cannot get any credit or guarantee of extra time being allowed on the policy from the insurance company.  He has been told that it might look at a discount when it reviews the matter next year.  D&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i.  Live horse and get grass.  That is ridiculous.  We are talking about a very important and flagship hotel in my constituency in south Tipperary on the banks of the Suir.</p> <p>Everybody else is in the same position.  This is only one but whether it be pubs, restaurants or whatever they are all the same.  These standing charges have crept in for these companies in the past ten or 15 years.  We have a regulator for every one of them but the regulator is useless, toothless and fruitless.  This man wrote to the regulator.  Why is this allowed?  He is not using the facilities.  He does not mind paying a minimum charge but that is daylight robbery.  Something has to be done in that regard if we are to recover what is now a struggling tourism industry because it has stopped.  We must try to reincarnate it and get it going.  From the small bed and breakfast premises to the big hotel, the people on the greenways and the blueways who are renting out boats and kayaks, the ice cream shops, the taxis or the small minibus operators, we need all of them.  We are depending on ourselves.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  I am appealing to people to shop local, stay local and "staycation" this year.  They are telling us it is too dangerous to fly so let us support our own country and our own people.</p> <p> On the VAT rate, the Taoiseach said today that he could not apply a 1% VAT rate because of EU rules.  To hell with the EU rules.  We are too used to kowtowing and implementing EU rules.  We are Ireland and we want to recover and have a modicum of a livelihood for our wonderful families.  Many of whom have ordinary family businesses that are growing and provide a massive amount of employment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, knows about Kerry and the Minister, Mr. Ross, has seen it.  He has also visited places in Tipperary with me, for which I thank him.</p> <p> While I am at it, we used to be an-chairde ar fad; we were great friends.  I wish the Minister well in his retirement and thank him for his engagement in the many issues on which I dealt with him.  The only area on which we had a difference was the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.  He decided not to like me because I had a different view, and that is a pity.  We need to hear all views in this House and we need to work together.  I wish him a happy retirement with his wife, Ruth, and family.  I hear he is writing a book.  He will probably put me into it but whatever he does, I wish him luck.  I mean that from the bottom of my heart.</p> <p> The tourism industry is in a bad state.  It needs to be nurtured and stimulated but the carry-on with regard to hotels is not right.  I had another hotel owner on to me who was trying to avail of the restart grant through the county council on the rates side.  If one has paid the rates this year, one can avail of it.  However, he did not have his taxes up to date because the doors closed suddenly on that date in March and he could not have them up to date.  For this year, for people who paid by direct debit or whatever the tap was turned off on their businesses.  Revenue must be flexible in this regard.  I am not talking about outstanding tax bills going back over a year.  I am talking about the current situation.  The Minister must tell the people in Revenue to take a hands-off approach in terms of the accounts for this year.  It cannot get blood out of a stone.  It cannot get money out of people who are not earning money.  It is as simple as that.  We need the young people working in those hotels again.  We need the housewives working in them again to help them put their children through college.  We need them badly.</p> <p> We need the ferry operators and the bus operators.  I refer to the school transport buses.  Private bus owners who mainly do a school transport service are still getting nothing.  Anyone contracted to Bus &Eacute;ireann is getting a 50% payment, which we welcome and thank the Minister for putting in place.  However, the private bus owners, and there are many, service the hills and the glens of Tipperary, Kerry and elsewhere because Bus &Eacute;ireann will not go to those areas.  Parents organise the routes for themselves.  The buses have to be tested, insured and above board, which is only right and proper.  Those bus owners are not getting a penny, and because many of the drivers and operators are over 66 years of age they are not getting any other payment.  It might only be a one-man operation.  That is a huge lacuna and it is very unfair because we have bedlam every September with students not getting a bus ticket but what if we did not have the bus operators to bring the students to school?  In my town, Denis Whelan runs a one-man operation and there are many more of them, including Mr. Tuohy in Nenagh.  They do not pay rates because they have a mobile bus that is parked beside the house or in a yard.  They are not in a building so they do not pay rates and therefore cannot avail of the grant.  That will be a serious issue for the pupils going back to school if the bus owners do not the grant.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that.</p> <p> As stated by a previous speaker, the PSO funding is an important issue also.</p> <p> With regard to driver tests, if one can take a taxi why can one not do a driver test?  I know of hundreds of people who are waiting for driver tests or for theory tests, although I believe they are starting up again now.  When are the National Car Test, NCT, centres in my county going to reopen and will the lifts be working when they do?  People are driving around now and we are not sure about their cars.  I support the NCT 100%.  I especially support inspection of the undercarriage: the chassis, brakes, steering, wheels, stub axles and everything else in the area underneath.  This is vital.  If the lifts are not working many of us could be driving defective vehicles.  We are paying for the NCT but it is a farce because that is the most important part.  It includes the steering rack and so on.  Will the Minister answer those few questions if he can?</p></speech>

I will address those issues further in another place.</p><p>I will now address the issue of insurance, about which the Deputy asked.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I met with representatives of Insurance Ireland to highlight and discuss some of the difficulties being experienced by the sector, some of which the Deputy referred to a few minutes ago.</p><p>With regard to the failure to pay out under business interruption cover, which is one of the big problems, policies are not designed to cover pandemics.  The Deputy will be aware of this.  Insurance works on the basis that only a small percentage of clients make claims.  Paying for a pandemic would, unfortunately, require payments to as many as 100% of clients in certain categories.  No insurance company could remain solvent were it to pay out to 100% of its clients.  Companies can only pay out where pandemics are specifically covered by the policy.  This is only the case for a small number.  </p><p>Insurance Ireland has made a commitment that, where businesses are closed and this has changed the level of cover required, a <i>pro rata</i>rebate will be given in the form of cash.  It has asked insurers to sign up to this measure and expect it to happen.  Chief executive officers say the number of inquiries is actually low and that there have been no rejections of applications to adjust cover that is not required during closure.</p></speech>

I will be brief enough.  We need to acknowledge what clubs across the country have done.  They have brought shopping to people who have been cocooning.  This was especially the case for GAA clubs both in my area and right around the country.  It is not only them however.  Many other clubs have put their shoulder to the wheel and helped those people who were having a difficult time.  We should acknowledge that and praise the work they did.  I welcome what the Ministers have done with regard to the likes of the League of Ireland.  It is important.</p> <p>I have a few brief questions for the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin.  Affiliations and funds in GAA clubs around the country are low.  Indeed, that applies to soccer clubs, rugby clubs and all sports.  Is there anything available to help them to keep ticking over and keep the lights on?  Regarding the sports capital grants for 2020, when does he expect the programme to be open to clubs?  I smiled when I heard Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  If there is no pitch between the two canals, I wish some of them would come down the country.  Sometimes we have to join teams together for smaller clubs so they would be quite welcome.</p> <p> Turning to the Minister, I wish him well.  When the clubs and all sports are getting up and running again, and in line with what Deputy Mattie McGrath said, when does he envisage the driver testing resuming for youngsters who might be starting college in September?  They have the theory test done and have completed enough lessons.  When can the driver testing get up and running again?</p> <p> There is another matter I wish to raise.  I do not expect the Minister to be aware of it but perhaps he is.  At Dublin Airport there are proposals to lay off 30 staff from Boeing.  There are 19 out of 23 engineers.  Funnily enough, the Irish engineers were the first to get competence on the Boeing 737 MAX.  The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, issues the maintenance approval and then they have to get separate certificates for the different aeroplanes.  Some engineers would have come here from England and got it.  They are using it in Gatwick.  It is ironic that nobody will be laid off in Gatwick even though they would not be Irish engineers.  With Brexit approaching is the IAA aware that the E145 maintenance approval, as it is called, is being used in Gatwick?  At the same time there is a threat that hangars will be closing in Dublin.  While we must bear in mind that approximately 62% of the leasing of aircraft comes through this country, the staff were the first trained in Ireland.</p> <p> Nobody denies that there are difficulties in the aviation industry, but there will also be opportunities.  Can we ensure that those highly trained Irish people are not sacrificial lambs whereby places like Gatwick will stay open ahead of those in this country?  It is ironic that many of the engineers in Gatwick were only taken on lately compared with the people here in Ireland.  I ask the Minister to talk to the IAA about this E145 maintenance approval.  I am not alleging anything, but I am saying that it would be worth examining.  It is being used in England and if there is a hard Brexit how does that operate when it is a European approval?  We have engineers here who are competent.  They were the first to do it and they are flown all over the world.  It gives them the right to do that once they have it.  It is looking like they will be at home.</p></speech>

We have been engaging with the national governing bodies through the sports monitoring group and with the Federation of Irish Sport, the Olympic Federation of Ireland and representatives of athletes.  We know funding will be needed to try to get sport in Ireland past this phase.  As part of that, we envisage that an element of that funding will go to a resilience fund for local sports clubs.  How that will be administered has yet to be decided.  I would envisage that it will go through Sport Ireland and that the national governing bodies will make a pitch for the clubs that are most exposed and in danger of going out of business.</p> <p>We know that every club could do with a financial boost.  We also know that for some clubs, if they do not get it, it will be the end of the road.  That is what we want to avoid initially and that is what we are working on.</p> <p> On the sports capital programme, earlier in the year we were pretty much ready to go with a new round.  However, there is a transition in Government circles but Covid is also a significant factor.  The question that needs to be asked is if there is a pressing need at the moment for a sports capital programme.  Are clubs looking to expand their capital situations in terms of investments?  The problem for most clubs is very much about current funding.  These factors need to be considered.  We are in a position to open up a new scheme quite soon.  Again, we will need to see how the situation on the current front evolves in that regard.</p></speech>

Although it does not have the resources to do what it would like to do, it certainly has political support.</p>  <p>  When the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I met the League of Ireland clubs, it was quite apparent they represented the beating heart of Irish football but also that of communities.  They are just too important to ignore, let go or in any way not support.  I am very hopeful.  I do not know the result of this evening's meeting.  It may have been rather difficult because there is constantly a funding problem.  I have absolutely no doubt, however, that there is goodwill there.  There is a great deal more goodwill than there was under the old regime.  The break in regime will help.  Funding will be a problem but we are very supportive of the League of Ireland.  We are looking for a package for sport in general.  We hope that we will be able to support the League of Ireland in some way out of that.  I am not making any promises of any sort but that is our ambition.</p>  <p>  On the aviation issue which the Deputy raised, I will convey his views to the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  I can go no further than that at this point.</p>  <p>  On driver testing, I presume the Deputy is referring to the actual testing of drivers and people queuing up.  He is right.  There is a big problem.  It is very obvious what the problem is.  The oral testing obviously can start earlier as it is easy enough.  I really could not understand why it could not be done earlier than this.  However, that was the advice we got.  It is obviously one of the last things that will fall when restrictions are lifted because it is, as far as I know, almost impossible to carry out a driver test without sitting beside or very close to the driver tester.  That is obviously one of the biggest health risks going.  It is a great pity but we cannot sort it overnight without breaching the social distance rules in existence.  When NPHET recommends that driver testing should go ahead, I will be the last person to stand in its way.</p></speech>
