I am open to engaging with the organisers of the Web Summit with a view to the summit staying in Dublin in the future and they have indicated this is something they wish to consider.  However, the organisers were clear about their intention to leave and that it was a commercial matter for the organisers to consider and upon which to decide.  I wish them the best of luck in the future and of course would be delighted were this event to return to Ireland in the future.  In considering how that might happen, my Department will play any role it can to facilitate such a return.  It should be noted, however, that F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to work with the international conferencing sector to win events and many other events continue to choose Dublin and Ireland as their host destination.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been directly involved in winning 188 international events to take place here over the next four years.  This represents &euro;151 million of confirmed business with more than 110,000 international business tourists.  Additionally, F&aacute;ilte Ireland currently is competing for more than &euro;150 million of other conferencing business for Dublin alone within the same period. </p>  <p>  International sporting events also are targeted by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to bring larger numbers of visitors to Ireland.  During 2015, some &euro;10 million of sporting business was confirmed and the current pipeline is strong with an estimated value of up to &euro;70 million against confirmed and potential events for Ireland to 2020.  This includes the College Football Classic, Boston College versus Georgia Tech, in September, which will bring with it an estimated 15,000 US visitors.  We can also look forward to hosting the Women's Rugby World Cup in 2017, as well as staging part of the UEFA Euro 2020 soccer championships. </p></reply>

This represents a &euro;100 million loss to the economy next year with the loss of 40,000 people visiting the city, staying in hotels, eating in restaurants and spending their money.  The only response from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance along the way has been that another conference will be found to fill the slot.  This fails to understand and recognise the importance of this event and what it does to the technology sector, to small and medium-sized enterprises trying to get a start and to attracting foreign investment to support such companies.  Moreover, to state on behalf of the Government it now is "open to engaging" is somewhat akin to telling somebody one is open to the idea of closing the door after the horse has bolted.  The first thing the Government must do is to engage proactively with the promoters but nowhere do I get any sense of urgency from the Government.  As for explaining it away by stating it is a commercial matter, it is not a commercial matter.  Mr. Cosgrave and others have been clear there are infrastructural and organisational issues which, were they addressed, could have retained the event here.</p></speech>

It was one of the most successful and largest conferences in Europe and the world this year-----</p></speech>

I accept the transport, tourism and sport Department for which the Minister is responsible is not the key Ministry but I believe that were he to take a leap of faith, the Minister could have a meaningful impact on the long-term outcome with regard to bringing it back.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy the loss of the event to Dublin is a significant business loss and I always have acknowledged that.  Alongside this, however, I will make two points to the Deputy, the first being that one might consider the degree of support the Government and State agencies have provided to this event in recent years.  When the event first began in 2010, it had just over 400 attendees whereas last year, more than 22,000 people attended the event.  When Government agencies and various Departments were actively involved in supporting this growth, this support was never acknowledged; nor should it be because the Government was supporting an Irish company here that was doing excellent work and employing people.  However, I am confident that strong plans were available in respect of all the matters raised by the organisers of the Web Summit regarding transport and the availability of hotel rooms.</p><p>I simply respect the fact that the organisers made a commercial decision about the growth of the event and the ability of Dublin to support it in the future.  We will be aiming to win that business back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100004#B00200"><p>We will all have a different view about how we got to the position we are in but we need to park that.  I do not get the sense from Government that there is a real structured approach to finding a solution.  The Web Summit is just over.  Yes, the organisers have made a decision but could this decision be changed?  There is an offer and they seem to have begun the work with Lisbon but is it too late to convince them that Dublin is the right venue for next year?  I do not get the sense from Government that anybody has even sought to ask Mr. Cosgrave or the promoters generally whether there is still an opportunity at the 11th hour to keep the event here.  Like many other events, once it goes for one year, the chances are that it will be gone for quite a few.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100004#B00300"><p>A structured approach is in place in respect of winning and supporting these events.  This is the very structure that has delivered the kind of success I outlined to the Deputy a moment ago.  A total of 188 international events will take place in Dublin over the next four years.  The National Convention Centre is exceptionally busy, as are other venues throughout the country, with the kind of structures for which the Deputy is calling and which are working in winning business to our country and supporting those events when they arrive here.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked me about next year.  Given all the water that has flowed under this particular bridge, I would be surprised if there was to be any change in respect of the location of the event next year.  All the relevant Ministers and I, along with our agencies, will work to see if there are other events of a similar nature that could be attracted to Dublin over the coming years.  We will then work with the organisers of the Dublin Web Summit to see if there are other activities or events they are organising that could be supported in Dublin while putting a proposition to them to see if the larger event can be won back to our capital city.</p></speech>

The contract the RSA has in place with Applus+ to carry out the NCT requires that specific standards in a number of areas be met, including customer waiting times, customer satisfaction and test integrity.  I understand this contract sets out specific penalties for not meeting performance requirements which the RSA continually monitors.</p><p>Both the testing system and vehicle inspectors are subject to a stringent audit system.  All test centres frequently receive unannounced visits and vehicle inspectors are observed undertaking tests and check tests, which involve vehicles just tested being immediately re-inspected.  These show that over 99% of tests are correctly assessed.</p><p>The NCTS is currently providing a seven-day-a-week service with late openings at least three days a week to 10 p.m. at all centres.  Twenty-four hour testing is provided at Northpoint and Deansgrange centres in Dublin.  A third shift is in place at Enniscorthy, Ballina, Galway, Kells and Drogheda which provides testing from 7 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. four days per week.</p><p>I am informed that the average waiting time for a full test during October was 9.25 days.  Retests requiring the use of test equipment are facilitated within three days and visual retests are available without appointment.  There is currently no backlog at the NCTS.</p><p>The NCTS is planning to increase testing facilities further with the provision of new test centres at a number of locations due to come into operation in the first half of 2016.  A total of 588 vehicle inspectors are employed and a further 26 will be available at the start of next year, the highest total number in the history of the NCT.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.  </i></p><p>​  Regarding retests, only road safety related fail items require retesting.  The main fail items in 2014 were suspension, tyre condition, brakes, stop lamps and headlamp aim.  These are not minor items and it is in the interest of road safety that such items are working correctly.  Retests not requiring the use of a test lane are provided free of charge and without appointment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100004#B00700"><p>High failure rates and an apparently high number of retests have been brought to my attention.  A discrepancy seems to exist in that pass rates are far higher in some areas than in others.  Although the Minister says that waiting lists are down to a certain level, it seems that people are booking many months in advance and still have to wait a long time.  There is a danger of a fine if their car is stopped or a Garda looks at their car for any reason.</p>  <p>  Some incidences of failure involve things like a tester refusing to test a car because it contains dog hairs and a damaged bulb, which can be replaced fairly quickly.  When a car is retested, half the rate is charged.  Some of the retesting is over the top.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100004#B00800"><p>In respect of some of the items that can cause a car to fail the NCT, I would respectfully say to the Deputy that a bulb that is not working, which can in turn cause an indicator or light not to work, is not a minor item.  It might feel like one now but as we can see with the nights getting longer and the days getting wetter, having indicators and lamps that work is a very important part of keeping a car prepared and safe.  I am sure the Deputy agrees with me on this point.</p>  <p>  I dealt with the time involved in testing about a year ago.  I am aware that we hear about people who go to book a test and the length of time involved in waiting for that test.  Against that, I would say that the average waiting time for such a test is improving at 9.25 days.  I hope it gives people the possibility of having their cars tested in a reasonably prompt fashion.</p>  <p>  I urge anybody who is due a test next January, February or March to book the test as soon as possible because this matter does develop at this time of the year every year.  I remind the House that a person can get their car tested three months early without having to change the date after that.  This is another change that has been introduced to try to moderate the demand for these tests, all of which have the objective of trying to make cars and thereby our roads safer.</p></speech>

I am not saying that this always happens.  I would consider a bulb that is not working to be a serious matter but a person can go from A to B on the way to a test centre and something can happen to cause a bulb not to work.  I do not see why the charge should be so high and this is an area where people are being penalised.  I dealt with a case where a tester would not entertain the car because there were a few dog hairs in it.  This is a bit much and needs to be looked at.</p>  <p>  I know we are dealing with a private company and Applus+ has a contract with the RSA but it is a pity that much of this money is not going back into road safety, which is where it should be going.</p><p>I have concerns about this process, including the speeding up of the test, which the company says is an efficiency measure but could lead to further health and safety issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100005#C00200"><p>One of the causes of this is the decision I made over a year ago to include the NCT in the fixed charge system.  I did this following advice I received and based on my own judgment that the quality and safety of cars and their roadworthiness continued to be a factor in our roads not being as safe as we would like.  The statistics in regard to what has happened since that change was made indicate, I would contend, that it was the right change to make.  For example, the number of NCT tests carried out this year to date has increased by 11% on what they were a year ago.  This is on the back of last year being the highest year on record in relation to the number of vehicles on which an NCT test was carried out.  While we did not increase the penalty so to speak in relation to the inclusion of the NCT into the fixed charge system we did change the nature of the penalty such that it is now a sanction that can be more easily applied.  This has led to more people having their cars tested, leading, in turn, to increased road safety.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's point regarding dog hairs in a car, I cannot comment on any individual case but I would hope that the inspectors would inspect cars in nearly all circumstances given the importance of doing so from a road safety point of view.

A four week long An Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing about the controversial cruise berth proposal is still not complete.  Today, the Harbours Bill 2015, which deals with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour and other regional harbours is being dealt with in committee.  I have submitted 30 amendments to that Bill, debate on which, presumably, will be completed in the next few weeks.  </p>  <p>  The Bill lays out two options for the governance of harbours.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour will either be a quango - a subsidiary of the council - or it will be fully publicly controlled.  I would like to know from the Minister, because the Bill is not clear in this regard, which option will be chosen.  The people want it to be publicly controlled.</p></reply>

The  Harbours Bill 2015 was published on 1 July and Oireachtas debates on the Bill have commenced with Committee Stage scheduled for this morning, 11 November, which I will be taking.  The Bill will provide the legislative basis for one of the national ports policy's key recommendations, namely, that governance of the designated ports of regional significance should vest in more appropriate local authority led governance structures.  As the Deputy is aware, D&uacute;n Laoghaire is one of these five ports of regional significance.</p>  <p>  The Bill is designed to provide maximum legislative flexibility.  It will not prescribe the model of transfer for any of the five ports, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Instead, the Bill will allow for the most appropriate model of governance to be chosen in respect of each individual company.  The two possible models of transfer provided in the Bill are retention of the existing company structure and transfer of the ministerial shareholding in the company to the local authority and dissolution of the existing company structure and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into local authority structures, where the port will be administered as a functional area of the local authority.  The manner of transfer selected in each case will be the one that finds broad consensus and agreement between the parties.  However, it should be made clear that ultimately the decision is mine, as Minister.</p>  <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have established an engagement team to discuss the practical issues associated with the transfer and consultants have been appointed to undertake a due diligence process, with the funding support of the Department.  This exercise may assist in the decision as to the most suitable model of transfer.</p></speech>

This speaks volumes about the problem that I have been trying to convey to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his predecessor for the past four years.  We do not know what is going on in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and we do not know its financial position because it is not accountable.  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing which took place over the last four weeks was a pretty extraordinary event.  It is unprecedented for a hearing of that type to continue for four weeks.  The level of participation by stakeholders, harbour users, community groups and so on was extraordinary.  With the exception of the harbour company, there was overwhelming opposition to what the harbour company proposes to do with the harbour and overwhelming dissatisfaction about the fact that the public and harbour users have no influence or say in this process.  They are not being taken seriously and are systematically ignored.  </p>  <p>  The public view is that the harbour should be brought under public control, although under the control of the elected representatives of the council rather than the CEO.  We have proposed a stakeholders group that involves all of the people who are passionate and concerned and genuine stakeholders in the harbour.  What is the Minister's view on this?</p></speech>

First, I do not propose to comment on a matter that is currently before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Second, I already made clear to the Deputy in my response to his initial question that the due diligence process and the work under way will form an important part of the input into the decision that I will make as Minister.  I want that to be a decision that can gain consensus among all the parties involved but, ultimately, the Bill is clear that the decision in relation to the mode of transfer and how that will happen is one that I and my Department will make.  Third, and this is a matter that we can debate further in committee, while I recognise the role that stakeholder groups can play I am concerned, in the context of the amendment which the Deputy has tabled in this regard, about the prominence the Deputy would want that group to have in the decision-making process in relation to future transfers.  I believe it is important to respect the structures already in place, bearing in mind that the members of the local authorities are elected by the communities they represent.</p></speech>

I urge the Minister to support the principle of this amendment.  There is major dissatisfaction about the current situation.  I am not commenting on the individual cruise berth proposal, which we will also debate later.  I attended the hearings over the past four weeks, which were also attended by representatives of the public and representatives of community groups and harbour groups and so on.  It is a pity that these people did not sit down five years ago and talk.  We would not be in the situation and the conflict we are in now over the future of the harbour if all those people had been compelled to sit down years ago and work out a plan that everybody could get behind.  Instead, plans were hatched behind closed doors.  That has to change.</p></speech>

I have been involved in similar matters in my constituency, as well as in my ministerial role.  The need for consultation and involvement in any significant infrastructure project is evident to me.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to an amendment he will table on the Harbours Bill 2015 on the need for a local authority to consult actively and to be involved with a stakeholder group.  I genuinely differ with him on this.  I guess it is due to a point of difference in our understanding of local government.  Members of local authorities are either elected to represent local communities or they are not.  If they are elected to represent them, they should have the power and ability to do their work.  Depending on the matter with which they are dealing they, in conjunction with a local authority chief executive, can make that decision.  I am in favour of consultation and how that will happen.  Ultimately, we have models of local government in place which give power to different parts of local government.  They should be allowed to discharge that power in the way the legislation is established and, I also believe, in the way people who vote for local councillors expect them to do.</p></speech>

It is of fundamental importance to how people view the implementation of our law, particularly for dangerous driving.  ​Recent reports referred to by the Deputy suggested that only 40% of people charged with drink-driving offences are being convicted.  This figure is based on an interpretation of data provided by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality in a response to a parliamentary question.  My colleague was asked for, and provided, figures for the number of summonses for drink-driving cases and the number of convictions.  These figures were portrayed by treating convictions as a percentage of summonses leading to the false conclusion that 60% of cases taken to court led to acquittal.  The reality, as the Courts Service pointed out, is that 86% of drink driving cases which go to court result in convictions.</p>  <p>  The fundamental error in the portrayal and reporting of those figures is that the number of summonses in fact represents all summonses requested.  It includes those not yet processed, not yet issued, not yet served, or not yet come to court.   It also includes cases which are being dealt with by a court but have not concluded.</p>  <p>  On the reform of drink-driving penalties, legislation on intoxicated driving was last reviewed and consolidated in the Road Traffic Act 2010.  This is quite robust in dealing with driving under the influence of alcohol.  The Road Traffic Bill 2015 will seek to strengthen the law on driving under the influence of drugs.  The drafting of the Bill is being finalised.  It is my intention to commence the passage of this Bill through the House before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Is there any work under way in carrying out a comprehensive analysis of all the data as it relates to drunk driving?  There is a concern in some quarters that summonses are not issued or fail to get through the courts because of relatively basic mistakes.  An end-to-end analysis of all cases, particularly regarding drunk driving, needs to be done by the RSA or by the Department.  This will ensure a detailed chart of results is compiled with every case tracked and the outcome recorded for statistical purposes to get an overall picture.  Will the Minister, the Department and the RSA start this work and chart it right the way through?  It is only then we will get to understand where the problems lie.</p>  <p>  It is not enough to give the general point that a percentage fall through the cracks in the courts system and that is the way it works.  We need to codify that and understand where the problems are.  Then we can, as we have before, come up with a legislative response in a bipartisan way which will eliminate, to the greatest extent possible, any opportunity for anybody to evade or avoid justice on this particular matter.</p></speech>

That is why we are examining matters such as the new database that would integrate information between a driver licence and the details of a car.  That is also why we want to make available the third payment option for next year.</p>  <p>  On the point about statistics, the Courts Service did make information available to me after these matters of concern were raised with me.  For example, in the two years and seven months to 31 July 2015, 11,237 drink-driving cases were concluded with 9,714 convictions.  The conviction rate was 86.41% with an acquittal rate of 13.56%.  Just over 9,100 people were disqualified from driving while over 8,300 were fined and over 300 were sent to prison.</p></speech>

For once and for all, however, we need to see where cases are falling down in court and group them under certain headings.  Then we can develop an action plan to resolve that.  It is a concern that there are all sorts of allegations that summonses were tampered with in advance or prepared in a manner which would ultimately lead to a non-conviction.  These are serious charges and to some extent they might be wives&rsquo; tales.  Accordingly, we need a proper method of charting, challenging and cataloguing these events to allow us to be in a position to bring forward a legislative response, if required.</p></speech>

I have spoken about the issue of the number of individuals charged with road traffic offences but who do not produce their driver licence when they are in the court.  The statistics on that have enabled us to prioritise it as a matter of concern and that is why we are following it up with the various steps I already outlined on the third payment option and an integrated database to pull together all available information.</p><p>I will write to the Deputy with all of the information that is available to me for 2013, 2014 and 2015 concerning what has happened in the courts in each of those years in terms of convictions, disqualification orders and fines that have been imposed.</p></speech>

Under the recent capital plan there will be investment of &euro;3.6 billion in public transport in the capital between 2016 and 2022.  That will enable a number of major public transport projects to proceed and it will also fund additional capacity to meet existing and growing commuter needs.  Under the capital plan, the construction of a metro link between the city centre, Dublin Airport and Swords will commence in 2021.  Other improvements to the Dublin public transport system that are planned for the short and medium term include the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel next summer, improved DART frequency, the opening of the LUAS cross city in 2017, elements of the DART expansion programme, including the extension of the DART to Balbriggan, and the ongoing improvement and expansion of bus services </p>  <p>  On the service provision front, the NTA funds public service obligation, PSO, bus and rail services and oversees the provision of Luas services as part of its statutory remit.  The NTA will receive an additional &euro;28 million in PSO funding from my Department in 2016 in response to the increased need I have outlined.</p>  <p>  The Dublin city centre transport study is now being undertaken by the NTA and the city council.  A significant number of submissions - almost 8,000 - have been made on it, which I welcome.  They include numerous submissions on the future of College Green.</p>  <p>  The NTA recently published its fare determinations for 2016 with the aim of maintaining customer support while ensuring financial stability for the operators.</p></speech>

It is very disappointing.  I accept that the NTA has a role, but the approach is unfortunate.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the capital plan in terms of transport links.  The problem with projects such as metro north, among others, is that it will be 2022 before it even commences, which is well outside the Government's term in office.  I agree that the metro north is an essential transport link for this city and country, but it is a long-term project.</p>  <p>  The use of apps has resulted in a big improvement in bus transport.  Apps are of major significance for people who use buses because they allow them to see departure times.  That is an important development.</p></speech>

By way of analogy, I refer to what is happening in the construction of the Luas cross city, which is a very big project for the Luas but is of a smaller magnitude than the new metro project.  As the Deputy will recall, the decision on the Luas project was made in 2012 and 2013 but it will not be in operation until 2017.</p>  <p>  Much of the need for fare increases is due to the need to give the best chance possible to transport operators to have financial stability.  The NTA decides on fare increases and structure.  It has continued to structure fares in such a way as to give a benefit to Leap card users.  That is the reason I welcome the fact that in 2015 alone 436,000 Leap cards were sold, with a value of &euro;57 million.  That shows the success of the initiative.</p></speech>

The impact of those initiatives has been major.  I hope they will be expanded to other cities, because currently they are predominantly based in Dublin.  I accept that the initiatives have been extended to Cork and other cities but I would like to see them spread even more widely.</p>  <p>  The Minister indicated that he had maintained the PSO funding at last year's level but, in effect, with inflation and other factors, last year's level would mean a bit of a loss.  That is what worries me about the increases that have been announced.  The Minister referred to viability.  We have one of the lowest levels of PSO funding in Europe and the allocation could have been increased to offset the increases.</p>  <p>  Will there be any further expansion of bus lanes or other approaches to deal with bus lanes?</p></speech>

There is no way the figures could be portrayed as either a cut or even a stabilisation of funding compared to last year.  Last year the Government stabilised the funding; we did not cut it further.  This year we have increased it.  Since 2008, there had been a reduction of approximately &euro;100 million in PSO funding at a time when the number of journeys on the public transport network decreased by tens of millions.  We have now restored &euro;28.5 million of the &euro;100 million decrease in a single year.  That is because of my recognition of the importance of PSO funding.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy acknowledged, Leap cards are being expanded into a number of other areas - Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Dublin Airport - as will real time passenger information systems.  In terms of bus lanes, the capital plan we have put forward does include some funding for their expansion across the city.</p></speech>

The fundamental problem is that the routing of the greenway through County Galway has taken a different approach from that taken on the eastern side of the River Shannon, where it was based on publicly owned lands along the canal and disused railways.  Is the Minister committed to a greenway from Athlone to Galway and, if so, will he facilitate that by utilising existing public lands to the greatest extent possible?</p></reply>

After that meeting, the Minister of State and I requested the project team tasked with delivering the western section of the Dublin to Galway greenway to commence a consultation process with landowners along the preferred route.  A report was provided to the Minister of State and me, and we published it.  We made it fully public because we want the matter to be in the public domain and be transparent.</p>  <p>  Having discussed the report with my officials, and the Minister of State and I having considered the report's conclusion, our decision was to pause the further development of the Galway and Roscommon sections to allow time to reflect on the issues raised and to give consideration to the possibility of developing a new route that works locally and has the support of key landowners.  I appreciate - this was evident in the report - that overall the level of support among landowners along the Roscommon section of the then preferred route was positive.  That was one of the reasons we decided to publish the report.  I wanted all that to be in the public domain.  Based on our joint prospective, we could not progress with that section of the route in its entirety without being clear as to how we would deal with the Galway portion of the route.</p>  <p>  In the interim, my Department will focus on completing the section of the greenway from Maynooth to Westmeath through Kildare and Meath, which has planning permission in place and is ready for development.  The reason the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and I met the landowners and the reason we decided to go ahead with other parts of the greenway was to make very clear our commitment to the completion of the overall project.  A Dublin to Galway national greenway would be a massive piece of public infrastructure and I am committed to putting in place a process to complete that largest section.</p></speech>

The reason for that agreement on the section through County Roscommon and part of County Galway is that about 40% of the route between Athlone and Ballinasloe is on publicly owned lands.  Can the Minister give me an assurance that we will look at routing the greenway from Ballinasloe to Galway on existing publicly owned lands?  As we know, over the next 15 years Bord na M&oacute;na will be pulling out of milled peat production.  Much of its land bank in County Galway is not in production at the moment or will come out of production in due course.  A significant land bank owned by Coillte is available.  Does it not make more sense to try to map a route between Ballinasloe and Galway utilising those lands in so far as possible and then sitting down with the landowners in the other sections?</p></speech>

During the Easter school break earlier this year I had the opportunity to go to the greenway located in the county and constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  I observed the success of it running from Westport through Newport and Mulranny to Achill.  Much of that greenway is located on and through private lands.  Agreements were put in place based on the principle of permissive access regarding the use of that land.  Using that land has delivered a project of extraordinary success because it has allowed cyclists and tourists, such as me, to see to the maximum the local communities and villages as well as the broader environment.  Going through some farmland with the co-operation of the farmers has made it such a success.</p>  <p>  The key point the Deputy put to me was whether I could give a guarantee that it could all go through public land.  I am afraid I cannot.</p></speech>

I have been saying this since last February.  I am probably the only public representative to say publicly that I want the greenway between Athlone and Galway to proceed.  It will go through my parish and I am determined to see it go ahead.  However, it can only proceed with the consent of landowners.  In the example that has been given between Athlone and Ballinasloe it will go through public and private lands, which is the solution to this; it is a combination of both.  The greenway between Westport and Achill goes through public and private lands, and that is the solution for the section from Ballinasloe to Galway.</p>  <p>  Tremendous work has already been done, particularly by one individual, Anne Marie Johnson on Roscommon County Council.  Will the Minister commit to bring the cycleway from Athlone to Ballinasloe, and even by physical segregation along the existing N6 as far as Aughrim?  As the Minister knows, the 325th anniversary of the Battle of Aughrim will occur next July.  We could create a siege cycleway from Athlone right through to Aughrim.  I hope the Minister can give an indication that he is committed to such a development.</p></speech>

I will not give that commitment when an independent body is in place to ascertain how it could be built.  I will not prejudge what it might recommend or undermine its work in any way.</p>  <p>  The overall Galway to Roscommon section, at more than 110 km, is the largest portion of it, as the Deputy will know.  While the work is now under way to see how a new route could be delivered to try to meet the needs the Deputy has outlined, I have now decided that the Kildare and Meath portions of this should proceed and work will begin on those next year.  I will not give any commitment on a new route simply because this work will be carried out by TII which will give us the best chance of getting a mix between public and private land while delivering a route that we know tourists and cyclists will want use.</p></speech>

I expect those new portions of the greenway to be open by the summer of 2017, which will then allow us to have made much more progress on the first half of the greenway.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to say if further funding will be available in the coming months for the other greenway project the Deputy mentioned.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and I want to deliver more greenways and we want to find new funding to make it happen.  This process will ascertain if different kinds of greenways can be delivered, perhaps at lower cost, to meet the kinds of needs the Deputy has referred to.</p></speech>

In approximately 90% of cases the applications relate to the personal weapons of the troops on board the flight.  The application forms for such flights specify that the exemption is being sought for the personal weapons of the troops on board and that no ammunition will be carried.If ammunition is being carried on a particular flight, it will be clearly stated on the application form.  Ammunition is classified under International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, regulations as a dangerous good and must be packaged accordingly and stored safely.  The flights carrying the personal weapons of the troops on board that transit through Irish airspace and airports are operated by well-known US and EU airlines.  These airlines are subject to strict domestic, international and EU safety and security regulations.  I have no reason to suspect the 1973 order is not being adhered to.</p><p>I will clarify a comment I made the last time I answered an oral question on this matter, Question No. 8 on 23 September.  While preparing the reply to today's question, it became apparent to me that I had inadvertently given the impression that all munitions were packaged securely and stored in the hold in such a way that they are inaccessible during the flight.  However, these rules apply to munitions that are classified by ICAO as dangerous goods, such as ammunition or explosives.  Unloaded personal weapons are not classified as dangerous goods by ICAO.  On this basis, the international rules for the carriage of dangerous goods by air do not apply to unloaded weapons.  There are no special packing requirements for such items given that they do not pose a safety risk to civil aircraft.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The US Department of Defense procedures, which are available publicly, permit the carriage of unloaded weapons in the cabin of civil aircraft.  However, these procedures permit this only in circumstances where all the passengers on board the aircraft are military personnel, that is, a troop charter flight, and where the weapons are unloaded, rendered inoperable and stored securely within the cabin.  It should also be borne in mind that these flights have to overfly or land in a number of other European countries besides Ireland and that common EU safety and security rules apply.  I am not aware that such flights have raised aviation safety concerns in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Given that 33 million people have been displaced by war and there has been an incredible refugee crisis for some time, should we not be more concerned about what is passing through Shannon Airport and our airspace?  Under freedom of information, Shannonwatch got details of flights that have come through Shannon and overflights during the past year.  On 15 November 2014 and 16 November 2014, explosives and rockets with bursting charges, which are probably cluster bombs, went to Saudi Arabia.  That is a war front.  Amnesty International has highlighted recently the terrible atrocities and war crimes taking place daily in Yemen.  Munitions are being flown through our airspace to Saudi Arabia to facilitate its war crimes.  Does the Minister's Department ever consider the end result of giving permits for munitions and troops to pass through our airspace?</p></speech>

International and national legislation allows for inspection of aircraft from other states and authorised officers of the Minister or the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, have the usual powers of inspection of all aircraft in Ireland for the purposes of ensuring compliance with air navigation and transport Acts.  This legislation, like any other legislation, is implemented in a way that is consistent with our broader foreign policy and Government policy.  The 1973 order empowers an authorised officer to enter and inspect a civil aircraft if it is suspected that the provisions on carrying munitions of war are being contravened.  Where there are reasonable grounds to suspect an offence has been committed, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has available powers of entry, search and seizure as part of its duty to prevent and detect crime.</p></speech>

If we had a speed limit of 100 km/h on national routes but never inspected drivers, people could drive at 150 km/h.  If we never inspect to determine whether people are keeping the rules, how can we know what they do?  In 2014, 190 tonnes of bullets went through our airspace on six flights to Afghanistan alone.  How many people did these bullets kill?  How in God's name can the Minister tell me his Department can be comfortable with or can even know whether human rights are being abused or war crimes committed with the help of the munitions or through the actions of the troops passing through our airspace?  Since 2001, the US military alone has killed 2.1 million citizens - not people carrying guns or explosives but citizens.  How can the Government say we are still a neutral country given that we are facilitating it?  We are complicit in major war atrocities.  How can the Minister stand over it?</p></speech>

Our foreign policy is very clear on it and informs all choices the Government makes on foreign policy and other matters.  My Department has clear responsibilities regarding legislation on the safety of aircraft.  To extend the Deputy's analogy, the implementation of road traffic law is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, similarly, if there is evidence that the law I have described is being contravened in any way, it is also a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Regarding how my Department engages with other Departments, for any application that comes in regarding a civil aircraft and its use in the carriage of munitions and weapons, my Department seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding foreign policy matters and the Department of Justice and Equality regarding security issues.  If the munitions are classified as dangerous goods, the views of the IAA are also sought and applications are sent to the Department of Defence.  If any of the bodies object, an exemption is generally not granted.</p></speech>

We are pressing for whatever city and I am not sure how the Minister will gauge it.  Perhaps he would indicate how he would make such a judgment or how he would see it.  Much is happening in our city.  Moore Street is being redone and the iconic buildings there are being brought on stream.  While it is a pity we do not have the whole battlefield site, many good things are happening.  I am concerned about Dublin city.  There have been reports of a shortage of hotel places in the city.  If it is the case, it must be examined.  Whether Dublin, Cork or otherwise, we must ensure there is quality accommodation.</p></speech>

The Government has decided to proceed with the new metro north project, which we debated earlier.  Funding will be available for that.  In light of the Government's decision, I have asked the National Transport Authority to keep the capacity issues on the corridor under review.  The authority continues to indicate to me that bus-based measures will be needed to provide increased capacity and to meet the level of demand in our part of the city.  Such measures could take the form of a BRT, a BRT-type service or a conventional quality bus corridor project and upgrade.  This is a matter that we will keep under review.  Any final decision we make will take account of the status of the metro project.</p></speech>

Measures were to be put in place.  The Minister is saying that while the metro is the main focus of attention, there may be interim projects that involve the use of BRT or some watered-down version of it.  It is not clear whether the Minister is intending to push ahead with this in some capacity.  He is saying that if transport problems develop to the extent that more accessibility, more bus services and more passenger services are needed, he will re-examine the BRT option.  It is obvious that it could be a good interim choice to deal with the problems that exist in this city.  Transport to the airport, for instance, is very important.  The number of people using the Swords route, about which we have been talking for a long time, has increased dramatically.  I think we should continue to look at BRT to see whether it can be utilised, especially in light of the money that has already been spent on consultation in this area.</p></speech>

As they are massive projects in their own right, they will take time to deliver.  Regarding the Swords to Dublin BRT project, now that I have made a decision to proceed with the metro transport choice, I need to work back from that to determine the right form of bus transit to meet the needs that will exist before the metro opens in 2026 or 2027 and to accompany the metro when it is operational.  The National Transport Authority is looking at that matter at the moment.  It will make proposals in this regard.  I would say that some of the projects we have done were worth going ahead with in their own right.  I refer, for example, to the change that was made to remove a pinch point at the Cat &amp;amp; Cage on the Drumcondra Road.  Regardless of the development of BRT, the removal of that pinch point was the right choice to make.  It was the right project.  Similar projects will be going ahead.</p></speech>

If we were to proceed with some form of BRT, it would facilitate such projects.  We will probably need some supplementary measures while we are waiting for the metro line to the airport to kick off.  I acknowledge that there have been some big improvements.</p></speech>

Tourism continues to contribute significantly to Ireland's economic recovery.  CSO figures for the first nine months of 2015 show that there were over 6.64 million overseas visits to Ireland, which represents an increase of 12.5% on the same nine-month period of 2014.  This growth in overseas visits has been accompanied by strong growth in overseas tourism revenue from all the main markets.  The most recent CSO quarterly tourism and travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors, excluding air fares or ferry charges, for the first half of 2015 increased by 16.2% compared to the same six-month period in 2014.  There was 8.4% growth in revenue from Great Britain, 33.7% growth in revenue from North America and 14.9% growth in revenue from mainland Europe.  Other long-haul markets recorded 2.6% growth in revenue.</p>  <p>  The Government's tourism policy statement, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, was launched in March of this year.  It acknowledges that generating increased levels of overseas revenue is a key part of the future of Irish tourism.  The main targets contained in the tourism policy statement to be achieved by 2025 are to increase overseas tourism revenue to &euro;5 billion net of inflation, compared to &euro;3.5 billion in 2014; to increase overseas visits to Ireland to 10 million, compared to 7.6 million in 2014; and to have 250,000 people employed in the tourism sector, compared to 205,000 at present.  Earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I appointed a tourism leadership group to put in place a tourism action plan that will set out the actions required in the period to 2018 to achieve the overall objectives in People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025 and to ensure the strong growth experienced in recent years continues.  We intend to publish the tourism action plan in the first quarter of 2016.</p></speech>

It proves the point that every avenue should be utilised and assessed.  Does the Minister of State feel there are other areas for expansion, such as the area of conference and business tourism?  People who visit this country for one purpose might well come back for a different tourism purpose at a later stage.  The Minister of State might indicate the extent to which he has had discussions with the tourism services sector with a view to identifying pressure points throughout that sector.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that by the end of the year, 2015 could be not just the best year since the recession or the best year in the past ten years, but indeed the best year ever for tourism in this country.  Those involved in every aspect of tourism in every corner of this country will say that this has been a brilliant year.  All of the propositions, including the Dublin proposition, the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East, have helped to bring people into this country.  The Deputy asked what we are doing to try to target further growth in the tourism sector.  We set up the tourism leadership group because we are looking at ways and means of increasing the tourism sector.  It is brilliant that we have over 200,000 people employed in tourism.  We want to increase that to 250,000.  I see no reason we cannot do so.  One of the good things about tourism is that it can be in every corner of the country.  When multinational companies are coming to Ireland, they want to specify where they want to be located.  Tourism can be in every corner of the country.  Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and those involved in the trade are looking for business.  We sometimes fail to give credit to the trade.</p><p>We do not give enough credit to the operators who are out there on trade missions all over the world.  They are out there sourcing business at every opportunity.  They go to travel fairs, as individuals and in groups, with the support of Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p> <p> The one area that we must look at is Dublin, because there is a lack of capacity in the city centre.  We do not have that problem in rural Ireland but we certainly have it in Dublin.  It is something that we must look at, target and deal with.  We can see problems coming down the track with regard to Dublin, and if we want to see further growth, particularly in terms of conferences and events in Dublin city, then we must find ways to increase capacity.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to a sum of &euro;54.4 million in 2015 and &euro;59.2 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  As I said already, the horse racing industry is very important to rural Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to the horse industry, which is a major employer in rural Ireland.  The sector is strategically important because of the significant contribution it makes to rural development, farm and other incomes, and the business, services and tourism sectors, as well as to the rural economy as a whole.  The horse racing and breeding industries are worth &euro;1.1 billion to the economy, employing some 16,500 people with high-quality jobs based in rural communities.  The Irish sports horse industry is worth &euro;700 million in economic terms each year.  We have heard much talk in recent times about the decline in rural Ireland and the need to rejuvenate it.  In that context, it is very important to recognise the role played by the horse industry in rural Ireland, and I believe there is room for further expansion and development.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us builds on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act of 2001, introduced by a Fianna-F&aacute;il-led government, which created a representative governing body for the industry and transferred various functions to that body.  We look forward to tabling amendments to further strengthen the current provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015 represents the culmination of a review of the industry and incorporates recommendations from the report prepared by Indecon in 2012.  The Minister has now moved forward with this legislation to incorporate some of the recommendations of that report which should greatly improve the horse racing industry and the organisation that runs it in the years ahead.  The new legislation will strengthen governance and transparency within the racing industry and will create greater accountability to the Government in the decisions and membership of Horse Racing Ireland, which was one of the key recommendations of the aforementioned Indecon report.  The Bill increases the number of number of ministerial appointees to the board of HRI and clearly assigns governance and regulatory responsibility, clarifying previously grey areas such as point-to-point meetings, finance and administration.  </p>  <p>  I always wonder, when Ministers announce that they are going to increase the number of ministerial appointees to boards, who those appointees will be.  I am sure-----</p></speech>

I am retiring from politics and am available to serve if the Minister is stuck for an appointee to the board.</p>  <p>  It is important to provide a single transparent structure for the administration and financial management of the industry.  As the Minister said last night, the Bill's provisions will eliminate duplication and increase efficiencies in areas such as finance, information technology and administration.  The Bill also proposes to establish a new statutory committee to focus on the requirements of persons employed in the industry and represent their interests on the board of HRI.  In recent days I have been contacted by several people working in the industry about jockeys and injured jockeys in particular.  They have asked about the role of the new board in the context of looking after injured jockeys.  A lot of jockeys get injured and people have asked whether a fund will be available, through HRI, to compensate those who have been seriously injured.  In recent years there has been a lot of fundraising activity on behalf of injured jockeys.  Mr. J. P. McManus and many others have run fundraising events, special races and so forth to raise money on their behalf.  Perhaps there should be an in-built fund in HRI for this.  It may be the case that such a fund already exists; I am not sure.  Such a fund could compensate those injured jockeys who cannot return to racing.</p>  <p>  As I am on the subject of jockeys, I wish to pay tribute to the late Pat Eddery, who passed away in recent days.  He was up there with Lester Piggott, with over 4,700 winners during his career.  Eddery, Tony McCoy and many other outstanding Irish jockeys have done a tremendous job in ensuring that Irish horse racing is to the forefront not just in Ireland but also in Europe and the rest of the world.  We should recognise the important role played by jockeys in the promotion of the racing industry here.  Last night I referred to the importance of people working in the industry.  In my own area of the south east, I am referring to people such as Jim Bolger, Aidan O'Brien, Paul Nolan, Colm Murphy and the Mullins brothers.  Willie Mullins is an institution in the horse racing industry.  People like those mentioned should be utilised more to promote the industry as we move forward.</p>  <p>  The Bill will allow the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to undertake regular value for money reviews of the horse and greyhound racing fund in the HRI.  I ask the Minister to outline whether he has had particular concerns in that regard.  There seem to have been some problems in the greyhound industry.  We have a magnificent greyhound track in Enniscorthy which received very little funding over the years but other greyhound tracks in which there was substantial investment now seem to be in financial difficulty and are finding it hard to survive.  The make-up of Bord na gCon needs to be re-examined and changed.  I believe there will be a change at the top of that organisation in the near future and I am sure the Minister will appoint someone to that role who will drive on the greyhound industry, which is another very important industry in rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the proposed change to the Forestry Act 2014 which will mean that the process of getting approval for the construction of forest roads will be easier and quicker.  In the past there was a lot of duplication and there were delays in that area.</p>  <p>  We must recognise the economic value of the horse racing industry to Ireland.</p><p>The horse racing and breeding industries contribute &euro;1.1 billion to the economy annually and provide 16,000 jobs, mainly in rural areas.  We hear a great deal about the decline of rural areas.  The horse racing industry is the only sector that has stood the test of time and I hope it will continue to make a valuable contribution to the rural economy. </p> <p> During the recession, many horse trainers were forced to reduce their activities owing to a lack of investment in horses.  I understand, however, that investment is increasing.  The racing industry will be one of the main drivers of growth in rural areas.</p> <p> Irish horses valued at more than &euro;200 million are exported to 37 countries every year.  Our horse industry has the best jockeys and trainers and breeds top-class horses.  Every year, many of the foreign riders who appear at the Dublin Horse Show ride horses that were bred in Ireland.  Of the 6,500 horse breeders in Ireland, 15% are overseas investors, spread across every county.  Racing festivals contribute &euro;260 million per annum to local economies.  The Galway Races, for example, generate between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million for the local economy every year.  In 2013, attendances at race meetings increased to 1.24 million.  Race meetings at Wexford's valuable and viable track attract large numbers of visitors, including many tourists in summer.  For example, people travel from Wales and other countries to attend race meetings in the town.  The track is a major driver of tourism in the south east.</p> <p> The international reputation of the Irish horse racing sector has facilitated exports of more than &euro;150 million annually.  The industry supports sport tourism, which attracts an estimated 80,000 visitors annually.  Horse Sport Ireland is different from many sporting federations in that it has 28 affiliates under its umbrella and covers a wide range of equestrian activities, from show jumping and mounted games to polo and harness racing.  A report produced by UCD in 2012 showed that there were 124,000 sport horses on the island at that time.  Clearly, such numbers generate significant employment.  The sector is worth &euro;708 million to the economy each year, supporting the equivalent of 12,500 full-time jobs.  If a company promised to create 1,000 jobs in any part of the country, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland would offer it all sorts of incentives and supports.  For this reason, I welcome the Minister's decision to increase the allocation to Horse Racing Ireland in 2015 and 2016.  If additional money comes into the State coffers, it may be possible to further increase funding to the sector. </p> <p> As I stated, 29,000 people depend on the horse industry for part or all of their income.  The industry counts 47,000 regular participants who are defined as breeders or other participants on a fortnightly basis.  It is clear from the Indecon and UCD reports that the horse racing industry is very important to the economy.  The Indecon report made 37 recommendations in areas such as funding, the board of Horse Racing Ireland, streamlining of functions, marketing, the competitiveness of the sector and legislative and governance changes.  I am pleased that the Minister has incorporated many of these recommendations in the Bill. </p> <p> As I stated, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will support the Bill.  In that context, I apologise for the absence of my party's spokesman on this issue, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We will table amendments on Committee Stage to make improvements to this welcome legislation.  I welcome the Minister's recognition of the value of the horse industry in a wide range of areas.  It is important that we continue to support and develop the industry, which must remain at the forefront of sporting, recreational and tourism activities.  </p> <p> The issue of doping among athletes is topical.  From time to time, people raise with me the issue of horse trainers operating outside the law, although I understand the use of drugs in horses is on a small scale.  What will be the responsibilities of the board of Horse Racing Ireland in this area?  Will it have sole responsibility for weeding out those in the racing industry who may step outside the law, or will responsibility be shared with the Garda and various Departments?  If drugs are being used, the practice should be eliminated and those involved severely dealt with.  The industry is too valuable to the country to have cowboys operating outside the law.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will pass all Stages as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

In 2012, horse racing contributed &euro;1.1 billion to the economy, and in 2013, its exports to 37 countries were estimated to be worth &euro;205 million.  The industry is also of significant value to the tourism sector.  It is important, therefore, that we get this legislation right and ensure transparency and accountability in horse racing.  The entire horse racing structure must be democratised.  In that respect, I am concerned about the proposals on ministerial appointments and changes in the structure of the board of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  Deputies are democratically elected and we need to see democracy at play in all aspects of political life and beyond.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to change the current status of the Horse Racing Ireland board and the committee that submits policy decisions to the board for approval.  Since its establishment in 2001, it has been the policy of the HRI board to approve committee decisions and recommendations.  It could be argued that the primary reason for the proposed changes to the HRI board is to give more central control to the executive and dilute the power of industry bodies whose representatives are elected to the board by members.  One could also argue that this has allowed large corporate bookmaking companies to exercise control over Horse Racing Ireland, a semi-state company.  Online gambling is worth approximately &euro;2 billion per annum, while land-based gambling is worth approximately &euro;1.7 billion each year.  As such, the gambling industry is worth nearly &euro;4 billion per annum.  Many people will argue that vested interests in the bookmaking chains have a strong lobby and exercise considerable influence through Horse Racing Ireland and its connections.  This sends out a very dangerous signal.  </p>  <p>  The changes in the Bill support my argument that the legislation increases the powers of the executive.  For example, it is proposed to reduce the number of elected representatives on the HRI board and increase the number of ministerial appointments to the board.</p><p>The Minister articulated his case and there was a lot of merit in much of what he said.  However, the issue is the message it sends to people in the industry, right down to the stable boy.</p> <p> Powerful on-course bookmakers now have provision for a seat on the HRI board, which they did not have in the past.  That does not sell the right decisions.  The change in structures for certain financial committees, including on media rights, that take power away from race courses and traditional industry bodies means a move from three seats to five with two appointed by HRI who are not members of HRI.  This changes the balance of power in favour of the executive.  I am looking at a table of the current and proposed composition of the HRI board.  Nominations from the race and regulatory authority currently stand at five while nominations to the racing regulatory authority in the new board are reduced to three.  The position regarding nominations from persons employed directly in the horse racing industry, which was workers and union representatives, has been changed also.  The number of ministerial appointments is three, one of which is from the North of Ireland.  While I welcome the all-Ireland approach, ministerial appointments are seen on the basis of past experience as a form of cronyism and as political in nature.  That can leave a bad taste.</p> <p> The new Bill seeks to remove any independent financial support from the industry body, the Turf Club, and give it to the executive of HRI.  That will control and further weaken the industry body.  Anything that reduces the integrity of a body such as the Turf Club or gives the impression of having done so sends a very dangerous signal.  The integrity of that body must be protected, maintained and strengthened.  Point to point racing, a sport that has never been mentioned in any legislation to date, was not mentioned in the Indecon report and has long had a basis in volunteering, is now being converted into a State Act.  What is the point of an applicant applying to the racing regulatory body for a licence, the licence fee having to be paid to HRI and the fees then having to be paid back to the racing regulatory body by HRI?  What signal does it send and what does it achieve?</p></speech>

That is all it is.  It is the signal it sends to the Turf Club and the general public who look to the Turf Club to regulate.  How can the race and regulatory body be solely and independently responsible for making the rules of racing if it has a statutory obligation to consult with HRI first?  It questions the integrity of the regulatory body.  It is an issue given the international situation in sport and the allegations surrounding Russia and other countries and doping.  The integrity of an organisation that is there to regulate appears to be undermined in this yet I have no knowledge of anything other than that the body has behaved impeccably.  I acknowledge that we can tease all of this out on a later Stage through amendments and make our views known.  We can add amendments to strengthen the legislation or provide the necessary reassurance.  It is our duty as legislators to reassure the public that the workings of the bodies, be it the HRI, regulatory body or the composition of the board, can have their confidence.  Public confidence will be the catalyst to move things forward in a better way.</p>  <p>  Minister, is there a legal challenge by the Turf Club in relation to that?  I am hearing that there is and I ask you to confirm if that is the case.  We need to know as we debate the legislation further.</p></speech>

We had a presentation in committee yesterday from harness racers.  I understand that they have been talking to the Minister.  I would like to see their interests forming part of the Bill and I think everyone on the committee agrees.  Many would argue that it has been left outside the loop because, as one person put it yesterday, it is a working man's and working woman's sport.  That sector of the industry has no financial support whatsoever from the Department.  It has been ignored continuously.  The HRI has been preventing those involved from having access to privately owned race tracks.  I would like the Minister to clarify in his reply whether he intends to take amendments to include harness racing in the Bill.  It would be very helpful.</p>  <p>  The Minister said in relation to the Forestry Act issue that on enactment of this position, only one consent will be required and that this will be administered by his Department.  Currently consent is required from the Department in relation to the construction of a forestry road while an entirely separate consent is required from the local planning authority for an entrance from a forestry road onto a public road.  I read this to mean the Department will be able to give the consent.  As such, the Minister will give consent for a private road to go onto a public road.</p><p>How does this fit into the planning laws?  As every elected representative knows, be they local councillors or Deputies, planning rules and regulations must be adhered to and any access to a public road requires planning permission.  Is the Minister saying that his Department will have the power to overrule these laws and allow a private forestry road access to a public one?</p></speech>

Before I start, my condolences go to the Eddery family.</p>  <p>  Horse racing is a major money spinner and is important to rural Ireland, where the business has been handed down to breeders and trainers through the years.  The amount of money that horse racing generates around the country is incredible.  For example, approximately &euro;200 million worth of horses are bred and exported each year.  In my county of Roscommon, the Galway races are well known for the amount of money that they generate.  This is great for the country, the Government and the people.  We must protect the industry and handle it well.</p>  <p>  Appointments have been made.  I have been vocal on this issue down the years, in that our system of appointments should not be ministerial in nature or the like.  We should always opt for the best person for a job.  The process should have no ministerial involvement.  Transparency must be to the forefront.  People could be placed on interview boards who knew the ins and outs and how to determine the best person for a position.  It should not come down to who one knows.  This is something that should be the case in every walk of life.</p>  <p>  The industry creates 16,000 jobs, which is vital.  By the look of the situation, even more jobs are being created.  Watching races in America, Australia and so forth on television, in which Irish horses, jockeys and trainers compete with the best, is a credit to them.</p>  <p>  As a previous Deputy did, I welcome that the Minister or the Department can give the go-ahead for a forestry road, but how does the planning issue stand?  If one builds a house, one must get the go-ahead from the local area engineer or submit a planning application for a new access road.</p></speech>

While that has been addressed to a certain extent, there have been major problems.  Various groups made proposals to the Government to try to resolve the situation and reduce the number of horses in question.  Will the Minister of State ensure that this problem is addressed?  Large numbers of horses were roaming around forestries and wild bits of land.  In fairness to people in the horse industry, they tried to tackle the problem.  Some opted for killing, but the issue was that a bit of paperwork was preventing people from acting.  The situation is falling into line, but we must devise something that addresses those horses that have not been covered historically.</p>  <p>  The horse industry is worth a serious amount of money, as is the greyhound industry.  Many people go to greyhound tracks during the week or at weekends.  In some parts of the country, greyhound tracks are struggling.  Breeders near me are committed to the game.  Will the Government give them as much help as possible?</p></speech>

I use the occasion to express my deepest sympathy to Pat Eddery's family on the sad loss of that wonderful and excellent jockey.  A great Irish sportsman, he was admired by many throughout the State.  He had an amazing record and was recognised internationally.  He was crowned champion jockey 11 times.  He had three Epsom derby wins, four Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe wins and four Irish derby wins.  He won nearly 4,600 races during his career.  He had the most winners in a day at seven on 26 June 1992 and the most winners in a season at 200 in 1990.  What a record.  To his friends and family and everyone involved in horse racing, I offer my deepest sympathy and strongest support.  I commend a tremendous Irish sportsman.</p>  <p>  The debate on this Bill is important, given the horse racing sector's major contribution to Ireland and internationally.  It has put Ireland on the map in terms of horse racing, breeding and show jumping.  It puts intense efforts into all sectors of society and sends a positive message about Ireland.  The Minister of State knows that it is important that we protect and develop the industry.  It has major potential to generate further jobs and expand internationally.  There is no point in sitting back because we have done a great job, end of story.  We need to be proactive.</p>  <p>  The racing sector makes a significant contribution to agriculture, as the Minister of State is well aware, given his strong background in that regard, and the general economy.  It is estimated that the horse industry provides in the region of 14,000 jobs and generates &euro;1.1 billion in economic output.  I will zoom in on these important figures.</p>  <p>  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, is financed by profits from the tote, funding from on-course and off-course bookmakers and a statute-based direct grant from the Government.  Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was established under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  In accordance with that Act, 80% and 20% of the moneys paid into the fund each year are distributed to HRI and Bord na gCon, respectively.  These amounts are subject to annual approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In 2014, &euro;43 million from the fund was paid to HRI.</p><p> When dealing with this, it is important that we understand the background to the whole industry and the particulars.  Although we frequently hear about tourism, our lovely scenery, conferences and web summits, which are all very important, we often forget about the number of people directly connected with horses and horse racing who come to Ireland.  It was estimated in the Alan Dukes report of 2013 that approximately 80,000 people travel to Ireland annually for racing.  This is a very large number.  They come from the United Kingdom and from right across Europe.  This significantly benefits the hospitality sector, including those who provide accommodation such as hotels.  We need to look after those who travel here as tourists and also as consumers.  We do not want to cheese them off, so to speak, as some hoteliers in Dublin are doing by overcharging them and screwing them for bed and breakfast.  We need to wake up to this.  Some Dublin hoteliers are exploiting people in respect of the costs of bed and breakfast and basic accommodation.</p> <p> If we are to promote Irish tourism and reduce VAT to help the tourism sector, we do not want to find out consumers are being ripped off and paying &euro;280 or &euro;300 for bed and breakfast.  That is not acceptable in this day and age, irrespective of the rationale.  I know from speaking to my colleagues that some of them cannot even get a hotel bed in Dublin on certain nights.  I am delighted the sector is doing well - good luck to it - but that is never an excuse to rip off the people.  I raise this in the context of 80,000 people coming to Ireland for racing related activity.  The same applies to the fishing industry.  Anglers regularly tell me this.  I recently met a group of golfers from Newcastle who came to the north side of Dublin.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, knows well, Dublin Bay North is a fantastic place to go and he is always welcome there.  It has a very important tourism industry.  We have a beautiful bay and also beautiful golf courses.</p></speech>

I draw attention to the tourism potential associated with the 80,000 people who come to the country for racing.  One needs to look after one's customers if one wants to develop a long-term relationship.</p>  <p>  Attendance at race meetings is important.  Data show growth in both total and average attendance rates of approximately 4% in 2014.  However, there is potential for further growth.  We need to up our game in developing the sector to get people away from the televisions and Intranet.  We must encourage them to go out and have a good day at the races, thereby supporting the industry.  With a bit of leadership and creativity, the growth rate of 4% could be increased to 6% or 7%.</p>  <p>  We need to protect and keep our eye on the industry.  We have a problem in the country with gambling and need to be conscious of those who find themselves in such circumstances.  At the same time, however, we should never blame the industry for people's personal problems.  There are times when I hear people having a go at the industry.  I call them the nanny state brigade.  They need to back off a little and realise many people work and are doing great work in the sector.  The great majority of punters are decent, responsible people.  For some in modern society, it is nearly a mortal sin to go into a bookmaker's shop to back a horse or greyhound or bet on the result of a football match.  There is no need to go down that road.</p>  <p>  The legislation boils down to three aspects, namely, the administration, governance and funding.  There are a series of amendments to existing legislation.  The Bill proposes amendments to the composition of the board of Horse Racing Ireland, provides for revised functions of Horse Racing Ireland, proposes the establishment of two statutory committees and proposes changes to the rules of racing.  I welcome the legislation.  It is important we focus on the needs of the industry.  There is considerable potential in the sector.  We need to get out there and push it strongly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1202" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100015#N01000"><p>The horse racing industry is well represented in my constituency, Kildare North, which may have one of the oldest traditions of horse racing on the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.  I became a blow-in in Kildare a very long time ago.  When I moved there, I became acutely aware of the fact there is a complete language change when one moves to a county dominated by a certain industry, just as one hears nautical terms when one goes to a coastal area.  In Kildare, one hears phrases such as "through the gap", "past the post" and "over the hurdle".  These phrases are part of the language, as the Minister of State will understand.  I have had to get used to it, unlike my constituency colleague, Deputy Lawlor, who is one of the few indigenous people who represent Kildare.</p>  <p>  I am raising certain concerns because they were raised with me.  I have spoken briefly to the Minister of State and will send him a more detailed note on this issue.  A major issue for thoroughbred breeders is the foal levy.  The three counties that are probably most affected by this are Kildare, Wexford - in respect of the National Hunt - and the Minister of State's county, Tipperary.  Therefore, he will be paying some considerable attention to this.  Most breeders are not associated with big stud farms; they are farmers.  Approximately 90% of all horses are bred in this environment.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State is aware, the foal levy is administered by Horse Racing Ireland.  It sets the rate each year.  The proceeds generated are used to fund the Irish Equine Centre, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association.  It is perfectly normal that an industry should pay a percentage to support itself and its proper governance.  However, it has come to my attention recently that the foal levy is designed in a very regressive way.  The people who raised concerns with me provided me with many tables to show that.  The levy takes proportionately more from the small-scale breeders than larger stud farms.  As I stated, 90% of the breeders are farmers.  The levy is based on the advertised fee for the stallion.  I have a table with approximately half a dozen examples.  An advertised fee of &euro;1,000 attracts a levy of 3.5%.  However, where there is an advertised fee of &euro;40,000, the levy is 1.62%.  Where the advertised fee is really high, the levy is 0.14%.  Therefore, the levy decreases with an increase in the advertised fee.</p>  <p>  I am told the advertised fee is rarely the fee that is charged.  The main reason the levy functions in the way outlined is that it is calculated based on the advertised fee for the sire of the foal and not on the value of the foal itself.  The point has been made to me that although one pays the fee, the foal might not survive or be of any use.  Alternatively, it might not prosper.  One could pay a fee on a foal that loses money.  Therefore, the amount bears little relationship to the principle on which the fee is calculated.  This seems to be a very serious flaw in the design of the levy.  The upshot of the regressive design is that small breeders, such as those who breed perhaps two or three foals each year, pay far more proportionately than their better-resourced counterparts in the large stud farms.  When one considers that approximately 70% to 80% of foals in Ireland are bred by small-scale breeders each year, one realises the very unfair nature of the levy.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the number of foals bred in 2006 was 12,500, while the figure for 2014 was 7,000.  That is quite a dramatic change in terms of scale, as I am sure the Minister of State is well aware, and it will have a bearing on the regressive nature and viability of this levy.</p> <p> It is unusual that most of these small-scale breeders are not members of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, yet they continue to fund its existence.  One would have to question whether that is fair when they are not represented in the design of this scheme.  It is also not possible to claim a refund of levies paid in cases in which a foal is injured or dies.  Again, this seems like a large burden on small-scale breeders.  I spoke to a breeder close to where I live and he had a foal which he expected would realise a certain amount.  However, the foal was frightened by a low-flying plane and ended up with some blemishes that dramatically reduced its value.  That is the kind of thing that can happen.  Would it not be better to calculate the value of the levy on the actual value of the foal in question?  Is it not time to reorganise how the money is spent to give better representation to small-scale breeders who clearly make up the backbone of the industry?</p> <p> The people to whom I have been talking are not opposed to the application of a levy, but they have proposals on how the Minister of State might rearrange it.  They suggest that the proposed wording in the general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014 should be changed from a foal levy to a sales levy, where the valuation can be established for each animal and the levy can be calculated on its true value.  The proposal is to put a 1% levy on all animals sold by thoroughbred breeders in Ireland.  In 2014, approximately &euro;155 million worth of horses were sold in Ireland.  That proposal would also give a proportionate figure in view of the fluctuation in numbers.  In 2014, such a scheme would have brought in revenue of approximately &euro;1.55 million to support the industry, which is almost &euro;155,000 more than the present foal levy.  In this way, everyone in the industry who sells horses at some stage - horses in or out of training, yearlings, mares, etc. - would pay a little, and that would bring in some extra revenue.  With this system we would save in the region of &euro;80,000 in administration fees.  It would only take a piece of software to transfer the money to Horse Racing Ireland from the sales company.  All other levies in the agriculture sector are paid at the point of sale, so people are asking why the bloodstock industry should be any different.  That is a valid claim.  </p> <p> The second primary point I wish to make is not really unrelated to the first one.  It has been highlighted to me that the institutional architecture of Horse Racing Ireland is a bit opaque and lacks accountability.  There is a clear need for the chairperson of the board to have a statutory requirement to govern the organisation in line with Government policy.  There is an awful lot that is positive about the horse racing industry, but there should be a symmetry and there is not.  Government policy, the organisation itself and the sport can be going in separate directions.  There is also a need to address the power imbalance by ensuring that at least one member of the board represents horse owners at all times.  Those are the points that were made to me and that I have been trying to narrow down.  I will certainly give the Minister of State some of the additional documentation that was furnished to me when I had discussions with the people involved.  </p> <p> I recently read some articles from 19th-century newspapers on the Punchestown races, including a report that detectives were dispatched from Dublin Castle to Punchestown, which provides a sense of the longevity of the sport in Kildare.  The county has been known as the thoroughbred capital for a very good reason, and long may it continue.  </p> <p> I wish to echo Deputy Finian McGrath's comments on the death of champion jockey Pat Eddery.  I extend my sympathies to his bereaved family.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that a lot of work has gone into solving the difficulty of duplication between my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Now that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to take the lead role, it will cut out that duplication, as forestry roads have been a problem for many people for a long time.  Many officials were involved in that work, but I wish to mention the efforts of an engineer who passed away in tragic circumstances.  Mr. Peter Britton from Tipperary died while climbing in the Mont Blanc range of the French Alps almost 18 months ago.  It would be only fitting for us to acknowledge his contribution and input into this matter.  Some of his ideas helped us to reach a conclusion that will be of benefit to many private forestry owners around the country.  I welcome the fact that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is now playing the lead role in this respect, thus making it easier for all those involved in the forestry sector.</p>  <p>  The horse racing industry has a major impact on our country and Irish people have a passion for horses and racing.  I grew up in a county in which the industry is deeply embedded, including among breeders.  The horse racing sector is a leveller.  Some people might say that only the wealthy are involved in horse racing, but that is not true.  Everybody can be involved in the industry, which is great for the country.  Some 18,000 people are employed in the equine sector around the country.  Many rural parishes might have no other income but for agriculture, tourism, and horse racing and breeding.  The Government must support the continued impact of the 18,000 people who are working in that industry.  </p>  <p>  We have proven in the past the importance of the export market for horses.  At this time of year, one can see bloodstock sales taking place in Doncaster and Newmarket, as well as at Goffs, Tattersalls and elsewhere.  Wherever they are, they represent fruitful breeding into which endless work has gone.  That work includes preparing foals for sale at market, and those involved in it have a passion for breeding.</p><p>Their aim is to produce a foal that can probably go on and win a gold cup, grand national or derby.  The impact of success and the relationship between a stable yard or breeding yard and the community as well as the associated pride is immense.<br/><br/>We are here today because the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, appointed Indecon to carry out a report to track the way forward for this industry and put a structure in place to improve the whole industry and make it more feasible.  One thing that has come out of the process is the question of investment in the industry.  In this budget and the previous budget, the extra money given to the Horse and Greyhound Fund will help to establish it in a better place.  It will send out a message loud and clear that the Government is fully committed to helping this industry in future.<br/><br/>The most important issue that has arisen in recent years and that has now come to fruition is the five-year plan Horse Racing Ireland has produced for stadia and race tracks throughout the country.  This includes investment in the Curragh, which is the flagship for the industry.  The plan is to make the Curragh a place where we can go and bring people from throughout the world to see some of the greatest races in the world.  The Curragh could take on and match other venues, in particular in Kentucky in the United States and the venue for the <i>Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe</i>in Paris.  I welcome the investment not only by the Government but by HRI.  The fact that major trainers and owners have put private money into the business and the fact that they have been forthcoming will ensures the future of the industry.<br/><br/>Not alone is the Curragh being developed, almost every other track in the country will see investment, including the tracks at Gowran Park, Tipperary, Galway, Leopardstown and many others throughout the country.  Few tracks are without a mention in the report.<br/><br/>The investment is important for the public who go racing.  It is important to have the facilities in place to bring tourists into Ireland.  We can talk about the industry and the affect it has on farms and land throughout the country but the major impact and potential relates to when tourists come to Ireland.  They can go to an evening meet in the Curragh, Leopardstown, Tipperary or Clonmel.  People can have a splendid evening.  That is where the potential to affect the community lies.<br/><br/>I live a few miles from Tipperary Racecourse.  Years ago many people used to attend the races there.  The numbers have fallen but the capacity and the facilities are in place now for that racecourse and many other racecourses throughout the country to attract people and give them a good evening's entertainment, something that is singularly worthwhile.<br/><br/>Deputy Catherine Murphy made some interesting points.  She commented on the concern among some people because of the drop in the foal registration from 12,000 down to 8,000.  That is a fact of the industry.  However, I see it a different way.  I believe there is an advantage in that.  In the past, particularly during the good times, the number of mares who got in foal was high, despite the breeding.  Now, the fact is that we only get a mare of good pedigree in foal and we can be certain she will produce a better type of foal.  This is what we have to produce for the export market.  I hope that the culling that has occurred to bring the figure down to the 7,000 base will be successful.  The base we will be working at in future will produce a better foal for the export market.  That is what we have to work at.  There is big money and a big prize to be got.  Greater prices are to be got when we have the right type of stock.  There is money to be made.<br/><br/>There are significant costs as well.  Deputy Murphy adverted to the foal levy and various costs.  It is important that everyone contributes to the betterment of the industry.  Prize money and marketing are all-important and they must be put in place.  In the past two years I have come to know that this is about marketing the product throughout the world.  The dairy industry has done a remarkably good job in that area.  The Irish Dairy Board has put money into that and worked at it.  The same thing has to happen with horses in Ireland.  We have to market and sell the industry.  We have to compete with the French and other producing countries.  That is something people should keep in mind when they are paying a levy.  Mostly, the foal levy is set at a reasonable rate for smaller producers.  I take the point, however.  It is something that might be looked at in future at some stage in respect of the point of sale.  Everyone needs to contribute and we need money to be available to sell our foals into this industry.  I have no doubt this industry can develop in future.<br/><br/>I will not take any more of Deputy Lawlor's time but my last point is important.  It relates to betting and betting shops.  This is another part of the industry we cannot overlook.  Paddy Power and other major players such as BoyleSports have big shops and seem to be taking over as monopolies.  We should not forget the small bookmakers who perhaps operate in a small village with one shop.  I know one such man in Tipperary who happens to be a friend of mine, Seamus O'Dwyer.  He runs a small shop.</p></speech>

I would like to be associated with the sympathies following the death of Pat Eddery.  He was from Newbridge and he passed away yesterday at 63 years of age, a young man.  Those of us who grew up in the industry will always remember Pat Eddery and some of the great horses he rode down through the years.  In particular, I have fond memories of his ride on Dancing Brave to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.  I also remember him at the Curragh, where he won the Irish Derby three times.  He won at many racetracks here when he was associated with Vincent O'Brien, for whom he was a stable jockey for six years.</p>  <p>  The reward he brought to not only those who went to see him but to others too was immense.  There was a lady in my area who would always like to have a flutter of a Yankee every day.  Unusually, she did not back horses, only jockeys.  The jockey she followed all the time was Pat Eddery.  Invariably, that Yankee would come up on a regular basis.  The man had in excess of 4,000 winners over the years and won multiple classics.  He was champion jockey 11 times in the United Kingdom.  We should be proud to be associated with him.  My sympathies go to his family on the sad occasion of his passing.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, for their support for the horseracing industry.  Almost 4,000 people are employed in the horse racing industry in Kildare, either directly or those associated with the three racetracks.  Deputy Catherine Murphy will know that in Kildare North we have a racetrack and a bit.  The racetrack is in Naas and there is a bit of the track in Punchestown in Kildare North.  Deputy Martin Heydon has a racetrack and a large bit of one, namely, the Curragh and Punchestown.</p>  <p>  I was in the Curragh the other day for the announcement of the support for the funding of the new development of the Curragh racetrack.  There will also be support for the track at Naas, where HRI is forwarding a grant of &euro;1 million.  This will be supplemented by &euro;1.4 million from the racetrack company in respect of the development of Naas Racecourse.  I hope that Punchestown might also gain from the capital fund.</p>  <p>  The fund has been reducing over the years.  This is the first time it has been increased and that is welcome.  As I said, some 4,000 people are employed in the racing industry in Kildare.  Most are in the training stables.  I am beside one such place, where Ted Walsh works.  He is a well known racing commentator.  That stable has produced a grand national winner and an Irish grand national winner.  I will return to the debate this afternoon when I hope to make a further contribution.</p></speech>

He did not answer the very basic question I put to him, namely, why the Department of Finance refused to waive its rights regarding the documents it sent to the commission of investigation.  I asked the Taoiseach if it was his position that no officials in government knew anything about this until last week.  He stonewalled and did not answer the question.  We have learned from the judge's statement published yesterday that the Department of Finance knew about this matter long before last week.  In fact, the Department of Finance sent legal submissions to the commission of investigation citing and claiming confidentiality over the majority of its documentation.  The Department of Finance was also aware of the position of the special liquidator, KPMG, in asserting confidentiality rights over all of the documents requested by the commission regarding Siteserv.  According to page 13 of the judge's report, the special liquidator has asserted a duty of confidentiality over all of the documents.  The report was sent to the Department of Finance by the judge.</p>  <p>  When can we get a bit of truth and simple honesty on this?  When did the Minister for Finance find out about this?  Is it the position of the Taoiseach that Department of Finance officials knew about this matter since August and September?  It appears from the judge's document that they knew about it definitively by early October, but told nobody in government.  The Department of Finance said it got legal advice.  Could the Taoiseach tell me who gave it that advice?  Was it the Attorney General or external legal advisers?</p>  <p>  I refer to the role of the special liquidator, KPMG.  It was originally the adviser to the sale of Siteserv.</p></speech>

Is the Taoiseach not now thoroughly embarrassed by the decision to ask it to investigate, given that it has emerged as the main obstacle in the progression of the investigation and has claimed that the public interest does not override the necessity of the utilisation of these documents by the commission?</p></speech>

His party and everybody else in the House welcomed the setting up of the commission of investigation.  Its purpose was to examine all cases in which there was a write-off of over &euro;10 million to determine whether they were done in accordance with appropriate procedures.  That was and remains the objective of the commission of investigation.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I pointed out to the Deputy that I received a letter from the judge on Friday which pointed out to me what the Deputy just said, namely, that all of the documentation received from the special liquidator had an assertion of confidentiality over all of the documents that it submitted.  He made the point that, in addition, it has asserted legal advice privilege over all of the documents containing legal advice.  It is simple honesty.  That is a fact, as stated to me formally in writing by the judge.</p>  <p>  He made the point that his commission had determined that a duty of confidentiality applies to all of those documents, something I told the Deputy yesterday.  Furthermore, I told him that the judge pointed out that the commission had determined that the special liquidator is entitled to claim privilege over any documentation containing such legal advice.  That is the truth from the judge.  He also went on to say that the Department of Finance had made a similar claim of confidentiality and privilege over some of the documentation provided by it and he pointed out that the commission, under his direction, was in the course of preparing a similar determination in respect of that.  Both of those determinations were made available publicly by Mr. Justice Cregan yesterday.  That is a fact and, as I said to the Deputy yesterday, I am not hiding anything.  The judge went on to say that because of these determinations he was not able to proceed.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is asking me about a commission of investigation which was established by the Oireachtas-----</p></speech>

It claims it can be adviser to and investigate the sale, as well as taking steps legally to say the investigation cannot go ahead under a different aegis.  It is incredible that the Taoiseach of the day would claim there is a Chinese wall syndrome at the heart of Government in regard to an investigation into the sale of a company which involved the write-off of &euro;119 million.  Taxpayers lost &euro;119 million on that particular sale and there are many issues pertaining to it.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said in the House that the utilisation of privilege is a matter for one Government Department and not the entire Government.  The Government stated that it established the inquiry in order to vindicate the public interest, yet a Department of that Government, which is the key Department, has stated that it took legal advice and laid claim to confidentiality over documents that are of central importance to the commission.  It is an extraordinary assertion by the Taoiseach which does not hold water.</p>  <p>  When I was Minister for Health, I waived legal privilege and took a decision-----</p></speech>

Last month was the worst October on record for the number of citizens on trolleys in our hospitals.  The number was almost 8,000 people including, infamously, a 91 year old patient who spent 29 hours on a trolley.  In the first ten months of this year, almost 80,000 people, which is the population of a small town, were on trolleys, which is the highest ever figure for the first ten months of any year since trolley watch began.  According to the INMO, for the 15th month in a row, October 2015 saw an increase in the level of overcrowding in emergency departments.</p>  <p>  In Dundalk, 25 year old Dualtagh Donnelly bled to death while waiting for an ambulance to arrive, despite the fact that his family home is only five minutes from the Dundalk ambulance station and five minutes from Louth County Hospital where the accident and emergency department was closed.  His mother, Oonagh, said she felt her son died because of politicians' promises.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, Dr. Gerard Crotty, who said the cause of accident and emergency overcrowding is a lack of capacity because not enough money has been allocated to deal with it?  Will he acknowledge that the public health system requires much greater investment by the Government to deal with the crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100019#R05700"><p>The public health system also requires much greater levels of management and the use of resources of taxpayers' money.  This morning's count at 8 a.m. saw 300 patients waiting on trolleys, according to the report from TrolleyGAR, which does this every day.  Last night at 8 p.m. some 152 patients were waiting on trolleys and at 8 a.m. yesterday morning, Tuesday, 10 November, 320 people were waiting on trolleys.  As the Deputy knows, the number always declines during the course of the day.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health convened the emergency department task force in December last year to provide a real focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by emergency department overcrowding, for which there are many reasons.  Good progress was made in the implementation of this task force's recommendations.  Delayed discharges have reduced steadily, from 830 last December to 567 on 3 November this year, which frees up approximately 265 beds to be used by acutely ill patients every day.  The average number of patients waiting for greater than nine hours on trolleys in October was 115, down from 173 in February before that.</p>  <p>  Waiting times for nursing home support scheme funding has reduced from 11 weeks to three to four weeks.  As the Deputy will recall, we were told before that if we put money into this it would alleviate the problem.  It has not done so despite a serious reduction in the waiting time.  Transitional care funding has continued to support 3,000 approvals, which is very much above the original target of 500, some 1,200 additional home care packages will have been provided by the end of this year, and 173 additional nursing home beds and 65 short stay beds are now open.  In addition to this, &euro;117 million extra has provided in 2015 to help relieve pressure on acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  I would be the first to say this is not the way I would like it to be, but clearly the request for resources, extra capacity and extra staff have all been met in part by the Minister, the Department and the HSE.  In April this year, &euro;74 million was allocated to reduce delayed discharges and lower the waiting times for the fair deal scheme as well as providing additional transitional beds, and &euro;18 million has been allocated to support acute hospital systems over the winter by providing additional bed capacity to deal with these very problems.  This additional funding has come on top of measures already taken when the Government provided the &euro;5 million to deal with these acute hospitals.  For the winter capacity, the hospital groups have all provided particular plans for each of the hospitals in the groups in respect of what they propose to do and how they propose to implement an integrated approach across primary, community, social and acute services to manage winter pressures, the scale of which we do not know yet because of what may occur with the weather and particular flus.</p></speech>

He ignored this.  His response was peppered with saying this is not the way he would want it to be, that the Minister has dealt with these demands in part and that we need much greater levels of management.  Then, without a sense of shame or embarrassment, he announced that today 300 citizens of the State are on trolleys.  What sort of a Taoiseach is he that he can stand there like a commentator and give us this figure?  It is the case that 300 citizens on trolleys as a direct result of Government policy.  It is not an accident, but a direct result of what the Government is doing.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister of Health said that CEOs of hospital groups should be allowed to transfer moneys from hospitals to private providers.  He went on to say that hospital groups should be able to conduct business in the manner of semi-State companies "outside the constraints of public service rules".  These are shocking and revealing comments, which highlight the ideological position of the Government which seeks ultimately to privatise our health services and leave patients at the mercy of a profit margin.</p><p>The silence of the Labour Party in the wake of the Thatcherite proposals from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is notable.</p></speech>

Just yesterday, the relevant Minister, Deputy Donohoe, acknowledged to the Road Safety Authority that the laws are full of loopholes.  Of the motorists before the District Court for drink-driving - we should bear in mind this only happens after they are tested positive for being over the alcohol limit using breath, blood or urine tests - an estimated five out of ten people escape conviction.  Even if a driver is convicted, there is only a one in five chance he or she will have the licence number recorded by the court, potentially allowing the person to continue driving when a court has ordered that he or she should not.  I acknowledge that these figures may be an overestimation but the fact remains that some people believe that technicalities and loopholes in the law, as well as finite Garda resources, mean that drink and drug-driving convictions can be avoided and they are no big deal.</p>  <p>  These convictions are a big deal to many families, some of whom are here today.  Ms Christina Donnelly is in the Gallery today and for her and her son, these convictions would be a devastatingly big deal.  Christina's son Brendan and his friend Lee lost their lives when the car in which they were travelling was struck by a drunk driver.  The driver, who fled the scene, was subsequently found guilty of dangerous driving causing their deaths, serving three years and eight months in prison.  Brendan was 24 when he died.  The lives of all his family were torn apart that day and they are struggling since to come to terms with the devastating loss.  Kate Flynn, who was to be here today, suffers five epileptic fits per day as a result of that accident.  She is now undergoing surgery.  Otherwise she would have been here today.  Deputy Finian McGrath told me of Lucy O'Farrell whose son was also killed by a drunk driver.</p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach is meeting the family later and we are very grateful for that.  Christina Donnelly has dedicated her life to road safety and is here today seeking the Taoiseach's support for the implementation of Brendan's law.  Under that law, drivers involved in fatal accidents who fail a breath test would have their licence automatically suspended until the court appearance.  Christina also believes that people found guilty of causing death while drunk or on drugs should serve a six-year jail term, with no discounts for good behaviour and mandatory disqualification from driving for up to 25 years.  What she is proposing is not unreasonable since in several other jurisdictions, a licence would be seized instantly if a motorist is found to be over the legal limit.  If a drunk driver causes serious injury or death, the licence would sometimes be suspended for life in some jurisdictions.  On Ms Donnelly's behalf and that of the many other families, some of whom could not be here today, I ask for the Taoiseach's support for Brendan's law.  Many people are watching on televisions throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am very happy to say hello to Christina after these questions.  We can all empathise when death comes to any family under any circumstances, but it can be particularly tragic when it is caused by road accidents and specifically drunk driving.  The key to reducing injuries and fatalities on our roads is to continue to change driver behaviour.  It has changed from what it was 15 or 20 years ago.  To this day for this year, 132 fatalities on the road have been recorded.  That number is down by 30 for the same date last year.  This cannot bring anybody back and those deaths create great tragedy and stress for many families.</p>  <p>  Strides have been taken to strengthen the law.  The introduction of mandatory alcohol testing has been a very effective instrument in preventing people driving in the first place when alcohol is taken.  The blood alcohol content limit has been reduced, with even lower levels for learner drivers.  All drivers in road traffic collisions where a serious injury occurs are now obliged to provide a preliminary breath specimen.  Under the most recent road traffic Act from 2014, further measures were taken to strengthen the law, including the provision of road impairment tests.  These are non-technological tests for drunkenness or intoxication.  There is also the testing for intoxicants in incapacitated drivers following road traffic collisions.  Furthermore, all convictions for drink-driving offences in the District Court carry a mandatory disqualification for a minimum of six months.  Apart from that mandatory disqualification applying under the administrative penalty system, which only applies to drink-drivers below a certain limit and those who have not received a drink-driving fixed penalty notice within the previous three years, it is a matter for the courts to make a disqualification order which can be of any length preventing a person from validly holding a driver's licence for a period.  That is a matter for the judge.</p>  <p>  Due to the nature of the road traffic legislation and the constantly shifting circumstances, road traffic legislation is always a work in progress.  The Minister has stated that because the road traffic Acts go back for many years, with many of them quite complicated and some out of date, he proposes to codify and update the road traffic legislation.  That will take the sections, bits and pieces from over the years and put them into a modern law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned Brendan's law.  I am aware of the death of Brendan and his friend, Lee, and the other driver in the accident having been jailed for five years but serving a shorter sentence.  He has been banned from driving for 15 years.  I know what Ms Christina Donnelly is indicating when she says she would like to see a minimum sentence of six years plus a 15-year driving ban for anybody convicted of drunk driving causing death.  In her case, the death was of her 24 year old son Brendan.</p>  <p>  What Deputy Halligan raises is perfectly valid.</p><p>However, I suggest that as the Minister is ordering a review of all traffic legislation, to codify and update it to give us modern legislation, the case for Brendan's law can be debated in that context regarding whether it should become part of a reviewed and updated legislation.  It is a very valid point of view, one of many valid points of view that are brought forward when this kind of situation arises.  I would be happy to have it considered and will discuss it with the Minister in the context of the review of the legislation that is taking place.</p></speech>

As we know, one in three road crashes in this country is alcohol-related.  The issue here is that the day after a crash, a drunk driver who was involved in that crash, even if it has resulted in the loss of life, is free to get behind the wheel again.  I am not passing any comment on the individual case, but this individual was actually photographed in the paper a few weeks after that with the keys of a new car.  This is the problem here.  Any disqualification comes into effect 14 days from the date of the conviction.  If the motorist, for instance, appeals that conviction, it will be adjourned until the appeal is heard and he can continue to drive in the interim.</p>  <p>  I know the Government is acutely aware of the shortcomings of that particular Act, the 1961 Act and yesterday the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, acknowledged the increasing issue of drug driving and said new legislation was being drafted.  We are asking the Taoiseach to commit to bringing consideration of the proposed Brendan's law, which simply put would mean that if a person is stopped for drunk driving or drug driving and is over the limit - all the indications are that many people who are stopped are not over the limit - they should not be allowed to drive until they come before the courts.  Thousands of people around the country and around Europe have signed up to this.  I am not passing any comments on sentencing, but such drivers should not be allowed drive before they come before the courts.  One individual had 83 previous convictions.  This Sunday is the UN World Day of Remembrance for road traffic victims.  I know the Taoiseach is supporting this family and is going to meet them and his support today would send a clear message to motorists that the Government intends to come down hard on people who drink and drive and who use drugs and drive.</p></speech>

There is no excuse for any person to sit behind the wheel of a car with alcohol taken.  It is against the law and enforcement of the law is what people need to understand.  I share the Deputy's view, because nothing can bring back the life of a person who is killed because of drunk driving.  We had the recent powerful impact statement by a mother in respect of the loss of her young son.  It is 54 years since the Road Traffic Act 1961 was introduced.  Since then, 15 different traffic Acts have been introduced in this House.  It is now past time to have that all codified and updated.  The Deputy's request on behalf of Christina Donnelly regarding Brendan's law should be considered and that review is the time to do that.  I would be happy to discuss that and that the Minister would consider it when the time comes.  These laws are complex and they will not be reviewed overnight.</p>  <p>  The Minister is now implementing drugs testing capacity on the roadside for drivers who have either drunk alcohol or engaged in substance abuse and sit behind the wheel of a car.  The vast majority of people, particularly young people, understand this.  One does not see the things we used to see years ago.  There has been a big improvement, but any death is one too many.  It is a point to be considered and I thank Deputy Halligan for raising it.</p></speech>

There is a lack of clarity about the final figure in a reply on 4 November and the Minister said the final figure would need to reflect the latest view of HSE year-end performance and that it is too early at this stage to assess accurately the projected overall deficit for 2015.  That was earlier this month.  I did raise with the Taoiseach yesterday that hospitals around the country are still waiting for news of the Supplementary Estimate in so far as how it affects their acute hospitals and whether the deficits they currently have or are projecting will be met in total out of the &euro;600 million.  It is a very serious issue going into next year, because the EU fiscal rules do not allow for over-expenditure or Supplementary Estimates.  When will we have the presentation of the health Supplementary Estimate to the D&aacute;il and will a debate be facilitated when that is produced?  I also want to seek clarity on the legislative programme as regards the one-year bankruptcy issue and the legislation that was produced by Deputy Penrose and accepted.</p><p>Yesterday, in his reply, the Taoiseach stated that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, had proposals to bring to the D&aacute;il arising out of the Oireachtas committee's report.  I am seeking to ascertain the status of the Bill that is already on the Order Paper to provide for a one-year bankruptcy law.  Is the Government favourably disposed to that and is it of a mind to allow that Bill to be passed through the Oireachtas before the end of this legislative session?  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could address the specifics of the Bill produced by Deputy Penrose - the Minister may have separate plans - and provide clarity on it in terms of the legislative programme and the Government's legislative intentions in that regard.</p></speech>

She got the report from the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in July last and she instructed her officials to examine in detail the substantial issues that are raised by the committee in it.  As indicated to Deputy Martin yesterday, I expect the Minister to bring her analysis of that report to Cabinet in the next couple of weeks.</p>  <p>  The Minister also pointed out that priority had been given to the passage through the Oireachtas of the important reforms contained in the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, to the implementing measures and court rules necessary to bring that into effect, and to the development and implementation of a range of measures to strengthen support for those in mortgage arrears on their homes, as was announced by the Government in May last.  I must provide an update to the House from the Minister in respect of whether we can get this through in this session or not.  My intention would be that it could happen.  There are a number of pieces of legislation which are on the stocks to move through, and if it is possible to put this through I certainly will be strongly in support of it.</p></speech>

The health (transport support) Bill is intended to provide for a scheme to make individual payments towards transport costs for citizens with severe disabilities.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, the Government scrapped the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance, and any citizen who was not in a scheme at that time has not had access to any transport scheme since then.</p></speech>

The electoral (amendment) (referendum spending and miscellaneous provisions) Bill will provide for the extension of the spending limit period.  It has not been approved by the Government yet and is No. 83 on the list.  Will it be approved by the Houses and will the limits be implemented before the general election?</p>  <p>  The Seanad electoral (university members) (amendment) Bill will give effect to the 1979 referendum on Seanad university franchise.  I was two years of age when the people voted on the issue.  When will the legislation come before the House and is it the sum total of the Government's Seanad reform proposals?</p>  <p>  I have asked about the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill numerous times.  The Bill has been before the House since 2005 and is awaiting Report Stage.  It is an insult to the House that it is still on the Order Paper.  Let us have the Report Stage debate or drop the Bill.  It has been recommitted to the Order Paper after successive general elections.  It is time to make a decision on it.</p>  <p>  The sea fisheries and maritime jurisdiction (amendment) Bill is to introduce a points system for skippers who infringe the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Taoiseach will be aware that the second largest trawler in the world is trawling off Donegal while fishermen who have been banned from fishing their own waters are looking out the window.  What type of legislation is the Taoiseach bringing forward to ensure the trawlers are properly inspected and conform with the Common Fisheries Policy?</p></speech>

I do not want to have to invoke it again.  The 1979 legislation probably will not come before us before the end of the session.  It is not the sum total of the Government's intention on Seanad reform.  A very interesting document was put forward by a number of people who served in the Seanad over the years and who have no vested interest in serving there any longer.  I gave Deputy Adams a commitment that we would have a debate on it, and we will when I get the opportunity.  I will have to come back to the Deputy about the electoral (amendment) (referendum spending and miscellaneous provisions) Bill.

The EPAs are pouring petrol on the migration flame.  I thank the Taoiseach for his earlier commitment to have a short debate on No. 17 on the Order Paper.  Will all groups in the House have an opportunity to contribute to the debate?  Can we have a broader debate on the impact the EPAs are having on migration across Africa into Europe?</p></speech>

I would like to think that we could have a suitably arranged debate here.  There are many groups in the House and if we were to give them all lengthy opportunities, it could go on for a very long time.  As I said, we will debate it when it comes back and we will see who we can facilitate or who is interested.  The Deputy's point about migration from Africa is part of the discussions taking place in Valletta today.  It is a set-piece arrangement.  The camps in the Horn of Africa are in a horrendous state and Ireland has had an interest in the matter for many years from a humanitarian perspective.  We will try to facilitate it on the committee, and the group discussion can take place when it comes back.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1090" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100024#W10400"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to protect, on reasonable grounds, the financial autonomy of vulnerable persons, specifically elderly people, who lack reasonable mental and physical capacity, and to guard against financial abuse.</blockquote><p>I thank the staff of my office for helping me to compile this Private Members' Bill.  A HSE working group that was set up to look at the issue of elder abuse produced a report, Protecting our Future, in 2002.  The report identified elder abuse as &quot;a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human and civil rights&quot;.  This report, which was published 13 years ago, categorised the various types of abuse that may result from deliberate intent, neglect, thoughtlessness or ignorance as physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and financial or material abuse, including theft, fraud, exploitation, pressure in connection with wills, property or inheritance or financial transactions, or the misuse or misappropriation of property, possessions or benefits.</p><p>The Private Members' Bill I am placing before the House today deals specifically with the financial aspect of the abuse of elderly people.  The statistics available to us on this issue are deeply disturbing.  Between 2007 and 2013, the HSE received 13,000 referrals from senior social workers relating specifically to elder abuse.  That is a huge number by any standards.  This phenomenon of elder abuse is an activity within society that is cloaked in secrecy and shame on the part of the victims and families involved.  The figure of 13,000 that I have mentioned is probably an underestimate of the true scale of the problem.</p><p>The Bill I am proposing has two simple objectives.  First, it seeks to codify in legislation what is meant by financial abuse of the elderly and to propose suitable legal sanctions depending on the severity of each case.  In the context of this Bill, financial abuse of the elderly means interfering with the financial autonomy and well-being of an elderly person by deception or intimidation or obtaining or using the funds or assets of an elderly person to benefit someone other than this elderly person.  Second, the Bill seeks to reignite a national conversation on how we treat elderly people and the measures we can put in place to offer them greater security and peace of mind.  We all know how challenging the present times are for elderly people who live in isolation, poverty or a state of fear of rural crime.</p><p>I am more hopeful of achieving my second objective than my first objective, given the marked reluctance of the Government to accept recommendations made in the Private Members' Bills introduced by Opposition Members.  I hope the Government will accept this Bill and allow it to advance for discussion and debate on Committee Stage.  This serious issue is of concern to many people.  The report I have mentioned indicates these serious issues have existed since 2002.  As I have said, the 13,000 complaints made by senior social workers between 2007 and 2013 might be the tip of the iceberg, bearing in mind the sensitivity and privacy issues associated with families.  The whole issue of pride arises as well.  Many people do not want to have situations being reported and Garda investigations taking place.</p><p>It is an honest effort on my part to deal with this issue.  The Bill can be taken, discussed, debated and amended and I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to do that.</p></speech>

Within decades of children in this country having been demonised, brutalised and criminalised for their audacity to be poor, different, abandoned, orphaned, troubled or just plain neglected, with Children First they are recognised and constitutionally protected as citizens of the Republic in their own right.  For this Government it was, and remains, a first but important step in creating an Ireland where the ideas and experiences of childhood are recognised, respected and protected.  As a country we have a lot to be proud of but we also have a lot to be ashamed of and a lot to be sorry for.  It remains in our psyche as a nation.</p>  <p>  When this Government was elected in 2011, I was determined to undo some of the wrongs done to our children and other fragile members of our society.  We have introduced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, the Child and Family Agency Act, the Children and Family Relationships Act and the Gender Recognition Act of 2015.  Children First is not a political amulet to hang around Ireland's neck to protect us from the misdeeds of past generations.  Rather, it is truly reforming legislation that recognises our children and protects their position under the Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  It establishes them as individuals with their own separate rights and their own discrete needs in terms of respect, dignity and protection.  We were determined to make Children First something that Ireland could and would be proud of, both in legislation and in practice.  At the same time, we were adamant that in our determination to forge a new and proper child protection reality in this country, we would move with all speed to protect a child in danger but would not commit the critical error of making up for past shortcomings and major lapses towards our children, catalogued in report after report, by taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  We had to make sure that no institution, regardless of its origin, would ever again trump the best interests of the individual child and his or her needs, rights and dignity.  That is why under Children First, in any cases of competing interests, it is the child's best interests alone that take precedence.  </p>  <p>  Children First is not a child protection panacea nor a social or national salve.  Rather, it is comprehensive legislation that protects the child and actively promotes his or her best interests at all times.  The family, in all its modern and compassionate forms, is the basis of society.  Whenever possible, it is better for a child to remain within its family unit.  Sometimes, however, this is simply not possible.  The cases publicised by the child care law reporting project show the significant need for intervention and protection and for family and individual support.  These and other cases show that across Ireland there are children marooned not in lives, but in an existence of neglect, violence or abuse, with no functioning adult in the family to provide not just practical things like meals, hygiene and protection, but also the love, respect and dignity that can make a child and determine his or her future.  </p>  <p>  As I have said before on many occasions, I am anxious to reassure families that Children First is not and will not become a charter for trespass by the State and its agencies into their lives and the lives of their children.  In fact, the Government resolved that Children First would clearly set out and demand that any actions taken be first and always in the best interests of the child and that they be judicious, timely and proportionate.  Of course, accountability is the way to guarantee the public responsibility commensurate with such public power in what are intensely private and personal circumstances.  I pay tribute to the social workers and care workers who do such a magnificent job with our children and families.  They deserve our highest respect.  We all depend on them to make the legislation work.  </p>  <p>  The Government did not draft this legislation in a vacuum.  It is integral to our commitment and our plan to do more for our children and to do better for our families.  Even at the height of the economic crisis, we put all our children first by creating a Department of Children and Youth Affairs with its own designated senior Minister.  It is clear in many cases that when we are intervening, we are already too late.  We must catch children and families before they fall.  We must support families from day one if we are to give them the future and opportunity they deserve.  Good and proportionate intervention is not interference, be it parenting programmes, family support services or the chance of an early education.  It is how we truly support all our children and every family, in terms of health, nutrition, learning and social opportunities, now and into the future.  That is good for our children, families, economy and society.  We know that the rate of economic return on good early years investment is significantly higher than for any other stage in a child's life, so if not then, when?  It is the way to a secure home life, access to education and later a good job and a place in society.  This is our idiom of care as a government.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I pay tribute to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, and his Department for delivering on this legislation today.  I also pay tribute to the Members of this House and of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, particularly Senator Jillian van Turnhout, for their support, guidance and good counsel.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to say these few words on the passing of this legislation.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100025#X02500"><p>I understand that we are discussing amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together but I wish to make a few introductory remarks before referring to those amendments.</p>  <p>  Today, we enact important legislation, as the Taoiseach has just said.  This legislation is important for Ireland's children.  The legacy of child abuse in Ireland casts a dark shadow over our Republic, a republic that declared in its Proclamation that it would cherish all our children equally, but it did not do so.  We know that the Ireland of the past was too willing to tolerate silence on the issue of child abuse, reassuring ourselves that our worst suspicions could not be well founded and allowing the abuse of children to go unchecked.  </p>  <p>  There is no silver bullet that will bring the abuse of children to an end but this Bill is an important statement of our collective obligation to put children first and to recognise that the rights of children are no less important than the rights of any adult.  The passage of this legislation honours the commitment in our programme for Government to put key elements of the Children First guidance on a statutory footing for the first time.  </p>  <p>  As passed by this House, the Bill contained three main elements relating to child welfare and protection and following a Government amendment in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Children First Bill also includes a provision to abolish the common law defence of reasonable chastisement.</p><p>The first of the three original elements of the Bill is to oblige certain professionals and others working with children to report child protection concerns to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and assist, if requested to do so, in the agency's assessment of risk.  Second, the legislation requires those providing services to children to be proactive about child protection.  They must assess the risk of harm coming to a child while using their service and produce a child safeguarding statement setting out the steps they are taking to mitigate that risk.  Third, the Bill places the Children First implementation group on a statutory footing.  The group, which includes representation from all Departments, Tusla, the Health Service Executive and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will promote compliance with Children First across the public sector.  It will also monitor implementation of the legislation and report annually to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<br/><br/>The Government committed itself to reforming provision for children and families, and this legislation is an important addition to the architecture protecting the safety and welfare of children.  It requires those who know about risk to children to alert Tusla and ensures the agency will have the information and co-operation it needs to address concerns about children's welfare or protection.  It is a manifestation of the reality that children's safety is all of our business.<br/><br/>Following a Government amendment introduced in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Bill also abolishes the defence of so-called reasonable chastisement.  The Government had committed itself to removing this defence, and following a proposal made by Senator Jillian van Turnhout, who is present in the Gallery, an amendment was introduced to remove entirely this outdated legal defence.  I strongly commend the Senator on her initiative and Senators on their strong endorsement of this measure. <br/><br/>This issue has been under consideration for too long, having been considered by the Law Reform Commission as far back as 1994.  It is not uniquely Irish, however, as international human rights bodies continue to highlight shortcomings in legal frameworks to protect children from violence in the developed and developing world.  While physical assault against children is already illegal, specifically in section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, which deals with the assault on any person, and section 246 of the Children Act 2001, which deals with cruelty to children, it is only in respect of assaults against children by their parents or persons acting <i>in loco parentis</i>other than teachers that it is possible to argue in defence that it was reasonable for the parent to assault his or her child.  Removing this defence in no way diminishes the primary importance of parents as the key educators and carers of their children.  It does not challenge legitimate parental authority.  Rather, this is an issue of fundamental human rights, a clear and unqualified statement that children have the same unqualified legal protection against physical assault as is afforded to all citizens.  It is a practical and tangible manifestation of children's rights.<br/><br/>The Children First Bill is part of the Government's much broader agenda of advancing children's rights and protections through significant statutory structural and strategic change.  The drive to enhance a prevention and early intervention rather than crisis intervention approach to child protection is at the core of our efforts.  This important orientation is evidenced in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 and the Bill before us.<br/><br/>While simple in form, the amendment can have a considerable impact in future for the good of children, their parents and wider society.  The Children First Bill constitutes an important step forward in children's rights and protections.  It is fundamental to establishing a culture that categorically proclaims that all children in this State are to be protected and that individuals, professionals and organisations will all play their part in ensuring this is the case.<br/><br/>I thank Senators and look forward to thanking Deputies for their contribution to the passage of this Bill.  I look forward to the co-operation of all parts of society in making Ireland a safer place for children and to the realisation of the proclamation that we will cherish all our children equally and treat them as our fellow citizens, with respect and the dignity all our citizens deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100026#Y00200"><p>I very much welcome the passage of this Bill.  As the Minister will be aware, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has supported this very important legislation since its inception.  As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising and having placed the children's rights referendum before the country almost three years ago, it is important we enshrine the rights of children in the Constitution.</p><p>The main element of the Bill will make the reporting of child protection concerns a statutory duty.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that never again will any person or institution place his, her or its good above the interests or well-being of children.  In welcoming the Bill, I should point out that many of its provisions could have been strengthened.  After four years of gestation, the legislation does not go far enough in applying sanctions to people who fail to report child protection concerns.  This amounts to a watering down of the legislation originally promised by the Department, albeit when the Minister's predecessor was <i>in situ</i>.  Initially, the Bill provided for significant and robust sanctions to be applied to persons who failed to comply with its provisions.  For my part, I sought to strengthen the legislation during the various Stages in the D&aacute;il by proposing amendments that would have made it a punishable offence not to report child abuse concerns or for a provider to continue to provide services to children without a child safety certificate, having been on the register of non-compliance for 30 days.  These were constructive proposals but the Minister did not believe it necessary to accept them.  I will hold him to the commitment he gave at the time to keep the matter under strict review.</p><p>While legislation is critical, the policies adopted and the budgetary decisions and changes made have a direct impact on the legislation.  It is good that we had a referendum on children's rights, that the rights of the child are being enshrined in legislation and that this Bill will be enacted today.  However, we cannot ignore the simple fact that in 2013, 11.7% of children, or one child in eight, were living in consistent poverty and 37% of children were experiencing deprivation.  In 2014, UNICEF published a study on the impact of recession on children which ranked Ireland 37th out of 41 countries in a league table measuring relative changes in child poverty.  We were close to the bottom of the list.</p><p>The Taoiseach alluded to the good work being done by social workers and care workers and no one could take that away from those professionals.  However, the Minister will be aware from our discussions on Committee Stage and from previous debates that child care and social workers have been put to the pin of their collars.  The most recent report by the independent Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, reveals serious deficits in the child protection and care systems administered by Tusla.  His audit found that last year Tusla managed to deal in a timely manner with only one fifth of all reports of child abuse.  By any measure, this is a gross systems failure on the part of the Minister and the management of Tusla.  The Child and Family Agency was established with the purpose of strengthening the child protection system in place under the Health Service Executive.  We now know that the agency is failing to investigate child abuse claims immediately.</p></speech>

The proof of the pudding is in the statistics I have highlighted.  The Taoiseach is right that we do not want to be intervening at a late stage.  We must intervene and prevent problems from happening.  That is why we should support institutions and services such as the family resource centres.</p>  <p>  On the amendment from the Seanad, I compliment Senator van Turnhout on her work and the Minister on taking it on board.  It comes about as a direct consequence of the requirement in an EU directive that we ban the reasonable chastisement of children.  That is right and proper.  We must acknowledge that there are parents who need support over and above other parents.  We must put in place positive parenting programmes to support parents who find it difficult to bring up their children.  It cannot always be about punishment.  It also has to be about supporting parents to do the job.  As the Taoiseach and the Minister said and as I agree, in 99% of cases, the best place for a child is in his or her home.  Some homes need more support than others and it is our responsibility to put those supports in place.  I support the passing of the legislation through the Oireachtas today.</p></speech>

It is a good day when the Bill is eventually reaching a conclusion.  I welcome the important amendments to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement from the Statute Book and I commend Senator van Turnhout on tabling the amendments and the Minister on accepting them.

In accepting the Minister's remarks on reasonable chastisement, it is important to acknowledge that it is a positive amendment and to commend Senator van Turnhout and the Minister on it.  We were out of step with Europe and had that look of austerity about us in the context of what the Council of Europe referred to as the violation of young people's rights.</p>  <p>  The Ceann Comhairle does not want us to give Second Stage speeches but Deputy Troy referred to the ongoing ills he raises every time he gets a chance.  He has a point in terms of how one brings forward the rights of the child.  The current D&aacute;il and Seanad have seen the committee system move forward through its pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Ceann Comhairle has allowed us to do that and deserves credit for doing so.  The committee system has dealt forensically with the children's legislation.  While I am digressing slightly, I disagree with the Ceann Comhairle's suggestion that we should not have a committee week.  We should have a committee week where we can bring the scrutiny work we do to the floor of the Chamber.  To be fair to Deputies Troy and McLellan and Senators van Turnhout and Henry, we have worked in the committee in a non-partisan way to do what is best for children.  The legislation demonstrates amply, as do other Bills, the collaboration and collective responsibility involved.  While I am biased, I consider that the Committee on Health and Children has worked very well in putting forward suggestions and amendments, which is a credit to our members.</p>  <p>  Today is a reforming day.  It is about legislation being enacted and the child being recognised.  Deputy Troy's point that it is about parents and positive parenting being given an opportunity to shine is equally true.  We had a briefing this morning with Senator Eamonn Coghlan on the healthy city initiative.  One of the things we must do if we are to learn from the past is to be proactive with parents to empower them and work with them to ensure their parenting is positive and that they have the skills and resources to become better parents.  In reflecting on the past, is it not brilliant and extraordinary that a child can be recognised in his or her own right under the Constitution?  It requires us to learn from the past.  Those of us who were in the previous Seanad discussed the reports on child abuse and the shock and horror associated with it.  I said during the debate on the Cloyne report that I was in the position of knowing some of the people who were abused and some of the abusers.  It was an extraordinary reflection on society that we were forced to deny things.  In a cathartic exercise, we were able to debate and give people the freedom to be who they were in the context of the legacy of the past.  Just last week, the Joint Committee on Health and Children heard testimony on the adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  We heard of the powerful personal experiences of some of the mothers and women, which was extraordinary.  We were moved at the committee meeting to hear from women who were treated appallingly by the State.  With this Bill, we again see the Oireachtas reflecting on the past and learning from it.  The Taoiseach was right to praise the work of social workers.  They are tremendous people who do huge work in all our cities and counties.</p>  <p>  Deputy Troy mentioned the budgetary effect.  The previous budget included a child care package and we have had an increase in child benefit.  We have seen an increase in the number of teachers being employed to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is all about assisting families and children for their greater good.  We have a collective responsibility in this D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I am very proud of the men and women who serve on the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  They have done powerful work in analysing legislation.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  Deputy Troy mentioned the issue of criminal sanction in relation to people who run services for children not having a safety statement.  The matter was discussed at length on Committee Stage and in the Seanad.  The rationale is straightforward.  It would require a huge amount of time and money to put in place an inspectorate with all the judicial requirements around that.  It was felt by many that this was not an appropriate use of scarce resources when the choice was between that and providing services to children.  It is a matter we will keep under review, however.  If what we have designed fails to deliver, we will certainly take action.</p>  <p>  Deputy Buttimer has addressed child poverty.  There was an increase in funding of &euro;38 million for Tusla and another &euro;27 million to clear any so-called backward debt.  There was an increase of 33% in the &euro;260 million to bring it to &euro;345 million for child care packages.  Free GP care, increased child benefit and more teachers were also provided for.  The budget shows that Tusla has the funding to address its core objectives and services.  There will always be a need for more and as the country continues to recover economically, more money will be available to invest in this area.</p>  <p>  I thank the Members for their co-operation on the Bill.  I commend specifically our social workers who have an extraordinary record in an international context.  Our attrition rate is much lower which is a reflection on their commitment to the service they provide.</p></speech>

I refer to the building project in Naas that has been stalled for several years over a planning matter, leaving standing tower cranes that are a blight on the skyline and the town.  Wherever a town or village has what is seen to be a stalled development or blighted streetscape, there is an unwarranted question mark over it.  The purpose of this debate is to ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to contact the local authority and help it in every way possible to bring about a resolution.</p>  <p>  Arbitration has been under way for some time.  Because the issues have been outstanding for several years, it is imperative that immediate steps be taken to bring the matter to a resolution.  One problem is that there is only one arbitrator for the entire country.  I know this is so, as I obtained that information through parliamentary questions.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that the work is imminent, it remains necessary and desirable to focus attention on the issue at hand and to bring it to a conclusion at an early date.  The same can be said of a number of adjoining towns that were victims of the economic crash.  Sufficient time has gone by to enable the facilities to be restarted, to reinvigorate the stalled developments and to ensure that they become part and parcel of the economic entity that is Naas.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State use his good offices to ascertain from the local authority what, if anything, is required beyond the resources currently available to it and to encourage speedy arbitration?  If he is called on to do something further, will he do so early in order to bring about a satisfactory resolution?  Approaching the Christmas season, it would be an important boost to the town were a settlement on the outstanding issues possible.</p></speech>

He has raised it a number of times and it is of concern to him and his constituents.  However, the management of issues relating to town centres is primarily a matter for the relevant local authority.  From inquiries made of Kildare County Council, I am informed that its involvement in this regard relates to the compulsory acquisition of two small parcels of land, with the main issue being the amount to be paid by the local authority to the landowners involved.  I understand that both parcels of land are due for arbitration, with hearings on the first parcel taking place this week and hearings on the second scheduled for early in the new year.  The remainder of the stalled town centre development is connected to NAMA, and Kildare County Council is precluded from involvement, while NAMA reports to the Minister for Finance on its activities.</p>  <p>  My ministerial role as regards planning and development generally is mainly to provide and update the legislative and policy guidance framework, including national urban policy.  I have no mandate regarding individual town centre developments, which are matters for local authorities.  In the broader sense of urban policy initiatives to rejuvenate town centres, a number of measures have been introduced by my Department in recent years.  Local authorities were requested to exercise restraint or, where possible, reduce commercial rates and local charges to assist local businesses in the current economic climate.  The majority of local authorities have responded positively.  Revised development contribution guidelines were introduced in January 2013 requesting that planning authorities put in place reduced development contributions to support town centre development and incentivise activity in the areas prioritised for development in the relevant core strategy.  The publication of new guidelines on retail planning in April 2012 were aimed at promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres.  These guidelines retained the previous caps on store size in less populated and smaller towns and were aimed at striking the right balance to ensure that local monopolies were not created in smaller towns, as these would be detrimental to competition.  In addition, the recently enacted Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which we passed in July, provides for the introduction of a vacant site levy to stimulate the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas with a view to restoring them to beneficial use.</p>  <p>  In terms of Government action other than by my Department to provide assistance to retail businesses and stimulate economic activity in urban areas, a number of measures have been introduced since 2011, including the introduction of the 9% rate of VAT on certain goods and services, the halving of the lower rate of employers' PRSI and the introduction of the microenterprise loan scheme and the credit guarantee scheme, both of which have had take-up from the retail sector.  Furthermore, the Government recently announced a new &euro;30 million investment in rural towns and villages in the years ahead.  This new scheme is aimed at supporting their revitalisation and increasing their attractiveness and sustainability with the aim of improving the living and working environment and enhancing their potential to support increased economic activity.</p>  <p>  The combination of these measures is evidence of the Government's commitment to addressing town renewal issues generally, and we will continue to progress such initiatives.  As indicated, however, the management of the stalled town centre development in Naas is primarily a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance.  With relevant processes under way involving NAMA and arbitration, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister of State to become involved or make any further comment on the matter.</p></speech>

I note the progress that has taken place to date, notwithstanding that the matter is primarily one for the local authority.  In view of the fact that the Government has already allocated approximately &euro;30 million for the upgrading of town centres throughout the country, it is appropriate for the Minister of State's Department to ask the various local authorities how and when they intend to use the funding and whether it would be possible to use it to complement the completion works required in Naas.  Admittedly, the allocation is obviously for towns and villages all over the country.</p>  <p>  One quality of a town that is of most benefit to its population and commercial sector is its appearance.  If the appearance is good, it encourages people to come to the area, spend money there, and feel good about it.  For a feel-good factor to manifest itself, it is important for the Minister of State to keep in touch with the local authority and inquire regularly to ensure that everything that can possibly be done is being done to bring about a rapid conclusion to the issues that have been outstanding for some time.</p>  <p>  While we all expect it will still take some time to address the arbitration issues, the fact that arbitration has started should now give rise to the possibility of taking action in anticipation of the conclusion of the negotiations, so we will not have to wait until everything is done before we start making preparations for a final conclusion.</p>  <p>  Again, I thank the Minister of State for his reply and recognise that he has already been in touch with the local authority in regard to this matter.  I thank him and his officials for their interest in the issue.  Will he try to ensure a rapid conclusion in respect of the outstanding works?</p></speech>

It is important that we debate and focus continually on how we can regenerate our towns and villages.  As the Deputy requested, we will engage with the local authorities on the &euro;30 million stimulus fund targeted at the renewal of towns and villages.  We will be making calls in this respect.  The local authorities will prioritise their submissions and send them to my Department, which will then assess them and make allocations accordingly.</p>  <p>  Urban regeneration is very logical, and I support the Deputy in this regard.  Urban regeneration is a priority for the Government.  It is logical because it concerns sites in the middle of towns that are serviced in terms of infrastructure and public utilities.  The sites are in the centre of communities and can be accessed by those communities.  Therefore, it makes perfect sense to prioritise urban sites, including town-centre sites.  For this reason, we brought forth the urban regeneration Bill in July of this year.  There are a number of incentives in that legislation, but also a number of sanctions for landowners who do not bring their sites back into beneficial use.  The Government will be and has been pursuing this vigorously.</p>  <p>  I expect local authorities to be proactive in terms of the regeneration of sites, be they for commercial development or for housing, in town centres and villages.  They have an obligation to be proactive.  They need to resolve any issues associated with the sites.  I encourage the local authorities, as the economy recovers and as opportunities arise, to bring sites back into beneficial use for the benefit of local economies and citizens in towns.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the role of NAMA, which is in control of many of the sites.  It reports to the Minister for Finance.  It needs to be made clear that NAMA has a social responsibility to make progress on the sites and remove them from the list of vacant, blighted or derelict sites.  NAMA has a role in bringing forward proposals to bring sites back into beneficial use as early as possible.  That message will be sent to those concerned.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100029#CC00400"><p>I wish to highlight an issue that many people mistakenly believe has been solved.  Sadly, it has not, and that is why I feel the need to raise it on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  People will be well aware of the Waterford Crystal pensions issue.  The factory was the pride of Waterford and it was shut down very suddenly.  Scenes from the grey days of the closure were carried on the news and are burnt into the memory of every person in Waterford.  There is not a family in Waterford that has not been affected.  This is a very difficult time for everybody.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the former MEP Proinsias De Rossa, was one of the people who from the very early days supported the former workers in pointing out that they might have a case to bring in respect of their pensions after the double insolvency of the company.  As we know, the case was fought by this State and brought to the European Court of Justice before being sent to the Irish courts for settlement.  As a Waterford Deputy, I believe the route that was taken was a very difficult one.  It brought me no pleasure to see the case being fought in the court system.  However, I have done my very best to support the workers as best I could.  I have set up meetings and kept in close contact with the former workers and Unite all along the way.  Much of the work has been behind the scenes.  I have been fighting the corner of the former workers at every opportunity presented to me, be it in regard to PRSI reimbursement or the outcome agreed.  I thank the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, Unite and the Department of Social Protection for brokering the conclusion on the deal.</p>  <p>  What makes me raise this issue, however, brings me no pleasure, although there have been some very positive developments in the Waterford Crystal pensions case in the past year, with a sum of &euro;182 million agreed as compensation after the company and its pension scheme went into insolvency.  The agreement was announced last December.  Included in the settlement was a lump-sum payment of approximately &euro;45 million.  It has taken a while, and there have been many ups and downs on the journey, but I am very happy to see that during the summer months, to the considerable relief of the workers and their families, they received their lump-sum payments.  However, two issues arise and I will not go back to Waterford this week until I have an answer in respect of both.  People are sick of ringing my office and the Department only to have no information forthcoming.  I spoke to a man this morning who said he had paid his dues for 42 years and was not asking for anything to which was not entitled.  Of the 1,774 claimants in the case, the number of pensioners is actually quite small.  What I want to know is when these pensioners will get their payment.  The people who have turned 66 are entitled to their pensions and are still waiting for this matter to be sorted.  I demand to know what the delay is.  Have the pensioners not been waiting long enough?  I have been trying to get answers for weeks, to no avail.  I acknowledge that the staff of the Department of Social Protection have been brilliant, particularly the team led by Mr. Liam Daly in the offices on the Cork Road in Waterford, but we need to get this sorted.  The request is simple.</p>  <p>  The second question, which is very emotive, requires an answer.  Since the pension case was put in train, 44 people have died.  I refer to the issue of the deceased workers and their families.  One man, Mr. Tommy Allen, whom the T&aacute;naiste met, received his lump sum in recent weeks, one week before he sadly passed away.  He is but one of 44 who are deceased.  The terms of the settlement that was agreed and announced last December are such that the families of the deceased are to receive their entitlements.  However, there seems to be a delay here also.  I want answers on this.</p><p>In many cases the relatives of the deceased are in their 80s.  Not only are they trying to cope with losing a beloved family member but also they do not have the wherewithal to keep chasing down what is rightfully theirs.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the work of Unite and the Labour Relations Commission.  In addition, I know Deputy Conway has constantly raised this issue, if not daily then certainly weekly in recent years.</p>  <p>  The mediated agreement for the former Waterford Crystal workers, which covers 1,774 scheme members, provides for the payment of a tax-free once-off lump sum of &euro;1,200 for every year of scheme service, not exceeding 40 years, plus fortnightly payment of moneys in respect of pensionable service which is payable from the normal retirement date of the scheme members.  To date, 1,574 lump sum payments have been authorised totalling &euro;42.1 million.  Work is ongoing in the Department of Social Protection to finalise payment of the remaining lump sums.  This matter is being prioritised.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this, officials of the Department are working on putting in place the administrative arrangements to facilitate the payment of moneys in respect of pensionable service.  Given that these pension payments will be in place for decades to come, it is essential that appropriate operational and system arrangements are put in place for their ongoing maintenance and payment.  I am advised that immediate action is required in respect of approximately 250 scheme members, or their spouses, or personal representatives in the case of deceased members, who have reached retirement age since the date of the wind up of the schemes in March 2009.</p>  <p>  Of the cases requiring immediate attention, the Department is finalising arrangements to make actuarially calculated payments to the personal representatives of deceased scheme members who had not reached pension age, which comprise approximately 20 cases.  It is anticipated that these payments will be made in late November or early December.  Once paid, no further payments will arise in this small number of cases.</p>  <p>  With regard to the arrangements for all other cases, officials of the Department have been in ongoing communication with officials of the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in addition to other State agencies such as the national shared services office, the Paymaster General pensions unit and PeoplePoint to explore the various options to facilitate the pension payments.  The Department of Social Protection has engaged with other Departments to put in place the necessary administrative and payment functions as a matter of urgency and is seeking to include this within the normal payroll and pension payment arrangements.  In this context, the shared services model is the preferred option for the payment and ongoing maintenance of pension payments.</p>  <p>  Given the complexity involved in finalising the payment arrangements, I am not in a position to advise the Deputy as to a definitive completion date.  Notwithstanding this, it must be emphasised that it is a matter of priority, both for the T&aacute;naiste and the Department, and it is hoped that the payment of pensions will commence in the coming months.  I am assured that every effort is being made to get the pension payments progressed as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised this issue not only with me but also with the T&aacute;naiste.  It is a matter of urgency and we will work tirelessly with other Departments to try to resolve any outstanding difficulties.  The Deputy can rest assured that we will do everything we possibly can to ensure all those payments are put in place.  It is important, however, that the payment arrangements are made on a sustainable model.  Pension payments will be made over several decades, so it is important we get this right from the beginning.  There must be no interruption of services as a result of the preparation work not being done properly for the commencement of those payments.  I reassure the Deputy that in cases where payments are to be backdated, that will happen.</p></speech>

There are approximately 250 such cases to be dealt with.  However, the Minister of State can understand what it must be like for the remaining workers who have reached pension age.  They cannot plan because they do not know when the money is going to come to them.  How long is a piece of string?  Are we talking about this calendar year or next year?</p>  <p>  I appreciate that a lot of wheels have to be put in motion while trying to get people to work together.  I believe this is a priority for the Department of Social Protection, but is it a priority for other Departments?  That is my concern because these people's lives have been put on hold.  They pressed a pause button when Waterford Crystal and the pension scheme became insolvent.  Many households have suffered anguish and worry because they have not been able to plan.  I could tell the Minister of State very personal stories of people trying to meet medical bills or putting off weddings.  People have not been able to get on with their lives.</p>  <p>  I am not prepared to be fobbed off and told it will happen in the coming months.  These workers deserve to know what is happening.  I realise the T&aacute;naiste has worked very hard on this matter.  As a local Deputy, however, I cannot go back down to Waterford this weekend without better information than that.  I am sorry but I need answers.</p></speech>

We are in constant contact and are having discussions to ensure these payments are made as quickly, efficiently and sustainably as possible.  I would love to be able to tell Deputy Conway that it will be next week or next month, and so would all my departmental officials.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, however, many wheels must be put in motion in this regard.  We also have to get it right.  I can well understand how Waterford Crystal is branded into people's hearts because they thought they were in safe, secure, long-term jobs.  They went into a job for life because that is what Waterford Crystal was.</p>  <p>  The Irish Glass Bottle Company in my area was a sister firm to Waterford Crystal.  I will not give history lessons because we both know about the foundations of both companies and how one spun from the other.  Many of my friends also lost their jobs and faced redundancy but they had to fight for their entitlements.</p>  <p>  I can certainly understand the frustration and annoyance that Waterford Crystal workers have experienced because the payments are not coming quickly enough.  All I can say is that the T&aacute;naiste, I and the Department will work tirelessly to try to ensure the payments are made as soon as possible.  Any delay will be reflected in backdated payments.  However, I am not going to mislead the Deputy or the workers and their families.  As soon as we have precise, accurate information we will come back directly to the Deputy, Unite and the workers to let them know exactly the factual position.  We will move to that position as quickly as we possibly can.  I will certainly keep in weekly contact with Deputy Conway concerning this matter.</p>  <p>  People who have lost their jobs in Waterford Crystal do not want to hear we are going to make that payment in the second week in December and then we do not hit the target.  That would be unfair and unjust.  As soon as we have that precise information I will ensure it is given to the families who are affected by this.</p><p>We will do it as quickly as we can.  I know Department officials have a personal relationship with this, because they know the workers who have come in and out of the Intreo offices.  In many cases, they know them on a personal basis.  From the point of view of the Department of Social Protection, it is more than simply a payment.  Having listened to officials, I detect there is virtually a mission to try to get this done as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible.  I can give Deputy Conway that commitment.  I am sorry about the news and that I cannot give the Deputy a date in December or January, but we will do it as quickly as we possibly can.</p></speech>

The cessation of admissions has had serious consequences because there is a major shortage of public nursing home beds in County Laois.  Only a handful of long-stay beds are available now in Abbeyleix and Shaen.  The units there are mainly respite facilities.  The unit in Mountmellick had been taking the bulk of long-stay patients.  There is a need for a major initiative on the part of the Government.  The unit in Mountmellick was already operating under capacity due to the closure of St. Joseph's ward a little over six years ago.</p>  <p>  While it is important that proper standards are met, I have some questions about some of HIQA's requirements, particularly those regarding single occupancy rooms.  I am unsure whether it is a question of being practical or if they are the best for patients.  Certainly, many people who work in the profession see them as a bad thing because they isolate patients.</p>  <p>  The findings in the report on the unit at Mountmellick included a reference to an inadequate number of toilets and inadequate washing facilities to meet the needs of residents.  This must be addressed.  Only two toilets are available in some areas along with a shower room.  These facilities are to cater for 22 patients.  Staff and patients have had to use commodes and that is not satisfactory.</p>  <p>  The HSE has submitted a national plan to the Department of Health, including plans to upgrade Mountmellick and the other two nursing hospitals in the county at Abbeyleix and Shaen.  These have been neglected by successive Governments.  The Government has earmarked &euro;300 million in the capital plan for upgrading facilities.  Now is the time to move and prioritise the matter.  It is badly needed.  There is a chronic shortage of long-stay beds in the county.</p></speech>

This was on the previous Thursday and they were told the elderly woman could not come in.  The daughter asked what would happen and she was told that the woman could go to St. Brigid's Hospital in Shaen in the interim.  However, works are under way in St. Brigid's Hospital in Shaen as well.  That In itself is a good thing but it meant there was nowhere for the woman to go at the time.</p>  <p>  Word filtered out and hit the local media sometime later.  Patients were being told on a one-to-one basis and it would have been far better if personnel had been more upfront about it at the beginning rather than people picking it up through the grapevine.  It was a bombshell when this information broke, but some were aware of it at that point.</p>  <p>  The main issue has been referred to and well documented.  There are some large wards in these facilities and HIQA has said there was a lack of dignity for patients.  That should not be the case.  I know it will cost money to correct.  We have had difficulties in Shaen and Abbeyleix in recent years as well as difficulties in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  All of this information has been filtering into every HSE hospital in the county.  This is undermining public confidence in the HSE.  It is our job to help us restore confidence in these institutions.  They have served people well in the past and we want them to continue operating.  The fact that Mountmellick has been closed for admissions in recent times is causing difficulties in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise due to delayed discharges.  That issue needs to be raised also.</p>  <p>  HIQA pointed to some good things in Mountmellick.  The report stated that hygiene, cleaning and many other things under the control of the staff in respect of the environment were working well.  It is not all bad news, but we want to eliminate the problems.</p></speech>

I am taking the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is on Government business elsewhere.</p>  <p>  St. Vincent's Community Nursing Unit is located on the outskirts of Mountmellick and provides much-needed residential services for the people of Laois.  It comes under the remit of the HSE.  Deputies will be aware that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, registers and inspects residential care facilities throughout the country.  The current registration status of the hospital includes a condition that no new residents may be admitted, except to the palliative care suite, until a funded plan to reconfigure the physical environment has been submitted to HIQA.</p>  <p>  While the issue raised refers specifically to the admissions restriction at St. Vincent's unit, I am aware that at a wider level there are concerns about the implications of the national standards for residential facilities more generally.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for services for older people in my Department, addressed this issue in the House last week in a response during a Topical Issue debate.  I will briefly restate what she said on that occasion, and I endorse her comments.</p>  <p>  The Government's recently published capital programme, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, commits to a major multiannual programme of capital investment in public and voluntary social care facilities.  The overall programme includes &euro;300 million for the development of community nursing units for older people and new improved models of accommodation for people with a disability, particularly in respect of de-congregation.  There is further potential to develop more projects through public private partnerships.  Building on investments already scheduled, this additional funding will allow the relevant facilities to comply with the national standards by the end of the new capital plan period, that is, by 2021.  A major national programme will now be put in place to address on a prioritised basis the refurbishment and new-build requirement.</p>  <p>  The shortage of public capital funds in recent years due to the economic crisis has meant a significant number of publicly-provided or voluntary-provided services have not met the physical infrastructure standards within the previously agreed timeframe of 1 July 2015.  The works required range from refurbishment to replacement of facilities concerned.  As a result of the capital programme, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, outlined a revised policy and timeframe to ensure all public and voluntary services can demonstrate to HIQA that they will achieve the relevant national standards by 2021.  In the coming weeks the HSE will submit to HIQA its plans, focused at individual service level, to meet the requirements of standard 25, the standard relating to physical infrastructure.  These individual plans will be in line with the revised policy timeframe and will detail proposed capital expenditure at each individual centre.  The HSE will assist the voluntary providers with which it has a service level agreement in submitting these individual plans.</p>  <p>  This decision was absolutely necessary to ensure that older people continue to have access to the services they need.  The imposition of a compliance timeline that was unachievable would have led to facilities closing throughout the country with others having to reducing their bed numbers.  Older people and their families as well as others who need these services would not thank us if that were allowed to happen.  It would certainly have exacerbated overcrowding in our acute hospitals - in some cases, this is already happening.</p>  <p>  While compliance with this particular standard has been particularly problematic for our public units, I am keen to acknowledge the considerable financial investment made by private and independent nursing homes in recent years in an effort to meet these environmental and other standards.  I hope that HIQA will give consideration to any similar plans to achieve full compliance that may be put forward by the private and independent sector where issues arise as well.</p></speech>

A revised timeframe is fine and it gives time for the hospital to comply.  The problem is the build-up of long-stay patients requiring public nursing home care.  They require high-dependency nursing home care in the meantime but we do not have places for them.</p>  <p>  The three nursing units in County Laois are operating at under-capacity.  The issue is the standard of the buildings.  At the same time we have an increase in demand due to demographics and the increasing population in the county.  There is an onus on the Government.  I have no wish for the Government to simply restart admissions to Mountmellick.  I realise it did not happen under the term of the current Government but the wards closed in Mountmellick need to be reopened.  There is a major shortage of capacity in the county.</p><p>I would like to see that plan being advanced and a timeframe announced.  </p> <p> With the Minister give a commitment today that Mountmellick, Abbeyleix and Shaen will be included in the new capital programme?  This cannot be delayed any further.  It has been delayed for years and changes have been made.  The deadline to comply with HIQA standards was 1 July this year.  As the Minister mentioned, that has now been extended and there are individual plans.  While the plans are being drawn up, the patients who need accommodation are coming forward to Deputies like myself and my constituency colleagues.  Families are telling us there are no nursing home beds for their relatives.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to include the areas to which I referred in the capital programme.</p></speech>

The Minister said the HSE would submit a plan to HIQA in the coming weeks.  We expect something on the future of health care facilities over a six-year period to be a secret document, and I ask that it be published at that stage.</p>  <p>  It is important that everything possible be done to reassure residents, their families and staff following the upset caused by the manner in which this matter has been handled in recent weeks.  Some measure should be put in place to alleviate that.  In view of the five-year timescale and given that places such as Abbeyleix could take up to 50 residents, there may be a solution.  In recent years, 30 to 35 people have been accommodated, but that figure has now been reduced to a tiny number.  There is a good case for allowing that number to increase to 30 or 35 as in recent years and to use the five-year breathing space to facilitate such a solution.</p></speech>

In some places it will involve refurbishing an existing unit.  In others, where it is not economical to carry out refurbishments, replacements will be provided and expansion can be considered in that context.  Obviously, priority will be given to those that are most far behind, if that makes sense, in meeting HIQA building standards.  I cannot give any specific commitment on any specific centre today for any part of the country because the plan will have to be carried out comprehensively on a national basis. </p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley mentioned single-occupancy rooms.  It is permitted under the standards to have dual occupancy rooms, but it is no longer possible to have rooms with four, six or 12 people.  I have visited some units, including a very old one in Carrick-on-Shannon, for example, and listened to residents and family members.  They were happy with the standard of care, but the quality of the building was not very good.  I suggest that people visit new buildings such as the community nursing unit in the Phoenix Park, which used to be St. Mary's hospital.  One can really see what the units should look like and what the modern standard of care for the elderly is.  It is only when one sees this that one realises quite how inappropriate some of the older units are. </p>  <p>  Many community nursing units are in buildings that are 100, 150 or 200 years old.  Very many are old workhouses or county homes.  While it was acceptable to have people living in rooms of six, ten or 12 beds on old-fashioned Florence Nightingale wards up to ten years ago, it is not acceptable now and into the future, and certainly not in ten years' time.  It is not possible to replace 200 years' worth of infrastructure in a few years.  We lost six or seven years as a consequence of the economic crisis.  The economy is now growing and as long as we continue that, keep the recovery strong and protect it from those who would undermine it, we will have the possibility of catching up over the next six years on what we missed out on in the past six years and bringing all of these units for older people and people with disabilities up to standard.</p></speech>

There was a very welcome announcement for ports such as Castletownbere.  I also welcome his ongoing commitment to providing coastal areas throughout the country with capital support, in conjunction with local authorities, to allow for investment in piers and quays along our coastline.</p>  <p>  The landing obligation or ban on discards introduced as a result of the new Common Fisheries Policy under Regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013 is a new departure and one that is necessary in light of much media comment and public concern about the requirement for fishing vessels to discard perfectly good dead fish into our oceans because they do not have a quota for them, they are undersized or whatever.  Fishermen are simply not able to land perfectly good fish, and there was a political move to do something about it. </p>  <p>  Following several years of negotiations and in the lead-up to the adoption of the Common Fisheries Policy, the landing obligation, or ban on discards, was introduced.  It has been introduced in pelagic species in the north-western waters of Ireland, Belgium, Spain, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  Pelagic species such as mackerel, herring, horse mackerel, blue whiting, boar fish, smelt, albacore tuna and sprat already come under the landing obligation.</p>  <p>  It is no harm to examine how that has worked within the pelagic sector.  There have been some hiccups and it has been difficult for skippers and owners to deal with the system, but in the polyvalent sector, demersal fishing will be the real challenge for the Department, the Commission and the fisheries sector.  The demersal species include cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, pollock, Norway lobster, nephrops, common sole, plaice and hake.  </p>  <p>  The discard ban, or landing obligation, is coming into effect on 1 January 2016.  There is major concern within the industry.  It is my job, as a public representative who hears about this concern on a daily basis in places such as Castletownbere and Union Hall, to address it.  There are real issues facing the industry and individual fishermen in dealing with their landing obligations, which they take seriously.</p>  <p>  I recognise that the Minister has established a discard ban implementation committee, led by Dr. Noel Cawley.  It would be unfair if I did not mention that there is a lot of confusion or a lack of knowledge about how the committee is operating and reporting and what it is considering.  Perhaps the producer organisations are dealing with it more intensively.  I have spoken to skippers and fishermen who have told me there is a great lack of knowledge as to how the committee is working.  Many issues need to be considered, such as quota lists and logging of discards.  There are technical issues such as the selectivity of gear.  Smaller vessels which have smaller holds may not have room for their legitimate catches if, rather than discarding non-quota species, they have to bring them in.  Fish may be landed on quays that may not be as well serviced as fishery harbour centres.  What will happen to such fish?  There are questions about what happens to undersized fish that are landed.  There are many technical questions and it is only reasonable that they be aired in advance of 1 January 2016.  I look forward to the Minister's response and an ongoing debate over the next few weeks and months on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.587" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100032#FF00500"><p>One of the key elements of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches.  In June 2013, under the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, a practical and phased discards policy or landing obligation was agreed.  The first part of the landing obligation, namely, the ban on the discarding of pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on 1 January 2015 and will be extended to certain demersal stocks, i.e., white fish and prawns, from 1 January 2016.</p><p>The landing obligation will be fully phased in for all quota stocks by 1 January 2019.  It is with regard to quota stocks and not non-quota stocks.<br/><br/>The phasing-in period was one of my key demands during the negotiations, to allow fishermen time to adjust and implement changes to avoid unwanted catches.  Under the new Common Fisheries Policy, the details of how the landing obligation will apply in particular fisheries, and what, if any, flexibility, for example <i>de minimis</i>which would allow some discarding, can be applied are decided upon by regional groups and member states in consultation with stakeholders.  Ireland is a member of the north-western waters group, along with Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Spain.  Stakeholders are represented at the north-western waters regional advisory council and the pelagic advisory council.  After intense negotiations, it was agreed in June of this year that from 1 January 2016 for the north-western waters the ban on discarding will apply to the prawn, or nephrops, fishery in all waters, the whiting fishery in the Celtic Sea, the haddock fishery in the Irish Sea and the north-west area, the hake fishery in all areas and the sole fishery in the Celtic Sea.  The other stocks will be phased in over the following three years.  Nobody is asking anybody to do anything massive in one year.  This will be done piece by piece and bit by bit.  We can see the difficulties as they emerge and we can try to solve them.  That is what this is about.<br/><br/>The vessels which will be subject to the landing obligation in 2016 are being identified on the basis of a combination of gear type and historic landing data.  For example, a vessel that had more than 25% of cod, haddock, whiting and saithe combined in its landings from the Celtic Sea in 2013 and 2014 will be obliged to land all the whiting it catches in the Celtic Sea next year.<br/><br/>This is a big ask for the industry.  This is a big change to the Common Fisheries Policy but let us be clear that up to 40% of the adult and juvenile fish caught under the Common Fisheries Policy since it was last reformed, and before that, has been dumped into the sea dead.  The idea that this is okay, because it is difficult to manage an alternative to simply dump what is estimated to be 400,000 tonnes of fish, needed to change.  This is equivalent in weight to all of the beef we export from this country, and we are the biggest exporter of beef by far in the European Union.  The Irish Government is now going to change it, and we will move away from what is called a landed quota for fishermen.  At present, if fishermen have a quota of five tonnes and they catch eight tonnes, they need to dump three tonnes into the sea.  Instead, they will have a catch quota, which will provide challenges for fishermen and we will help them through this.<br/><br/>We have the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, which is double anything we ever had before for the fishing sector.  It is a significant amount of money to spend on the fishing industry to help it adapt to the transformation we need to fund over the coming years.  We have started with pelagic fish and it has worked.  We are now moving to some demersal stocks for next year, those we believe we can implement most easily, and we will learn as we go along and help fishermen adapt.  There are flexibilities we can use and obviously there will be tolerance when it is introduced on 1 January.  This change must be made, and let us be absolutely clear about this.  It will be done and it must be done.  The producer organisations and fishermen, by and large, have been working with us to try to ensure it works in a practical way.<br/><br/>I have been in Castletownbere, where we held a meeting specifically on this on the quayside, answering questions for approximately an hour and a half.  Dr. Noel Cawley has a job to do to make sure communication continues until and after 1 January to ensure the implementation of the new policy, which is about creating healthier fish stocks so there is more fish for everybody to catch.  The win for fishermen is that moving from a landed quota to a catch quota means they should get a quota uplift when we negotiate quotas in December.  This means we should, hopefully, get access to catching more prawns than we would otherwise have been able to catch because we will not be dumping any over the side.  We must factor in this, with regard to everything that will be landed in the future.  There is an upside for the fishing industry.  There is an immediate upside in quota uplift, which needs to be negotiated on the basis of science, and, of course, there is a medium to long-term significant uplift in terms of the health of the stocks.  This can be a good news story but together we will have to learn to adapt and change how we fish.  I am certainly up for this in terms of the support programmes we will put in place.</p></speech>

We are not trying to unwind the landing obligation or the discard ban.  It is difficult, but there is no turning back and this is the reality which must be dealt with.  Throwing fish back is abhorrent to fishermen; what they do is catch fish.  They are not there to throw them back and they do not want to throw them back.  They would wish to have a mechanism whereby they do not have to do this, and this is it.</p>  <p>  The point I am making is there are real difficulties as envisaged by fishermen, particularly in the demersal sector.  If one has a whiting quota but not a haddock quota, it is very difficult to segregate the species.  I accept the Minister's response.  It is a new departure for everyone, including the Department, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the fishing sector.  The reason I am raising this on the floor of the D&aacute;il is, exactly as the Minister said, that phasing it in is the correct way to do it.  There will be hurdles to cross between now and 1 January, and over the coming year or two.  I am pleased the Minister has said the Department will be accommodating in every way it can to help the sector and I urge that this is so.  Getting to maximum sustainable yield in fisheries is the right policy.  Without fish there is no fishing industry, and I and the sector fully agree with this.  It will take some difficult decisions and new management processes to deal with this.</p>  <p>  The feeling on the ground is one of uncertainty and doubt because, as the Minister recognises, the demersal sector is not the jewel of the crown of the fishing industry.  It has had difficult times.  One could argue the fleet is at overcapacity.  The quota we have is simply not viable for many of the vessels, which are small.  On top of this, the issue of dealing with landing obligation is creating real doubt and concern in much of the demersal sector and for this reason it is only fair to bring it before the House.  I accept and I hope the Department, Dr. Noel Cawley's implementation group and the industry will come together to find real solutions to the obstacles which lay ahead.  This is the right thing to do but it is very difficult, and this needs to be recognised in full by all stakeholders.</p></speech>

We have been trying to do so.  I have been to Castletownbere and we spent quite a bit of time with the fishing industry specifically on this issue.  I have also been to Kilmore Quay, where I took questions for two and a half hours from fishermen on this issue.  It is the responsibility of Dr. Noel Cawley's group to have these town hall meetings and very practical discussions about what is being asked and what is not being asked.  No one is asking a fisherman to bring in starfish and land it on the quayside.  They can discard them.  In terms of quota species, we will introduce stocks to the quota over a period of time, as we learn to be more targeted and accommodate through the management tools we have a negotiated in the Common Fisheries Policy a way in which we catch what we land as opposed to catching a lot of fish which we do not have the capacity to land because we do not have the quota for them.  We have had some success in this, particularly with regard to juvenile fish.</p><p>If we consider the change in mesh size and net design in the Celtic Sea, for example, we have reduced dramatically the number of juvenile fish being caught in that fishery.  We can learn from that.  Likewise, there has been much experimentation in the Irish Sea and other prawn fisheries with the aim of avoiding catching cod.  We need to encourage fishermen to do that.</p> <p> We have a package that is worth &euro;241 million with the new European Marine and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  That is more than twice any other package that has ever been negotiated for the Irish fishing industry.  We have that so we can facilitate, support and finance the change programme required over the next few years.  I appeal to fishermen not to see this as a threat but rather as an opportunity that requires them to look differently at their management systems and how they fish.  Sometimes when people are challenged and a bit confused about what is being asked of them, the response is one of resistance because they think there is an ulterior motive.  There is no such motive in this case as this is about trying to create healthier, bigger stocks of fish at sea in order that we can catch more fish.  It is also about ensuring we are using the science, innovation and technology we have available to be more targeted in our fishing.</p> <p> It is complicated when we speak about a mixed fishery, with different quotas applying to different stocks all being caught in the same net.  That is the particular difficulty we will have to face.  In the Celtic Sea, which is arguably the most complex fishery around the Irish coast, we are starting with the easiest of the three in the cod, haddock and whiting fishery, namely, whiting, and we will see how that works.  We will co-operate with fisherman to ensure it works and we will extend the process to other species year on year.  Nothing is being rushed and this will happen in a phased way between now and 2019.  There is much money to help us get there with respect to changed management systems and gear that is required but it would be disastrous for the fishing industry to think we can resist this because it is new and we do not like it.  To be fair, the people involved will not take that route.  Let us work together on this so that in five or six years we will have healthier stocks and more profitable fishing, which ultimately is what this is about.</p></speech>

I have been involved with the legislation from when the heads were first put before a committee or even before that.</p>  <p>  It seems that some of the Bill is seeking to legislate on what I would call common sense in that people are using common sense already but we seem to be legislating for it.  It is not evident in many practices but in the horse racing industry, much common sense prevails, both in the Turf Club and Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  Some of the pernickety elements of the Bill try to rule out the use of common sense.  If we were to look at this again, we might eliminate the pieces that might rule out using common sense.</p>  <p>  Part of the Bill arises from the Indecon report and there is a move to eliminate duplication.  One of the key areas mentioned is HRI and the Turf Club having individual financial structures, but I find it difficult to see how we can eliminate that when representatives of the Turf Club are asked to appear before an Oireachtas committee to account for its finances.  It would need a full accounting section within the Turf Club for that to be possible, so why are we examining means of eliminating this duplication?  I do not see that happening.  It is one of the questions I asked the members of HRI when they came before the committee.  Specifically, I asked how many staff would be lost arising from this partial amalgamation but I was told nobody would lose his or her job.  When I asked about savings, I was told they would not amount to an awful lot.  One must ask why many parts of this Bill are in place.  Has there been a value for money review of HRI?  Indecon produced an overall report but has a value for money analysis of HRI been done?</p>  <p>  The real concern is the independence of the Turf Club because whatever opportunity it had for generating income, although it is not being removed, is being directed somewhere else through HRI and then back to the Turf Club.  I am concerned about this because of what happened in the UK with the amalgamation of the regulatory body and the people who run the sector to form the British Horseracing Authority.  The Minister is aware of an issue from a few years ago arising from the close links between the regulatory body that would follow up on a matter and a major owner.  There were serious concerns about that and I am worried that something similar could happen here, although I hope that will not be the case.  The Turf Club is being pulled in more.  The Jockey Club ran the regulatory side of the Turf Club in the UK but it is now gone completely.  I am concerned about that.  The Turf Club is like any other club around the country, including the rugby or GAA club in the Minister's constituency.  It is filled with volunteers who steward at racetracks and point-to-point meetings throughout the country.  I hope what happened in the UK is not repeated here.</p>  <p>  The Turf Club must be independent and part of that is about its ability to access its own finance as quickly as possible instead of having to go cap in hand to HRI all the time.  If it does not have that ability, its integrity may be compromised.  I am fearful about that as we have tremendous integrity in the racing industry.</p>  <p>  On the appeals issue, when a judgment is made by the Turf Club, the person has a right to appeal the judgment, but in certain circumstances the legislation indicates that during the appeals process, whatever punishment was issued to the appellant is suspended.  In certain circumstances, a position could arise where the offence is abhorrent but the appellant would be allowed to practice under the rules of racing.  That should not be allowed.  A fellow tried and convicted for murder is not released when the appeal is ongoing.  He would be in jail.  This goes back to the issue of common sense.  In such cases, the waiving of a sentence while an appeal is taking place should not be allowed.</p>  <p>  I apologise for going on but I have a good few more points to cover if I can.  I am really passionate about the area.  The foal levy-----</p></speech>

I know where the foal levy goes and I heard what Deputy Catherine Murphy stated earlier.</p><p>The Irish Equine Centre is one of the places the funding from the foal levy goes.  I have appealed to the Minister before that its funding be increased.  It is a hugely responsible body within the whole horse-racing sector and it is having difficulties at the moment because of staff shortages.  I have a couple of questions.  Will someone from the Tote be on the betting committee?  That should be important.  I also want to be clear about owners.  They invest &euro;300 million per annum in the horse-racing industry.  The Government only invested &euro;68 million last year.  It was very much welcomed and it is hoped that the investments will come to the racecourses along the way.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.609" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100035#JJ01300"><p>I will try and limit myself to nine minutes to give Deputy Hayden time.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill and to thank the Minister for his and his officials' active engagement with the committee.  The aim of the Bill is to strengthen governance and transparency within horse racing, to clarify the respective roles of both Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, as the promotional body, and the racing regulatory body, known as the Turf Club, to improve accountability and manage integrity functions.</p>  <p>  Last year, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, referred the general scheme to the joint committee and requested that it consider undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny, which we acceded to.  Over a period we held a series of meetings, starting on 1 July with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, bringing in all the stakeholders and ultimately bringing in officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 8 October.  We completed a comprehensive process of hearings and made a number of recommendations and observations on foot of that.  One of the recommendations I would like to acknowledge, which is referenced in the Bill itself, is that the board of HRI be reduced from 13 to 12 ordinary members plus the chairman.  We considered this and having heard, in particular, from the Irish Stable Staff Association that the industry services committee on the board would include the chairman of that committee and a member of the stable staff, who comprise the biggest cohort of people working in the industry.  While we all see and hear about the princes, millionaires and everyone else who are involved, the people who do the most on the ground are the employees within the business, and without them the whole industry would not function.  It was important to recognise that they would have a seat on that committee and ultimately a seat on the board.  It is very important that we acknowledge that through an approach by all members of the committee and others, including Deputy Lawlor, who came in on some of the hearings, of engagement and partnership with the officials we achieved something that makes sense.  For the sake of one extra person on the board, it was well worth it.</p>  <p>  A couple of other things came up.  Regarding the issue of regulatory functions and the Turf Club and the fears that it is being held accountable, it already is and there is already a binding arbitration process in place for any disputes.  They are binding it if it goes that far.  Thankfully that has not happened too often.  Bear in mind that HRI provides &euro;7.1 million of taxpayers' money to the Turf Club.  It is not interfered with.  There has been some dispute about this, but in reality, if a body is charged with the integrity functions and is receiving funding from the State, if in a hypothetical situation it were to get funding from another source to do the same thing, it does not seem to me to be unreasonable to expect it to account for why it needs the money.  This has not happened, but it could happen: that is the provision.</p>  <p>  On point to point races, there is no interference with the hunt clubs, except the administrative process of registration, and in reality, under the current legislation, the point to points get &euro;1.5 million, but this is not referenced at any point in the Horse Racing Ireland Bill as it stands.  There is no mandate on the HRI to provide it.  It is something to bear in mind and we must put these things in context.</p>  <p>  With regard to the foal levy, we have had a good bit of representation from a number of owners, who make the point that the biggest number of owners across this country own five mares or fewer.  They have proposed a sales levy, on which I have yet to be convinced, but there is one point: the foal levy, as it is constructed, is based on various different levels, so one triggers into a higher levy based on the advertised fee.  The tables are very transparent but the advertised fee is the guiding fee, as opposed to the invoice fee.</p>  <p>  I do not know whether it is for the Bill itself, for a statutory instrument, or for the HRI to decide this when its new board is formed, but there is merit in saying, as is the case in many other sectors, that one should pay based on the invoiced amount rather than the advertised amount.  That removes the ambiguity whereby some people are getting a deal and paying less because they have two or three mares with the same stud owner but they are not being acknowledged for that.  Some of the fees seem to be set just marginally above a trigger point, which is a bit of a coincidence.  I suppose that is the way it works.</p>  <p>  I agree with what Deputy Lawlor said about the Irish Equine Centre.  It is like many other semi-stand alone entities in that it needs to be funded properly.  People will say when they go to it that there is a health and safety risk down there with the level of clutter and everything else in a building that is not fit for purpose.  Provision has to be made for that and a better stream of funding must be secured.  They do carry out other functions on behalf of other bodies, including BVD testing for bovines, and they get paid for it, but a proper structure of funding for the Irish equine sector, although it goes beyond the remit of this Bill, is very important.</p>  <p>  On funding itself, we have referenced in our report, and it is referenced in the Bill, the whole idea of State funding and support.  It is to be welcomed that this has increased over the last two budgets.  However, in the long term it is interesting to see some of the figures on the robustness of this industry.  The number of owners has dropped significantly, as has the number of people working in it, but attendance at racecourses has been maintained quite well, as has betting.  In many aspects, betting has increased, but we are not capturing it.  I know the Betting Tax (Amendment) Bill is taking a while to get through, but we have to look long-term at a stand alone funding model for the horse racing industry so that the State has to continue to invest in it.  It is too important and there are two many people - 17,000 - working in it to leave it to struggle without that support.  There is an alternative if we get it right.  I am somewhat disappointed that the Gambling Control Bill will not be completed in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, because it is comprehensive legislation which deals with, among other matters, betting revenues and betting on- and off-course.</p><p>The Betting (Amendment) Act  2015 goes most of the way, particularly for the horse and greyhound sectors, but it is important that we get this finished.  I ask the Minister to urge his colleagues to ensure that this important Bill is enacted as quickly as possible.</p> <p> I would like to record and acknowledge the support that the committee received from both the Library &amp;amp; Research Service and the secretariat in preparing a report.  This process should expedite Committee Stage and make it more efficient.  Indeed, officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine briefed us, both formally and informally, and took our views on board as we progressed, so that by the second time they met us they were well aware of our thinking as a committee, and we were reflecting what the sector's stakeholders had articulated to us during our hearings.</p> <p> I commend this comprehensive Bill.  The Minister and his officials are to be commended on it.  It is a vital sector, particularly for rural areas, and one that gives us a good reputation both at home and abroad.  It is something that deserves this type of attention to detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100036#KK00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which has seen a significant amount of work.  As Deputy Doyle pointed out, it is the first time that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member, has been able to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny, a new process that Government has brought in, which allowed us to examine thoroughly with the relevant stakeholders in the sector the impact of a change in legislation, and will hopefully allow us run the Bill through the House with greater buy-in and a better understand of everyone involved.</p>  <p>  As a Deputy representing Kildare South, I have always been an advocate for the horse racing and breeding sector, not only because I like horses and going to the races but also because I know so many employed in the sector in my constituency and who employ others in the sector also.  This economic activity, which was worth &euro;1.1 billion to the Irish economy in 2012, happens in rural parts of Ireland where there is little other economic activity.  Of the 18,000 employed in the sector, 4,000 are in Kildare alone.  Those are 4,000 real jobs and pay packets that help drive the local economy, never mind the positive image Kildare enjoys as the thoroughbred county.</p>  <p>  This Bill comes after a lengthy period of review of all aspects of the horse racing sector.  It started with the Minister's commissioning of a review of the sector by Indecon, and the Department facilitated a stakeholder consultation as part of that review, which included written submissions from interested parties.  The Department then drafted the Bill and it came before us in the Oireachtas joint committee for the pre-legislative scrutiny.  The process was a really good exercise during which we invited in all of the key stakeholders.  Discussions took place over a number of months, and the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine paid close attention to what was said and some of the concerns that were raised.  It is a good way for us to do business in the House.</p>  <p>  This Bill looks to strengthen governance and transparency within the administration of horse racing.  It also clarifies the functions of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the racing regulatory body, the Turf Club, as well as streamlining certain administrative functions.  It extends the definition of integrity services to allow the racing regulatory body to ensure that horses are run fairly and properly without being limited to on-course activities, which is a key change.</p>  <p>  Representation on the board of HRI is set to change also, with ministerial representation increasing from one to three members, including a representative of Northern Ireland.  The racing regulatory authority will have three representatives.  Other representatives on the board will include one from the race courses, one from the horse breeders, one from the horse trainers and one from the owners, who are important because they contribute so much to the sector.</p>  <p>  Two board members will be from the industry service committee.  I am delighted that one of these will be a dedicated representative of the Irish Stable Staff Association following the recommendation from the Oireachtas joint committee.  The stable staff are the lifeblood of the sector, working seven days a week and all hours of the day to care for and prepare the horses.  Without these skilled workers, the excellent horsemen and women who work in yards all over the country, we would not be world leaders in this game.  This additional seat is a recognition of the position of the thousands who work in the yards the length and breadth of this country, and I thank the Minister for taking on board our request to ensure that they are adequately represented on the board of HRI.</p>  <p>  There will also be a representative from the betting committee, which is important.  The relationship between the bookmaker and the racing sector has been fraught at times.  Having representation on the board from the whole betting industry is crucial.  There are synergies that could be beneficial to racing from working more closely with the betting industry.  This move definitely achieves one of the aims of the Bill, which is to improve communication throughout the sector.  The fact that the media rights, which are so coveted and which are crucial to the funding model, are largely paid for by the betting sector is proof of the importance of a working relationship between both sides.</p>  <p>  Streamlining and the achievement of efficiencies should be an ongoing job in any State or private entity that has access to taxpayers' funds.  In this instance, the streamlining must also take cognisance of the need to not undermine integrity functions.  I therefore welcome the assurances that the Minister has given with regard to both the integrity services carried out by the racing regulatory body and the commitment to maintain and protect the strong point-to-point activity.</p>  <p>  The Turf Club is, in effect, a private club, the voluntary members of which contribute significantly to the running of the sector and safeguard and protect the rules of racing.  We can never take this integrity for granted.  The Turf Club, in exercising those functions, receives some taxpayers' funding, and the provisions in the Bill are very much about protecting the interests of taxpayers and ensuring that there is full openness and transparency.</p>  <p>  The HRI, as a semi-state body, is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other State watchdog bodies.  This Bill improves the transparency and accountability where public funds are involved while also looking to protect the ability of the racing regulatory body to carry out its functions without its integrity being impinged.  That is a fine balance that we must get right for the good of the overall sector.  In that regard, I am quite happy that sections 11 and 12 put the Turf Club on a stronger footing in many regards.  Section 11, regarding the rules of racing, points out that the Turf Club is solely and independently responsible for making and enforcing the rules of racing, provides on-course integrity services, licenses racecourses and participants in horse racing, sets charges for licences and is responsible for decision-making regarding handicapping and doping, all of which are important matters.  Let us be honest and admit that integrity is something we take for granted when the sector is doing as well as it is, but all we ever need is for something to go wrong and then everyone will look and ask where the integrity is.  Much consideration has been given to this.  The Turf Club has appeared before the Oireachtas joint committee and has made representations.  It is really important that, as the Bill moves through the House, we keep strongly in the forefront of our minds that no step here will impinge on that in any way.  I am happy that this Bill goes a long way towards that while also protecting and representing the best interests of the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  I will touch on the redevelopment of the Curragh, which is not directly linked with this Bill.  In my constituency, the announcement a couple of weeks ago of a &euro;65 million redevelopment of the Curragh underpins the confidence regained in the sector after a tough recession, but also Government's commitment to the sector, because it takes funding and confidence to make that happen.  The fact that we now have a partnership between the HRI, as a semi-state body, and the Turf Club, which had to move a long way in sharing its ownership of the Curragh racecourse, along with private benefactors, shows what can be achieved in a public-private partnership, if you like, of a different type.  I was struck that at the launch the private investors' representative singled out, as the Minister who was present will be aware, the confidence as a result of the investment by the Government over the past couple of years.  Although the increases that we have managed to secure in the horse and greyhound fund in the past couple of years were important, there has also been a sense that the Government is taking it seriously - not merely making a token effort, but recognising that this is a sector that employs 18,000 people the length and breadth of the country.  It is economic activity, and the Government is serious about protecting the horse racing and breeding sectors.  That is why we saw that private investment come into the Curragh.</p>  <p>  In terms of the future funding model for the sector, something that came up quite a bit in the discussions at the Oireachtas joint committee is the level of frustration.  Down through the years, the horse racing sector never wanted to be in a position in which it was dependent on the taxpayer.  However, it is aware that at times of recession such as we have come through, the cheap throwaway comments from the Opposition benches to the effect that it is grand to fund the racing authority but we could open another hospital ward instead, are populist and effective soundbites.</p><p>However, it misses the fact that the sport is not just a flutter on our part, but is an investment in an industry that creates jobs.  We would like to return to a point where we have multi-annual funding and the racing industry can stand alone, as it did before.</p> <p> While I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan's move during recent years to extend betting to the remote and offline, more can be done.  It does not come under the Minister's remit but is more a matter for the Department of Finance.  A 1% rate of duty on betting is low.  We wanted to get the online system bedded in to see how it went.  I hope whoever is in charge of the purse strings for the next budget will seek to grow it and increase the slice of the cake that comes in from betting revenue and thus get racing back to a position where it is not dependent on a handout from the Government, which can fluctuate each year, and can plan with a multi-annual approach.  I welcome the work by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in giving a commitment for the next couple of years of funding and sticking to it, which allows them to plan accordingly.</p> <p> I know the Minister's commitment to the industry.  He and his officials have done extensive work on bringing this body of work through since before the Indecon report to date.  I look forward to further detailed debate as it reaches Committee Stage, and I look forward to the strengthening and growth of our racing and breeding industry, which is a source of pride to all Irish people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100037#LL00200"><p>The regulation of the horse racing industry is an important function, although there is a certain paradox in the idea of horse racing being an industry.  I am uncomfortable about the misuse of animals to generate profit.  I am from Newbridge, County Kildare.  I grew up beside the Curragh and knowing horses and horse racing, and respecting horses and other animals, is part of my DNA.  The point has often been made that elite race horses are treated better than many human beings in terms of their standard of living and the care and attention they receive.  While that is in part true, elite athletes pay an enormous cost for their dedication to their sports and, unlike humans, horses do not necessarily have a say in the activity.</p>  <p>  We must be balanced.  While horse racing generates revenue and is an industry which makes multi-millions of euro every year, the nuclear and arms industries are also industries, but ones to which many people object on ethical grounds.  Creating employment in itself is not reason enough for an activity to exist, and we must be balanced when we deal with these issues.  I would like to propose some points that have not come up in the debate so far.</p>  <p>  Horse racing is often cruel and unpleasant.  Although we call it a sport, it leads to dreadful injuries for horses which race and, inevitably, leads to the slaughter of horses that do not make the grade.  Sadly, there was rampant overbreeding of horses during the boom years, and, when the crash hit, these horses were slaughtered in their thousands.  Some 4,618 thoroughbreds were slaughtered in licensed abattoirs in 2011 and God knows how many thousands were slaughtered in registered knackers' yards.  In 2012, some 24,362 horses of all kinds were slaughtered in Ireland.  The problem I have with the Bill is that there is no provision to deal with the overbreeding of race horses.  Like everything else, the market dictates and decides.  It is a missed opportunity to put measures in the Bill.</p>  <p>  According to Animal Aid in the UK, approximately one in every 37 horses which start a season&rsquo;s racing will have perished by the end of it.  They die as a result of a racecourse or training injury, or are killed because they are deemed no longer financially viable.  Some 82% of flat race horses older than three years of age suffer from bleeding lungs, that is, exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage, which can cause blood to leak from the nostrils.  Some 93% of horses in training have four gastric ulcers, and the condition gets progressively worse.  This is the cost to horses of our horse racing industry.  When these horses are retired, their conditions and welfare improve.  I would have liked if this Bill had paid more attention to the fate of retired race horses, which is often a dismal one.</p>  <p>  It is disappointing that the Minister, who probably does not have the worst of reputations on animal welfare issues, did not seize the opportunity in the Bill to dedicate funds from the horse and greyhound fund for programmes to retrain and rehome former race horses.  Maybe it is salvageable.  I do not know why the opportunity was not seized, and the Minister should address it.  The Irish Horse Welfare Trust runs the only such programme in Ireland, which is part funded by Horse Racing Ireland and the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association.  However, with hundreds of race horses being retired every year, further funding could have ensured that none of the horses ended up abandoned, shot or slaughtered.  Having dedicated themselves to the altar of profit for the two or three years during which they were racing, no horse should end this way.  Given the millions of euro sloshing around in the horse racing industry, it is shocking that of the 401 horses seized by the ISPCA between 2008 and 2014, because they were living in conditions too atrocious to be left in, approximately 10% were thoroughbreds.</p>  <p>  The Minister takes great offence at wanton cruelty to animals, particularly to horses.  We should use the Bill to divert resources to deal with retired race horses.  Given that the animal welfare concerns exist with regard to horse racing, I am surprised the Bill does not stipulate that somebody from an animal welfare background should sit on the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  The Bill specifies that the chairman and members of the board will be appointed by the Minister, having regard to creating a balance between the different interests in the horse racing industry.  It is very vague.  Where are the interests of the horses?  Horse racing and betting is a multi-million euro industry.  The welfare of the animals which make it all possible must be factored in somewhere.  It could be tightened up in the legislation.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies have mentioned the fact that no specific provision is made for representatives of horse owners to sit on the media rights committee.  Given that the media rights money paid to racecourses would not exist without owners, it is a legitimate enough point that they should be given some involvement in that regard.  However, one of the areas that could be improved is the withholding of funds.  This is an industry.  It is all about profit, and money talks.  Money influences whether unorthodox or unacceptable behaviour is addressed.  While the Bill makes welcome provisions for the Minister to withhold funds to Horse Racing Ireland or Bord na gCon under certain circumstances, for example, if they fail to furnish accounts, it does not go far enough and we should do much more.</p><p>Currently, Bord na gCon can decide to pass on public taxpayers' money to the Irish Coursing Club, for example, as it did in 2014 when almost &euro;14,000 went to coursers for DNA sampling and &euro;92,057 went to Sporting Press Limited, which is a subsidiary of the Irish Coursing Club.  I find it absolutely reprehensible that taxpayers' money is being diverted for hare coursing.  I am quite sure the overwhelming majority of Irish taxpayers agree with me that it is nauseating.  This Bill does not provide for a sanction whereby funds can be withheld from Bord na gCon if they are to be used for these purposes.  I suggest that this legislation is too good an opportunity to miss.  Public funding for coursing is seriously sick in a society that claims to be civilised.  We need to do more to use this legislation in the way I am advocating.  In its response to the Indecon report, which was absolutely damning of Bord na gCon's activities, the board said it would make additional contributions to the retired greyhound trust "when resources permit".  I would respond to that by saying "big deal - yippee" and asking whether they think they are great.  To be honest, this Bill could have stipulated as a condition for the drawdown of funds from the horse and greyhound that a certain percentage of those funds should go to the retired greyhound trust and other welfare initiatives.  I still think it is not too late for us to look at including such a stipulation.  It is important that we sanction Bord na gCon for not submitting accounts - it is great because we all love exemplary accounting skills - but to be honest, sanctioning the board for poor animal welfare practices is far more serious and beneficial.  It is something that needs to be built much more clearly into this legislation.  If we are talking about regulation, we should put the animals that are the source of the profit in the first place at the heart of the Bill.</p></speech>

I know that these are early days in its passage through the Oireachtas.  However, it has been the subject of extensive consultation at the joint committee and with individual Deputies.  I expect that there will be positive and genuine engagement with the Minister on Committee Stage.  I hope some of the points that have been made by Deputies will be taken on board in a genuine way.  I am aware that certain representative bodies within the sector are concerned.  I trust that those concerns will be taken seriously and that there will be genuine engagement.</p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to put a few points on the record.  I am deeply passionate about this industry.  It is unfortunate that this sector has been subjected to a great deal of misinformation and negativity in recent times.  The first point to be made is that this is a sport in which we excel.  We are the best in the world.  It is also an industry where we happen to be the best in the world.  That is something I am deeply proud of as an Irish person.  I believe the vast majority of Irish people are extremely proud of it.  We are probably a little shy about promulgating the major success story that surrounds the thoroughbred breeding and racing sector, which is a massive contributor to the economy.  Various figures have been bandied around in the Chamber today, but I understand that approximately 17,000 or 18,000 people are directly employed in this sector.  Many people in rural Ireland are indirectly employed because of the racing industry and the thoroughbred sector.  It is a very important part of the life of this country, particularly in rural Ireland.  Indeed, the important racecourse up the road in Leopardstown receives a great deal of local support in Dublin.</p>  <p>  Sadly, we live in a time of major decline in rural Ireland, where significant challenges like depopulation, youth unemployment and emigration are being faced.  The racing sector has endured and continued to excel throughout all of these difficulties.  We have racecourses in 17 counties.  Well over 1 million attend race meetings every year.  As Deputy Heydon noted, that number is not in decline.  If one examines what is happening in other countries in Europe, one will see that this is quite unique.  It is something to be really proud of, and it is a testament to the resilience, hard work and vision of the people who work in the racing sector.  The racing festivals at Punchestown, Galway and Listowel, to name just three, are massive earners in those communities.  It is important to mention that they are significant drivers of growth and employment at various times of the year.  </p>  <p>  We have been subjected to a certain degree of inverted snobbery about racing.  Nothing could be further from the truth than the notion that it is for an elite.  While this is particularly true in the national hunt sector, it applies right across the board.  This industry and sport is about the common man and woman.  The fact that 93% of farms involved in this sector have just a handful of mares bears out the suggestion that it is about ordinary people.  The vast majority of breeders in Ireland are small-time breeders.  Many of them are living the dream, or hoping to live the dream, by investing constantly and working all year round to support their passion.  I suppose they are hoping to strike gold at some point.  Unfortunately, that does not happen for most people.  This really important sport, which is part of rural Ireland and our way of life, encompasses all strata of society while attracting massive investment from some of the wealthiest people in the world.  We are all familiar with the investment we have seen from Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Middle East.  In recent times, significant investment has come from places like Qatar.  That is happening all the time in counties like Kildare and right across the country.</p>  <p>  Vision has been a feature of the thoroughbred sector in recent decades.  It is not often that I give credit in this Chamber to previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, but I will do so on this occasion because the introduction of the stallion tax was a really bold step that led to many opportunities, drove investment in the industry and gave Ireland the opportunity to be one of the best places in the world in which to invest and breed.  We should be proud of that legacy, which continues today.  Unfortunately, it contrasts with what is happening in the sport horse sector.  I know the Minister has done a great deal of good work to help that sector in recent years.  I hope the studies and reports he has commissioned will bear fruit in the sport horse sector, which is an area in which we took our eye off the ball and failed to show the same vision and ambition.  Unfortunately, Ireland has moved from being one of the best producers of sport horses in the world to falling way down the rankings, with just a handful of horses in the top 100 of the Longines rankings.  We need to see a new vision in the thoroughbred sector and a new vision for racing.  The related question of ensuring there is a stable and long-term supply of funding and investment arose when we considered the Betting (Amendment) Bill and the Gambling Control Bill.  We need an integrated approach.  While I welcome the great ambition that has been shown, certainly by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, other elements of the Government have not necessarily shown the same degree of support, unfortunately.  We really need to push for such support.  There has to be no doubt that the industry will receive secure long-term funding.</p>  <p>  I would say we have seen certain worrying trends in recent times.  While the value of exports is increasing, the number of horses being exported is decreasing.  Obviously, we are selling our best horses.  While what is welcome, we have to consider the medium and long-term needs and objectives of breeding and training.  Ultimately, we want to stand the very best stallions in this country.  That is what the tax exemption for stallions was about in the past.  I think we need to concentrate on trying to address the slightly worrying trend that exists in this area.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of it.  Equally, race horse ownership has declined.  I am between two minds on whether that is necessarily a negative.  During the Celtic tiger era, we saw too many bad horses running, frankly.  Similarly, we saw too many bad horses being produced in the sport horse sector.  We have to focus on quality.  There are many ownership models that can be pursued, encouraged and incentivised by the Government through taxation or whatever.</p><p>It must be targeted.  We cannot go back to producing low quality stock just to pump up the numbers.  It is very important that we continually and rigorously focus on quality and I know that the Minister feels the same way about that issue.</p> <p> Tourism is a very important factor and one that is often overlooked when we are quantifying the value of the sector in this country.  There have been some very interesting and welcome innovations in recent years like the champion's weekend, for example, of which I am very supportive.  We need to develop a lot more of our tourism industry around the equestrian sector generally, be it sport horses, hunting, racing and so forth.  Much of that can be integrated because often it is the same people who are interested in all the different elements.  There is real potential there.</p> <p> Many of the concerns I have about the Bill have been highlighted by Deputy Anthony Lawlor.  When one focuses on efficiencies and cost-savings, which is what this Bill is largely about, it is very important that the integrity and independence of the regulatory system is not compromised, but there are risks in this Bill.  Deputy Lawlor pointed to the experience in the UK, which is not one we should replicate.  There is a risk that the independence of the Turf Club can and will be compromised by this legislation.  I know these concerns have been brought to the Minister's attention and I am sure he has given them consideration.  However, I believe more consideration needs to be given to them before this Bill gets to Committee Stage.  I have no doubt that amendments will be tabled at that point to try to improve the Bill and ensure this drive towards efficiency is not delivered at a cost to the integrity of the sector and independence of the Turf Club.  This is an issue the Minister has heard raised many times but it is something he must seriously consider.</p> <p> I note that I have run out of time.  There were a number of other points I wished to make but I will not get an opportunity to do so at this stage.  I hope to be in a position to do so on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.617" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100039#NN00200"><p>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important legislation, the objectives of which are to strengthen governance and transparency within horse racing, to clarify the respective roles of the HRI and the RRB, to improve accountability and control over the generous State funding of the sector and to streamline the administrative functions of these two bodies.  While these objectives are both laudable and timely, we must be careful to ensure in our rush to the headland of good governance that we do not suffocate and snuff out the work of many inspired generations of volunteers throughout the country.  I refer, for example, to point-to-point racing and how it is governed and administered.  We must be careful not to see everything through the prism of the large, viable and disproportionately better supported HRI.  The smaller provincial racecourses will be the victims in this and will lose out in terms of funding, particularly if the media rights provisions in section 5 come to pass.  That effectively gives the HRI the right to secure all income generated from the sale of media rights as part of its general functions.</p>  <p>  I will digress for a moment and refer to a matter in which the Minister is greatly interested.  Indeed, I applaud his interest.  We all know that the horse racing industry makes an important contribution to employment in numerous areas including training, breeding, catering, betting, regulation and transport and provides work for jockeys, stable hands and so forth.  That is why it is absolutely critical that we put a full stop to the stupid, ill-conceived and bananas plans of various wind companies to erect wind turbines across the midlands, in the heart of the rural Ireland.  Wind farms and stud farms are incompatible and do not run together.  There is a clear danger that some prominent stud farmers will relocate if these monstrosities are given the go ahead.  I do not think it will ever happen but we must be vigilant.  I unequivocally support the efforts of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to increase significantly setback distances and to curtail and restrict the areas where these companies are contemplating setting up wind farms so as to protect stud farms, villages and agricultural and pastural lands.  These wind farms should not be allowed in any such areas.  There are more than 200,000 acres of cutaway bog available for the extraction of wind energy.  That said, I am of the view that the economic case for wind energy is dead in the water and does not stand up.  If wind farms were not subsidised they would not even get out of the traps.  As is the case in Britain, I advocate that subsidies be cut off and discontinued altogether.  We should let the wind farm projects stand on their own two feet, so to speak, if they are capable of doing so at all.  I urge the Minister to ensure they become a dead duck.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the fact that the bloodstock industry is of enormous economic benefit and nowhere more so than in my own constituency.  The horse and greyhound industries secured significant additional resources in the recent budget thanks to the good work of the Minister which must be acknowledged.  The industry provides more than 17,000 jobs, as my colleagues have said, and is worth well in excess of &euro;1 billion, with exports worth in excess of &euro;200 million.  We all recognise that State support was designed to make up for the shortfall in funding for the horse and greyhound sectors caused by the economic downturn.</p>  <p>  Racecourses are the critical element for horse racing, as the Minister is well aware.  Without the 26 racecourses located across 19 counties, which are capable of hosting both national hunt and flat race meetings, the industry would not exist at all.  In recent times, horse racing has seen significant declines in a number of key areas.  Attendances are down, on-course betting activity has reduced significantly and the number of racehorse owners and horses in training is down by over 30%, although the decline in the last area has been stabilised somewhat in recent times.</p></speech>

Owners had to renew their colours every year, which was nonsense.  They also had to pay money to renew the registration of trainers.  The HRI was extracting money at an unacceptable rate.  It got blood out of the turnip.  It contributed to the decline in numbers and I have said that to its representatives.  The Turf Club and others involved in the industry know of my views on this matter, as do the media.  The HRI acted disgracefully.  It has started to cut back on some of those practices now, but a bit late in the day.  During the recession, the HRI was horrendous and had no feeling for ordinary punters or the small racehorse owners.</p>  <p>  Racecourses play an important role in the development of tourism, as I know well from the work done by my local racecourse at Kilbeggan, which is 175 years old this year.  We are very proud of that racecourse.  It is managed shrewdly by Paddy Dunican together with the clerk of the course, Lorcan Weir, and the large and willing band of volunteers who work hard to make it the great racecourse that it is in the heart of the midlands.  We are very proud of it as a premier location and a premier racecourse.</p>  <p>  I am motivated not by any grandiose ideas or plans born in the brains of well-sheltered bureaucrats but by what is important from the perspective of the racecourses and their voluntary management who have struggled to survive.  They have not been helped, notwithstanding assurances I was given to the contrary, by the machinations and manoeuvring of the HRI which seems to be preoccupied with ensuring the top courses, some of which are owned by its members, continue to progress and are the major beneficiaries of the largesse of the State.  I would use the issue of media rights as an example of what I mean in this regard.  It is critical that the racecourses have the final say in approving any contracts involving media rights.  Those rights are owned by the racecourses.  They are a proprietary right and there is a constitutional issue involved.  As a lawyer, I wish to signal that fact.  It is likewise with the issue of point-to-point meetings, about which I will speak later.</p>  <p>  Section 10(9) and (10) of the 2001 Act, which deal with the distribution of the income generated from media rights, must be deleted.  This must not be ratified collectively either because there is a fear, which is well founded, that this would lead to a return to the old situation whereby the HRI and the bigger racecourses would outvote and overrule the wishes and the will of the smaller racecourses and impose their view on the matter.  They would determine how to deal with the collection of large sums originating from the sale of media rights and they would reign supreme.  I do not want any part of this section circumscribed by the imposition of any additional sections which would effectively amount to a sleight of hand.  I wish to signal that I will be keeping a very careful and close eye on this on Committee Stage.  I am not a contrarian but experience has taught me to be sceptical when required and in this case I will be so.</p>  <p>  The television rights income on Irish racecourses, especially the smaller country tracks, is replacing revenue from declining admissions income.  That is why it is vital for small racecourses to be able to protect their intellectual property rights.  Others should not have the right to grab them, to expropriate them for themselves and then decide how much to give to the racecourses.  That is not the way life works.  Those racecourses have been in existence for a very long time.  Kilbeggan, as I said earlier, has been operating for 175 years.  I also go to the racecourses in Roscommon and Ballinrobe regularly and would only go to the bigger racecourses for the odd big race meeting.  The smaller courses are the bedrock of the industry.</p>  <p>  To be blunt, the HRI depends on the taxpayer for its income.  It receives significant grants from the taxpayer through the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As a State body it was clamouring to get a share of the racecourse media rights for years and in 2001 it achieved that goal with SIS.  There was great annoyance at this because not only did the HRI receive the market value for the ownership of the media rights but small racecourses like Kilbeggan had to pay &euro;12,000 per meeting to the HRI, amounting to &euro;96,000 for eight meetings.  Over an eight year period, that amounted to  &euro;768,000.  A significant number of bookmaker's shops have closed since the last contract was negotiated in 2011 so there will be fewer bookmaker's shops to buy the media rights products in the next contract.  The question arises as to whether it will be the smaller racecourses that will bear the brunt if there is a decrease in income.  That is why this issue is so important.</p><p>It is fundamental and runs to the very essence of this Bill.  <br/><br/>The deletion of section 10(9) and (10) will enable a section to be included to provide for formal ratification and approval by racecourses of any contract involving media rights.  I may be wrong in this regard but I have checked the approximate percentage increases in income received in the most recent SIS media rights contracts negotiated by Horse Racing Ireland in 2011.  I note the increase for Fairyhouse racecourse was 70% and I salute that decision.  The increases for the racecourses at Leopardstown, Punchestown, the Curragh and Galway were 78.38%, 88.25%, 97.24% and 90%, respectively.  I also note that the increases for the racecourses at Ballinrobe, Clonmel, Dundalk, Roscommon, Kilbeggan and Thurles were 35%, 29%, 36%, 36%, 32% and 35%, respectively.  The change is important for this reason.  <br/><br/>I understand that prior to 2011, racecourses received equal payment from SIS for their media rights.  As such, the pitch was level.  I understand Horse Racing Ireland is now requiring racecourses to pay a minimum sponsorship contribution of &euro;3,500 for premium fixtures.  If the racecourses are not able to guarantee such payment, they may have to find alternative dates and times for the relevant race meetings - for example, by moving them to weekday afternoons during the summer months or outside the summer period altogether.  As I indicated, Kilbeggan racecourse is 175 years old and has much of which to be proud.  Kilbeggan is clearly a summer track.  Is the introduction of a minimum sponsorship charge of &euro;3,500 a way of compelling racecourses to pay towards the prize money and administrative costs of the racing industry?  The Government, through the Minister, is already funding the industry to a significant degree.  One must wonder what is the motive or rationale for this proposal, which is a matter of grave concern, especially for smaller racecourses.  I have spoken to representatives of a few such racecourses and they work hard to control costs and outlay.  These racecourses are operating as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible without compromising standards.  The issue of media rights is important for this reason and it is a matter on which I and other members of the Labour Party will focus. <br/><br/>I will raise another bugbear of mine, one that is shared by many of those working in the industry.  County Westmeath is decorated by high achievers at high levels, from horse owners, breeders and trainers to jockeys, stable mates and stable hands.  One cannot but laud the wonderful recent publication by Kilbeggan native Stan McCormack of a book with the title <i>Racing Through the Midlands</i>.  The Minister should buy a copy.  Mr. McCormack is well up in the racing industry and did a great job in the book.  It refers to various issues, including the Newbrook racecourse in Mullingar, the famous races at Kilbeggan, the point-to-point races at Castletown Geoghegan and The Pigeons in Doory near Ballymahon. It also highlights many successful breeders, trainers and jockeys who achieved significant success in many important races and famous equestrian occasions.  Some of these in my home area include Cecil and Alan Ross and their late father Billy, Adrian Murray, the late Jimmy Tormey, Ciaran Murphy, and Dot Love, who trained Liberty Counsel to win the Irish Grand National.  Martin Lynch from Castletown Geoghegan nearly won the Aintree Grand National.  These are small trainers who did their best and fought to survive during the recession.  Tommy Cleary is another trainer in Athlone whose son is a very good jockey.  Anne Fallon is also a trainer.  Owners include Gigginstown House Stud and Michael and Eddie O'Leary, and hardly a week goes by in which one does not read about one of them.  They also have great supporters who travel to Cheltenham and elsewhere.  Christy Maye and Martin Dibbs bred Comply or Die, which won the National.  Sean Reilly, a neighbour of mine, bred the great mare Shadow Eile.  There is also the late Ned Newman and his son Gerry in Leney, Ballinalack.  Other notable names include the late Cecil Ronaldson and the O'Neill family of Rathganny in Multyfarnham.  Mr. Watt won the Grand National in 1958, and L'Escargot, who was bred there, won 17 years later when he beat Red Rum in 1975.  Other names include the Nugents, the Boyd-Rochforts, Tally-Ho Stud, the Clearys of Bishopstown, the Dobsons, and the Downes family of Russellstown Stud.  Peter Downes, one of nature's gentleman, was an expert on all things equestrian.  The late Colm Murray had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the racing industry.  The Minister will know Mr. Breon Corcoran, the chief executive of a new betting entity.  He is a Mullingar man from Ballinea, and we are very proud of him.  I have only referred to a sample of the County Westmeath people associated with the sport of kings, although they do not regard it as such because they are ordinary folk who have an ingrained love of racing. <br/><br/>I will address briefly the importance of point-to-point racing and the reasons it should not be included in the Bill.  Surely it is incongruent to have a successful amateur sport that is manned by volunteers governed by legislation.  I am completely confused by the decision to include the sport in the provisions of the Bill, because this is not done with any other sport.  I am involved with point-to-point racing, which has its base in rural Ireland.  I was delighted to win one of the oldest cups in Ireland, the Barbour Cup, twice with Ballintue Road.  Point-to-point racing is a community activity organised by the local hunt or committee.  The point-to-point community is almost entirely voluntary and is predicated on the traditional concept of sharing and co-operation.  It is an integral part of the fabric of rural communities throughout the island.  Point-to-point racing was not covered by the Indecon report and is not mentioned in existing legislation.  The sport has thrived under the stewardship of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, INHSC, and is run on a very low cost base owing to high levels of volunteerism in the sport.  It is not necessary to have a successful amateur sport governed by legislation, as is proposed in this Bill.  This proposal is unprecedented, and while I will not dwell on the issue, I would not be surprised if it was subject to a legal challenge.  The Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee has made many submissions to the Department and it is disappointing that they have all fallen on deaf ears.</p></speech>

The Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee runs point-to-point racing by providing racing officials and voluntary stewards for each fixture.  It also provides a comprehensive committee and administrative structure to deal with integrity and licensing issues.  The sport has never experienced major problems, although the Minister may wish to point out some problems.</p>  <p>  The Bill will require point-to-point participants to register with Horse Racing Ireland.  This is an unwarranted interference in the running of an amateur sport, which is run successfully by the  Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  The provisions will irreparably damage point-to-point racing and its culture of volunteerism.  This will be the first time in the history of the State that participants in amateur sport will be required to register with a State body.  I played GAA at amateur level for 27 years, during which I was never required to register with a State body. </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the appropriation by Horse Racing Ireland of income derived from point-to-point racing.  Is that not a major change?  I had to collect a certificate from Cecil Ross's wife for point-to-point racing, for which I paid a registration fee that was reinvested in the sport.</p></speech>

It is unprecedented that the State proposes to take over an amateur sport.  HRI also has its neck in to negotiate the media rights for point-to-point racing.  Is there anything HRI does not want to control?  It will come as a great surprise to hunts around the country that organise point-to-point fixtures for which they own the media rights.</p></speech>

I have many questions to ask about how the legislation will operate.  Did Horse Racing Ireland provide integrity funding for point-to-point races?  Was it provided under the development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry or under the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse?  In what way will HRI provide such funding?</p>  <p>  I have here a copy of the agreement reached between the then Minister for Agriculture and Food and Minister for Finance in 2001.  At that time, the Turf Club agreed to transfer a number of registry office functions and racing administration to Horse Racing Ireland on the basis of a guarantee of funding for the industry and an agreement that all costs of integrity services would be recovered from HRI on the basis of an agreed budget.  Joe Walsh and Charlie McCreevy were the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance, respectively, at the time.  I remember a memorandum of understanding being drawn up because I was the Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture at the time.</p></speech>

That is my point.  The memorandum of understanding was subsequently approved at a joint meeting of the stewards and governing bodies.  Given that stewards of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee were not present at the negotiations between the two Ministers, it is clear that point-to-point racing was not discussed as part of the transfer provided for at that time.</p>  <p>  We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  I understand that integrity is a very important aspect and I support many of the provisions of the Bill.  The Turf Club and Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee currently have two streams of income.</p><p>Those are a reimbursement from HRI of the integrity service cost for racecourses and point to points and income from licence services.  Any surplus arising from the licence is retained and invested.  All costs associated with the running of the office's indirect costs are split between integrity and licensing.  This was agreed with HRI ten years ago and was based on certain criteria.  The cost of integrity is reduced on an annual basis by income from fines imposed for rule breaches or charges imposed in relation to the provision of integrity services such as sampling and stable inspections and the reimbursement from HRI net of this income.  As such, I want to make sure that the important point to point races at Castletown Geoghegan and Durrow and the ones beside the Minister in Cork are not left out on a shelf and the volunteers made to feel a big body is coming in to swipe away their functions.</p></speech>

It is important to understand how this will work.  I am quite happy with the Minister's assurance, but I still believe point to point races should be excluded.  If one looks at it from a legal perspective, I wonder if the commitment that was given in 2001 will stand up to scrutiny in the context of the Bill.  That is all I am putting out.  I am entitled to put it out.  The Minister says that everything is protected and I accept his word.  I am putting it out to make sure.  Point to points are pivotal to the racing industry.  While only 10% to 20% of the horses go on to race on courses, it is very often the poor person's way of getting into and enjoying racing.  That is extremely important.</p>  <p>  I notice the Minister did not interject when I was speaking about media rights and, as such, I assume there was nothing wrong with what I said.  I assume we will have the appropriate amendments on Committee Stage to address the concerns I have echoed in relation to media rights.</p></speech>

I was thinking on the way here about going as a child to the race meeting in Galway when that festival was a farmers' festival.  I remember going in and putting a bet on with my 50p and getting the perforated ticket from the tote.  I had to stand on tiptoe to reach into the slot because I was so small.  In a lot of families in Ireland, racing is a social thing.  We grew up with it and have enjoyed it.  I remember on that particular occasion that my 50p bet returned the princely sum of &pound;56 for my place.  Was I a proud man going home the same evening.  What was even prouder was the fact that my father had been burned at the races on the same day and I had more money in my pocket going home than he had.  It is memories like that which we all have of attending race meetings growing up.  Hopefully, the next generation will have the same appreciation of it as an enjoyable sport.  That is the way a lot of us look at the racing industry and the racecourses around the country.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to look at the industry more broadly.  It is the reality in rural Ireland now that agriculture is not the mainstay it used to be.  The latest Teagasc figures for 2014 show that 37% of Irish farms, which is less than four in every ten, are economically viable.  In the west, it is just 16% of farms that are economically viable.  In many parts of rural Ireland, the only potential relates to tourism.  Tourism is going to be a vital aspect of sustaining communities and populations in rural Ireland.  The small racecourses form an integral part of that.  In my neck of the woods, we have quite a number of racecourses.  In Roscommon town we have Roscommon racecourse and over the road we have Kilbeggan racecourse to which Deputy Penrose referred earlier.  There are also racecourses in Ballinrobe, Sligo and, of course, Galway.  There has always been a very strong tradition of farmers having one or two horses and a local trainer having perhaps five or six horses and bringing them to small local meetings.  Once in a generation, perhaps, those trainers might have a winner at Ballybrit or one of the major festivals.  That is their goal in life and when it happens the whole community gets behind the trainer and the horse.  It is that sense of community that is fundamentally important in relation to the racing industry, particularly outside the major centres.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me to fail to join other speakers in mentioning the late Pat Eddery who was an ambassador for the racing industry.  He is someone we all grew up watching cross the finishing line.  Deputy Anthony Lawlor referred earlier to backing the jockey rather than the horse and Pat Eddery made quite princely sums for many people who adopted that particular tactic.</p>  <p>  Deputy Penrose raised the issue of media rights and I want to take it up also.  For the small racecourses like Roscommon, Kilbeggan, Ballinrobe and Sligo, media rights are crucially important to keeping their gates open and the courses operating.  They are excellent courses and a linchpin for tourism.  In fairness to most of the racecourses, they have tried to develop festivals around some of their meetings, particularly where they can get two meetings back to back.  They have tried to tie in the local towns with the festivals and sought to open up their racecourses to other events to attract visitors to their areas.  Ballinrobe has been hugely successful in that regard and Roscommon has been involved in that work too.  That effort needs to be supported because it is a driver of local tourism development.  In that context, I have concerns about the way the legislation is structured.  As Deputy Penrose mentioned earlier, the media rights committee can obtain outside expertise.  I do not have any particular difficulty with that.  My concern is that as drafted the legislation provides that the media rights committee when negotiating any contract or arrangement referred to in subsection (1) shall consult with the executives of all the authorised racecourses.  Consultation can mean calling them all into a meeting, setting out what the negotiating strategy is and going off to negotiate on that basis.  The committee will then have ticked the box on consultation.  There is a big difference between consultation and agreement.  The issue has been flagged with the Minister and it came up at the pre-legislative stage in committee.  While the Minister has provided reassurances in relation to that, the difficulty is that the law as drafted is not strong enough.  My fear is that the smaller racecourses will be squeezed by this.</p></speech>

A weighting is applied based on a meeting's status or grading rather than on the number of meetings that a course holds.  As the Minister knows, however, it is the small racecourses with the large numbers of people passing through their gates that keep the industry alive, support small trainers and encourage owners of one or two race horses.  They keep interest going, as those who go to local racecourses in, for example, Roscommon also go to the large festivals in Galway, Listowel and so on once or twice per year.  They are crucial to maintaining, developing and promoting the industry, yet they believe that the squeeze is being put on them by the current legislation.  The Bill as drafted will give them even less control.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Penrose stated, there is a question mark over whether the Bill infringes on the property rights of racecourses.  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, has a dual role in this matter.  It is the racing industry's overall authority and is an owner of some racecourses.  Funnily enough, those seem to be the courses that, alongside Galway and a number of other courses, are getting the lion's share of the funding.  Smaller racecourses believe that they are being squeezed in this regard.  I hope that the Minister can table an amendment on Committee Stage to assure local racecourses - the Roscommons, Ballinrobes, Sligos and Kilbeggans - that this agreement will not just be thrust on them and they will not be bullied into reducing their number of meetings or considering closing.  Enough have closed in recent years.  These ones survived the economic recession because they had local networks of people who traditionally attended their race meetings.  They need to be supported through the fair, equitable and transparent distribution of media rights funds.  This is important.</p>  <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the sport horse industry, particularly as regards animal welfare and feral horses.  These problems have implications for the horse industry, which is worth approximately &euro;150 million per annum in exports, making it a significant export industry that should be supported and developed.  In recent years, there has been a slippage in standards in the sport horse industry.  Professor Paddy Wall is doing a great deal of work on this front and has a lot of respect from the industry.  He and the people around him will turn the industry around and develop it.</p>  <p>  There is a problem at its lower end, though.  A substantial number of horses have still not been chipped and do not have passports.  We have an issue with stray animals.  Not only are they a risk in terms of being reservoirs for diseases such as strangles, but they are also a risk to human life.  The issue has died down to a certain extent since coming to the fore a few years ago during a fodder crisis that not only affected our cattle industry and the rest of the agricultural sector, but also the horse industry, in that there was no outlet for those animals at the lower end of the scale.</p>  <p>  We need to examine what is happening in the beef industry and determine how to use some of the tools that it has developed.  For example, the beef data and genomics scheme is a good one, although it could probably have been explained better initially.  Thankfully, more farmers have joined it than originally withdrew.  I hope that it has got over the initial problems with communication and confusion.  We have a beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, and a sheep technology adoption programme, STAP.  Perhaps it is time that we consider establishing the same discussion groups in the horse industry that have proven so successful in the dairy industry and, more recently, the beef and sheep industries.  We must do something to improve the breeding strategy in the sport horse industry and increase standards across the board.</p>  <p>  Consider the example of suckler cows.  Our beef industry was on its knees, as the most important part of the cow during the period of coupled payments across Europe-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100042#QQ00400"><p>No.  The most important part of the cow was its ears.  The quality of the animal had no bearing.  During the boom, the standard of horse fell significantly because people held on to low quality stock.  Bizarrely, there was a trade in that stock.  When the recession hit, there was no outlet.  There was also an issue with passports and slaughtering facilities for those horses.  All of this caused a welfare problem, but the greater issue is that of quality and breeding standards.</p>  <p>  Our beef industry has come a long way from farming for ears to breeding strategies.  We are now moving a step farther and engaging in genomics.  Explaining this to farmers will take a while, but they will appreciate it in time.  We need a similar strategy in the sport horse industry, given that it will face greater challenges than the dairy sector or even the beef sector did.  We should transfer what we have learned from the roll-out of the beef data and genomics scheme to the equine sector.  I encourage the Minister to devise a scheme, even if it is just to get information out there.  Professor Wall is determined to explain to breeders on the ground what is being sought by the market, but more needs to be done if we are to communicate to them what is happening.  Those tools that have been developed by the Department for the beef sector can be replicated in the equine sector.</p>  <p>  We must consider what to do with animals that do not have chips or proper passports.  This problem is costing the animal welfare funds of the Minister's Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and so forth approximately &euro;5 million per year.  This cannot continue and some solution must be found, as our export industry is too important.  We must try to improve standards and bring all of the players together - Teagasc, Horse Sport Ireland, the welfare groups, UCD, the Minister's Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the breeder societies - around the same table and develop a strategy for the sport horse industry from its weaker end to its international and Olympic end.</p></speech>

He was a truly gifted horseman and a legend of the sport of horse racing.  He was a champion jockey 11 times and the winner of 14 British classics.  He was associated with some of the best horses of the 20th century, such as Sadler's Wells, Rainbow Quest, El Gran Senor, Grundy, Zafonic, Warning and Pebbles, on which he won the Breeders' Cup Turf in 1985.  Born in Newbridge in County Kildare on 18 March 1952, he became one of the greats of the sport of kings.  May he rest in peace.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill.  It aims to improve governance, funding and administration arrangements for the Irish horse racing industry so as to underpin the sector's world-class standing and protect and maintain its reputation.  I understand that in the course of drafting this Bill, further consideration was given to the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The number of HRI board members is to be increased by one to accommodate the request of the committee that stable staff be represented on the board.  I welcome that.</p>  <p>  The Irish bloodstock industry is of enormous economic benefit to this country.  It is estimated by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association that the industry provides in excess of 14,000 jobs and approximately &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and is responsible for exports worth over &euro;200 million.</p>  <p>  The legislation will strengthen governance and transparency within horse racing and result in increased efficiency through the streamlining of certain administrative operations.  It will clarify the respective functions of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the Racing Regulatory Body, RRB.  It will strengthen the integrity functions of the body and improve accountability and control over State funding.  The legislation will also provide that Bord na gCon will be statutorily subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies or other such codes or policy documents issued by the Government by amending the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.</p>  <p>  Key outcomes of the Bill will include improved governance and changes to the HRI board constitution to improve efficiencies and accountability.  There will be new statutory committees for HRI, including dedicated committees for persons employed in the industry and the betting sector, in addition to harmonisation of existing statutory committees.  Other features include maintaining ICT integrity functions and the retention by the RRB of responsibility for integrity functions and its licensing role.  The issuing of hunter certificates and management of entries and declarations for point-to-point racing and the financial receipts associated with those functions will remain with the local hunt clubs.  The RRB will be required to consult HRI regarding amendments to the rules of racing and, likewise, HRI will be required to consult the RRB in regard to amendments to its directives.</p>  <p>  With regard to streamlining and efficiencies, a single streamlined structure within HRI for the administration and financial management of all other aspects of horse racing will facilitate the elimination of administrative duplication between HRI and the RRB.  This includes the processing of income derived from both the registration fees for hunting certificates and licensing of trainers for participation in point-to-point races.  These payments are currently processed by the RRB.  This will pave the way for increased efficiencies in areas such as finance, IT, payroll, pensions and certain administration aspects in regard to point-to-point racing.  This will involve data sharing between HRI and the RRB.  Changes to licensing and registration will be subject to annual approval by HRI.  Income streams that currently go to local hunt clubs will be unaffected.</p>  <p>  I commend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, under the chairmanship of Deputy Andrew Doyle, on its role in formulating this important legislation.  I recognise the work of the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, on bringing this Bill before us for due consideration following the consideration of the recommendations contained in the Indecon report.</p>  <p>  I welcome the recently announced &euro;65 million redevelopment plan for the Curragh Racecourse, A Vision for a New Curragh.  The Curragh is our premier flat racing racecourse.  The best horses, trainers, jockeys, owners and stable staff in the world compete there.  It is very encouraging that the redevelopment plan has been produced.  I wish well the stakeholders, including the Irish Turf Club, HRI and the private investors.  I look forward to seeing the ambitious plan becoming a reality by 2018.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the Grand Alliance horse racing syndicate on its fabulous win in Mallow recently in the Munster grand national.  I encourage all the members, especially the Ceann Comhairle, to take the bull by the horns and opt for the Irish Grand National in Fairyhouse.  I hope the syndicate will have a very successful Easter next year.</p></speech>

There are a couple of issues that need to be raised, however, particularly in respect of gambling.  I have raised this matter in the debate on the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  I realise that some of the funding from online betting is going towards HRI and Bord na gCon.  When an individual walks into a betting shop and places a bet, he does so with cash.  There is no capacity to run credit or use one's credit card.  Likewise, when one goes to a racetrack, one walks up to the bookmaker of one's choice, having looked at the prices, and makes a bet accordingly in cash.  The notion that one could gamble using credit is one I do not approve of at all.  It lends itself to a form of addiction that can result in the loss of one's life's savings.  One could lose more than one's life's savings in that one could go into enormous debt as a result of the ability to use credit cards.  I approve of the concept of debit cards in the facilitation of gambling but believe it is not appropriate to have a credit card as the <i>modus operandi</i>.  There is a litany of stories throughout this country of people who lost everything they ever had and some more owing to a gambling addiction, with the consequence of their being in debt to credit card companies and banks.</p><p>Many people are employed in the online gambling business.  I support the business.  For the most part, people can contain their online gambling, and they regard it as fun to back their own team or horse.  They get a little enjoyment from it.  However, when gambling becomes a problem, it is incumbent upon those who provide licences to bookmakers, be they online or otherwise, to operate prudently and in the best interest of society overall and look after the punter or gambler.</p><p>There are a couple of other points I would like to raise.  Some 80% of the funding is to go to HRI and 20% is to go to Bord na gCon.  The Minister is responsible for both areas.  In my area, Kerry, we are more into dogs than horses.  According to the breeders' and owners' associations, prize funds have become so low that people are moving away from the industry.  The industry provides a good social outlet.  Dog racing is a tourist attraction in Tralee, where one sees tour buses going by on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights.  However, we need to have races of a high quality.  In order to have them, we need to inject money into the industry.  I would like to see the money invested in prize funds more than in administration and meeting organisational running costs.  I admit there has been streamlining but the money needs to go to the prize funds as the first port of call.</p><p>With regard to horse racing, Killarney is well supported.  Listowel is also very well supported.  Unfortunately, during the downturn the racecourse in Tralee ended up being mothballed.  There is nothing more than a couple of point-to-point meetings and some coursing meetings taking place there.</p><p>There is a wonderful stand and facilities in a county that might not be as synonymous with horse racing as that of my colleague, Deputy Jack Wall, from Kildare.  However, people like Jim Culloty and Bryan Cooper have played a prestigious role in the industry at all times.</p> <p> I wish to highlight a couple of other things.  Some 17,000 people are employed in the industry.  It could be improved, however, and we could do more to support the industry's exporting capacity.  We have developed a small number of breeders who have dominated hurdle activities in recent years.  It was a sport that was open to most farmers of a decent size and I would like to see the sport going back in that direction.</p> <p> The idea of horse-owning syndicates was promoted seven, eight or nine years ago.  I know we have some participants in the House.  It was a great way of getting the average person involved in horse racing and it brought forward the entertainment side of it.  People followed the horse or dog as the case may be and that should be promoted by Horse Racing Ireland as well.  For the most past I support what is in this Bill.  I am just conveying some ideas, particularly around gambling where I would prefer to see the use of debit cards rather than credit cards.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Finance but perhaps the Minister, Deputy Coveney, could advance it.</p></speech>

Pat was from a Newbridge family that gave so much to racing in Ireland.  Apart from Pat, many other members of his family participated with many of the great trainers around the Curragh.  Pat then went on to England and became world famous by riding many winners.  He was always one who gave everything.  On the radio yesterday, the English trainers said it did not matter whether it was a seller race or a derby he was running in, they knew that if Pat Eddery was on board, they would get full value for their money.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p>  <p>  I commend the Minister on bringing forward this legislation for an industry that is so important locally, nationally and internationally.  I am also pleased that the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine played a part in preparing the Bill.  That is one aspect of Bills that perhaps we do not use enough.  We should ensure committees participate in putting forward ideas, which is what happened in this case and is to be commended.</p>  <p>  Many heroes have been created over centuries of racing - too many to mention here.  I am sure that, like myself, everyone has well-known names to which they can readily refer.  I remember my first winner at a Punchestown festival meeting many years ago.  It was a black horse trained by the late Bunny Cox called Jungle Cry.  I am afraid, however, that in the interim many a horse went by the post there without my own wager on it, but that is just the name of the game.</p>  <p>  The Minister has accurately and rightly set out the critical importance of this iconic, flagship industry.  The Bill deals with the statutory functions of the racing world which are very important.  The figures for the value of horse racing to Ireland speak for themselves.  Some 18,000 people are employed in the sector across rural Ireland while it earns hundreds of millions of euro in exports to almost 40 countries.  In addition, the industry contributes well in excess of &euro;1 million to the economy annually.  It also attracts more than 80,000 tourists to our world-renowned racetracks which are attended by in excess of 1 million spectators each year.</p>  <p>  Nearly every one of the country's 26 racecourses now has its own festival.  These are developing into wonderful occasions for loved ones to return home and visit their families as well as seeing their friends and acquaintances.  We can see this aspect being developed in various areas by Tourism Ireland and local authorities.  Such festivals can be developed around racecourses and, as such, are proving to be valuable to local authority finances as well as those of the racecourses themselves.</p>  <p>  This industrial side is vital and central to my community in south Kildare.  In many such rural communities it is the main employer.  I could cite many of the large studs in south Kildare, including Kildangan which is a major player in employment in that area.  Other parts of the industry provide thousands of jobs in stables, racecourses, tote facilities, ancillary facilities, transport, farriers and agriculture.  I could go on.</p>  <p>  It is also important to the small farmer who may also be a trainer with a private licence for one or two horses.  Their day comes too when at a race meeting we suddenly see the small man winning out against his more famous or well-heeled rival.  Perhaps many of us go to too many race meetings, but we want to see locals with badges representing their horses in the parade ring.  It gives a new value and a sense of involvement to racing which is growing.  We used to see it with the derby and dog racing but we are now seeing it on a wider scale with horse racing, especially at some of the major festivals.  It is bread and butter for small farmers, trainers and breeders.  If they are lucky at Goffs or Tattersalls they may make a breakthrough with one foal, so their year is made.  If they are lucky on the day it may be for more than one year.</p>  <p>  The spin-off effect of any one day in the racing calendar at any of the three County Kildare racecourses is a major financial input for local communities.  Many factors are involved, including restaurants, bars, shops, garages and transport used by visitors and commuters.  They ensure there is significant investment in the area surrounding the race meeting.</p>  <p>  We hear that the industry has vast potential for growth and expanded investment as the economy shows good signs of recovery.  County Kildare's three courses play a major part in our sporting and tourist attractions.  The Curragh is the home of all our classics.  Last week, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the chairman of the Curragh racecourse, Padraig McManus, explained the new development plans there.  It was an exciting moment not just for the racing fraternity in Ireland but certainly for the people of Kildare who love the open plains of the Curragh.  Apart from horse racing, the application process includes the development of the Curragh plains and gallops, the Curragh camp and increased training facilities.  Many other aspects of community life in the area are of significance to those who use them.</p>  <p>  The investors are household names not alone in Ireland but also internationally.  In his speech, the Minister mentioned that he had invited more investment via an open door.  I was pleased to hear that there is potential to attract more investment to the Curragh and other areas.  The way the Curragh is being developed will set a trend thus attracting investment in other areas.  It was a great day for Kildare and is something we are looking forward to.  With the help of God, the planning application will be made at the start of 2016.</p>  <p>  As part of that expansion, Horse Racing Ireland has also approved a substantial development in Naas.  Two weeks ago, I was in Naas as the chairman of Club Kildare which is the Kildare GAA supporters' club.  It is a beautiful facility on the edge of the motorway which is open for development and investment and will now get a new stand.  It will be open for groups in Dublin that go to Naas because of what will be there in the near future.  Mr. Tom Ryan and his committee could not have been more helpful to us in ensuring everything was available to us on the day.</p><p>Certainly, we will be passing that on to other groups that are interested in having race days and so on.  It augurs well for Naas that it is seen as being one of the areas that Horse Racing Ireland will develop.</p> <p> Dick O'Sullivan and his team at Punchestown have done wonders in developing the festival there.  The festival is now matching Cheltenham in National Hunt racing and is the equivalent on the Irish scene.  Furthermore, we are now attracting more visitors from the United Kingdom.  All the major players in the training game in England are now coming because they want to have their horses run against the best in Ireland.  They want to have their horses winning major races at the festival in Punchestown.</p> <p> As we go forward, it is vital that we look at the industry and ensure that those participating are protected and looked after.  There are four main players as I see it: the jockey, the stable lad, the owner and the horse.  I gather we are going to provide facilities for stable lads.  A former colleague of ours, Se&aacute;n Power, undertook considerable work to establish the Irish Stable Staff Association.  It is good to see that we will have a representative from that association on the racing board.  It is important that they are given recognition and that the hard work they do on a daily basis to ensure the industry survives is recognised.</p> <p> The jockey should be respected too.  Under section 7 the funding provided to the pension trust for jockeys and other funds will be protected.  It is vital to ensure that all the funds, including the funds for jockeys and the benevolent funds, are secure.  We need to look at them on a constant basis.  I am unsure whether that is possible under the legislation, but perhaps the Minister could seek to ensure that they are investigated on a constant basis.  Perhaps the Minister can ensure that funding is available for hardship cases and cases involving major injuries.  We have seen several such cases involving our famous jockeys of late.  Two or three of them were badly injured.  I am keen to ensure they will be looked after and that the relevant facilities will be put in place not only from an insurance perspective but also in respect of the funds provided.</p> <p> Recently, I spoke to John Weld, chairman of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners.  The owners want to play their part as well.  They have no wish to take over but they are keen to be involved in the running of the various organisations and courses.  They want to play their part in anything that goes on.  We know that the numbers in ownership are dropping.  That is only a passing phase.  We will see the strength of the overall package that is Irish racing develop again.  This is likely because of the improvement in the economy and because we have never lost the quality of horse running in all the major tracks in Australia, America and the United Kingdom.  Indeed, the horses from those areas pose challenges for us when they come here.  Yet the breed of horse here has always been well able to look after itself.  That is due to the many wonderful trainers we have in this country.  I have referred to the small trainers already, but we need to consider the major players as well, including Aidan O'Brien, Jim Bolger and Willie Mullins.  There is strength in their depth and experience that cannot be bought.  I am sure that will be reflected in the continuing growth of the industry.</p> <p> Previous speakers referred to the welfare of the horse.  Of course it is of paramount importance and we must not ignore that.  I do not doubt the views of the Minister in respect of how this should be part of any legislation.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, he is familiar with that aspect of the racing world.  In that way, one of the most important aspects will be looked after.</p> <p> People in Kildare have concerns in respect of two aspects of the natural progression of industry.  One relates to wind turbines and the other relates to pylons.  The question of pylons seems to have been put to rest at this stage.  However, there remains a constant threat and there is much concern among the major players, especially in stud farms, with regard to wind turbines and the problems of flicker, noise and the height of the turbines.  According to the experts in the bloodstock industry, they pose a major challenge.  It would be a major imposition and a concern to us if the development of the wind farm industry continues to the point at which we cannot control it in areas of major importance.  Obviously, a person's house is his castle.  To my knowledge, that must be and will be protected by legislation.  However, we must also look at the other aspects of it.  The bloodstock industry is certainly an interested party.  I know strong representations have been made to the Minister as well as to other Members on the matter.  I hope that common sense will prevail and that, as we go forward, not only the homes of Ireland but also the industry that is so important will be protected.  Not every area of Ireland is affected, but in many affected areas, such as mine, stud farms play an important role in employment and community activities.  I am not aware of any stud farm in Kildare that does not play a major part in the local community.  Those involved look after the facilities in the small villages where they are located and contribute to the overall impact and sponsorship of the areas.  Certainly, it would be of major concern if anything were to undermine in any way what we see as being vital to those communities.</p> <p> I welcome the legislation.  I know it relates to a statutory body and regulation and so on.  However, in speaking on the Bill we should acknowledge what the industry means to people and to public representatives.  No matter where we go in the world, if people mention Kildare they talk of the thoroughbred county where the major stud farms are located.  They talk of the home of the classics and the home of the Punchestown festival.  In that way we can see the renowned tourism attraction for Kildare.  I attended a meeting last week with the chief executive of Kildare County Council, Peter Carey.  We spoke about reinventing and reinvigorating the thoroughbred county signage and so on to ensure that Kildare will benefit further from the growth we are seeing.  As the Minister said himself at the Curragh previously, the development of the racecourse will be a central focus for the Irish bloodstock industry.  It will ensure benefits for the overall development of the area as well.  It was satisfying to hear that the racecourse development is going to envelop all of the Curragh, including the camp and all the other amenities.  One need only go across the Curragh any given morning to see hundreds of people walking, running, or riding bicycles.  It is a vast area of importance to us.  I was delighted to hear this was not solely a racecourse issue but one that would have an overall impact and make a major difference to Kildare and the local people who use the facility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100045#TT00200"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak for a few moments on this important legislation.  I thank the Minister for introducing it.</p>  <p>  One of the things we are aware of in respect of the racing industry is its importance as an economic entity.  It is peculiar in the sense that it combines business, employment and recreation.  It is an industry that generates extensive local support from the towns and villages associated with the various stud farms, trainers and horses, as we all know.  Sometimes the horses do not run fast enough, but their intentions are genuine most of the time.</p><p> I compliment the Minister on his input to the racing industry since he came into office.  It is important to ensure that the industry, as it stands, grows, prospers and develops in this country.  We have now achieved a worldwide status which is growing, and with that growth comes significant employment potential.  We can now take our place in any of the main racecourses worldwide and distinguish ourselves, and have done so repeatedly over the past number of years.  That was a major goal some years ago, but it has developed to the extent that it is now expected.  That has come as a result of careful governance, breeding, the encouragement of various strains over a long number of years and continued investment in the industry.  However, that stands in stark contrast to the 1960s, when most of our breeding stock left the country or were sold off at an early stage.  The fact that horses are now being kept, raced and go to stud at home is a major boost for the sector.  Ultimately, that will result in a major improvement in employment and employment prospects.</p> <p> I congratulate in particular the extent to which everybody involved continues to take an interest in the future and well-being of the industry, whether it is racecourses, owners, trainers or the betting fraternity.  When one goes to a racecourse, one is always welcomed and made to feel at home, something that applies to visitors as well.  At the Punchestown Festival, I met a woman who had not been to Ireland for many years - she told me it was her first visit in 45 years - and that it was well worth the wait.  It was as good an accolade as one could extend to the industry.  </p> <p> The Minister recently visited the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown and saw the work being done there.  I have a special interest in the centre because it was very good to me in years gone by, something I will never forget, in particular in regard to my involvement in this House.  It has done a tremendous amount of work and has increased standards in terms of the services it provides up to international levels.  It can do more with more, something I know the Minister is well disposed towards, and his preferred option would be to encourage and protect the sector.</p> <p> I refer to forensic areas such as Backweston, for example, where we need to compete with countries all over the world in the degree to which we have science and facilities to follow the industry, ensure that it adheres to the highest possible standards and that we are in a position to compete with forensics anywhere in the world.  We should not have to send samples abroad, wait for them to return or wait for a decision made by somebody else.  It is very important that we have scientists here, continue to encourage them and ensure that the required resources are made available.  I know the Minister is well disposed to doing just that and he will continue to do so.</p> <p> I mentioned the extent to which business, industry and recreation is combined in the Bill.  I do not want to delay the debate, but no other industry so well combines the entrepreneurial efforts and skills of so many constituent bodies so effectively.  At the same time, it creates an area for the enjoyment of the general public in a celebratory mode, and long may that continue.</p> <p> It goes without saying that the continued emphasis on good breeding practices needs to continue.  We need to keep in place the means and wherewithal to retain and race the best strains in this country.  As a result of establishing their credentials here, they will be able to continue to travel worldwide and be a flagship for the Irish industry. </p> <p> In a previous incarnation, I visited two of the stables owned by the ruler of Dubai, in the company of the late head of the National Stud.  Seeing the facilities provided there made me realise the major investment made in the horse racing industry in areas that did not necessarily compete - they have a number of studs in this country.  It remains a challenge to us in this country to ensure that we can continue to compete with those with whom we associate in the industry at home and abroad.  </p> <p> I again congratulate the Minister on the work he has already done with the industry.  I have no doubt he is well committed to it.  He understands and knows it well, which is always a help.</p></speech>

There have been many good contributions on the Bill and a series of different suggestions, supportive comments and some new approaches, some of which I will address.  I will not be able to address everything in the time available to me, but we will be able to tease out many issues on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised concerns about ministerial appointees to the Horse Racing Ireland board.  We are essentially moving from the Minister being able to appoint the chairperson, but nobody else, while the industry appointed other people as representatives of different parts of the industry, to now having three ministerial appointments to the board, albeit one of them will represent interests from Northern Ireland in terms of horse racing.  That recommendation came from Indecon.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately, a large amount of public money goes into the industry.  It is the correct decision and I hope we will be able to continue to increase funding for the industry and sport, but because of that it is important that we have members on the board, appointed by the Minister, who represent the public interest.  There is an onus on the Minister to make sure that the right people are appointed.  The new procedures and approaches for public sector appointments will be used.  In other words, the skill set that is needed to ensure that we have a balanced board will very much shape the people chosen to be members of the board.  </p>  <p>  A number of very valid points were made regarding an injured jockeys fund.  My experience of jockeys in the industry has been extraordinarily positive.  They are courageous athletes who set standards but, unfortunately, at times it is a dangerous sport.  Some very serious accidents have happened over the past five or six years.  The industry has a responsibility to ensure that such people are supported, and that starts with financial support.  There have been many generous fund-raisers in that regard, but I am open to considering ways in which the industry could more formally support the maintenance and pooling of resources to create a fund that could support injured jockeys.</p>  <p>  Drug testing is a red line issue for me.  We need to have the best drug testing facilities in the world in order to maintain integrity in the sector.</p><p>We need to take a totally uncompromising approach towards rooting out the inappropriate use of drugs and illegal drugs.  To be fair, we have been doing this through the Department's inspections and the Turf Club's role in protecting the integrity of the sport.  These provide pretty robust controls in this area.  The Irish industry has a strong reputation and for good reason.  We cannot allow anything to undermine this.  The independence of the Turf Club and its role in this regard, as well as the role played by the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when appropriate, are all focused on ensuring this is and remains the case.</p> <p> The essence of some of the concerns of a number of Deputies speaking on Second Stage was the maintenance of the independence of the racing regulatory body, namely, the Turf Club, and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  The legislation solidifies the independence of the regulatory body.  It is about ensuring there is legal separation between Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the Turf Club in terms of their clear roles as set down in legislation.  We will not go down the route the UK has chosen to take.  We want a well funded, independent, well run, efficient and transparently run Turf Club and we have a really good starting point.  The Turf Club does an excellent job.  It relies on many volunteer stewards in racecourses throughout the country.  People have a lot of faith in it.  We will not do anything to upset this.  What we are trying to do is to build a modern legal structure to protect and add to what is already there and working.  That is all we are trying to do.</p> <p> The Indecon report recommended that I do a lot more than I am doing, in truth.  When it looked at streamlining, it recommended that the Turf Club and HRI would be in the same building, and that the Turf Club would move a half a mile or so from where it is into the HRI building.  This was its recommendation.  It also made a clear recommendation on having a single portal for all payments, whether for licensing or registrations, and that we would have a single office to manage the money coming in and going out, so we would have clear transparency in terms of who pays what and where the money goes.  We will implement this element.  I made a concession to the Turf Club because I was convinced by its arguments that it was important that it have, and be seen to have, physical independence from HRI in terms of its own building and offices to run its own show.  We made this significant concession early on.  It was the right thing to do, but it was also evidence that we are doing nothing to damage or undermine the independence of the Turf Club.  It is quite the opposite, as this is about protecting it in legislation.</p> <p> When it comes to funding streams, we must ensure that any body that is publicly funded or partially publicly funded is protected with appropriate modern legislation.  This year, the Turf Club, as an independent body, will receive &euro;7.1 million of taxpayers' money to run integrity services in racing, and we must ensure there is legislation to protect it if it is questioned on where the money goes, how it is spent and how the budget is put together.  This is why having a single office for managing the money coming in - for example, for the registration of hunters - is simply a sensible streamlining process whereby money comes in through one office.  After the Bill is implemented, all of the money that goes to the Turf Club at present will automatically go back to the Turf Club, and we will put very clear language in place and, if necessary, will make appropriate amendments to ensure this is the case.  This is not about taking money from anybody; it is about ensuring that any money raised is raised in a transparent way and the budget needed to provide adequate integrity services through the Turf Club is an appropriate budget, in view of all of the different budgetary factors that the Turf Club manages.  That is all it is about.</p> <p> Deputy Penrose and a number of others seem to suggest this is some kind of takeover from voluntary hunt clubs of the scheduling and operation of point-to-points.  Nothing could be further from the truth, as all of this will remain within the infrastructure and with the people who are there at present.  The beauty of point-to-points is that they are run by amateurs.  Of course we have a Turf Club presence at meets, and we also have HRI funding, as it spent more than &euro;1 million this year supporting integrity services for point-to-points, but ultimately the scheduling of point-to-point racing and the operation and running of point-to-point racing will remain with hunt clubs and will remain with the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee in terms of its operations.  The only thing that will change, essentially, is the registration fee to register a hunter, as this will come through the new streamlined office which will manage the process.  It is about the process, and not about changing influence, decision making or the people who run the show.  Point-to-point racing is in the legislation because nobody can credibly say point-to-point racing has nothing to do with racing.  Of course there is a difference between race meets at the 26 racetracks around the country and point-to-points.  There is a big difference between them, and this is not some agenda to change the people who influence and make decisions on point-to-points.  There is simply a streamlining of functions around the collection of fees and registration and, of course, ensuring that the horses involved, the owners and the betting that takes place at point-to-point meets are covered by the rules.  We need legislation to do this, particularly when we put public money into point-to-point racing.  I do not see any change in its practical running.  People turning up to point-to-points will see the exact same structure.  For people who breed horses, it will be more or less the exact same structure, except that they will simply send the cheque to a different office, but the money will find its way to the hunt clubs, the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee and the Turf Club.   There has been much inflammatory language about this issue and it is important to establish what the facts are and the intention of the legislation.</p> <p> Comments have been made about the greyhound industry.  The primary focus of this legislation is the horse racing industry and ensuring we have proper modern legislation for it.  There will be a forthcoming greyhound industry Bill, and people will have an opportunity to contribute to it.  We have also had an Indecon report on the greyhound industry, and we have a series of recommendations which we are implementing at present.  Part of this will be new legislation.</p></speech>

It depends on when the boss decides to call the election.  I will happily participate in the legislation, although my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, makes most of the decisions on the greyhound industry.  Changes are needed there and change is under way.  Deputy Wallace has raised questions about this, as have many others.  This is why we had an Indecon report and why we are making significant changes to the industry to put it on a proper financial footing again, so we can start to increase prize money to create incentives to breed and manage dogs appropriately.  It is also why we have welfare legislation, to ensure it is done properly in the interests of the animals as well as the owners and the people involved.</p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised about media rights negotiations.  To speak plainly, in Ireland we have many racecourses in different parts of the country, and we need to find a way to support them all, which is what we are trying to do at present.  Anyone who thinks that if racetracks independently negotiate media rights with media companies they will somehow get a better deal than if they use the power of collective negotiation does not understand how media rights negotiation actually works.</p><p>I have met the representatives of the Association of Irish Racecourses, AIR, and they are happy with the current approach.  That is an organisation representing all the racecourses.  The collective negotiation is to ensure we get the maximum value possible in media rights negotiations.  We then need to ensure that whatever money is raised is spent appropriately among racetracks and in the industry as a whole.  We should not forget that media rights are not just about location because they take in prize money, horses and the people who pay for the horses and bring them to the racetrack.  It is about the public purse providing the prize money for the races.  We are negotiating the entire package.  The racetrack is an important part of that in terms of location and the racecourses do a fantastic job in running racing.</p> <p> My job is to ensure we have a structure in place that allows us to maximise the income we can get for this sector, which includes racecourses, as well as for the industry as a whole in negotiating media rights.  That is what we are trying to do.  The distribution of that money will involve consultation with the chief executive officers of all the racetracks and we have committed to that.  There will be an amendment on Committee Stage to take account of some of the concerns raised and the conversations that have taken place with AIR.  We should wait and see what that is and I hope it will deal with people's concerns.  We will not go backwards and say that racecourses will do their own thing.  As a result, our capacity to negotiate better financial packages for media rights would potentially be undermined.</p> <p> Deputy Daly and one or two others raised welfare issues, both in the thoroughbred sector and sports horse sector.  I have spent much time and public money in the area and through microchipping, passports and an obligation for equine-registered premises as well as a very comprehensive and lengthy animal welfare Bill, we now have the tools to deal in a very comprehensive way with animal cruelty inflicted on horses and other animals.  We intend to enforce those new rules through the legislation, and we are trying to do that.  The number of seizures we had to make this year compared with last year or the year before has fallen dramatically.  This year I will again provide approximately &euro;2 million for local authorities to implement seizures and support programmes.  We put a fund of &euro;1 million in place for urban horse welfare support programmes this year, which is predominantly about trying to encourage the Travelling community to be part of projects with their horses that can put a structure around how and where horses are kept.  I am committed to that and, as it happens, we will not be able to spend all the money because the projects have not materialised</p> <p> Politically, getting agreement on such things is difficult although we are making some good progress outside Kilkenny.  There are potential plans for outside of Cork and other towns and cities.  I would like to see every city in Ireland have an urban horse project on the outskirts that could allow for Traveller teenagers to learn how to look after their horses properly.  There is an incredibly strong bond between the Travelling community and their horses.  I have met Travellers and spoken to them about this.  We would like to facilitate that in a structured way that will look after the welfare of horses as well as respecting the traditional link between horses and the Travelling community.  I am committed to that project, as I stated, but it will take time.  This is not just about the Travelling community either, as I hope many others will be part of that project.</p> <p> Deputy Naughten raised issues of horse breeding programmes, with dealers buying large numbers of horses with a view to selling them either to factories for meat under dubious identification or potentially selling them on at home or abroad because there would have been a market for that.  The market collapsed very quickly following the horsemeat scandal and an awareness that the horse identification processes that were being implemented in Ireland were inadequate.  We have addressed many of those issues and, as a result, the number of horses that need to be seized has fallen dramatically, although seizures are still required.</p> <p> The breeding programmes in the sports horse sector and certainly in horse racing have adapted and reduced the numbers quite significantly.  We have a strategy for the sports horse sector for the next ten years, Reaching New Heights.  It is a very good document put together by Teagasc, the Royal Dublin Society and Horse Sport Ireland.  We have implemented much of that strategy and put public money into it.  It is about supporting welfare initiatives but, more important, more targeted and intelligent breeding of sport horses.</p> <p> There is one comment I do not want to let go.  Deputy Creighton rightly stated that the reputation and rating of Irish sports horses has reduced over the past ten to 15 years.  That is perhaps the case for showjumping although we are now starting to make improvements in the area.  Ireland is number one in the world for eventing in terms of breeding and we are staying there.  Even through the difficult times of the past ten years or so we have managed to maintain that position.</p> <p> I take the points from Deputy Daly about welfare but I am not sure this is the legislation to deal with some of those matters.  We have had very comprehensive welfare legislation coming through the Houses.  The focus will be on implementation and enforcement of that legislation to ensure people will not mistreat animals, whether they are racehorses, sports horses, dogs or whatever.  There is very comprehensive legislation to deal with that.</p> <p> I associate myself with the tributes to Mr. Pat Eddery.  Even for people who are not knowledgeable about racing, he is a household name and a legend of the sport.  I endorse all the warm tributes being paid to him.</p> <p> I will make one or two more points before finishing.  We recently announced a really exciting new development programme for the Curragh.  It will be a &euro;65 million investment programme over the next few years and we hope to have it finished by 2018.  At least half the money for the project will come from private donors or investors.  We have a new model that we created which is a partnership, with a third each coming from the Turf Club, Horse Racing Ireland and private donors.  It will be a really successful and interesting business model, a public private partnership chaired by Mr. Padraig McManus who has done a really solid job on it.  We will get this done.  There will be a planning application done, if not before the end of the year then early in January.  There will be proper consultation with all stakeholders before that happens, and I hope we can bring it through the planning process quickly in order that we can get to building what will be one of the most modern racing facilities anywhere on the planet, matching the best flat race racecourses anywhere in the world with regard to condition of the turf.  People will be very proud of that every time they drive past in the Curragh and go to race meetings.  If ever there was proof that the Government and the State wants to invest in and prioritise an industry and sport, it is evident in what we have seen in increased funding last year and again this year, facilitating projects like that in the Curragh and in many other capital investment projects for racing.</p> <p> To be honest, I had not thought before about Deputy Spring's point but it seems reasonable on many levels.  He has concerns about credit cards being used for betting, whether on racecourses or elsewhere.  It seems reasonable to examine the sense of allowing people to use credit to bet.  Again, it is for betting legislation rather than this Bill, although it is a fair point.</p> <p> I welcome the comments from Deputy Wall who was present at the Curragh.</p><p>To my embarrassment I did not see him in the crowd and I did not recognise him that day.  If he is watching, that was an oversight on my part and I apologise for it.</p> <p> I thank all other Members for their contributions.  We have taken note of them and will try to take them on board.  I will be introducing a couple of amendments on Committee Stage, and if people have sensible amendments, I will take them on board.  I hope I have a track record of doing that.  However, I am not going to be taking on amendments just to be popular with any interest groups.  They have to make sense and be right for this legislation.  I am going to meet the Turf Club and discuss the concerns it still has in respect of the legislation.  Before that we have Committee Stage.  Where it makes sense to do so, we will show some flexibility, but we do not want to undermine the core of this Bill which is about putting a proper legislative foundation in place for the racing industry for the next 20 to 30 years.</p></speech>

I would hazard a guess that if it were the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, he would get out of his sickbed to be here.  It is not that he would not trust anyone else to do it but that he was so much on top of his game.  I did not agree with everything he did and he was not on top of his game in certain areas, but he had a very different approach.  Given that the Government has advertised this almost as a flagship Bill in the area of policing, although we do not agree with that, it is surprising the Minister is not here herself.</p><p>We submitted many amendments but we were pretty shocked at about 12 p.m. today to see that 37 of our amendments were ruled out of order on the basis that they were not discussed on Committee Stage.  We went to the committee initially but the proceedings were not completed on the first day.  They were postponed to another time, which was fixed for 12.30 p.m. on a Tuesday.  Neither I, Deputy Clare Daly, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, Sinn F&eacute;in's justice spokesperson nor the Fianna F&aacute;il justice spokesperson were available to attend, but they insisted on the meeting going ahead anyway.  We had a Technical Group meeting which we had to attend to get speaking time for the week.  On that basis, our 37 amendments have been ruled out of order.  I find this very undemocratic.  If we are to be treated in this way, we will avail of any rules and regulations we can use to enhance our democratic rights on this end.</p><p>The amendment in question relates to section 4 on the security services.  In section 3A(1)(a)(i), as inserted by section 4 of the Bill, regarding &quot;preventing, detecting and investigating offences under the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998&quot;, we are looking to insert &quot;where there is reasonable suspicion&quot; after &quot;preventing&quot;.  There are huge issues around State security.  To look at where we are even before this Bill is enacted, in the current law there is no definition of &quot;State security&quot; in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 because there was not the same need for the distinction since the Garda and the Minister were responsible for both policing and State security.  There is a reference to State security in section 99 of the 2005 Act which restricts GSOC, when investigating a possible offence, from searching any Garda station designated under section 126 and allows the Garda Commissioner to object to any investigation of Garda stations on State security grounds.  The Minister is the final arbiter if there is disagreement between GSOC and the Commissioner in this regard.  There is also a procedure set out in section 100 where a designated High Court judge may refuse the operation of section 99 and any regulations issued under sections 96 and 126, which allow a Garda requested by GSOC to provide a document in connection with a GSOC investigation to refuse to do so on grounds of State security.  The matter is then referred to the Minister for her direction.</p><p>In the new Bill there is a very broad and vague definition of State security, with the Minister self-appointed as the final arbiter.  The new Bill also permits the Minister, arguably unconstitutionally, to decide what is or is not lawful. It states:</p><blockquote>3A.<b></b>(1) In this Act &lsquo;security services&rsquo;, subject to subsection (2), means the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na referred to in section 7 that are concerned with&mdash;<blockquote>(a) protecting the security of the State including, but not limited to, the following:<blockquote>(i) preventing, detecting and investigating offences under the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998, the Criminal Law Act 1976, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 and the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010;<br /><br />(ii) protecting the State from&mdash;<blockquote>(I) espionage,<br /><br />(II) sabotage,<br /><br />(III) unlawful acts that subvert or undermine, or are intended to subvert or undermine, parliamentary democracy or the institutions of the State.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>I point out that &quot;intend&quot; is a very broad term.  These provisions, it is stated, do &quot;not include lawful advocacy, protest or dissent&quot;.  Who decides if it is lawful?  It appears that either the Garda or the Minister in this instance are setting themselves up as judge and jury as to whether something is lawful.  Who decides if something is intended to subvert parliamentary democracy?  The goings on at Shell to Sea, where the local community strongly protested against the actions of Shell and what it was doing to the local environment and the manner in which it went about it, were handled very roughly by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Much has been said about this over the years.  It beggars belief that, despite a great deal of international condemnation, we have never seen a proper independent State investigation into what went on there.  The State could easily argue that it was in the interest of State security that they handled it as they did.  That is very worrying from my perspective.</p><p> It is not an ideal position for State security and policing to be under the control of one body.  I realise that changing it is a significant challenge, but if one looks around the world, it is a rare position.  Some Government - obviously, it will not happen with this Government - will eventually take on the challenge of dividing up State security and policing.  I would be convinced that we will get a more accountable policy operation when we separate them.  Sadly, too often garda&iacute; have hidden behind the notion of State security.  They state they cannot give one something and when asked why, their response is that it is in the interest of State security.  It is interesting that Mr. Conor Brady, a former GSOC commissioner, has highlighted that GSOC has struggled alarmingly to deal with many complaints about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of its use of State security.  I realise we will not get that now but we should, at least when we are discussing this Bill, provide for a little more transparency in how things are done.</p> <p> When there is an argument about whether something should be deemed part of State security, the Minister should not be setting herself up as judge and jury over the matter.  There should be an independent arbiter of some sort, preferably a High Court judge.  In parts of this Bill, Deputy Clare Daly and I have introduced the idea of an ombudsman commission.  We have introduced the idea of GSOC playing a role, in line with a High Court judge, to decide where there is a dispute as to whether a matter is rightfully being considered one of State security.  The idea of leaving it in the hands of the Minister of the day is not the way to handle it.</p> <p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will probably be aware, many of our complaints about how policing is conducted are strongly linked to the fact that policing is excessively politicised in Ireland.  The Government has too much control over the running of the police service and it has led to many problems.</p> <p> When we introduced our policing Bill, both two years ago and a year and a half ago, we were strongly in favour of the idea of a police authority but we had a very different idea of a police authority than what we are getting now.  One of the strong elements running right through our police authority was taking the hands of the Government of the day off policing.  It was also designed to be much more accountable to the people.  It was designed to lead to much greater policing by consent rather than from on high.</p> <p> It is a long Bill, there is a lot to talk about and I will not go on too long on amendment No. 1.  Likewise, on the second amendment, as we are discussing both of them together, in section 3A(1)(a)(ii)(III), under security services, we seek to delete "unlawful acts" and substitute "acts which have been found by a Court to be unlawful, and which".  I have dealt with this issue.  There should be court involvement in deciding what is unlawful and what is not.  When is a protest lawful and when is it not is a decision for the courts?  It is not a decision for a politician.  That is why we would be adamant that both of these amendments are taken seriously and carried.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.685" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100050#YY00200"><p>I echo Deputy Wallace's points.  It is almost exactly a year since the Government published the first heads of a Bill on a policing authority, and while this version is radically different and inferior, the one we got in November of last year was not any great shakes either.  That said, I find it quite shocking that the Government has on more than one occasion lauded this as one of its great achievements in Government.  I also find it quite shocking that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, could not deign to be here when she made what must be her 79th public appearance in welcoming the same-sex referendum result, which obviously everybody is happy about.  We all voted for it so of course we are.  That was a judgment of the people so it is shocking to milk it for the length of time it has been and not have the time to come to the House.</p>  <p>  However, that is less shocking than what happened with the amendments.  To register the point, we all like to work in a spirit of co-operation and even though members of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality stated that they could not attend a meeting to discuss the amendments, that committee went on regardless.  Let us remember that we got a note this morning with the grouping of the amendments tabled on this Bill.  There was no mention of anything being out of order on the first grouping we received but two hours later, after 12 o'clock, another grouping was issued to tell us that a chunk of amendments had been ruled out of order because they were not discussed on Committee Stage, which all the Opposition members made abundantly clear they were not in a position to attend.  When the Government, in putting forward a Bill that is supposed to be delivering transparency and accountability in policing, does it in such an underhand manner, it undermines the Government's argument.  Unfortunately, the Government will pay a heavy price for that because we will insist on our democratic rights on every amendment now being adhered to.  Whereas we might have been more amenable to speed up the passage or whatever, why would any sense of co-operation be given by the Opposition when the Government is so shameful in treating the Opposition in this regard on Committee Stage?</p>  <p>  We are talking about a Bill that is a much more diluted version of what the Government put forward in November of last year.  Deputy Wallace and I were looking at some of the information we put out at the time when we made the point that the legislation then was substantially weaker than Deputy Wallace's Bill which was passed on Second Stage in the House and which the Government allowed to lie derelict.  Deputy Wallace's Bill delivers real Garda accountability and a proper independent Garda authority.  It was put together with major stakeholders such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, the then Irish Human Rights Commission, the Combat Poverty Agency, Social Justice Ireland and all the other organisations, not least of which were the countless people we met throughout the country who have been crying out for and demanding justice in this area because of the difficulties they experienced at the hands of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Critically, it also included members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who found the structure incredibly inadequate in taking forward grievances they had.</p>  <p>  The excuse put forward by the Minister on the previous occasion - I have asked her about this and she has failed to answer it - as the reason she has a watered-down version of what the Government was talking about previously is legal constraints, constitutional issues and the so-called advice of the Attorney General.  When the history books are written about the record of the Government, the role of the Attorney General, Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan, will feature.  She will have at least a chapter or two devoted to her in terms of some of the decisions she has stood over.  With regard to this one, however, we do not know.  We have asked for the publication of that opinion and we have not got it.  The advice on that rings hollow because it does not seem to stack up with the views being put forward by others.  The Government states it had to row back because of the Attorney General's advice, that it would have liked something stronger and more robust but the Constitution does not allow that.  That is not the case.  In fact, most academics believe the Garda Commissioner might be allied to the Executive under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  If the Government is relying on the advice of the Attorney General regarding constitutionality, then it should publish it.</p><p>Let us see it.  It is only advice and her advice has been wrong before.  If the Government thought it was wrong and there was a constitutional restriction on making the Bill better, why did it not call a referendum on it?  The Government held a referendum on the age of the President, which nobody cared about.  Why did it not hold a referendum on this at the same time as the marriage equality referendum?  If the Government was worried about the Constitution, it could have put this to the people, who would not have disappointed.<br/><br/>The sections relate to State security.  As Deputy Wallace said, Ireland's policing service is unique because of the way security comes under these issues.  As he said, the Act contains no definition of State security.  Our problem with the amendments is that the Bill is too broad.  It is setting up the Minister as judge and jury on whether an issue is a matter of national security.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not democratically accountable if, as the Bill proposes, the Minister can say a certain issue is a matter of national security and therefore the authority cannot investigate it.<br/><br/>Deputy Wallace has highlighted the protest actions that could be included.  We saw what happened with the water charges protests this year and the number of citizens who have been arrested for exercising their democratic right to protest.  People have been charged with kidnapping.  It has been ridiculous.  Anybody would see it as lunacy.  It is not acceptable.  The excuse of national security can be used almost without limit based on the way the Government has drafted the Bill.  It is very important to define who decides what is unlawful and to specify that there be reasonable suspicion, not just <i>carte blanche</i>for people to decide.<br/><br/>I would like the Minister of State to comment on the provision proposed in section 3A(1)(a)(ii)(III) that the Garda and the Minister decide whether something is unlawful.  This is almost certainly unconstitutional.  Under the Constitution, only a court can decide whether something is unlawful.  The Bill is subverting parliamentary democracy and seems lunacy.  Under this definition it could include issues such as water charges protests and protests against the installation of water meters.  The Bill provides that the Minister retains full and direct control and the authority has no role in policing issues that arise given that the Minister can turn around and forbid the authority to investigate a matter on the grounds that it is a matter of national security.  It is a major flaw in the legislation.  As Deputy Wallace said, it was highlighted by many people who gave their opinion when the Bill was moved.  It is a major flaw.  We are proposing in amendment No. 3 the establishment of an independent arbiter with recourse to a High Court Judge, for example.<br/><br/>National security is one of the overriding issues in the proposed legislation and we need to consider it.  Some of the organisations that contributed to the discussion proposed other options and the Government could have given them proper consideration.  For example, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, had no difficulty with issues of, say, national security policing being examined by GSOC or overseen by the proposed authority, which we would like, where national security policing impacts on the fundamental rights of individuals.  The authority should also have a liaison role with any Oireachtas committee which has competence for national security policing review, as per the IHREC recommendation.  The IHREC pointed out that it is a requirement of the European Court of Human Rights that we have an independent body to provide oversight on national security policing.  We are discussing a so-called independent Garda authority that does not have independent oversight of national security policing.  Instead, the Government is using this as a fig leaf - a big wall, rather - to hide behind and avoid public scrutiny.<br/><br/>The Government had other options.  Some of the academics who gave up their time and contributed to the process suggested other options.  For example, Dr. Vicky Conway, in her presentation in Farmleigh, proposed two different approaches on security issues.  The Government could have transferred security matters to an alternative agency, as suggested by the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  An alternative was the Probation Board for Northern Ireland, PBNI, approach of removing these matters from the purview of the authority with some exceptional opportunities of review by way of some sort of special-purpose committee.  The protection of judicial oversight in differentiating between policing and security matters, which we are setting out, is the absolute minimum.  Without it, one has nothing.  One is just saying the Minister can decide and that is it.  If this is the case, we might as well wrap up and not have the authority.  As an absolute minimum a High Court Judge is necessary.  This is why we propose the amendments.<br/><br/>That the two are so intertwined in the police service is a key part of the Bill.  If the Government is not prepared to disentangle them, there is nothing unconstitutional that could not provide the Government with giving more accountability in this regard.  It is regrettable.  I have no doubt it will be used.  Deputy Wallace is correct to point to the opinions of people such as Conor Brady, a highly respected former head of GSOC, who identified that the excuse of State security is a major obstacle to GSOC investigations into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have no reason to believe that the situation has improved in the years since he left GSOC.  All evidence would suggest it has deteriorated.  Some of the adjudications GSOC has made of late have further diminished the public&rsquo;s confidence in the organisation&rsquo;s ability to deal with Garda complaints and hold garda&iacute; to account.  If we have a problem with national security being used in one Garda accountability body, to establish a policing authority and allow final decisions on what it can and cannot investigate at the door of the Minister is political policing and political interference.  It is not delivering genuine Garda accountability and is not the way forward. The Government would be better off doing nothing than going down that road.</p></speech>

Determining whether amendments are allowed is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and he made his ruling.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, is attending the summit on the migration crisis in Valletta.  During the past year, it has been the most pressing issue for politicians across our Continent.  Everybody should respect the importance of the Minister attending meetings such as this, as well as the Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings which she attends.  It is essential that Ireland be represented and that we show solidarity with member states that are having a very difficult time dealing with an enormous humanitarian crisis for those who have the misfortune to find themselves in it.  The Minister would, if she could, prefer to be here to participate in this Report Stage debate, which I am happy to do on her behalf.</p>  <p>  Section 4 inserts into the principal Act a new section 3A which provides a definition of "security services".  We had a discussion about the reality of policing and security being functions for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at present.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner will report to the authority on policing matters and will be fully accountable to the Government for security services.  That will continue to be the case.  The definition encompasses, among other matters, functions linked to offences under existing legislation, including offences under the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998 and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  It also encompasses functions linked to espionage and sabotage.  The definition does not expand existing Garda powers in the field of security and a specific exclusion is provided for lawful advocacy, protest or dissent.  Such matters were referred to by Deputy Wallace in his contribution.</p> <p> Amendment No. 1 seeks to qualify the security function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a manner that would limit the definition of that function to a situation in which there is a "reasonable suspicion" of a threat to national security.  If this amendment is applied to the substantive security powers of the Garda, it will impede the ability of our security services - our garda&iacute; - to take proactive measures to prevent threats to national security.</p> <p> Amendment No. 2 seeks to restrict the meaning of "unlawful acts" that subvert or undermine parliamentary democracy or the institutions of the State.  As the Deputy has said, he wants this provision to relate solely to "acts which have been found by a Court to be unlawful".  If this amendment is applied to the substantive security powers of the Garda, it will turn the criminal justice process on its head because it will mean that a court decision as opposed to statute law, for example, needs to be in place before the security services can take action to protect the State from acts that are about to happen and about which it is concerned.</p> <p> As I have said, the proposed new section 3A does not expand the existing Garda powers in the field of security.  In that context, it is not a substantive provision which can be relied upon by garda&iacute; for the purpose of the exercise of their security functions.  The substantive provisions for that purpose are found in the legislation that is listed in the proposed section 3A.  The purpose of this section is purely to delineate which functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be overseen by the Minister and the Government and which of them will be overseen by the policing authority.  In these circumstances, the Minister cannot accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</p></speech>

The Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality asked us if we would be able to get to the meeting.  We said it was not possible.  I am sure Deputy Mac Lochlainn of Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Niall Collins were asked as well.  None of us could go, so I do not know why the committee bothered asking us.  I should point out that this is not the first Bill the Minister has missed.  While I have no problem with her going to Malta, I suggest that if the Government is seriously concerned about refugees, the first thing it should do is stop allowing Shannon Airport to be used by the US military as an airbase from which to destroy communities worldwide.  I remind the House that 2.1 million citizens have been killed by US military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001.  Many of the troops who killed those people and many of the munitions that were used to kill them came through Shannon Airport or through Irish airspace.  It is the height of hypocrisy for us to say we care about the refugees if we continue to allow Shannon Airport to be used as a US military airbase.  Some 33 million people have been displaced by the wars-----</p></speech>

We are talking about the structure of a police authority that we are establishing.  The thinking behind the establishment of this body was that it would be able to make decisions and help to stop people from accusing the Government from having its paws all over policing.  Deputy Shatter would still be in his former position as Minister for Justice and Equality if different legislation had been in place to prevent him from having his paws all over policing.  The idea of providing for a police authority is to do away with the previous approach by creating a buffer.  However, this is not the buffer we envisaged.  In the form the Government is proposing it at the moment, it is only a pup.  We need a police authority that has real authority and some independence from the control of the Government.  We are not getting that.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, was not in Valletta yesterday.  She was having another press conference on the same-sex referendum.  If the Minister's problem was that she had to attend the Valletta summit, we could have discussed this Bill yesterday.  That is a very important point.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State did not respond to what I said about the Attorney General's opinion, which I would like to see given that it is the Government's official justification for watering down this Bill.  The essence of what is proposed in this Bill, as it will stand if our amendments are not adopted, is a continuance of Government control over policing.  The effect of allowing for the possibility that State security considerations will be used to block the new Garda authority will be to deny the authority the right to oversee events.</p>  <p>  I do not agree with the Minister of State's ludicrous suggestion that our proposal to include the words "reasonable suspicion" would prevent garda&iacute; or anybody else from being proactive regarding these matters.  One would imagine that if garda&iacute; are investigating people for issues, they would have reasonable suspicion and would not be merely fishing or surfing for information on spec.  As far as I am concerned, the importance of privacy and civil rights means they should not be proactive unless it is based on reasonable suspicion.  The key point we are making about the word "unlawful" is that under our Constitution, something is deemed to be unlawful or otherwise if the courts deem it to be so.  The way this legislation has been framed by the Minister is that it will give the Minister the power to interpret whether something is lawful.  This is outside the Minister's constitutional provision and is outside the way our Constitution works with regard to the separation of powers between the Oireachtas, the Government and the courts.  We are trying to limit some of the restrictions being proposed by the Government.  The aim of our eminently reasonable amendments is to deliver greater accountability.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State has not responded to many of the points we have put forward.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, presided over the first sitting.  The Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, presided over the second sitting which was unfortunately and disappointingly scheduled at a time and date when it could not be attended by any of the Opposition justice spokespeople who take questions.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, did not attend either meeting and she is absent again today.  It is outrageous that the Minister for Justice and Equality has missed two separate Committee Stage sittings and today's Report Stage debate.  It shows a complete disrespect for the Opposition.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, when I say that.  I appreciate that he is doing his job.  This is supposedly a major Bill for the Government.  It certainly should be a major Bill for the people.  We did not have the Minister for Justice and Equality for Committee Stage and now we do not have her for Report Stage.  I want to put it on the record that it is outrageous that this has happened.</p>  <p>  I am very disappointed that our amendments have been ruled out of order.  I do not tend to get into quarrels with the Bills Office which is very professional.  I am disappointed because all the Opposition spokespeople attended the first day of Committee Stage debate and tabled many amendments.  When the Committee Stage proceedings went into a second day, the meeting was scheduled at a time and date that did not suit any of the Opposition Deputies for what I hope are very understandable reasons.  Deputy Wallace and I were led to believe that because we had discussed our interlinked amendments in such detail on the day, there was an understanding that the amendments we could not discuss during the second half of the Committee Stage debate would be accepted.  As Opposition Deputies, we are having to deal with the failure of the Minister for Justice and Equality to show up for two separate days of Committee Stage debate and for today's Report Stage debate.  We are now being asked to accept the decision to rule half of our amendments out of order as a result of the scheduling of one of the days of Committee Stage debate at a time and date when we could not be present.</p><p>The Opposition has been treated pretty badly here.  I would like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to facilitate me by ensuring every word I have just said and every word the two other Deputies have said is taken on board by the Ceann Comhairle's office and considered as a complaint about what has taken place here.</p></speech>

It is a crisis that has come upon the European Union over the period she has been in office.  She is an extremely hard-working Minister who would be here under normal circumstances but we are not living in normal times.  It is the job of the Justice Ministers from all member states to attend these meetings to assist the countries of origin, the people who are migrating and the front-line destination states which are in a very difficult position.</p>  <p>  I accept the points made by the Deputies but I am not aware of the specific details around the committee itself.  I know the committee meeting took place during D&aacute;il sitting times, during the hours that were allocated.  Week in and week out, in order for these Houses to conduct their business, Government parties have substituted and Deputies have asked other party members to be in attendance at committee meetings in their place.  I know that the facility to nominate others to deputise at committee meetings exists.  It is a matter to discuss with the Chairman of the committee.  I attended at the first Committee Stage round but was not present for the second round.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Clare Daly, she will be aware that the Attorney General's advice is never published.  I know that Deputy Daly tabled a parliamentary question on that issue but the Minister is not accountable to the House with regard to advice given by the Attorney General.  Our Attorney General has done and continues to do an excellent job during a period in which there has been a remarkable amount of legislation in development.  Her advice is very much cherished and valued by Cabinet and by the Government.  I have no doubt she will continue to give that exemplary professional advice to the Government in the same fashion as she has done to date.</p></speech>

No one is saying that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be allowed to act on the spot.  It is a matter of whether something is deemed to be an issue of State security.  More often than not, decisions that are made are not necessarily made in the heat of the moment.  Often such decisions are contemplated in advance.  When GSOC, for example, looks for information or wants to check a Garda barracks, the Garda Commissioner is able to say it is a matter of State security and that she cannot let GSOC in to search that barracks.  That is not a spur of the moment action; that is contemplated.  There have been many instances where decisions could be made by an independent body like the policing authority on whether an issue should be deemed to be a matter of national security.  As long as the Government decides what constitutes a matter of State security, we will never be happy with how this is dealt with and we will certainly be pressing our amendments.</p></speech>

In any event, amendment No. 3 seeks to substitute in section 3A &quot;the Ombudsman Commission&quot; for &quot;Minister&quot; and to provide that the Ombudsman Commission will consult a designated judge of the High Court who will act as an independent arbiter.  We have partially touched on this principle already.  The amendment is intended to prevent the excuse of national security being invoked by the Minister to prevent a full investigation by GSOC.  The legislation as drafted proposes to set the Minister as the final arbiter where there is a disagreement over whether an issue is considered a policing or a security issue.  The Minister could be self-interested in such a categorisation and it is illogical to consider that a safeguard of any sort.</p><p>Despite the statement by Josephine Feehily, who is to be chair of the policing authority, that the demarcation between policing and security was something to be tested, no appeal to the courts is provided for.  There is no way to test it and the Minister has the final say.  Decisions on national security and policing should be dealt with by an alternative body such as GSOC and overseen by an independent arbiter such as a High Court judge.  We suggested GSOC as the relevant body so that the amendment would not be disallowed.  If we had suggested some other new body, our amendment would have been thrown out on the basis that it was going to cost the Exchequer money, God forbid.  We would not like to do that.  Although it is GSOC that is referred to, it is our belief that some independent body should be involved in the process.</p><p> Our policing Bill would have allowed the Minister a say in the decision on whether something should be deemed a matter of national security.  It would also have given the policing authority a say.  If they could not agree, a judge would have become involved.  That is not the case with this Bill, under which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister are the final arbiters and there is no independent decision maker.</p> <p> The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, stated that it had no problem with issues of national security policing being examined by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, or overseen by the proposed authority.  The protection of judicial oversight in differentiating between policing and security matters is the absolute minimum that is acceptable.  All such matters should be decided by a High Court judge, as simply providing for judicial oversight can mean rubber-stamping and a one-day annual review of sample categorisations, which we have encountered a number of times in terms of surveillance, for example, garda&iacute; giving themselves permits to bug vehicles, etc.  Instead of going to court to get an order to initiate surveillance, a garda can get a senior officer's permission.  Such transactions are supposed to be examined at the end of the year by a judge but he or she only rubber-stamps them after examining all of them in one day, having travelled to a number of places in the city to do so.  It is not a serious exercise.  We recommend more oversight and independent decision making.</p></speech>

That is a consequence of the manner in which the issue was handled this morning.  We will operate off the initial grouping.</p>  <p>  We are discussing an attempt to move away from the Minister being the final arbiter in these matters.  The idea that the demarcation between policing and security is unclear but can be tested is not good enough.  There is no appeal to the courts and no way to test it.  Under the Bill, the Minister will have the final say.  We want to insert a buffer at least.  I am not overawed by High Court judges and they are not necessarily the be all and end all in deciding these matters, but they are a step removed from the Oireachtas and there is an independence around them.  With the Government not breaking the political link in the Bill, we believe that this is the best way to deal with the issue.</p>  <p>  This relates to the point on State security, which is not defined in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  In certain cases where GSOC wanted to investigate matters but the Garda authorities or the Garda Commissioner objected to that on grounds of national security, the Minister was the final arbiter in the disagreement.  A procedure is in place under section 100 of the Act, in that a designated High Court judge can, at GSOC's request, review the operation of section 99 and any regulation issued under sections 96 and 126, which allow a garda who is requested by GSOC to provide a document in connection with a GSOC investigation to refuse on grounds of national security.  At that point, the matter is referred to the Minister for a direction.  If the matter does not relate to State security, GSOC can appeal to the Circuit Court for a direction.  From my parliamentary questions, I know that GSOC has not applied to the Circuit Court on any of these issues.  The Government appointed a judge to administer this system, but that was only last February, which is surprising.</p>  <p>  No applications on matters that cited State security have been made in the lifetime of this Government.  This fact could be viewed in two ways.  On one hand, is it not grand that the provision has never been invoked and there has never been an attempt to hide behind national security and, as such, what are we worried about?  On the other, what is the problem with accepting our amendment?  We should always err on the side of being human rights compliant, open and transparent.  We must view this issue in the context of what we are discussing.  The Bill is supposed to deliver accountability and transparency to the Garda, but it does not break the political link if the Minister can object.</p>  <p>  Our amendment No. 3 is not the best thing ever, and we did not draft the provision this way when we tabled our Bill, but it at least provides the protection of judicial oversight in this matter.  It is preferable in that regard.</p></speech>

I am very alarmed.  When the Minister was in attendance at an event organised by the Law Society and the IHREC, Mr. Conor Brady, a former member of GSOC, made the sensible proposal that wherever something was deemed to be a matter of State security by the Garda when the police authority or GSOC requested information, a way to separate politics from policing, which is what this Bill is supposedly about, and have an independent adjudication would be to have a member of the Judiciary appointed by the Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham, decide on whether it really was a matter of State security.  The Bill defines "State security", thereby providing the independent member of the Judiciary a legislative footing to decide whether the concern put forward by the Garda Commissioner was valid.</p>  <p>  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government will not accept a sensible proposal like Mr. Brady's.  I spoke to the Minister briefly as we left the Chamber and I told her that Mr. Brady's suggestion was excellent.  She did not disagree but someone in the Department of Justice and Equality got a hold of the proposal and said, "Ho ho ho".  That is what has happened with this Bill.  Departmental officials have decided that they must retain their historical control over policing.  The Government will put in place a new policing board, titled "Independent Policing Authority", to oversee policing, but the Government will still retain control over the meaty policing issues.  That is disappointing.</p>  <p>  Respected experts on policing in the State, for example, Mr. Brady and Dr. Vicky Conway, were invited by the Department of Justice and Equality, the Law Society and the IHREC to attend the event to which I referred.  They gave their opinions but have been ignored by the Department.  It is a large, historically conservative Department that has influenced the Minister to make these decisions.  That is why votes are being called.  This is big stuff.  The Bill is a missed opportunity.  The Government is undermining the independence of the authority from the get-go.  Our party voted to support the Bill on Second Stage in good faith, expecting amendments to be made on Committee and Report Stages.  Over the two days that we sat on Committee Stage, the Minister was not present.  On Report Stage today, she again was not present.</p><p> The Government controls the sittings, not us.  It is the Minister's choice not to be present.  Unfortunately, as the Bill stands, and considering the Minister is not even present to hear the arguments we are making on it, we will be voting against it at the end of Report Stage.  This is very much regretted.</p></speech>

The OECD stated recently in a report that in 2013, after Greece, Ireland's expenditure on health declined most out of all 33 members.  Between 2005 and 2009, Ireland was increasing the amount it spent on health care at an average rate of 5.3% per annum.  However, from 2009 to 2013 the rate of increase decreased by 9.3 percentage points to -4%.  In total, the 33 OECD countries spent &euro;737 billion on drugs in 2013.  The Irish bill was the seventh highest, with &euro;600 million spent on over-the-counter and prescribed medicines in 2013.  In 2014, the European Commission called on Ireland to spend less on patent medicines after a report found that the amount of public moneys being spent on drugs was well above the EU average.  The drug companies have been tackled and some concessions have been granted on prices, but the statistics show that a more aggressive approach will have to be taken by the Minister to put prices on par with those in the United Kingdom and other EU countries.</p>  <p>  There are some astounding figures pertaining to patients on the outpatient waiting list.  Over 404,000 are currently on that list.  Some 68,000 are waiting for inpatient or day case treatment.  These are the up-to-date figures.  The problem is rampant and I ask that it be addressed.  The Minister is trying to address it by outsourcing over 20,000 appointments to the private sector.  However, to be fair, these are astronomical figures, and it is inexcusable that they have been allowed to escalate to this level.</p></speech>

A man called George McAnaspie stood up and said that when his wife Mary had gone to Wexford General Hospital in December 2014 with pneumonia, she had waited 12 hours in the accident and emergency department before being told it would be another four hours before she could be seen.  The couple missed their bus back to Ferns.  Mary was too sick to wait any longer in the accident and emergency unit and left to go to her sister's house.  The couple went to Florida a few weeks later in December to see their children and Mary collapsed with heart failure.  She had a triple heart bypass operation in America, followed by an operation to install a pacemaker a few days later.  Pneumonia resurfaced three weeks ago on 15 October and Mary ended up having to spend ten days in Wexford General Hospital with congestive heart failure and pneumonia.  At that time, her husband received letters stating their medical cards were under review.  He sent off two letters outlining the details of Mary's condition.  He arrived home to find two GP visit cards in the post.  He went to the pharmacy to buy monthly medication and was informed that the medical cards had been stopped while under review and replaced with GP visit cards, which cannot be used to purchase medication.  Mary's medication costs between &euro;500 and &euro;600 every month and the couple cannot afford it.  The medical card application is currently under review and the couple expects a decision in the next week or so.  I do not need to add very much other than the fact that the HSE is seriously dysfunctional and may be beyond repair.</p></speech>

Accident and emergency units around the country are chronic at the moment.  I am not saying it is not a question of money but I firmly believe it is a question of organisational skills.  There has to be a full root-and-branch analysis of what is being done.  In response to any letter representing a person in need of a hip replacement, a Deputy gets the same waffle back.  It is stated that if the person deteriorates, he should go to his doctor, and that if it gets worse the Deputy should contact the HSE.  It would be better off if the officials wrote, "Leave him in pain".  It is as simple as that; that is what they are saying to us.</p>  <p>  There is a three-year waiting list for orthodontic treatment for young children.  That is the reality of what we are dealing with.  With regard to hearing and eyesight tests, there is a state of disarray.  Two children in my constituency need a spinal operation but nobody is listening to them or examining them.  With regard to trolleys, the service is in chaos.  The hospitals in Ballinasloe and Galway have patients out the door.</p>  <p>  We have to start with a root-and-branch analysis of the health service.  When we train a doctor, are we to let him or her go to Australia or not?  If &euro;500,000 is spent on training a doctor, are we to say to him or her, "Away with you and good luck to you".  Should there be no patriotism or payback to one's country?</p>  <p>  Why do we not consider the circumstances of general practitioners?  Their representatives were in last week.  A general practitioner could take over a rural practice at present but would not get the rural allowance.  There should be a full analysis of where we are going in the health service.</p>  <p>  For Deputies, what is happening is frustrating and disgusting.  I am sick to the teeth of getting back lovely one-liners stating that the Minister is not responsible for the issue raised.  When one writes to the Minister highlighting an issue, one is told the HSE is responsible.  When one writes to the HSE, one gets another letter in response.  I am sick of seeing the names of the same people writing the same stuff in response.  All one has to do is put a name at the bottom, and the same words come in every letter.  That is disgusting.  We are going nowhere.</p>  <p>  Someone has to start calling the shots.  As I stated, I do not believe it is a question of money.  We are putting layers of bureaucracy in place.  I heard of a case where there was a problem but, instead of solving it, we added another layer of management.  Front-line staff are not being put on the ground.  If this continues, we will see chaotic scenes in the hospitals around the country in January of next year.  No one wants to see that.</p></speech>

This motion is calling for a period of six hours, yet the Government cannot even accept that.  What does that say about this Government?  The reality is that, under its stewardship, we have seen a massive erosion of our health service.  The drug payment scheme threshold has been increased by 37% and prescription charges have been increased fivefold.  Some 600,000 home help hours have been cut.  Home help is the very measure that could keep people out of accident and emergency units.  The disability and carer's allowances have been cut, student nurses' pay has been butchered and so on.</p>  <p>  In reality, the Government has made our public health system so unworkable and inefficient that people are being forced into private care.  That is exactly the scenario that was highlighted by Gene Kerrigan on Sunday when he referred to when the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was Minister for Health.  The latter explained at that time that he could not deliver a first-class public health service because, if he did, there would be no reason for sustaining a private system.  The implication was that a hospital is not just a place where medics seek to preserve and repair our bodies and minds; it is an investment opportunity.</p><p>Chartered accountants JPA Brenson Lawlor boasted recently in a piece entitled &quot;A lovely, simple business plan idea about a fabulous investment in old people&quot; that it was an investment opportunity.  It stated:</p><blockquote>What about a nursing home investment that yields 15%?  Lets look through the check list.  There is demand for thousands of new nursing home spaces - check.  The Irish population is ageing, guaranteeing a continuing long-term and rising level of occupancy - check.  The country has a huge and continuing problem with hospital over-crowding, new nursing homes can fix that.  We look at what you can get from a government bond versus what return you'd get from running a nursing home business.  Come, talk to us; come along.</blockquote><p>That is what we are talking about - rationing our health service and profiting from the misery of citizens.  All the research and information shows that a single-tier public health service is by far the best for people's health and wealth and for the wealth and well-being of the nation.  It is a disgrace.</p></speech>

Health is possibly one of the most important matters we can discuss in the House.  While we discuss many important things, as the saying goes, "Your health is your wealth".  Providing adequate support and funding to those who deliver services within our health system is equally important.</p>  <p>  I am not sure the Opposition, including Fianna F&aacute;il, have much room to criticise when it comes to a debate on our accident and emergency departments or any aspect of health.  Their track record speaks for itself.  The Minister for Health will be in the Chamber later and I do not envy his position.  Since coming into Government, the health system has been a very difficult issue to deal with.  We were handed something of a poison chalice.  I am not talking about those delivering the services, but we have had a dysfunctional system for some time.  While we do not want to see a cut in funding, for years money was pumped into the HSE and yet I do not believe the service then was superior to what we have now.  It is certainly not perfect but huge strides have been made and many decisions have been taken to try to tackle the problems we face.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for Health for visiting Navan hospital recently and clarifying, yet again, that Navan accident and emergency department is not closing, despite what many scaremongers are saying.  I thank the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Reilly, for listening to my concerns and those of many of my colleagues as well as the various unions and organisations representing hospital staff, including nurses and doctors.  The Minister has tried to implement what has been asked of him.  He has tried to allocate more funding when and where it is needed.</p>  <p>  Without a shadow of a doubt in many areas we are starting to see where this is working.  We are starting to see definite improvements with &euro;117 million in additional funding being allocated to reduce overcrowding.  As a result, we are seeing a reduction in delayed discharges while the fair deal waiting time has also been reduced.  More than 220 beds are freed up every day and we can see additional improvements in areas that I could list.</p>  <p>  The Minister said there are still too many people waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.  One of the biggest challenges we face is at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is not in my constituency but serves many people in my area.  One of the biggest problems there is staff recruitment.  On my local radio station I regularly discuss the health system, including accident and emergency departments.  Every time I go on air I am asked what the Minister has done to try to address the problem since I was last interviewed on the station.  In fairness, every time I have been on the radio I have been able to list a number of things and I have noticed the uptake in staff.  Specifically for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the INMO, the Department and the Minister agreed a series of provisions whereby additional beds were to be opened up, staff were to receive full pay and additional staff were to be taken on.  After a number of months, a small fraction of that staff had been taken on.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, however, we have a double-edged sword here.  We are constantly listening to reports about the desperate conditions hospitals are in, the overcrowding, unhappy staff and trolley lists.  It is endless.  If I were a young graduate leaving college, I would not want to work in that situation.  The Minister, the media and everybody else needs to be more positive and needs to encourage people to come into our health system.  If so, it would go a long way.</p></speech>

The Government is fixing the health service.  It is extraordinary and a bit of a groundhog day when one reads the motion from the Members opposite.  When Deputy Martin was Minister for Health, they ran out of Government and out of the Department.  We should contrast his tenure in the Department of Health with what is happening today.  The Government is fixing our health system despite enormous financial constraints.</p>  <p>  We have had wide-ranging reform, including free GP care for older and younger people, and have delivered on a commitment to universal health care.  In addition, we are moving chronic disease management of asthma and diabetes into a primary care setting.  We are also working to improve patient safety while easing hospital overcrowding and reducing waiting times for public patients.  Deputy McEntee referred to early discharges and delays being reduced in the fair deal nursing home support scheme.  This is being done at a time when the population is increasing and ageing.  We must press ahead with reforms and plan for the future, including a growing number of elderly in the population.  The motion before us offers no roadmap in terms of a Fianna F&aacute;il health strategy other than saying it will oppose the Government.</p>  <p>  We are committed to delivering the new national children's hospital.  In Cork city, we have seen the new mental health unit opened this year.  For many decades, mental health was the Cinderella of the health service but it is now being given the opportunity to take centre stage in a new unit in Cork University Hospital.  We must examine how we can deliver better governance and the hospital group will provide us with that opportunity.  We need to bring about improvements in emergency response times in hospitals, but to that end we require a societal and attitudinal shift.  In many cases, our first port of call is the accident and emergency department when it should not be.</p>  <p>  People have a simple approach to the Fianna F&aacute;il mantra on health.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Martin, commissioned 191 reports at a cost of &euro;16 million to the Exchequer.  He promised a lot but delivered very little, which illustrates the base they are coming from.  Our health budget has been restored and more staff are being recruited.  We have a journey to go in terms of how we can deliver real and tangible reform to reduce accident and emergency waiting lists.  We must try to bring about better outcomes for patients, with patient safety being at the very heart of what we do.</p></speech>

One side is saying what they have done and aspire to do while the other says we have not done enough and they did better when in government.  I grew up in a medical household where my mother was a nurse and my father was a doctor.  They would often say they were not expert enough to solve the medical problems that exist in society, although they had ideas about it.  The real essence of it exists within the HSE, including hospital managers and consultants.  I would not condemn anybody for commissioning reports but there are enough reports to choke a herd of donkeys.</p>  <p>  The sentiment from all sides is appropriate.  We are trying to improve the health service and give our view of what is going on in our localities.  It is particularly relevant for me at the moment as Kerry General Hospital had a report issued yesterday concerning infectious threats.  It was a HIQA report dated 8 July.  The Minister of State has heard me speak about the need to safeguard Kerry General Hospital, but we need a capital infrastructure plan for our hospitals.  We hear about plans to upgrade facilities that are more than 100 years old, which is ridiculous in a modern society.  We will have an increasing number of health problems so we need to invest more money in the health service, but we also need to start looking after our own health a bit more as well.</p>  <p>  In the event that 30 year old hospitals have had no capital infrastructure and there is a threat of diseases, as highlighted by HIQA reports, it is imperative for the Minister of State to look at the likes of Kerry General Hospital.</p><p>That hospital serves not only Kerry but west Cork and west Limerick as well.  We need to copperfasten the integrity of such hospitals.  They do not lose VHI patients to other private hospitals or lose public sector patients.  They do not lose surgeons who want to come to places to develop their skills.  The sentiment is right.  It is about trying to find funds and ensure the goodwill is implemented by experts.</p></speech>

During that time the stock response was to throw additional financial resources at the problem.  That did not solve the problem then and it will not solve the problem now.  That appears to be the stock policy response of Fianna F&aacute;il not only in health but across a range of Departments.</p>  <p>  I am keen to raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, the matter of care of the elderly.  I welcome in particular the announcement recently of funding to improve HSE-controlled community hospital beds which are currently non-HIQA compliant.  I am familiar with these cases because there is one in my home town of Macroom.  There is a community hospital which is held in high regard locally, along with other community hospitals in Kanturk and Millstreet.  These are part and parcel of the local community.  The bar has been raised by HIQA, which is only right and proper, and we need to catch up.  I am pleased a deal has been brokered.  We need to be careful, however, about retaining the appropriate balance between HSE-controlled bed numbers for care of the elderly and beds controlled by private nursing homes.  If we put the overwhelming majority of eggs in one basket and rely on private nursing homes to provide beds for public patients, ultimately we will be hostages to fortune and we will be asked to pay increasingly high prices for those beds.</p>  <p>  In meeting new HIQA standards we should avail of the opportunity to bring change.  Officials in the hospital in Macroom have appointed a design team to examine the hospital facilities to see how it can meet HIQA compliance while retaining current bed numbers.  However, we should be more ambitious.  Although we may not currently have the finances available, we should examine the campuses to establish how we can double or triple the number of beds available.  In the long term this would ensure we can maintain the appropriate balance.  It was the case that the cost ratio between those beds under HSE control and those in the private sector were out of line in so far as the private sector was providing more cost efficiency.  However, this is an opportunity to address the matter by increasing bed numbers and thereby reducing the overall cost per patient.  It is right and proper that HIQA standards should be met.  People are living longer and we will need more beds.</p>  <p>  There is a problem in the old Southern Health Board area of Cork and Kerry relating to home help.  Rightly, much of the effort goes into ensuring those in acute hospital beds are discharged appropriately.  They are, however, commandeering home help hours at the expense of those in the community.  This, in turn, is having the knock-on effect of driving people in the community into nursing homes.  We need to consider that as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I too wish to raise the issue of care of the elderly with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, since she is in the Chamber.  I echo Deputy Creed's points on the HIQA standards, which are important.  It is important that the standards are met.  I welcome that there is a serious conversation under way and the possibility of funding for the provision of new publicly-controlled beds for geriatric patients in future.</p>  <p>  In my part of the world, Thomastown in County Kilkenny, St. Columba's Hospital is a fantastic facility with almost 90 beds.  The number has reduced from more than 100 beds some time back because of these self-same HIQA standards but it is an outstanding facility.  It is public and it is particularly renowned for its rehabilitation services.  It is important that the facility be maintained in future.  The same applies to Castlecomber District Hospital.</p>  <p>  Yesterday evening I tuned in to the start of this discussion when Deputy Kelleher moved the motion.  Deputy Keaveney was the second speaker.  He took my name in vain, so to speak, in reference to a previous discussion on the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, which we discussed in the House recently.  He spoke about the difference between those in Fianna F&aacute;il and the rest of us in terms of their aspiration for social spending.  He managed to misquote and mis-reference me several times, but finally he offered the correct quote.  What I said was that the economy and taxation need to be central to the major discussion that will take place in any election.  In the previous discussion, and again last night, Deputy Keaveney gave the impression that funding for public services can simply fall out of the sky.  Unless we have an economy that functions properly and a taxation system that is efficient, the funding for public services will not materialise.</p>  <p>  Deputy Keaveney's views are echoed in the motion from Fianna F&aacute;il.  They have learned nothing from the cliff they drove the country off seven or eight years ago in terms of the economy.  Everything we discuss in terms of public expenditure is contingent on the fact that we have a functioning economy.  Thankfully, that is what we have again.  We also have the Exchequer in a healthy position.  For the first time in seven or eight years it is substantially in that position now.</p></speech>

When I was doing my research I discovered there has been a Private Members' business motion on this issue every year since 2004.  We know who was in charge in 2004.  It is a damning indictment of many different people and bodies that we are still in this situation today and that we continue to have a discussion on the matter in October, November or January of any given year.</p>  <p>  We can consider  this in three different ways.  First, why are people ending up in accident and emergency units?  Second, why are they staying there for so long?  Third, why are people not leaving accident and emergency departments more quickly?  We need to take practical steps.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State and the Department will be well aware of the question of primary care centres and getting more people treated in them before they get to accident and emergency departments.  There is major concern, particularly among rural general practitioners at the moment.  I offer one example from Galway.  A GP there contacted me and said he had treated a young man who required seven sutures in his leg.  This took 12 minutes in the doctor's surgery.  It was a bad laceration.  The patient also required an anti-tetanus injection.  For this, the doctor received &euro;28 from the Government.  The materials in this case cost &euro;19, giving the doctor an after-tax income for this work of &euro;3.90.  I also understand from many GPs operating in rural areas that making house calls to elderly patients is no longer an option because of the time such calls take and the remuneration involved.  Instead, those patients are being referred to accident and emergency departments.  This involves ambulance calls, trips across the country and long waits on trolleys in overcrowded accident and emergency units.</p>  <p>  We need to consider the type of patients who are coming into our accident and emergency departments.  A particular point has come to my attention.  I have been contacted by a number of people on the matter.  This relates to cancer sufferers.  We know these people are going through a serious time in their lives.  They go to accident and emergency departments for routine treatment.  The doctors know what they need to do to help to make these patients better, yet they are still waiting in the same queue as other people in accident and emergency departments, thus taking up time available to doctors.  Let us consider the case of University Hospital Galway, for example.  The doctors there know why those patients are there.  Those who present could be put into another area where they could get the treatment they need.  In that way they would not take up places in accident and emergency departments.  Cancer sufferers should not be in accident and emergency departments during the course of their medication given the nature of their immune systems.  Moreover, there is no point in their taking up space in this way.</p>  <p>  I was contacted by a nursing home today.  The person concerned said that in recent weeks he has contacted a number of hospitals to say the nursing home has between ten and 14 beds available all the time and that he would help in any way possible.  I am not suggesting for a moment that everyone who is in a hospital could go to a nursing home, but I have no doubt some could.  The person did not even get a call-back.  Between ten and 14 beds were free in the system.  The person from the nursing home wondered what needs to happen for hospitals to be able to move patients to nursing homes that can supply the beds for them.  If there was more co-operation between the relevant hospitals, particularly those suffering from overcrowded accident and emergency departments, and those who have beds in the community, we could make progress.  In that way, patients could be moved out of our hospitals much sooner than is the case at present.</p><p>I welcome what has happened regarding the fair deal scheme.  There are many people willing to provide help, particularly those in the nursing home sector, and they need a lot more co-operation than they are currently getting.</p></speech>

It was a real eye-opener for me and those in attendance.  Almost everyone present at the meeting had a loved one living with dementia or was coming to terms with its effects.  The simple but strong message that every single person made to me was the wish to remain independent and live at home.  Almost 48,000 people are living with dementia in Ireland and the majority of them do not want to go to hospitals.  Rather, they want to live in their own homes and do not want to have to line up in our emergency departments.</p>  <p>  We have been very fortunate to have had in D&uacute;n Laoghaire a Living Well With Dementia project in Stillorgan and Blackrock.  It was headed by Eilis Hession and her professional team and was half-funded by the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The project lasted for a number of years and raised awareness of dementia.  More important, it also provided support for the person with dementia and his or her carer.  This model is advocated by the Alzheimer Society and it helps people with dementia to remain in their homes for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  Many cases of people who arrive into our emergency departments can be avoided through long-term planning and investment.  We need to focus investment on community long-term care and give a renewed emphasis to implementing the national positive ageing strategy which was launched in 2013.  I urge the Minister of State to prioritise making staying at home the first option for people living with dementia and the elderly.  </p>  <p>  I must also mention briefly the ongoing difficulties we have experienced with nursing registration.  I raised this matter with the Minister of State several times, including at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, and I am pleased that steps have been taken, but more needs to be done.  We cannot simply have a backlog of nurses caught in red tape when people are waiting on trolleys.</p></speech>

Many of the aspirations of these groups conflict with one another, which leads to major challenges for those who are trying to manage our health services.  On top of that, the recent health Ireland survey, published by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, shows the problems we continue to store up for our health services.  </p>  <p>  We still have significant problems with drug and alcohol abuse, obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.  We need to focus on decreasing the health and financial impact of these diseases.  They are problems about which we can do something, and we need to redouble our efforts to sort them out because they are storing up major costs for individuals, families and our health service.  It is something that will overwhelm our health service.  </p>  <p>  Many people come into the Chamber and talk about the NHS as if it was a panacea for all of our problems.  In fact, it is not.  It is in crisis for a number of different reasons.  It is not able to look after patients.  One will wait up to seven days in the NHS to see a GP, which is not a GP service compared to this country, where 96% of patients can see their GP within 24 hours of contacting a surgery.</p>  <p>  Many things are working extremely well in our health services.  We have an occasional crisis because that is the way of health services.  They are not like a bus timetable or train schedule; there are peaks and troughs which frequently create problems.</p>  <p>  There are issues within our population that we cannot control, such as growing old - we cannot stop that.  We need to look after this cohort of patients, but they are not all the same.  Many of my patients in their 80s or 90s are as healthy as can be.  They live and drive independently and have active and very fulfilled lives.  Another cohort within that population are fully dependent, and need full nursing home care and major resources in the community to help them.  They are completely different from the other group.</p>  <p>  All of the conflicting interests within the patient population, and doctors, consultants, nurses and administration and physiotherapy staff, all have their ideas about how things can be done right.  It is time we had a national conversation about what we will do about our health service.  The solutions are not always what we can import from abroad.  Many of the solutions are already in place and many parts of our health service are working very well.  We need to analyse where the problems are and start sorting them out.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what has been said by Members on both sides of the House.  I agree that the safety and quality of patient care must be our primary focus.  Patients should receive the very highest standard of treatment, irrespective of where they seek it.  Elderly patients should not wait more than six hours for treatment.</p>  <p>  In my constituency, Louth and East Meath, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is, unfortunately, regularly in the headlines because of the high number of patients on trolleys.  I have worked very closely with the hospital in trying to reduce the number of patients on trolleys and I am confident that we are addressing the issue, although I would prefer if the numbers fell more quickly.</p>  <p>  I have spoken on many occasions with my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, about the need to address overcrowding in emergency departments.  We both agree that the situation is not satisfactory and improvements are needed.  We also agree that simply throwing money at the situation will not resolve it, as has been proven in the past.</p>  <p>  The emergency department task force was set up in December 2014 to provide a focus in dealing with the challenges posed by overcrowding in emergency departments.  In April this year, the task force action plan was published and a range of actions were identified.  They included optimising existing hospitals and community capacity; developing internal capacity and process improvements; and improved leadership, governance, planning and oversight.  </p>  <p>  I note that the task force implementation group met most recently on 2 November, that the implementation of the action I outlined is continuing and key priority actions have been identified.  They include strong centralised operation processes within hospitals to drive bed management and discharge planning; consistent access to senior decision makers within the emergency department to ensure appropriate admission and enable effective discharge management on a seven-day basis; delegated discharge and enhanced roles for nurses to include the expansion of ENP roles with emergency departments; effective management of demand and capacity requirements regarding scheduled and unscheduled care; and an appropriate structures within the hospital and local community services to ensure an integrated and timely response to continuing care needs.</p>  <p>  While we still have a long way to go, it is somewhat pleasing that progress has been made and this can be seen in the fact that delayed discharges are steadily reducing.  There were 570 on 27 October 2015, down from 830 in December 2014.  The waiting time for NHSS funding has reduced from 11 weeks at the beginning of the year to between two and four weeks.  Transitional care funding supported almost 2,000 people who were approved for the fair deal scheme to move from acute to non-acute care while awaiting long-term care placements.  Over 1,200 additional home care packages will have been provided by the end of 2015.  Some 149 additional nursing home beds, including 24 additional private contract beds in Moorehall, County Louth, and 65 short-term beds in Mount Carmel have been opened in 2015. </p>  <p>  We are on target to provide an additional 1,604 NHSS places.  I note that the director general of the HSE is co-chairing the emergency department task force implementation group from now until March 2016.  He has taken this decision in order to ensure that all relevant parts of the health services, including acute, social and primary care, are optimising resources in order to deal with the particular challenges associated with the winter months.</p><p>We are going in the right direction because, under the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, the health service is changing.  We have learned that throwing money at a problem will not solve it.  We need to make key changes to how we deliver health services.  We need the full support of, and backing from, all key shareholders.  These changes will not happen overnight as they will take time to implement.</p> <p> I ask that all Members of the House, particularly members of the Opposition, work together on this issue.  Health is not an issue for political football.  We need joined-up thinking and a united approach to ensure we provide a world-class health system for the people of Ireland.  I know from my work on the health committee that results can be achieved when we work together regardless of our party allegiance.  We need to learn from the lessons of the past, when throwing money at a problem was seen as the only solution.  The problem with our health service cannot be resolved by money alone.  Changes are needed in how we manage and deliver health services.  I firmly believe we are now on the right road to delivering a world-class health service and time will prove this.</p></speech>

In particular, I commend Deputy Billy Kelleher on tabling the motion.  He made a very important point yesterday when he spoke about the need for health professionals to highlight conditions which could jeopardise patient care.  He referred to the fact that last month was the worst October on record, with 7,971 admitted patients cared for on trolleys.  In the first ten months of this year almost 80,000 admitted patients were on trolleys.  The fact we learned of a couple aged 90 who had to endure a very long time on trolleys has been well highlighted.</p>  <p>  Having listened to very good discussions on radio on this matter, the overall feeling is that the fact we have lost so many beds is a serious issue.  Recently, I listened to a discussion in which health professionals gave an overview of the health service.  They spoke, in particular, about the fact such a low percentage of the health budget is invested in primary care, which is leading to overcrowding in hospitals and many cutbacks in various programmes.  I will mention one briefly - I referred to it yesterday during a Topical Issue debate - namely, the school dental service.  This service lacks staffing and funding and yesterday the Minister assured me he would try to address it and that we should see improvements next year.  It is quite instructive that it was highlighted in the media that 334 children in Galway were hospitalised for dental treatment last year.  There is no doubt the lack of school dental checkups has led to these hospitalisations.  Dental issues are not being identified because routine examinations are not being carried out.  I hope the position is beginning to improve.  There are also cutbacks in staffing.  We must ensure that specific consideration is given to this matter.  I refer to south Galway as a case in point in this regard.</p>  <p>  The health professionals in the discussion to which I refer also spoke about other issues, such as the fact that they feel there is not enough support available in the area of mental health.  I have seen evidence of this in east Galway, where 22 acute beds were lost in Ballinasloe.  The professionals in question are of the view that there should be more support for public and private nursing homes.  They also feel that if there is no investment in these areas, the result will be even more overcrowding in hospitals.</p>  <p>  There has been a reduction in waiting times for fair deal applications.  I welcome this development but these applications must be dealt with because if they are not, more people will end up in hospital.  One commentator referred to about Dr. Jimmy Sheehan's call for more use of scanning equipment and the need for more staff working at weekends.  This is an issue which, I am sure, could be investigated.  We also need to have people working midweek.  There are these pressures on primary carers.  We have some very good home care and home help packages.  One gentleman informed me he has home help three times a day, which is very good.  On the other hand, people have told me they only receive a half an hour at lunchtime, which is a very busy time of the day in terms of home help.  This all leads to many people ending up in hospital.</p>  <p>  It is not an either-or situation when it comes to tackling the health budget because money must be spent.  I refer, in particular, to the rheumatology situation, which was highlighted on "Morning Ireland" this morning.  We do not have rheumatologists in the west of Ireland, and traditionally we have had waiting lists there.  What was highlighted this morning was the fact people must travel long distances to University Hospital Galway for treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.  There is also a shortage of staff in Limerick, which was very much highlighted.  The information we have received from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is something about which we should be very concerned.  It has highlighted not only trolley watch but also the need for recruitment.  It made a very strong point that unless resources are provided there will be ongoing issues about staffing and safe working environments.  In addition, it is concerned about the people for whom it cares.</p>  <p>  With regard to hospital beds, I refer to Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.  This is a level 3 facility of significant size.  There is a need for single en suite rooms and isolation areas.  I hope planning permission will be obtained for the proposed new 50-bed unit - I look forward to it having 100 beds in years to come - there and that this will be built as soon as possible.  The hospital's catchment area is large and there are many elderly patients living within it who require care.  There are also staffing issues at the hospital.  I hope we can make some progress to put in place more beds in the region for the people who badly need them.</p></speech>

I know from experience that time flies and one suddenly looks back and wonders what was going on.  I have believed for a long time that we are great people for changing structures but that we are not great at making the structures that are already in place work.  We now have the Saolta group and various other arrangements in place.  Ultimately, however, the people who go into hospital, who require day care or who need access to another service do not really care what is the logo of the entity providing the care.  What they are interested in is the service.  I believe, and most of us have this experience, that when one starts changing the structures and moving people around, what happens is that the real change being sought is delayed.  The question we must ask is whether the changes introduced in recent years have actually had an impact.  Unfortunately, the figures suggest that the answer is "No".  Certain high-level ideas that were attached to getting rid of the health board approach were good.  The idea of uniform national services, irrespective of where one lives, within reason is good.  However, the old concept whereby every health board had its own standards, etc., was not good, particularly in view of the fact that ours is a small country.  I have always been a great proponent of taking a strategic national approach, whether for ambulance call-out times or waiting list times.  I have not, however, been a great proponent of changing management and board structures because much of this tends to be very disruptive in terms of solving the problems that exist.</p><p>I have often wondered if we should take a more scientific approach, such as that taken by somebody running a manufacturing industry, when dealing with the flow of people in and out of hospitals.  Rather than changing the management, perhaps we should examine whether all the logjams are necessary.  I often described the accident and emergency department process in a hospital as equivalent to a hotel owner insisting that everybody who entered the premises, whether they wanted a meal, a pint or a bedroom, should register first at the front desk.  If that happened, there would always be a queue at the front desk waiting to register.  In my humble view and as any analysis would prove, many people end up in accident and emergency departments who need either a patch-up clinic, involving X-ray and appropriate outpatient treatment before going out the door, or who should be admitted directly to the hospital rather than through the accident and emergency department.  We should ask ourselves if there should be a minor injury clinic that would operate separately from the accident and emergency department.  There should be a separate process for incidents that would very likely require admittance, meaning people with a condition that inevitably requires a hospital stay in a known department would not have to go next or near the accident and emergency department.</p> <p> When I was a Minister I was fascinated by the fact that one hospital in Kilkenny never seemed to have a queue in the accident and emergency department.  We never got an answer on why that was so.  I do not know if it is still the case.  I had an interesting experience of that when I attended a football match in Kilkenny.  Five minutes into the second half of the match, one of the London players came down very heavily and was carted off to hospital.  The match continued for another 25 minutes of play and the lads togged off before coming out to get on the team bus.  They found that their comrade had been to the hospital, had his foot X-rayed to find it was not broken and was bandaged and strapped.  He was sitting on the bus waiting for the others.  Does the Minister of State know of many hospitals, even in their quiet periods, that would deliver such a service?  It is absolutely vital that we start looking at the systems we have rather than all the time playing around with the top structures.</p></speech>

Debates on trolleys and accident and emergency departments are like Christmas in that they come around every year, although this year the debate is earlier.  Anybody with a busy constituency clinic would have been able to pick up early in the summer that there were difficulties in the health service that would not normally be seen in June and July.  There were delays, with operations being cancelled wholesale.  If we could see it, it is beyond me why management in the HSE could not see it as well and start planning for it then, as opposed to adapting the normal winter plan, which apparently only comes into effect in mid-November.  We have had the various incidents that have been highlighted in the past number of weeks in Tallaght and every other hospital, to be frank.  The same management is comfortable putting out a tender for trolleys for Tallaght hospital without dealing with what is causing the use of trolleys in the first place.</p>  <p>  When listening to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I was reminded of a Dublin media personality visiting my home town, when his spouse got an ear infection.  Their first question was to ask where was the nearest accident and emergency department and when I told them it was an hour away, they nearly got a bigger infection.  If we have a properly resourced primary care system, it should be able to take much pressure from the accident and emergency departments.  A properly resourced system would work seven days a week, with GPs rewarded for offering services rather than penalised, so we would not drive GPs to Canada because of a lack of resources.  We should not be going around begging to get doctors into rural areas because every rural vacancy is treated differently when it comes to the rural practice allowance.  A proper system would work with district hospitals operating on an effective step-down basis.</p>  <p>  On examining waiting lists, I noticed the waiting list numbers for Mayo General Hospital have fallen.  That is not due to anybody in the constituency but rather an effective system of step-down working in Ballina, Belmullet and Swinford, using the older people's and community nursing homes as step-down facilities.  People are being moved from Mayo General Hospital when they do not need to be there.  We get them out at that end and stop them coming into the accident and emergency department when there is a properly resourced system of primary care around the county.  In a county with such expansive geography, that is a necessity.</p>  <p>  Our district hospitals should be able to do X-rays seven days a week rather than five days a week between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  That way of thinking and doing business must change, and surely with any kind of reform that must be considered.  I am not convinced about these hospital groups.  They have nice flashy logos - it is Saolta in our case - but do those groups involve the district hospitals, or is it a case, for example, that Mayo General Hospital needs to work with them?  What have the hospital groups brought to the equation in dealing with this problem?  If we look at the size of the problem in mid-November, it is far more serious than it has been for some years.  Much work must be done around those hospital groups.</p>  <p>  We are supposed to have had much public service reform in the past few years.  I know it took much work to get to an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. working day but we must examine the possibility of a seven-day service, putting extra positions in place to do that.  It is ridiculous that operating theatres are empty through the night and X-ray machines are switched off at weekends unless there is an emergency appointment.  It is ridiculous that services that can be done and which do not take long must be done between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  It is absolutely ridiculous, particularly when people must travel long distances, that everybody gets the same appointment at 9 a.m., meaning that in many cases hundreds of people will turn up for that appointment, leaving some people to be seen only at 3 p.m., 4 p.m. or 5 p.m.  Such practice still goes on.  Until patients are treated with dignity and respect, with resources provided to back this up, there will be more cases like we saw in Tallaght, with accident and emergency services backed up.</p>  <p>  I am not convinced that the current management of the HSE understands this but if it does, it is not interested in change or putting patients at the front and centre of the system.  With the kind of money being spent on health, we should be able to resolve these problems.  We do not necessarily have to think outside the box; with a bit of cop-on we could resolve these problems.  If somebody experienced the journey of a patient from Erris or Ballina into Galway, he or she would know it involves driving through the city of Galway in peak traffic to try to get to the regional hospital, when there are hundreds of acres in Merlin Park that could offer many services without forcing people through the city.  That would require somebody to think about the patient in his or her home and what it takes to get to the hospital.  We are pushing people into these super-hospitals but it seems nobody in the HSE management is thinking of the patient's journey.  As long as this continues, we will have accident and emergency department problems every year.  We will see tenders for trolleys each year and we will hear of cases where people were on those trolleys for 97 hours every week from November to March.  That is simply not good enough.</p>  <p>  We can wring our hands in the Chamber, give out and vote but we will go home again at 9.30 p.m.  The problems will continue at 9.30 p.m. this evening, at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow and 9.30 p.m. tomorrow evening.  The people who should be accountable are not here in the Chamber and the people running the health service are not here.  It is time they walked in the shoes of the people they are supposed to serve; if they did, we would have a different kind of health service.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Kelleher on bringing it before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann so we can discuss the crisis in accident and emergency departments.</p><p>We need to realise there is a very serious issue.  We are well served with many fine people working in the health service, but in the part of the country I live in, a decision is made by families before they send elderly people into the emergency department at Cork University Hospital because of the lack of dignity they would face and because they would be waiting for hours.  We saw the closure of the emergency department in Mallow hospital, which was a fantastic service for Duhallow, western Duhallow in particular, and places that are more than an hour and ten or 15 minutes from Cork city.  I have first-hand experience from my family of the likes of the emergency department in Mallow hospital.  Going back a few years ago, I was in an ambulance after a road traffic accident where they diverted the ambulance at the racecourse in Mallow to Mallow hospital instead of Cork.  We left the scene of the accident for Cork and had to be diverted because the patient deteriorated.  Thankfully they were resuscitated in Mallow and then sent on to Cork.  The decisions being made do not reflect the reality on the ground.</p> <p> There is one issue I want to raise, namely, the ambulance service in the Duhallow region.  Every week, somebody rings me about the ambulance service.  Last Monday afternoon, I got a phone call from a relative whose family member had gone into an epileptic fit.  They had rung for an ambulance and waited 40 or 45 minutes for it, then they rang me out of desperation, not thinking we could wave a magic wand or whatever.  The issue was that the ambulance was coming from Tralee because there was no ambulance in Duhallow at that stage, and then through the emergency call centre there was another change and the ambulance came from a different direction.  The region of Duhallow is not being well served.  There was an ambulance taken out of the Millstreet area with this new configuration of the ambulance service.  There was always an ambulance in Macroom, Kanturk, Mallow and Millstreet.  That ambulance was covering the Cork-Kerry border and the greater part of Duhallow.  It covered 27,000 or 28,000 people.  The region itself would be larger than some rural D&aacute;il constituencies.  We have no ambulance service there.  If an ambulance leaves Kanturk and takes a patient to the CUH or to any other hospital in the city and then there is a call-out to Littleisland or to Cobh or anywhere else, the ambulance is immediately dispatched because this is the nearest ambulance and if there is a call in Kiskeam or Rockchapel or any of those places, there is no ambulance.  It will be the Limerick or the Kerry ambulance, which might be an hour or an hour and a half from those places.  It is simply not acceptable in this day and age.</p> <p> We have seen the issues with the new call-out services.  That is a concern as well.  When people are ringing an ambulance for a family member, they are very distressed.  They are very worried and they are asked all these questions.  It is fine for somebody to be taking down the details but there needs to be a small bit of human kindness and compassion.  Operators must understand that people are very distressed, whether there has been an accident or whatever has happened to cause someone to ring an ambulance.</p> <p> The basic point is that the removal of the ambulance service from Millstreet has been catastrophic in terms of ensuring an ambulance is available to reach within a reasonable timescale the people in western Duhallow whom I represent.  It is a crying shame and I ask the Minister to go back and look at it because it is not acceptable.</p> <p> Going back to the motion Deputy Kelleher has placed before the House, we saw last week various reports about elderly people waiting on trolleys.  There was almost a wringing of hands and an attitude that it was somebody else's fault.  There were all kinds of commitments made, going back seven, eight or nearly ten years at this stage, that if certain people were elected, they would get rid of the trolleys and so on.  Last week, there was an attitude of, "How dare you bring up the issue of trolleys in the D&aacute;il and how dare you bring the privacy of patients into it?"  The dignity of patients is destroyed while they are waiting on trolleys.  It is not acceptable to have an elderly person on a trolley having come from their home or sometimes a nursing home because they are ill.  It is not acceptable to have them on a trolley for 24 hours or longer.  It is very challenging for the patients, their families and any ounce of human dignity to have them in that place.</p> <p> We all have to ensure that when this debate is over we continue to keep the pressure on, that there is a proper attempt at solving this issue, that we do not just have a vote tonight on the counter-motion and walk our way through it, and that we make a proper attempt to sort it once and for all.  I impress upon D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that it is not acceptable what the configuration of the ambulance services has done to my region of Duhallow in taking an ambulance out of Millstreet and leaving the Duhallow region without a service, a region which is an hour, and in some instances over an hour, from any one of the hospitals in Limerick, Cork or Tralee.  That is not acceptable and the issue needs to be revisited by the HSE immediately if not sooner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1199" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100063#MMM00200"><p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, on bringing forward this motion to ensure the crisis of overcrowding in emergency departments is at the forefront of D&aacute;il business.  The only consistency that has resulted from this Government&rsquo;s chaotic handling of the health system is the incremental pressure placed on front-line emergency staff.  Emergency medical consultants, nursing staff and all other support staff are forced to go above and beyond the call of duty every day just to ensure hospitals can function on the most basic of levels.  Their job is a difficult one, and as the crisis deepens over the winter months, it will be next to impossible as even more pressure is placed on emergency services.</p>  <p>  The latest figures made available by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation show that the number of people on trolleys at St Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny has soared by 144% in the space of a single year.  These figures are inexcusable and are the clearest sign yet that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is completely out of his depth.  Kilkenny has recorded one of the largest increases in the entire country when it comes to the number of people stuck on trolleys.  There were 143 people stuck on trolleys in Kilkenny in October 2014, but the latest figures show there were 349 patients on trolleys in October 2015.  How does the Minister stand over a situation where a growing number of patients are languishing for hours on end on trolleys in corridors and other public spaces?</p>  <p>  I spoke to a man only a matter of hours ago who had attended the emergency assessment unit of St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny before being sent home with no diagnosis following an eight-hour wait.  The staff had to resort to asking him to come back tomorrow.  The man informed me that there was little or no room for staff even to turn, let alone operate at the level required to administer appropriate care and attention to those who were waiting.  Patients were reduced to tears and staff members were visibly upset at working in such intense conditions.  I am not talking about a year ago; this was yesterday.  While in power, Fianna F&aacute;il channelled significant investment, which oversaw the opening of a state-of-the-art 26-bed unit at Kilcreene hospital for the purpose of respite and step-down care.  These beds would be prime real estate now, given the current crisis facing us.  I urge the Minister to investigate the possibility of reopening this facility.  Kilcreene hospital is a facility which can assist in mitigating this emergency in the south east.  It is an essential component of the health service in the region and with minor investment this hospital can meet HIQA requirements and relieve the pressure on surrounding emergency departments.</p>  <p>  During a previous Fianna F&aacute;il motion on hospital waiting lists in September of this year, I asked the Minister to give a strong commitment that orthopaedic services and elective services would be maintained at this first-class facility indefinitely as a support to Waterford Regional Hospital.  This request was not directly addressed in the Minister&rsquo;s response so I am raising the matter for a second time.</p><p> Another neighbouring hospital of mine, Waterford Regional Hospital - or, as it is now known, University Hospital Waterford - is the closest hospital for many in south Kilkenny.  This is another crucial emergency department which caters for many rural areas of south Kilkenny and is bursting at the seams.  I have outlined to the Minister the waiting list crisis at the hospital on previous occasions during the Topical Issue debate, but my call for action continues to fall on deaf ears.  It is getting to a point at which the sick are nervous and anxious when they learn that they may have to attend an emergency department.  They are pleading with their GPs and trying to avoid emergency departments at all costs.  This is not how a modern health service should operate.</p> <p> I again ask the Minister of State about the St. Luke's accident and emergency department.  I cannot stress strongly enough that it was chaotic down there yesterday.  I was asked to go on local radio this morning to speak about it.  A patient who was on a trolley there yesterday spoke of the serious situation.  This cannot continue.  It is November, five weeks before Christmas.  We are going into the bad season - what we call the serious season - of January, February and March, when there will be much more sickness around.  What will happen at St. Luke's in those months?  I ask the Minister of State to take note of this and bring our comments back to the Minister.</p></speech>

It is uncomfortable, it is distressing and it does not lend dignity, let alone service.  However, quoting statistics will never have the same impact as personalised stories, and we saw that this week and last week with consultants and, indeed, the relatives of elderly patients who were waiting for admission in emergency departments.  Was there an elderly man on a trolley in an Irish hospital for more than 24 hours last week?  Yes.  Should it have happened?  No.  We all are agreed on that.  Was there an elderly person on a trolley the week before for more than 24 hours?  I think the answer would be "Yes".  Should it have happened?  No.</p>  <p>  Every month, the HSE publishes the number of patients who have been waiting for admission to hospital.  It publishes the number discharged within six hours, the number waiting longer than six hours, the number waiting longer than nine hours and the number waiting longer than 24 hours.</p>  <p>  This year, we asked the HSE to start publishing the data on patients attending emergency departments who are over 75 years of age.  Between January and September, there were 88,772 visits to emergency departments by patients over the age of 75.  This accounts for 12% of the total number of visits by patients to emergency departments.  A total of 46.2% of those over the age of 77 are admitted or discharged within six hours of registration.  The point is that these figures exist.  They are there for anyone to look up on the website.</p>  <p>  Really, the point I make is that the previous Government - I do not do the "previous Government" bit often-----</p></speech>

Let us take a look at exactly what we have been doing in primary care since 2011, rather than at the previous Administration.  Forty-six primary care centres have been delivered since March 2011.  There are an additional 50 locations where primary care infrastructure is under construction or at an advanced planning stage.  Primary care teams and personnel are being put in place.  Clinical programmes are being developed.  A new contract with the GPs is being negotiated.  We have moved ahead with the diabetes cycle of care for type 2 diabetes, also delivered in the community.  We have introduced an asthma programme for those under six.  We have introduced free GP care for both those over 70 and those under six.  We are negotiating a new contract with GPs and, subject to this, will further extend GP care to children under 12.  We have increased the number of discretionary medical cards from 52,200 in June 2014 to over 90,000 now.</p>  <p>  We have introduced a project to standardise the accreditation process for minor surgery in GP practices.  This is far more meaningful than it sounds.  This project will involve a network of 24 GPs across 20 locations in 11 counties.  In the past, GPs were responsible for carrying out many minor surgeries in the community but this was not recognised as such.  We are now determined, rather than being dazzled by the high-tech and the high-spec, to move back into primary care, and that is what we are doing.</p>  <p>  What we have done in mental health, I think everyone agrees, has been quite spectacular.  This was at a time when this country, when we came to power, had four months' funding left.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.769" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100064#NNN02800"><p>I can come in here and remind the Minister of State that her party and Fine Gael in opposition criticised the decision of the previous Administration to begin a process of reconfiguration of the health services, all of which was based around international best practice and which was introduced to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients.  They objected to it from an Opposition standpoint.  They used emotive language, suggesting that people would die and that they would not get critical care within the golden hour, a scenario that has been so richly abused by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  When they came to government, they accepted the facts of international best practice and went on to say that reconfiguration would continue apace, but they have failed abysmally to invest in, support and fund it.</p>  <p>  A critical component of the reconfiguration process is an adequate and appropriate ambulance service.  The ambulance system is creaking.  I had the opportunity to visit its headquarters recently.  They are fine people and they have great technology, but they have ambulances on the road that are out of date and, in some cases, falling apart and breaking down, which means patients are not getting the care they need on time.</p><p>In my county of Clare, there is a shortage of 20 personnel.  There is not adequate staffing in the county to deliver on reconfiguration.  I see none of my colleagues here who frightened the people of Clare against the notion of reconfiguration, using emotive language and saying 20 people per year would die.  I have challenged them on many occasions to come in here and say whether 20 people per year died because of the principle of reconfiguration.  If that is the case, why has the Government not reversed it?  It has refused to enter the debate.</p> <p> Having accepted that reconfiguration was the right policy in the first instance, the Government has declined to challenge the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to put an adequate amount of money in place to properly fund the reconfiguration process.  Until that happens, the Government will not have a system in the health service that meets the needs of people who have been transferred, in the case of Limerick, from Nenagh, St John&rsquo;s Hospital and Ennis.  People took hard decisions and, eventually, bought into the notion that it was the right thing to do.  However, the Government has failed abysmally to fund the policy.</p> <p> There is not an appropriate person in University Hospital Limerick to read cancer scans.  Limerick is a centre of excellence for the delivery of cancer care and, heretofore, the assumption was that the policy would be adequately funded.  However, it does not appear to be.  It gives me no pleasure to challenge the Minister of State or the Government on the issue, given that the lives of people are affected by it.  However, we owe it to the people we represent to challenge the Government every day of the week until we receive adequate funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-11a.771" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="19:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111100065#OOO00200"><p>In light of the statistics the Minister of State put before us, which are designed to baffle and mislead, I will read a message from Margaret, who attended St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital.  She stated:</p><blockquote>I had a reason to spend a good part of yesterday [Monday, 9 November] in St Luke&rsquo;s hospital in Kilkenny.  There were lines and lines of people, all in need of care and attention queueing at the medical assessment unit.  People were waiting to be seen.  Some were awaiting tests, others results.  Some were waiting for beds and a decision to be made in that regard.  Patients were waiting on chairs and trolleys and in wheelchairs.  People accompanying them stood for hours and, eventually, sat on the floor.  There were so many people that the staff literally did not have room to turn.  They continually had to excuse themselves just to work.  Under these appalling conditions, staff heroically and unselfishly ploughed on and helped and cared for people professionally with empathy and kindness.  Thanks to all the staff.</blockquote><p>She thanked the staff and criticised successive Governments for not investing fully.  This is in a hospital which Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said earlier was the lead hospital in terms of development and the delivery of services in the country.  This is happening in our hospital while yards away from where people are being admitted, there is a brand new unit that was opened and closed and that could ease the pressure.  However, staff are not being provided.  The nurses and front-line staff are a BAND-AID in the system, holding it together.</p><p>Meanwhile, while the unit lies empty and is not being used for the purpose for which it was built, the HSE has decided to run down the services at Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital and look to an overcrowded campus in University Hospital Waterford.  The treatment of patients is chaotic and no respect is being shown for the dignity of the patients by the system which the Minister of State represents, the HSE and the Department of Health.  Shame on them for putting patients and front-line staff in this predicament.  It is about management and using the resources the Government has.  In St. Luke&rsquo;s, the Government is doing neither.  It is ignoring the issue regarding Kilcreene hospital.</p><p>Another lady contacted me today and said her elderly parent was in bed and asked for an extra sheet and blanket.  The nurse leaned in and quietly and politely told her that her best bet was Dunnes Stores.  What kind of system is the Government running?  There is a shortage of bed clothes.  There is a new arrangement for hospital stores and these essential items cannot be accessed easily.  There is a shortage of staff.  Stroke victims, the elderly and those who are in deep shock who attend accident and emergency services are being left without the care and attention they deserve and require.  Staff members complained to management long before this happened, but were ignored and now there is now chaos.  How can any management team in any hospital in the country stand over it?</p><p>The Minister of State remarked on funding to the hospitals.  She stands over the HSE that must now pay compensation of &euro;9 million to suppliers because it broke the rules and did not meet the criteria.  She stands over a HSE that cannot collect its debt from the private health insurers, not because the private health insurers will not pay, but because the HSE consultants will not sign off on it.  How many hospital beds would be off the corridors and in the wards, how many sheets, blankets and pillows could the Minister of State provide for a hard-pressed service, if the management, who are well paid, would collect the money and reinvest it in front-line services?  We should examine what is happening in the UK health service, which is returning to the cottage hospitals which are easily managed, where there is no MRSA or infections, and where those who are elderly and in dire need of the service get it when they want it.  Shame on the Government and the House that the elderly and sick are left as they are in our hospitals throughout the country.</p></speech>

While the views expressed on the Government side of the House were much more couched and nuanced in their criticism, the overriding fact cannot be denied.  Our health service is in crisis.  Many Deputies on the Minister's side of the House alluded to this fact.  Some Deputies will come in and read scripts from the various press offices of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to condemn us for highlighting what is a topic of discussion on every airwave and in every newspaper and in the emergency departments, hospital canteens and homes throughout the country.  The health services are in crisis.  The first issue in dealing with any problem is to acknowledge that there is a problem, and the Government must do so.  We were accused of tabling a motion that was long on aspiration.  The Minister's amendment is much longer on aspiration.  It is also much longer on deceit.  It is like something from Alice in Wonderland.  It does not tally with reality.  The Minister should have tabled the following amendment:</p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;acknowledges:<br /><br />&mdash; that we have broken most of our promises, and notes in particular that we broke promises in the area of the fair deal, discretionary medical cards and the drug reimbursement scheme<br /><br />&mdash; that we have driven nurses from the country because of the graduate scheme which was recently introduced<br /><br />&mdash; that we have driven our consultants and GPs from the country and consistently undermined the basic infrastructure of delivering health services, namely, the human resource element, the staff who are working day and night to try to provide a service that is not being resourced by the commitments the Government said it would make in its general election mandate.</blockquote><p>Either the Government sought a dishonest mandate, or it has been incapable of delivering on the promises it made.  Either way, it does not augur well for the health services.</p><p>While the motion refers primarily to the emergency departments in our hospitals, there have been continual U-turns on universal health insurance and the privatisation of hospital management, a move that was roundly condemned in the context of the establishment of hospital groups through the wording of reconfiguration.  Our motion aims to highlight the deficiencies in our health services but also to highlight the inadequacies of the Government&rsquo;s response and its handling of the core issues on a daily basis.</p><p> We have appalling stories from families whose loved ones have been visiting emergency departments throughout the country.  People who are charged by the HSE and the Government with overseeing patient safety are speaking out by telling the Minister that our emergency departments need help because patients' lives are being put at risk.  Those who are charged directly by the Minister and the HSE with caring for patients in our emergency departments have brought it to our attention that in recent times, patients aged 91, 93 and 100 years of age have had to wait inordinate lengths of time on trolleys in emergency departments.  When they speak up and ask the Minister for help, the Minister vilifies them, undermines them and says they have agendas.  The only agenda I have found when speaking to people who work in emergency departments is a desire to provide safe and adequate care in a timely fashion to those who present at their departments.</p> <p> The Minister and the Minister of State have to get their act together.  They need to acknowledge that they have singularly failed.  There has been a consistent failing in the delivery of the budget.  We recently had another bogus budget, just as we have had every year since this Government came into office.  The backdrop against which the budgets in question have been delivered is almost laughable.  Every year, we need a supplementary budget towards the end of the year to keep the lights on and ensure the staff are paid.  That is how our health service is being managed.</p> <p> I make no apologies for tabling this motion.  I did not do so just to have a cheap shot at the Government.  I tabled it because of the hundreds of e-mails that are sent continually to our offices by general practitioners, nurses, consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors and public representatives of all parties.  We frequently table D&aacute;il questions with those representations in mind and we have tabled this motion in the same spirit.  There is a despair among those attending emergency departments and those working to deliver health care in those departments.  I condemn the Government's actions and I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
