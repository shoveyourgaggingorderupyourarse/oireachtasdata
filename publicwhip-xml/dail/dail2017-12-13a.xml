What specific actions has he taken, if any, to prevent further leaks of confidential and sensitive data?  Will he confirm whether he has given this matter the absolute priority it deserves?</p></reply>

I am aware of the matter to which he refers.  A core part of the work of our embassies in the EU is to report on views on Brexit in other member states. These reports are an important source of information, not just for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but also for other Departments concerned with Brexit.</p>  <p>  For the past year, it has been the practice for a weekly summary of such reports to be prepared and circulated both within the Department and to other Departments.  These summaries, like the reports on which they are based, are not intended for the public domain.  They do not include material relating to policy papers prepared within the Department or to meetings of a sensitive character held in Dublin, Brussels or London.</p>  <p>  It is very disappointing and regrettable that a recipient of the summary would have leaked it to a journalist.  This was the first summary out of approximately 40 to which this happened.  The Secretary General of the Department is currently investigating the leak and has been in contact with all recipients of the document, either directly, in the case of recipients in my own Department, or indirectly, through the Secretaries General of other receiving Departments.  Until I receive a copy of his report, I will maintain an open mind on how this occurred and how it might best be prevented in the future.  In the meantime, given the sensitivity of the issues under consideration, no such summaries have been circulated since 23 November.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that these are weekly working documents are summaries.  This is not a significant report that was leaked but it should not have happened.  We are annoyed about it.  The Secretary General of my Department is trying to get to the bottom of the matter.  Until we are comfortable with putting in place the distribution system we had before, knowing it will not result in another leak, we are not going to do it.</p></reply>

I am glad to hear that we have amended procedures in so far as those reports are not being circulated until we get to the bottom of the matter.</p>  <p>  I commend the officials and the staff within the Department on the efforts made in respect of the phase 1 negotiations.  That is very important.  It was a good result and we, as a party, have cautiously welcomed it.  However, the real work starts in phase 2.  We have to be sure that the reporting of the negotiations we have with our European partners is absolutely watertight.  This is a breach that is nearly of strategic national importance, regardless of whether the Minister believes it is significant.</p>  <p>  On a question raised by my party leader on 29 November, can the Minister indicate the status of the investigation and where it stands?  Are we any closer to finding out who leaked this document or who gave permission for it to be leaked?  What specific actions have been taken?  Can the Minister give a commitment to the House that this will not occur again?</p></speech>

There were 40 such reports compiled weekly.  We need to be informed in terms of what is being said about Brexit and in the context of ensuring that our approach is fully appropriate and up to date.  This weekly summary should not have been leaked.  It was embarrassing for some of the people who were named in it.  Obviously, we made the necessary contacts to explain to people what had happened and to assure them that it will not happen again.  As I said, until the Secretary General is satisfied in terms of his own investigations, we will not be circulating these weekly summaries.  That investigation is ongoing.</p></speech>

Our partners need to have confidence that they can speak to us openly.  While this question mark hangs over the process, the position is very serious.  I do not get the sense the Department or the Minister are taking this as seriously as it should be taken.  Our partners have to trust that what they say to us is confidential.</p>  <p>  The fundamental question is when we will get to the bottom of this.  There is an "if" in there as well.  When does the Minister expect to get a report from the Secretary General of the Department on this matter?  Will he give a commitment that, when he gets that report, it will be debated, either at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence or here in the D&aacute;il?  We have to ensure that this never occurs again.  If we were in the middle of phase 2 negotiations, which are very specific on trade and future relations between Britain and the EU, can the Minister imagine what effect a document like this - even though he says it is not significant - might have?  This is being reported all over Europe, all over Britain and all over Ireland, with people named, their comments mentioned, etc.  This matter needs to be given the priority and afforded the importance it deserves.  I would like the Minister to confirm that it has been.  When will a report be completed by the Secretary General?</p></speech>

It is very important we get clarity and certainty for businesses, farmers and citizens across the island of Ireland with respect to what will happen in Brexit negotiations.  The only way we can provide certainty to businesses, farmers and others that there will be no hardening of the Border is if the North stays in the customs union and Single Market.  My party leader put this question to the Taoiseach last week but did not get a clear response.  I am putting the question directly to the Minister today.  Is it the position of the Irish Government that come what may, the North and the entire island will stay in the customs union and Single Market?  It is a very simple and straightforward question.  It is either "Yes" or "No" and I ask the T&aacute;naiste for an answer in the first instance to that question.</p></reply>

We have also secured a firm commitment that no physical border infrastructure or related checks and controls will exist and I am therefore satisfied that in all eventualities a hard border will be avoided and there will be no return to the borders of the past.</p>  <p>  It has been the Government&rsquo;s consistent position that the best possible outcome for Northern Ireland and east-west trade would be for the UK to stay in the Single Market and customs union.  This is ultimately a decision for the United Kingdom and while we hope they change their approach, the UK&rsquo;s stated position is that it will leave the Single Market and customs union when leaving the European Union.  However, the agreement reached last Friday not only provides a guarantee that there will be no hard border under any circumstances but it also spells out for the first time how this will be achieved.  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions, paragraph 49 of the report states that "in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement."</p>  <p>  It has also been agreed that any agreements put in place will be accompanied by effective mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight.  This is an important fail-safe, recognising that to avoid a hard border, no matter how it is achieved, Northern Ireland or the UK as a whole will need to remain fully aligned with those rules of the customs union and the Single Market which underpin North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  There is a great deal of work still to be done on the Irish-specific issues in order to ensure that all of the commitments set out in the joint report are implemented.  I am therefore pleased that work on Irish issues will continue to be taken forward in a distinct strand of the negotiations in phase two.  This will ensure that they will not be overlooked at any point in the next phase.  All of those points were reinforced yesterday when I met Mr. Michel Barnier for over an hour.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental matter, central to protecting the interests of the people of Ireland.  The Minister spoke of full alignment, which we acknowledge as progress.  The qualification that comes with full alignment is that it is only on the basis of alignment with North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement.  These are clearly important.  We have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister on several occasions trying to understand what the "all-island economy" means.  Trade is not an area that is mentioned even once.  There is mention of education, health, research and innovation standards but there is no mention of trade at all.</p>  <p>  We have concerns because this is not a bulletproof guarantee, as the Taoiseach has said.  It is simply a political agreement between two governments.  Nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.  There is a world of difference-----</p></speech>

Last Friday's agreement was not an agreement between two governments.  It was an agreement between the British Government and 27 other governments.  It is also patently clear from the guideline document that will be before heads of state towards the end of this week, if they support it, that in order for phase two to progress, the commitments made in phase one must be honoured.  Will the Deputy please not raise unnecessary fears, in this House or anywhere else, about very sensitive matters?  We have enough challenges in dealing with Brexit and the relationships between Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as relationships in Northern Ireland between two communities, of course, without the Deputy raising unnecessary fears.</p>  <p>  We have stated over and over again that the Irish Government's position is we would like the United Kingdom as a whole to stay in the customs union and Single Market.  That would solve many problems.  It is a decision for the British Government to decide how they want to approach this.  We have agreement between the British Government and the European Union that in the absence of agreement, there is a fail-safe and fall-back position that would ensure full alignment on the island of Ireland with the rules of the customs union and Single Market.  It would allow the all-island economy to continue to function as it does today.  The Deputy knows what that means.</p></speech>

We do not know whether there will be a hard or soft Brexit.  We do not know if there will be a transition period.  If there is such a period, we do not know how long it will be or what conditions might apply to it.  We do not know whether there will be a deal.  One of the parties might walk away from the table over the next one, two or three years.  We do not know any of these things.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, this level of uncertainty is bad for business.  I will give an example of how it is affecting businesses in Ireland right now.  Despite Ireland's significant success in the agrifood sector, it has been shown in a new ESRI analysis that investment in the sector has decreased over the past 18 months.  It is reasonable to assume that this reduction is partly linked to Brexit.  There is a lot we do know.  Sterling has fallen to a point where more and more Irish firms are finding it impossible to compete.  The UK economy is in trouble.  Growth is now anaemic.</p></reply>

In this capacity, I continue to work closely with colleagues across the Government to address many of the challenges resulting from Brexit, some of which the Deputy has accurately referred to.  Detailed sectoral work is being done by individual Departments and through cross-departmental co-ordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  These structures represent an active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government's overall response to Brexit, including its priorities for the next phase of the Article 50 negotiations.  I hope those negotiations will provide some clarity over the coming months.  As part of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures, there is an important focus on deepening the Government's analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios, including a scenario in which no withdrawal agreement is concluded.</p><p>Engagement with stakeholders is an important pillar of the Government's overall response to Brexit.  Within the framework of the all-island civic dialogue on Brexit, three plenary meetings and 20 sectoral meetings have taken place in locations across the country.  The Brexit stakeholder forum, which has a more limited membership, has met four times since its establishment in September, most recently last Friday in the wake of the publication of the Commission-UK joint progress report.  The Government is actively responding to the domestic implications of Brexit.  In addition to our overall budgetary and capital spending policies, significant measures amounting to over &euro;50 million were announced in budget 2018, including a new &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for businesses, a &euro;25 million Brexit response loan scheme for the agrifood sector and additional supports for the food industry.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The increased funding for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the State agencies involved in export promotion will allow for the opening of six new diplomatic missions.</p><p>The support of our EU partners and the EU institutions has been a key factor in securing the positive outcomes achieved to date, including the agreement reached last week.  The Government will continue its intensive engagement, particularly with member states which share our concerns.  We will aim for a withdrawal agreement based on the commitments set out in the Commission-EU progress report, an ambitious framework for the future EU-UK relationship and transitional arrangements which will give time for the detail of that relationship to be negotiated and for businesses and citizens to prepare.</p></speech>

I have probably asked for them from the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on five or six occasions.  I keep being told that they are coming or not coming, or that they are being put together or not being put together.  There is a fund which will provide credit to enterprise.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the domestic response is in stark contrast to the international response.  Business people like farmers, bed and breakfast owners, hoteliers, traders and agrifood exporters are not seeing the help that is needed.  The National Competitiveness Council warned a few days ago that small exporting firms might not survive Brexit, even if tariffs are not introduced, without a relentless focus on competitiveness.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that we are not seeing such a focus.  In November, a survey conducted by InterTradeIreland found that 95% of businesses across this island do not have a plan for Brexit, which represented a slight decrease on the 97% figure recorded last year.  A survey conducted by a Department here found that just 15% of small and medium-sized enterprises have taken some form of action on Brexit.  The reality on the ground is that firms are not getting ready.  I suggest that one of the main reasons for this lack of preparedness is that firms are not getting the support they need from the Government.  What has the T&aacute;naiste done to secure the relaxation of state aid rules?  What has he done to provide grants, in addition to loans?</p></speech>

Approximately 38,000 Irish companies have significant trade interests with consumers and customers in the UK.  The Deputy has attended many of the meetings I have attended at which Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and IDA Ireland have provided information and updates.  They have seen an increase in awareness levels among their client companies about the need to prepare for Brexit.  There is huge uncertainty because we do not know what the final outcome will look like.  We are anxious to move on to the second phase of the negotiations on Friday to try to answer many of the questions being asked by companies in the UK and Ireland.  There is no doubt that we will speak to the Commission about state aid rules if the outcome of Brexit looks like it will be very damaging from an Irish perspective, particularly in the context of Irish trade with the UK.  In such circumstances, we will talk about the measures we can take in response.

The conversation on state-aid rules needs to happen today.  We have had three Ministers for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in the past five months.  I am yet to see a coherent and substantial response.  I accept that Enterprise Ireland is helping a few hundred companies, but that is not enough.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about 38,000 Irish companies, but I remind him that 90,000 such companies are importing and exporting from the UK.  Tens of thousands of other companies will be indirectly affected by Brexit.  The UK is a big economy.  I think it is the sixth biggest economy in the world.  The economy of the 26 other remaining member states is five times bigger than the UK economy.  Our level of market penetration in those 26 member states is one ninth the size of our market penetration in the UK.  The opportunity is there, but it is just not good enough to say we will need to know what the final shape of Brexit is before we get serious.  We have to start getting our firms exporting out to the 26 member states that are remaining in the EU.  The T&aacute;naiste and I are aware that, regardless of what happens, Brexit will make it much more difficult for our firms to trade with the UK.</p></speech>

That would be necessary even if Brexit was not looming.  We have intensified those efforts, for example by increasing staffing in all the key State agencies in this area.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has been spending a lot more time on trade missions than would probably otherwise be the case.  We have seen a dramatic increase in agrifood trade with big markets like China.  Such trade has almost reached &euro;1 billion per annum.</p><p>Five or six years ago, that figure was probably less than &euro;200 million.</p> <p> We are seeing significant increased efforts to find alternative markets in anticipation of problems in the context of Brexit, but that does not happen overnight.  The relationships that we have in the UK are still strong, still functioning and still need to be maintained.  At the same time, we are opening up other options for companies to trade, particularly in the agrifood sector.</p></speech>

This is rightly seen as an endorsement of the far-right policies of the Israeli Government and an attempt to annex not just East Jerusalem, but all of the Palestinian territories.  It has caused uproar in the Middle East, with protests taking place and, tragically, four Palestinians killed and many hundreds injured.  His arrogant declaration is already stained with blood.  Does the Government not agree that it is now time to withdraw the invitation to President Trump to come to Ireland?</p></reply>

I was disappointed at the US announcement recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and initiating steps to move the US embassy there.  I issued a statement describing this decision as premature, ill-advised and unhelpful to efforts to resolve the conflict in the Middle East.  High Representative Mogherini issued a similar statement on behalf of the EU and many EU governments have done likewise.</p>  <p>  No country has its embassy to Israel in the city of Jerusalem.  There are good reasons for this international consensus.  First, the status of Jerusalem is one the issues to be resolved in a peace agreement and it is unhelpful to single out and anticipate a conclusion on just one issue.  Second, Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, including occupied East Jerusalem, where more than 300,000 Palestinians live and which Palestinians see as the future capital of the Palestinian state.</p>  <p>  President Trump stated that United States recognition did not imply any US view on the eventual boundaries of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  That is an important caveat.  Unfortunately, this nuance is lost in the political signal sent to Israel last week.</p>  <p>  I would not be in favour of refusing to meet or host the President of the United States because of a disagreement on policy, however strongly we might disagree.  That would be incompatible with the depth and scale of our relationship, which is overwhelmingly a positive one.  It would reduce our opportunities for influence in the short term and damage our interests in the long term.</p>  <p>  For our part, Ireland's policy on Jerusalem is clear.  In this week's EU informal meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, I underlined to him our continuing conviction that the conflict could only be resolved by a two-state solution, including a sovereign state of Palestine.  I also stressed the crucial and negative impact of continuing settlement building.  Therefore, the Government looks forward in due course to recognising Jerusalem as the capital both of Israel and a sovereign state of Palestine.</p></speech>

However, the Government can do something that would send a powerful signal right around the world, namely, to use this occasion as it should have used on many other occasions previously to withdraw the invitation, which has political significance, to President Trump and say that we do not accept the policy of supporting the annexation of Palestinian territories, we oppose the oppression of the Palestinian people and we oppose the US support for that policy under various presidents, Democrats and Republicans.  Candidates from both parties promised to move the embassies previously.  Israel is the largest recipient of US military aid, including a recent deal for $38 billion over the next ten years.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the EU presenting itself as an honest broker and as having a different policy than the US are just crocodile tears when Palestinians are being killed, given the covert support for Israel, such as through the EU-Israel association agreement, which effectively incorporates Israel into the Common Market, or the funding for Israeli armaments companies through EU research programmes.</p></speech>

For Ireland to effectively reverse an invitation to the President of the United States to visit Ireland would be counterproductive and a mistake.  We share many interests with the US and there is a long and friendly relationship between the two countries.  We disagree on some policy issues, including this one.  I have stated clearly that last week's decision was a mistake, one that has created a great deal of tension across the Middle East and annoyance in many Arab and other states.  It makes the search for a lasting peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians more difficult.</p>  <p>  However, I do not believe that, either on this issue or on the many other issues that the US and Ireland need to be talking to each other about, we advance the interests of either country by disinviting the President of the United States.  If President Trump chooses to come to Ireland, that visit will be facilitated.</p></speech>

Issues will arise time and again and, time and again, the question of withdrawing the invitation will be posed.  What will it take?  The conditions of Palestinians in annexed East Jerusalem are horrific and a microcosm for the oppression of Palestinians generally within the West Bank, Gaza and the 1967 borders.</p>  <p>  Of the approximately 300,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem, more than 140,000 are separated from Jerusalem proper by a so-called separation wall 10 m high.  These are cut off from access to basic public services, have a minimal number of post offices and a minimal amount of electricity, and a small minority of people are connected to water legally.  Despite East Jerusalem having 33% of Jerusalem's population, it gets less than 10% of the funding that goes into the city.  There has been the expansion in settlements, with 200,000 illegal settlers in East Jerusalem since 1977, which is designed to make a Palestinian state unviable.  That is the strategy of the Israeli ruling class.</p>  <p>  The EU will not do anything about this, so the only answer is a movement of protest from below, which is precisely what the Minister says is not worth doing.  Look at what was achieved in the Arab Spring.  What is necessary in the Middle East is an uprising of ordinary people in Palestine and Israel and across the region to bring a solution that is in the interests of the people of that region.</p></speech>

I have been to Jerusalem, the West Bank, including Ramallah, and Gaza.  I was there four months ago and will return in the second week of January when I will be visiting Gaza, Ramallah, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  I will also be visiting Cairo.</p>  <p>  We have an interest in this issue and I want Ireland to use its influence, but I do not want Ireland to cut itself off and be seen as a country that simply makes critical statements of Israel and takes protest actions.  We would be written off as a broker that could play a part in helping to move a new peace deal forward.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's concerns about the conditions in Gaza in particular, but also those in much of East Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank.  I had an opportunity to say directly to the Israeli Prime Minister that we, as the European Union but also as Ireland, continued to have concerns about Israel's policy of expanding settlements.  I asked him direct questions in that regard.</p>  <p>  The only point on which the Deputy and I disagree is how to bring about a political dialogue that can result in a good outcome for Palestinians, but also a good outcome for Israelis in terms of their legitimate security concerns.</p><p>That is what I believe the Government politically has an obligation to try to achieve.</p></speech>

The request was filed with the court on 4 December 2014.  On the basis of new material uncovered, the Government contended the ill treatment suffered by the victims should be recognised as torture.  The Government&rsquo;s request remains under consideration by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, the UK was invited to submit observations on several questions posed by the court.  At the request of the UK, the deadline for submission of its observations was extended by the court from time to time up to December 2016.  In February 2017, the Government submitted its reply to the UK observations on the application.  Further observations were submitted by the UK in April and the Government responded to these in May 2017.  The Government is now awaiting notice from the court as to how it wishes to proceed in considering the case.</p>  <p>  In a separate process, the Belfast High Court on 27 October last, further to a judicial review application by some of the victims in the case, quashed a 2014 PSNI decision not to take further steps to investigate the question of identifying and, if appropriate, prosecuting those responsible for criminal acts during the interrogation of the victims.  The court finding means the question should be revisited.  The Department is continuing to monitor these developments.</p>  <p>  The Department has remained in contact with the legal representatives of the survivors and their families in this case since the Government&rsquo;s request to the European Court of Human Rights in December 2014.  Departmental officials also met with the men in November last year to inform on the status of the Government&rsquo;s request to the European Court of Human Rights and to hear their views.</p>  <p>  I would be glad to meet with the survivors to hear their experience and their views regarding their continuing search for truth, justice and acknowledgment.  I have directed the Department to confirm the meeting sought in the period ahead, when I would hope to be in a position to brief on progress with the Government&rsquo;s application in Strasbourg.</p></reply>

He referred to the original details such as inhumane and degrading treatment.  What emerged in early 2013, through declassified documents which the British Government had tried to hide from European Court of Human Rights, was that there was an existence of the interrogation centre in Ballykelly.  In other words, lies were told to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>  <p>  There is further evidence that this was a policy at the highest level which the then British Prime Minister, Secretary of Defence, and Home Secretary knew about.  The Irish Government did fulfil its role.  However, we are approaching 40 years since the events and the men are still waiting for justice.  In the meantime, four of them have passed away.  When one meets them, one realises the extent of their suffering, both physical and mental.</p>  <p>  For how much longer will this go on?  Surely this ticks all the boxes to be considered a priority case by the European court, considering the ages of the men involved, the new evidence and the length of time it has taken so far.

There was quite a long debate on Syria in the Foreign Affairs Council meeting this week.</p>  <p>  On 9 May 2011, the EU agreed to impose restrictive measures, or sanctions, on members of the Syrian regime to put pressure on them to end the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria.  Targeted EU sanctions are in place against over 250 people and almost 70 entities complicit in the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria.  The first person on this list is Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.  The sanctions also include an oil embargo, restrictions on investments, a freeze of the Syrian central bank&rsquo;s assets and export restrictions on equipment and technology which might be used for internal repression, or for interception of Internet or telephone communications.  There are no sanctions on food, medicines or most other civilian goods.  The EU&rsquo;s Syria sanctions include exemptions for essential civilian needs and humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  The EU keeps the impact of sanctions under constant review.  It will consider options to mitigate any unintended consequences which can be documented as relating directly to the measures themselves, as distinct from the more general economic disruption caused by the conflict and the Assad regime&rsquo;s actions.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the Assad regime and its supporters.  It will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures.  To lift these sanctions would amount to tacit support for the Assad regime and would serve to encourage further impunity with regard to attacks on civilians, as well as disregard for the UN-led peace process.</p>  <p>  There are numerous barriers to humanitarian access in Syria but these are as a result of actions by the parties to the conflict, particularly the Assad regime.  I am aware of the challenges faced by NGOs operating in Syria.  However, I am confident that EU sanctions are still justified.</p></reply>

However, it was leaked.  It found US and EU economic sanctions on Syria are hitting civilians the hardest and preventing the delivery of blood safety equipment, medical equipment, medicines, fuel, food, water pumps, spare parts for power plants etc.  A leaked internal UN email, obtained by the online news publication, <i>The Intercept</i>, in October 2016, also highlighted US and EU sanctions as a principal factor in the disintegration of the Syrian health system.  I recommend the Minister examines these two documents.  The essentials are not getting through and the sanctions in place, which the EU thinks are bothering Assad, are not.</p><p>As we know Assad is winning the war so the sanctions had no effect on that.  The people are suffering.  A fresh look at the area is required.</p></speech>

For example, in 2016, the EU amended the Syrian sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel.  Earlier this year, the relevant working group of the Council of the European Union examined the impact of EU sanctions on NGOs providing humanitarian assistance in Syria and consulted NGOs, including Irish NGOs, as part of the process.  The review highlighted some challenges facing NGOs working in Syria, including a lack of understanding of the restrictive measures by banks and other key actors, which can result in delays in transferring funding, which the Deputy raised last week or the week before when there was a Private Members' motion on this issue.  This led to the publication of a frequently asked questions document by the European Commission, which aims to clarify the sanctions regime for NGOs and economic operators to facilitate the work of humanitarian actors in Syria.  Ultimately, the European Union wants to bring about an agreed settlement and permanent ceasefire that lasts in Syria.  That is the way in which we can help people in that country most effectively, as opposed to removing sanctions and essentially allowing Syria to go back to normal under the Assad regime.</p></speech>

The centre for Syrian studies at the University of St. Andrews has stated that the reduction in living standards and aid dependency as a result of the sanctions is empowering the regime because people are more dependent on the regime.  The NGOs that were interviewed in this report complain about the sanctions and say the sanctions undermine their chance to help people.  The sanctions between 1991 and 2003 in Iraq caused the deaths of over 500,000 children.  We will not know for a few years how many children will die in Syria because of the sanctions.  The sanctions are not working.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with the Deputy on that.  The sanctions against Syria are much more targeted than that but I reiterate the idea that we would send a signal by removing sanctions now, effectively saying that we accept that the Assad regime should not be targeted in any way politically, would give the wrong signal in the context of the negotiated solution we are looking for in the Geneva process.</p></speech>

I will not repeat my earlier reply but will add the following.  The decision by the United States and its implications were discussed by EU foreign ministers both at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday and in the informal meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel which preceded it.  Last week, many EU partners, like Ireland, had made statements of their own position following the US announcement.  High Representative Mogherini had likewise issued a statement on behalf of the EU.</p>  <p>  The EU and its member states have reaffirmed our belief in a two-state solution to the conflict, including the future of Jerusalem as a capital for both states, both Israel and Palestine.  That remains our clear position.  In the informal meeting on Monday, I stressed to Prime Minister Netanyahu the continuing necessity both for a solution based on two states, including a sovereign state of Palestine, and of a complete freeze on further settlement expansion, which is something I also made clear to him when I visited Israel four or five months ago.</p>  <p>  There has understandably been a strong reaction in the region to the US decision, but I want to acknowledge that most Palestinians have expressed their anger and frustration peacefully.  Regrettably, a small number have resorted to violence, including the firing of rockets from Gaza, which I condemn.  At least two people have already lost their lives and I hope that all concerned will show restraint, both in protesting and in responding to peaceful protests, in order that no further lives are lost.  Jerusalem has been a focus of tension and a flashpoint for violence in recent years.  The international community has repeatedly called for all parties to refrain from unilateral actions that might increase those tensions.  Unfortunately, that is what we saw last week.</p></speech>

Surely he does not believe that, as the two-state solution is non-existent?  What happened last week was a deeply incendiary act by Donald Trump and was calculated to cause a reaction in the Middle East.  Jerusalem will never be the capital of Israel and should never be formally recognised by the EU.  This will only embolden both Donald Trump's reactionary supporters in the United States and the reactionary elements of the Zionist Israel of Netanyahu.  This legitimises what Netanyahu wants to do.  He has no interest in the two-state solution.  That is pie in the sky.  It is time for the EU to recognise that there is no way to have a two state solution.  The only solution is one state in which Palestinians, Jews and Christians all live together as much as possible, peacefully.</p></speech>

The Government supports that, the EU supports it and it has been the subject of many debates, conclusions and resolutions in the UN.  It is what we would like to see.  The announcement last week, in my view, makes it more difficult to re-establish a political process that can lead to that outcome but the Government and I, on its behalf, will do everything possible to encourage a process that will result in that outcome.</p></speech>

What Donald Trump did last week will start another intifada.  Indeed, one has already begun in Palestine.</p> <p> That is what Trump has done.  His statement that Palestinian matters do not matter was incendiary.  Even Netanyahu says that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people.  What the hell is that?

We need to see addressed the misery that many Palestinians live in today, especially the humanitarian challenges they face in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.  That is why the international community, including the European Union, must show leadership and facilitate a process whereby we can have a negotiated solution again.  That has not been the case for more than two decades now, despite the fact that the Oslo Accords provide a clear roadmap to do that.</p>  <p>  Taking hard line positions on one side or the other is not helpful.  We need to recognise when mistakes are made.  I believe a mistake was made last week by the US President in making the announcement that he did.  We all have a responsibility to try to calm things after that mistake.</p></speech>

Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was not a mistake; it was a calculated declaration of war against the Palestinian people, the Arab world and the Muslim population.  If the Minister does not see that, then he is living in cloud cuckoo land.  Netanyahu is celebrating.  He claims that the European Union will eventually accept this and move EU embassies to Jerusalem.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the Israeli Government is genuine?  I say as much given what it has done since the Oslo Accords to accelerate illegal settlements, carve up Jerusalem and ethnically cleanse thousands of Palestinians from east Jerusalem.  It has carved up Hebron, literally sliced Hebron in two, to the point that there are now 600,000 settlers in the West Bank.  That is double the number at the time of the Oslo Accords.  Does the Minister honestly believe Israel has the slightest interest in peace?  Now, the United States has made absolutely clear that it has no interest in peace either.</p>  <p>  I have never believed in the two-state solution because it legitimises ethnic cleansing.  Whether the Minister believes in the two-state solution, it is now dead because Israel has systematically flouted the Oslo Accords and UN international law.  Faced with these facts, at what point will the Minister say that sanctions become justified?</p></speech>

That would be an extraordinarily negative message to send to Palestinians and Israelis for that matter, many of whom I have spoken to.  Many Israelis want a lasting peaceful solution and are committed to a two-state solution.</p>  <p>  The actions of the Israeli Government, especially in the context of settlements, the expansion of settlements and increasing the settler population in the West Bank, are certainly difficult to see as compatible with a willingness to negotiate a viable two-state solution that works for Palestinians as well.  I have made that clear and the European Union has made it clear too.  The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Mogherini, made it clear this week that EU countries would not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and would not move their embassies following the lead of the US.</p>  <p>  Let us talk about the facts and look to try to calm issues rather than inflame them.</p></speech>

The Minister believes sanctions are justified against Syria.  Does the Minister believe that at any point sanctions should be imposed against Israel for what it is doing?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister believe anything other than words of concern should be expressed about the fact that the United States has now legitimised the breaking of international law?  Does the Minister believe it was legitimate to dismantle the apartheid state in South Africa using sanctions and boycott?  Will the Minister explain the difference?  What is the difference between the systematic flouting of international law and the ethnic cleansing being conducted by the Israeli State on the one hand and what apartheid South Africa did on the other?  Can they Minister explain the difference?  I cannot see the difference, except for the fact that Israel has done it more thoroughly.  Does the Minister oppose ethnic cleansing?  That is what is being done in east Jerusalem &ndash; there is no other word for it.</p></speech>

We will continue to do that in an effort to try to get an outcome that is fair to Israelis and Palestinians.  That is what we are working towards.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that Ireland should put itself firmly into one far side or the other.  Instead, what I have been trying to do with other EU states is work with them to build strong consensus within the European Union.  I believe we will be listened to in that forum.  Moreover, I believe we will be far more effective in terms of getting a response from Israel if we can get EU consensus and a way forward.</p></speech>

The Minister and his EU and UN colleagues should come together at this juncture with a view to doing exactly what he has just said.  Their aim should be to calm down the situation and establish a bridgehead to move on the negotiations and the peace process with a view to accommodating the various conflicting positions.</p></speech>

There are differing views within the European Union, which is why the EU high representative has looked to try to find common ground on certain issues.  That is the reason the Israeli Prime Minister got a clear message when most of the Ministers were in attendance on Monday morning.  The European Union is united in its concern around the continued expansion of settlements.  I share the concern of Deputy Boyd Barrett in that regard.</p></speech>

The issue is how we move forward a process that can result in a two-state solution as opposed simply to making criticisms and protests.  That is where there is a difference between politicians and NGOs in terms of what we need to try to do.  NGOs have legitimate concerns and need to raise legitimate issues.  I am a politician representing the Irish Government.  We are looking for a political way forward.  We are working within the EU structures because that is where we have power.  Ireland, as a State within the European Union, is looking and talking to other countries to try to get unity and consensus that can increase EU leadership in this area.</p><p>The European Union is by far the biggest provider of financial support in the Middle East, particularly for Palestinian communities.  It also needs to be a very significant political contributor to moving this process forward, along with the United States.</p></speech>

This is all the more important now that the US has undoubtedly damaged its potential as an honest broker in the short to medium term, which is very clear from the statements made by the Arab League and many Arab governments.  There is a need for the European Union to work with the US and others to try to find a way forward in which Palestinians and Israelis can have faith.</p></speech>

The Minister made reference to consensus.  There was consensus in this House on the recognition of Palestine.  The Minister has said that he wants to see consensus at European level but the difficulty in that regard is the guilt in Europe regarding the Second World War.  Consensus can be reached in Europe on favourable trade status for Israel but not on actions being taken against Israel because of the aforementioned war guilt.  We need to show leadership here.  There is no point in the Minister saying that the settlements are difficult.  They are not just difficult, they are illegal.  There are approximately 500,000 illegal settlers right now.  Are we going to wait until there are 1 million illegal settlers before we take some action against this Israeli Government?</p></speech>

That is not just my view; it is also the view of the UN.  The settlements are totally unacceptable and are counterproductive in the context of a lasting peace settlement.  They also make the politics for the Palestinian leadership all the more difficult in terms of convincing people that negotiation actually works.  That is why the settlements are so counterproductive.  I have been to the area and seen the settlements we are talking about in east Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank.  I will be there again in a few weeks' time.  I do not propose to change the Irish position right now.  I want to go to the Middle East again in the second week of January.  I will have a meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister and high-level political meetings with the Palestinian side as well.  When I have made that visit, we can then review the political approach that Ireland has been taking.</p></speech>

Last Friday was a crucial moment in the negotiations and a good day for Ireland, North and South.  The Government&rsquo;s long-standing goals in the context of ensuring that the Good Friday Agreement, in all its parts, and North South co-operation will be protected and in maintaining the common travel area were secured.</p>  <p>  Crucially, in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and protecting the gains of the peace process, the UK restated its aspiration to avoid a hard border and also set out in detail for the first time on how this could be achieved.  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the Border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement - which has always been the Government&rsquo;s preference - or through a specific solution for Ireland, the UK has committed that, in the absence of agreed solutions, it "will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement".  It has also been agreed that any agreements put in place will be accompanied by effective mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight.  We very much welcome these assurances and the details that back them up.  I am satisfied that in all eventualities a hard border will be avoided.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work intensively, as part of the EU 27, to ensure that the UK's exit from the EU does not undermine the peace process and does not give rise to the reintroduction of a border on the island or the introduction of one in the Irish Sea.  The avoiding of a hard border is described as a &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; on the UK&rsquo;s part and as the &ldquo;overarching requirement&rdquo;.  We are pleased that discussions will continue through a distinct strand in phase 2 of the negotiations.  It was a very successful strategy in phase 1 to have a distinct Irish strand, along with the financial settlement and citizens' rights strands.  We wanted to have that distinction again in phase 2 because there was a legitimate fear that the Irish issues would be put into a pot with all of the other big trade issues and would not get the same focus or priority.  That is not now going to be the case.  In phase 2, just as in phase 1, there will be a distinct Irish issues chapter or strand.  That will be part of an overall agreement whereby we will have to support solutions for the Irish issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300010#H01700"><p>I thank the Minister and compliment him on the negotiations over the past couple of weeks.  Obviously, the Brexit negotiations are of huge importance in the Border region, particularly for agrifood businesses such as Lakeland Dairies, which has plants on both sides of the frontier.  Businesses along the Border are very anxious to ensure that the seamless border that exists at the moment will continue.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the negotiations will deal primarily with the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  I very much welcome the news that agreement has been reached on phase 1.  What is especially important about that agreement is that there will be no hard border on the island, as the Minister has just outlined.  Anything other than that would have had major implications for the thousands of people who cross the Border every day for work, education and leisure.  However, concerns still remain because the text published last Friday repeatedly emphasises the fact that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  It is important that the EU's understanding of the guarantee is the same as UK's understanding.</p>  <p>  Phase 2, which deals with trade, must now be addressed.  It is important that we maintain a close and coherent focus on what we, as a country, want from this process.  This phase will be particularly important for the agrifood and tourism sectors in Cavan and Monaghan, as well as for our export industries.</p></speech>

The Border counties are in many ways uniquely affected by Brexit.  The Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will effectively become the land border between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  That has created a lot of concern and has given rise to many questions and much anger in Border counties.  That is why the Government took the very stubborn position of refusing to move to phase 2 until it was addressed.  We got fantastic support and solidarity in that from other member states because they understand why Ireland is so concerned about this, North and South.  We also have very clear language on this, which the Deputy will see when the guidelines are published at the end of this week.  Those guidelines make it clear that phase 2 will not be allowed to progress unless we get assurance that the UK will follow through on the commitments it made in phase 1.  That is really important and should be very reassuring for people.</p><p>Some of the ambiguous statements over the weekend on the commitments which were made last Friday have been clarified, both on the EU side and on the British Government side, and that is very welcome.</p></speech>

It is important for companies such as Lakeland Dairies, which have plants on both sides of the Border, and we certainly do not want to go back to the time when there was a very visible Border because it curtailed the development of the area.  I ask that, in future negotiations, positive discrimination be exercised in respect of Border counties because we are only now getting back onto our feet following the Troubles.  We need to be mindful, particularly in the trade negotiations, that towns and villages along the Border are only now rising from the ashes of the Troubles.</p></speech>

It was a deliberate decision by the Taoiseach to send a message that we are prioritising the Border counties in the context of the undoubted concern around Brexit.  In the new capital expenditure programme, which will be announced in the first quarter of next year, there will also be a reinforcement of the focus on the Border counties to ensure that connectivity, North and South of this island, remains strong and that the connection between the Border counties and Dublin is also factored into economic development plans.  The Government is very aware of how vulnerable and exposed many Border communities feel in the context of Brexit and we need to respond to that.  The agreement of last Friday is, hopefully, a strong signal of intent in that regard.</p></speech>

The Kurds there are an extraordinarily resilient people, as they are in Kurdish parts of Turkey.</p>  <p>  A referendum on independence was held by the Kurdistan Regional Government in September 2017.  On 6 November, the Federal Supreme Court of Iraq issued an opinion stating the referendum was illegal, and the Kurdistan Regional Government has confirmed its respect for that opinion.  The Federal Government has taken steps to re-establish a presence at Iraq&rsquo;s external border crossings, including the international airports in the Kurdistan region.  I recognise that, following the referendum, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed by Erbil and Baghdad, and I call on both parties to engage in a constructive and comprehensive dialogue.  Ireland supports efforts towards a mutually agreed solution, based on the full application of the provisions of the Iraqi constitution.</p>  <p>  In its June 2017 Council conclusions, the EU reiterated its steadfast support for Iraq's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and its firm and active commitment to the preservation of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-confessional nature of Iraqi society, including the protection of its minority groups.  In order to achieve the objective of building a common vision on the future of the country, the EU believes that it is now essential for Iraqis to embark on an inclusive process of reconciliation, both at the national and at the local level.  The EU believes that the general interest of Iraqi people is best served through dialogue and co-operation.  I take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s support for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for inclusive democratic measures to allow for genuine national reconciliation, in order to create the environment for long-term viable stability in Iraq and the wider region.  If specific commitments were made by my predecessor, I will follow up on them and get back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

In 1920, Kurdistan was to be established as an independent state but, following the treaty of Lausanne after the disastrous Greek-Turkish war, the opportunity was lost.  I asked the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan, whether the annual report on Turkey had been received by the Foreign Affairs Council, particularly in relation to the wave of repression that occurred in Turkey following the attempted coup in 2016.  The Minister said that, in one of the few positive elements of the Iraq war, the autonomous region of Kurdistan had emerged.  Do we have any specific relationship with that region?  I note what the Minister said about the referendum and the large numbers of Kurdish people in Syrian and Iran, where there has been similarly severe repression over the decades.</p></speech>

Three years of war have had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life.  The death of former President Saleh has led to increased violence this month.  The closure of land, air and sea ports in November, including for the transit of humanitarian aid, was an alarming development, which we responded to at the time.  The humanitarian situation is reaching crisis point.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, and we are committed to maintaining support.  My predecessor, Deputy Flanagan, raised concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the disastrous humanitarian effects with ministerial counterparts in Saudi Arabia and the UAE on a number of occasions.  More recently, officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin last month and passed on my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access.  In recent days, the embassy of Ireland in Saudi Arabia has conveyed to the Government of Yemen that the reopening of Yemeni ports, for both humanitarian and commercial traffic, is essential to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue.</p><p>At the Foreign Affairs Council this week, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen.  In my interventions, I highlighted the need for more robust political engagement for a sustainable solution.  My officials and I will continue to raise my concerns on the humanitarian access issues with the Saudi authorities, as well as with other parties, and at EU and international levels.  In September, we worked with other EU countries to get a resolution passed at the Human Rights Council in Geneva to set up an independent panel of international experts to investigate potential violations of humanitarian law in Yemen in the conduct of the conflict there.</p></reply>

Brother Kevin's organisation is an iconic illustration of the generosity of people and the wider community.  To witness volunteers from all strata of society is heartening; what is not so heartening is the lack of a proper meaningful response from Government.  The reality from the front line is there is a terrible disconnect between official pronouncements on housing and homelessness and the experiences of those who are without homes.  When I visited the centre in April, I raised some issues with the Taoiseach's predecessor.  I pointed out that in 2013 there were 4,747 children attending for lunch and by 2016 the number was 8,353.  That is a 76% increase and a shocking indictment on society and Government.  I was there with Deputy Barry Cowen yesterday and, depressingly, the figures are getting worse rather than better.  The figures for children attending for meals at the centre between January and September 2017 are worse than the figures for the entirety of 2016.  In 2017, 4,500 people attended the medical clinic in the centre.  Prescription charges are paid for by the organisation.  There are 700 people for dinner every day and another 300 for breakfast.  Every week, 1,900 food parcels are given out; 3,000 people are expected in Christmas week; and 250 baby parcels are given out weekly, which is a new service.  The centre raised &euro;3.5 million from people; the Government gives it &euro;450,000.</p>  <p>  More crucially, when I raised it in the D&aacute;il last April, I raised some very specific issues.  The first was the appointment of a social worker to the centre.  The second issue was the appointment of a child welfare officer to act as first responder particularly in the case of child protection issues.  In terms of child protection issues, the workers at the centre are very worried about the vulnerability of children who attend.  They were promised a HSE link officer or child welfare officer.  The centre has not had a social worker since 2012.  The prescription charge should be waived for medical services at the centre.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, visited last year and the Minister, Deputy Harris, visited last November.  Commitments were given on all those fronts and none was delivered.  Nothing has happened, which I find extraordinary and unacceptable.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and ensure the appointment of a dedicated social worker to the centre?  Will he intervene and ensure the appointment of a child welfare officer to protect vulnerable people?  Will he acknowledge that the housing plan is not working?  There is no difference on the ground despite all the statements we are getting.  The reality on the ground is becoming depressingly worse from talking to those at the coalface.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300012#K00400"><p>As the Deputy has acknowledged, a number of Ministers have visited the centre in recent times.  The Ministers, Deputies Harris, Coveney and Zappone, have attended so I do not know why a social worker or child welfare officer has not been appointed but I will follow it up.  I was not aware of the issue until this morning.  I will check up on it.</p>  <p>  In terms of issues more generally, it is important that I say the Government takes issues such as child poverty and housing very seriously.  As I said yesterday, I believe homelessness is a stain on our society.  We will do everything we can to reduce it in the years ahead and eliminate it if possible.  The housing plan is working but it will take time.  We are seeing a very significant increase in the number of social houses being built and provided.  There will be about 2,000 this year and 3,800 next year.  When one adds in other things such as voids, long-term leases and purchases of privately developed housing, it will be 7,000 next year.  This year if we take the private and public sector together we will probably build more new homes than any year since 2010.  What happened in this country, largely as a consequence of economic mismanagement in the past, was a construction and banking collapse.  As a consequence of that, for the best part of seven years very few new homes were built either by the private sector or the Government so we are catching up on seven years during which there was no housing supply.  It will take us time to catch up.  Notwithstanding that, every day people are being housed by the Government.  Every working day, 80 individuals and their families are provided with housing by the Government.  They are new tenancies and by next year, we will increase it to 100 a day.  We are starting to see some results.  It is significant that the number of families in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels is falling and shows evidence of some progress.  I was pleased to visit one of the family hubs last week to see how they operate and to see the quality of the accommodation that is now provided.</p>  <p>  When it comes to rough sleeping, we have provided extra capacity in the system to make sure that nobody has to sleep rough over the winter period and into the spring and beyond.  An extra 200 single and double beds have been provided across the city to make sure nobody has to sleep rough.  We know from last Sunday night's count that there were spare beds available for both men and women in the city.</p>  <p>  In terms of the issues the Deputy raised around children in general, I have not had a chance to visit the centre but I hope to do so in the future.  I do not know what type of system of means testing is used.  The broader picture regarding child welfare and child poverty is that child poverty is falling again having risen for a number of years.  We have seen an increase in employment which is putting more money in parents' pockets and we are seeing some real differences.  They are not just words; they are real differences and real changes introduced by Government both this year and next year.  For example, in a few weeks' time, the prescription charge will go down for everyone under 70, including children.  We will continue to reduce it in the years ahead as resources allow.  Social welfare payments are going up.  They went up this year for the first time in eight years.  They will go up again next year from March.  We have expanded free school meals, something I did as Minister for Social Protection, to all DEIS schools and beyond DEIS schools because more than half of children who are disadvantaged are not in DEIS schools.  We are making real efforts as a Government and if the Deputy is honest about it and looks at the broader picture, he will see some progress is being made but we are only getting started.</p></speech>

I think 76 have been delivered.  That is our problem.  I have heard all this before in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  I have heard it all and I have seen very little delivery on the ground.  Ministers visited the centre and a child welfare officer could not be appointed to the centre for some reason - I do not know what it is.  The centre depends on the generosity of people for money.  They got &euro;3.5 million through collections and &euro;450,000 from Government.  Surely, the least the Government could do is ensure that the Ministers who visit follow through on the visit and make sure the issue of child protection in particular is looked after and that such an officer is provided as well as a social worker and other services it requires.  There are fantastic examples of volunteers.  The Peter McVerry Trust, Simon Communities, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland and the Penny Dinners all say it is getting worse on the ground.</p></speech>

I have explained the backdrop to this - a six or seven-year period after the economic crisis in the causing of which Fianna F&aacute;il had a very significant hand.

During Leaders' Questions, I made a modest proposal to increase respite care hours by 20%, which would cost &euro;13 million.  I also proposed that the Government should provide 2 million additional home-help hours and 2,500 home-care packages at a cost of &euro;72 million.  The Taoiseach committed to examine these proposals.  I then wrote to him setting these out in more detail.  I have yet to receive a reply but I hope that is an indication that he is still considering these proposals.  It would make a meaningful long-term difference to the lives of people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Yesterday the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced that he had secured an additional &euro;10 million for respite services, which I welcome, particularly as some of it will be allocated to my constituency.  According to the 2016 census, more than 20,000 people in Louth and east Meath have a disability.  They also have less services than other parts of the State.  Only nine respite beds are available for adults with intellectual disabilities and there are no emergency services.  The Government needs to do a lot of work to rectify this.  The new services announced yesterday need to be put in place go gasta.  The details of a plan need to be revealed as quickly as possible.  The HSE was not able to give us any details this morning.</p>  <p>  Yesterday's announcement was long overdue.  Some of it is deficient.  For example, only one in four full-time carers will be eligible for a free GP-visit card as announced yesterday.  That is because the card will be given only to carers in receipt of the carer's allowance.  All of these carers should be allocated medical cards.</p>  <p>  Last week my proposition included the provision of home-help hours and home-care packages.  There is no mention of this in yesterday's announcement.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will get around to this when he eventually gets around to answering my letter.  As a doctor, I am sure the Taoiseach is aware the issue of in-home respite hours is crucial for some families.  On a number of occasions I have raised with the him the case of Brendan, who has not got any in-home respite hours in the past five months.  Incidentally, he got a total of 15 nights' respite in the past year.  In another case, Sam, whose mother the Taoiseach has met, has not got respite care since he turned 18.  When will they be able to get their respite care?  I ask the Taoiseach to outline the timetable for the services announced yesterday.  When will he respond to my other proposals? </p></speech>

That will provide an additional 19,000 respite nights per year for people who need it, which is an important step forward, and nine new dedicated houses for respite will be established throughout 2018, with one in each community health area.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Finian McGrath, from the Independent Alliance part of the Government, has done a huge amount of work on this issue and will provide more details in the coming weeks.  That will be contained in the HSE's detailed operational plan, which usually comes out early in the new year.</p>  <p>  Home-help hours and home-care packages are matters for the 2018 HSE service plan, which we hope to have ready in a few weeks' time.</p>  <p>  It was also announced yesterday that people in receipt of carer's allowance would receive a doctor-visit card as a right.  Deputies, who are familiar with the system, will know that the carer's allowance is given to full-time carers and is means tested.  I cannot remember the details of the means test off the top of my head, but it is one of the more generous means tests in the social welfare system.  Essentially the carer's allowance is geared to people who have had to give up a job in order to care full time.  It provides income support they would not otherwise get.  It is a positive announcement and an important move forward by the Government that people who are in receipt of carer's allowance will have a doctor-visit card as a right.  Respite allows the person who needs care to be cared for but we also need to care for carers themselves.  That is why it is important that they should be able to visit their doctor without having to pay.</p>  <p>  This is about something I genuinely believe in, which is incremental, sustainable progress.  This is not just the end; it is part of what we are doing.  Last year, for example, we restored in full the respite care grant, now called the carer's support grant.  We increased the carer's allowance for the first time in eight years.  We also changed the rules so that when somebody is no longer caring, they continue to get the carer's allowance for 12 weeks to give them time to get their life back in order.  Next year, we will announce an extra &euro;10 million for respite, a doctor-visit card for every person receiving carer's allowance as a right and an increase in the carer's allowance again in March.  In a sustainable incremental way, I want every year to do two or three significant things that improve the lives of people with disabilities and improve the lives of their carers.  That is the commitment the Government is demonstrating and following through on.</p></speech>

I hope he will do so quickly and I hope he does not send me a "Dear John" letter.</p>  <p>  According to a response received last night to a parliamentary question from an Teachta Louise O'Reilly, our health spokesperson, the HSE will have provided 14,293 fewer overnight respite sessions and 591 fewer day respite sessions this year than it did last year.  When that is put into the package announced yesterday, the additional &euro;10 million is supposed to provide 19,000 respite nights.  In effect that means the HSE will be providing an additional 4,707 respite sessions over what it provided in 2016.</p><p>The Taoiseach should figure that out.  That is the way it works out.  If that is not accurate, he should tell me, but if it is accurate, does he agree with me that it is not good enough?  There is a lot of catching up to be done on this issue.  This is about citizens who have rights and who want to be treated as citizens despite the fact that they have disabilities.  They need to be given full services, and the Taoiseach's Government needs to fix itself in terms of that function.</p></speech>

As a result of that, an additional 10,000 children became entitled to a full medical card last year and 40,000 children received a medical card this year without any reviews.  If anyone is being reasonable in their assessment, they will see that what we are trying to do, now that have fixed the economy, balanced the books and the economy is in a strong place, is to make incremental progress year on year to improve living standards, especially for those who need assistance the most such as carers and people with disabilities.  I accept that we are catching up.  That is absolutely right.  We will catch up and we will make more progress every year for as long as this Government is in office.  I have a different philosophy to Deputy Adams, who is a revolutionary socialist.  He believes in destroying the system, removing everything, bringing it down to a certain level, and then creating some sort of Utopia.</p></speech>

The cost of accommodation is out of control and out of the reach of too many.  Child care bills are rising.  There is no sign of any incremental progress on the extension of general practitioner, GP, care for children on which we were making progress.  The modern workplace puts enormous pressure on parents.  They fight to sustain their careers and raise their families but the recent budget did little for those parents.  There was no increase in child benefit.  Cr&egrave;ches raised their prices.  There was no subsidy increase on child care and nothing to address the ever-rising price of a home.  They got tax cuts that cost them money because they have to pay more for the basic services the State should be providing from health care to child care to education.</p><p>Last week, the ESRI made it official.  It did not get much notice, but its study on the distributional impact of tax and welfare in the last budget confirmed that it would not even give the price of a cup of coffee.  Instead, it would cost people.  It shows all income groups will suffer losses, with the lowest income groups being hardest hit and the best off losing least.  Families with a single earner lose most.  In an economy where the cost of everything is increasing and where wages are not rising fast enough, people will be worse off.  In a recovering economy, that is some achievement.</p><p>There are actions that could be taken that would give parents a break.  Parents in Ireland have the right to 18 weeks of unpaid parental leave.  For many, that leave is absolutely necessary to care for a sick child or other issues, but it is at a huge cost.  A Programme for a Partnership Government states that the Government will increase paid parental leave in the first year of birth.  In the manifesto for leadership that the Taoiseach produced, he said he would improve and extend contributory benefits such as parental leave.  He said something similar in his address to the Fine Gael national conference recently, yet <i>The Sunday Times</i>reported last weekend, in a report written by Valerie Flynn, that the Government wants to delay the implementation of the new European Union law that would give Irish workers the right to four months of paid parental leave.  An Irish official was reported to have said that the Irish Government has reservations about these matters.</p><p>My question is a simple one.  Why, on the one hand, is the Government saying it wants to give paid parental leave when, on the other, behind closed doors in Brussels, it is saying the opposite?  Will the Government introduce four months of paid parental leave as is being discussed in the EU directive, and when will it do so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300014#M00800"><p>I am not involved personally in the negotiations in Brussels but it is Government policy that we want to introduce paid parental leave allowing parents to share the leave among themselves.  Currently, maternity benefit and paternity benefit are separate.  We would like to have a parental leave with parental benefit attached to it, which would allow parents to share it, and we will be guided by the European law in that regard.  If the Deputy wants evidence of that, this Government of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents have increased maternity benefit and paternity benefit twice.  We have extended maternity benefit to cover children who were born prematurely to give their mothers more time with them.  We have also introduced paid paternity leave and gave an increase.  It is our plan to move towards a new system of parental leave with parental benefit attached to it, which parents can share, although realistically we are talking about legislation next year and its introduction the year after that.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will know that the ESRI does its analysis in a particular way.  He was a major critic of it when he was around the Cabinet table and he will know that when the ESRI does its analysis, it does not take into account the benefit of any service improvements so if we improve the health service, education or bring in subsidised child care, that does not count for anything using the ESRI simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, analysis.  It also uses a particular system where it adjusts for average increases in wage earnings.</p>  <p>  What people will do throughout January is look at their payslips and throughout January, February and March they will look at the amount of money coming into their pockets.  The people who are working will see a reduction in their universal social charge.  People on middle incomes will see that the standard rate cut-off point will go up and they will pay less of their income at the higher rate.  People who need medicines will find that their prescription charges go down in January not just for people with medical cards, but also those who do not have medical cards.  People with children will find that they are getting a full second year of free preschool.  People who are on low pay, such as those on the minimum wage, will see the minimum wage go up in January.  Public servants will see pay restoration and pay increases happening in two tranches next year, in January and October.  People whose children are in receipt of child care, particularly those with children between six months and three years, will see the subsidies for child care continuing throughout the year, with targeted benefits for those on low incomes.  As mentioned earlier, people in receipt of carer's allowance will see a right to a GP visit card being extended to them.  Low income families, those in receipt of family income supplement, will gain as much as &euro;10 extra a week from March when those changes come into effect and lone parents who are working will have significant gains as well.  The Deputy can try to denigrate the Government achievements all he likes.  What we are starting to see now, which is something I am committed to making happen as Taoiseach and as Head of this Government, is all individuals and all families in all parts of the country seeing their living standards improve as the economy improves.</p></speech>

The truth is that most people will see some improvement to the value of about a cup of coffee.  The real cost of providing child care and being able to afford a home is receding from them, but that reality is lost on the Taoiseach.  On the net question I asked, the Taoiseach stated that he is in favour of paid parental leave but we will have a law next year and perhaps parental leave being paid the year after that.  Is it the Taoiseach's commitment in his programme for Government or his leadership manifesto that it may happen in two years' time?  Why is it reported that he is resisting the EU legislation or is the report, authoritatively put in one of the national newspapers, false?  Is that what the Taoiseach is saying?</p></speech>

We have maternity leave and maternity benefit for the mother and paternity leave and paternity benefit for the father.  As a Government, we have increased the cash payment in the last budget and will increase it again in March.  We also brought in new rules, particularly around premature babies.  That is the current system.</p><p>What the Government wants to do and wants to see happen at a European level is a move to a new system of parental leave which would effectively replace maternity and paternity leave and allow couples the autonomy to choose how to share that leave.  At present, a European regulation to bring that into effect is under discussion.  I am not party to the detailed negotiations on that but I can absolutely assure Deputy Howlin that the Government intends to support the regulation, introduce parental leave and parental benefit in Ireland and change the current system to the one I have outlined.  There should still be dedicated maternity leave for mothers because they are the ones who give birth and they need particular time to recover.  There should be a dedicated carve-out for mothers, and then perhaps the rest can be shared between the two parents.</p> <p> Before we introduce legislation, we want to find out what the European legislation is going to be.  It would make no sense at all for this Government to enact legislation in respect of parental leave here in Ireland in the next few months only to discover six months later that there is a European directive or regulation to which it runs contrary.</p></speech>

They worked extremely well for years until the Government started tinkering with them, constantly changing the rules and regulations to such an extent that their future is being put in jeopardy.  Sponsors are being scared off by the increasingly demanding conditions being placed on them, on the supervisors they employ to run these schemes and on participants.  We saw evidence of this in Galway city earlier this year when a project which provided valuable experience was closed by the sponsoring group.  This was probably not the first - it certainly will not be the last - sponsor to pull out of a CE scheme or decide against opting into one because of the barriers that are placed in the way of the schemes.</p>  <p>  While this Government and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection claim to be supportive of the work being done through CE schemes, their actions suggest otherwise.  The only satisfied party involved is the Department.  The time participants are allowed to spend on schemes and the amount of training involved have both been reduced.  Costs have risen but cuts to the budget for materials have not been restored.  This has resulted in a fall in productivity of the schemes.  It also means that there is no sustainability of service.  CE schemes are among the few subventions the State offers to voluntary groups, whose sustainability often depends on the work being carried out by the participants on the scheme.  The constant changing of work practices of participants and supervisors and the obligations of sponsors have diminished the appeal of these schemes for everyone.  It is funny that the Department should constantly trot out the line that the people taking part in these schemes are not employed by it.  In doing so, it can keep them at arm's length.  However, it is the Department which keeps laying down new demands on how the schemes should be run.</p>  <p>  I would like to pay special tribute to the supervisors, who are the linchpins of the schemes.</p></speech>

The Department does not seem to acknowledge the vast amount of work being undertaken by supervisors, and how constantly changing procedures and requirements make this role extremely difficult.  This group of people do not have pensions or contracts of indefinite duration and have had no pay increases in the past ten years despite Labour Court recommendations.  The benchmarking procedure relating to them has been abandoned and there has been a long, drawn-out process regarding pensions.  The latter are currently being examined by the community sector high-level forum.  Having spoken with a number of supervisors, I know that they do not hold out any great hope of a positive outcome in the context of the forum's consideration of the pensions issue.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge the tremendous work being done by CE schemes and ensure that the Department rights a wrong for supervisors by providing them with proper contracts, a pay increase and pension rights, which are long overdue?</p></speech>

We were certainly in government at the time in any event.  It started off as a different scheme, called social employment, and then became community employment.</p>  <p>  CE has huge value.  It has a duel value in that it provides employment and training opportunities for people, and also provides important community services as well.  The number of people on CE schemes stands at 21,956.  That is down by approximately 2% on last year, which makes sense when the economy is growing, when there is more employment and when there are fewer people who are unemployed.  As unemployment goes up and employment falls, the numbers increase.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the CE supervisors, I am advised that they have been seeking, through their trade unions, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a Labour Court recommendation which was issued on 22 July 2008 relating to the provision of a pension scheme.  The CE scheme supervisors are not employees of the State or the Government.  They are employees of private companies in some cases and of community and voluntary sector bodies in others.  The taxpayer, therefore, is not responsible for funding the pensions of such employees, even when the companies involved are reliant on State funding for their operations.  The same would apply, for example, to commercial entities that do work for the State, to individual contractors who do work for the State and to semi-State companies as well.  As the Deputy will know, Labour Court findings are made in respect of employers.  As the employer in this instance was not the State-----</p></speech>

The CE schemes do tremendous work.  These schemes would not be in operation if it were not for the supervisors.  The supervisors on CE schemes run by certain local authorities, including Galway City Council, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have full pension rights.  The Taoiseach must solve this issue.  The supervisors are employed through the CE schemes.  However, those schemes are administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which, in turn, is controlled by the Government.  The Department constantly imposes rules and regulations on these schemes and tells those involved how they should be run.  New procedures are being brought in every week and the supervisors have to implement them.  Those people are entitled to absolutely nothing when they retire.  I know one supervisor who cannot even get a mortgage in view of the pittance he is being paid.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach must right this wrong.  The supervisors should be brought under the remit of the Department.  They should be entitled to pensions and should be put on proper contracts of work.  I ask that the Taoiseach intervene personally in order to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

We just had the penultimate Leaders' Questions and my last of the season.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the programme for Government committed to publishing a new updated action plan for educational inclusion with a particular focus on DEIS schools.  Emphasis was to be put on a broad-based package of measures, which would encompass all aspects of education impacted by disadvantage.  One learns from today's<i></i>edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>that 250 schools across the country that applied for inclusion in the DEIS scheme were excluded and that only 79 have been added to the scheme.  Will the Taoiseach indicate why that happened?  Why was there an absolute lack of transparency in respect of those particular schools being excluded from the DEIS programme?  Children from a disadvantaged background are essentially being refused inclusion in a scheme that could assist them in their educational achievements.</p></speech>

No school applied and no school was excluded.  The situation is that we provided &euro;15 million extra for disadvantaged schools in this year's budget, in line with the plan we had published.  As a result of that we have provided for 79 additional schools to join those schools already in the disadvantaged category.  We have expanded the number of schools in the programme.  In the context of planning for the future, my Department looked at the possibility of further extensions to the disadvantaged programme.  That is where the figure the Deputy has quoted came from.  It was in a reply to a freedom of information request.  The Department was looking at possible scenarios, one of which was to extend the scope of disadvantage to provide for additional schools.</p></speech>

It is about the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017.  The Taoiseach will know that hundreds of young people are in some form of mental health distress and are on waiting lists to see a psychiatrist.  Some 2,500 young people are waiting for mental health services.  Some 317 have been on waiting lists for more than a year.  Can the Taoiseach imagine being on a waiting list for more than a year?  There are no child and adolescent mental health services available in the north Louth area.  People under pressure in the Ladywell facility are doing exceptional work but the facility is not fit for purpose.  Will the Taoiseach commit to the provision of fully staffed and adequately funded mental health services?  Will he provide 24-7 mental health services?  Will he update the D&aacute;il on the status of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill?</p></speech>

We have had discussions in this House, and I have had discussions with my former Department, in respect of section 39 organisations.  Staff in those section 39 organisations, who took cuts mirroring those in the FEMPI legislation, have a legitimate expectation of pay restoration at the same rate and at the same time as the rest of the public service.  I understand that there are difficulties in ring-fencing money to do that, although there has been an additional general allocation to section 39 organisations.  As a matter of public policy, will the Taoiseach or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform make a declaration that, where workers in section 39 organisations suffered reductions mirroring those in the FEMPI legislation, their pay will be restored at the same time and at the same rate as all other public sector workers?</p></speech>

Obviously a number of things need to be done.  A referendum Bill must be passed; legislation, or at least heads of legislation, must be published; a referendum commission needs to be established; and time is required for a campaign.  A date in May is achievable, but only with the co-operation of the House.  I ask for that co-operation.</p></speech>

It is not for the work he has done or for what he has achieved as a Minister.</p><p>I welcome that more rural bus link services have been announced by Deputy Heydon.  They will be a help to towns and villages at certain times.  However, 38 buses will not service all of rural Ireland.  I am amazed that Deputy Heydon, being from County Kildare, claims to be a rural Deputy.  If I were to take him and the Minister, Deputy Ross, to rural Kerry and leave them in the Black Valley or the Pocket in Glanmore without satnav, neither would arrive in Killarney in time for their Christmas dinner.  The service discussed by Deputy Heydon is only a camouflage.  Members of Fine Gael are supporting the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill and sacrificing the people in rural Ireland.  I ask the Government to drop the Bill because it is not rural-proofed and does not explain how those it will make more lonely and isolated will manage.  The Government has no proposal to deal with that.  Deputy Heydon said the Bill was to ensure that when people such as the Deputy and his wife go to Kerry, they will not get hit by a driver who has had three or four pints.  I want the Deputy to withdraw that remark because no driver does that in Kerry.</p></speech>

As I said, speaker after speaker has admitted that we need a proper rural transport service, which we do not currently have.

It is now December and this is the first time that Members have had sight of the report, notwithstanding that the report itself outlines that transparency is of the utmost importance, that a culture of transparency should be cultivated and so on.

There are several thousand such home owners in County Donegal.  The blocks are defective as a result of a mineral, mica, being present in them.  As the Taoiseach knows, an expert panel was established to consider the issue and it reported to the Government.  I have raised the issue with the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy English, in the House.  The Minister of State committed to home owners that he would revisit County Donegal before Christmas to update them on progress and to specifically report back on social housing options for many of those worst affected whose homes have become unsafe to live in.  I also asked the Taoiseach when the report would be discussed at Cabinet and he committed that would be done before Christmas.  Has it been discussed?  Has a decision been made by the Government to deliver a compensation scheme for the affected home owners and, if not, how many Cabinet meetings remain to take place before Christmas?  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure the commitment is met and that affected home owners do not see more broken commitments in terms of the Government handling of the issue.</p></speech>

It will be brought to Cabinet early in the new year.  Senator Michelle Mulherin, Deputy Joe McHugh and several other colleagues have raised the issue with me and with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has met affected residents and home owners.  The report will outline the potential issues involved and the options for response.  The Government has responded to similar issues in the past, such as the measures put in place to deal with homes affected by pyrite.</p></speech>

If such a person gets a prosthetic limb from a private company besides the one that is contracted to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, the hospital refuses to give him or her the intensive physiotherapy he or she requires.  A company called Mobility Ireland seems to have this contract, and no one else can get in on the game.</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills this morning, in response to a freedom of information request, indicated that 257 schools met the qualification criteria for DEIS but have not received any funding, including a number in my constituency, among five in Tipperary town.

I assure the Deputy that no school was excluded.  What happened this year was that we expanded the programme to bring in 79 additional schools.  No school in the scheme was withdrawn; we have expanded the scheme.  We have considered extending the scheme further in future years.  This was the subject of the freedom of information request, and it was in the context of the possibility of extending the scheme that the number the Deputy mentioned arose.  No school is being excluded from any criteria.  The existing scheme is upheld in all respects.  The new scheme that we introduced brought in 79 additional schools.  We will examine the new 2016 data to see whether there are schools that would qualify at that high level of disadvantage that did not get in among the 79.  If there are such schools, we will include them, but a wider extension is a matter for future years.</p></speech>

I know he has spoken to me before about this previously.  Recent Central Statistics Office figures show that 700 people living in County Roscommon must get on a train or a bus or into a car every day and travel to Dublin for work.

In fairness, I do not break the rules.  This is in the programme for Government.  We are over 20 months into this Government, but very little has happened on regional development.  The Taoiseach talks about it the whole time and constantly says it will happen, but it is not happening in our county or many other rural counties.  When will we see real jobs coming to the regions?  These people have to get up at 4 o'clock and 4.30 in the morning.

Obviously, people make decisions for many different reasons.  I appreciate it is a very long way to travel from Roscommon to Dublin, but there are people in other rural counties who choose to commute and who want to live in rural areas and commute to work.  One cannot assume that if 700 jobs were provided in Roscommon, all these people would necessarily give up their jobs in Dublin and take up the jobs in Roscommon.</p></speech>

One can imagine the distress, hardship and anxiety this caused the mother and child.  This happens regularly.

It has been a number of years since plans were announced to build a brand new Garda station in Macroom.  A new station is much needed.  The current accommodation is inadequate not just for the garda&iacute; to carry out their business, but also for the public, victims of crime and people who want to go to the Garda station, whether they have plucked up the courage to make a statement or whether they wish to meet garda&iacute; for other reasons.</p><p>They need to know there will be an adequate building and facilities that will afford privacy and so on.</p> <p> A site has been available for well over a year and the project is ready to proceed to planning and design.  No progress has been made, however, because Macroom station is bound together with a number of others, including those in Clonmel and Sligo.

The conditions in Clonmel station, for both garda&iacute; and the public, are appalling.  We have had announcement after announcement that work on the building would commence but, as is the case with Macroom station, there is a hold-up because of the bundling with Sligo.  Will the Minister ensure work commences on the four stations in this bundle?  Clonmel is the largest inland town in the country but its Garda station is more suited to Cromwellian times.  It is unfair to expect garda&iacute; to work in such a hovel or the public to use it.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300019#R00500"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Derelict Sites Act 1990 to increase the levy placed on derelict sites; to ensure the register of derelict sites compiled by a local authority is made publicly available on the local authority's website; to ensure protection for the rights of homeowners who have moved into residential care and own a derelict site; to amend the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 to extend the definition of a &quot;vacant site&quot; to include sites below 0.05 hectares; to ensure the documents associated with the entry of a site onto the register of vacant sites are made publicly available on the local authority's website; to increase the vacant site levy in each subsequent year; to increase the scope of the levy to include properties in negative or low equity; and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>I am introducing this Bill in view of the need for greater urgency and transparency in tackling the housing crisis we are facing and the ongoing dereliction in our cities, which is not being addressed with sufficient speed or breadth by the Government.  Our objective is to achieve living cities in whose centres people of all different incomes and backgrounds can live.  One of the mechanisms necessary to achieve this aim is by means of a strengthening and tightening of the way in which we deal with derelict and vacant sites in cities.  The Bill includes several simple but critical provisions that we hope all parties will support.</p><p>With regard to derelict sites, we are proposing that the same higher charge that was introduced in respect of vacant sites should also be applicable to them.  We need that type of punitive measure in place to encourage the development of those sites.  In addition, we are proposing to extend the provisions relating to how the register is maintained in order to achieve greater transparency.  There is a social justice consideration to take on board in that the owners of derelict sites may themselves be vulnerable and possibly living under the social care of the State.  We must be cognisant of this possibility in our application of compulsory purchase orders so that people are not left vulnerable through the actions of the State.</p><p>In the case of vacant sites, the application of the levy provided for in the 2015 Act must be extended to include sites of less than 0.05 ha.  A survey of vacant sites in Dublin city in 2015 showed that of the 280 sites examined, 143 were below that size threshold.  A January 2017 survey of 979 sites found that only 385 were deemed eligible for the vacant site levy, with 174 excluded from the application of the levy on the basis that they were below the size threshold.  To give some context, 0.05 ha is roughly equivalent in size to a basketball court.  If we are to create living streets and cities, vacant sites below the threshold must be included in the levy, so that they can be used for housing, apartment developments, mini-parks and a whole range of urban uses.  Their current non-usage is wasteful and is killing urban streets.</p><p>We would do well to take the advice of Mr. Thomas Drummond, Under-Secretary for Ireland in the mid-19th century, who said that property has its duties as well as its rights.  There are several high-profile examples of vacant and derelict sites which put the problem in context and illustrate the utter lack of willingness by the Government to act to address it.  The Iveagh Market site off John Dillon Street in the centre of the Liberties has been vacant for 25 years and there is no sign of it being developed.  This was an important civic space and part of the texture of the Liberties, but it is has been left lying idle because of a lack of ambition, political direction and willingness to pursue the interests of society against those of individual property owners.  A more recent example is the unfinished development of the Kilternan Hotel, formerly the Dublin Sports Hotel, which was almost completed when the property market crashed and the owner could not meet the bank repayments.  The building was put into the National Asset Management Agency and sold on to a new developer, but it has been left to fall into dilapidation.  These examples of dereliction show the ongoing lack of care when it comes to creating a vibrant urban environment.</p><p>This legislation can play a critical role in addressing the problems caused by dereliction and dilapidation in urban areas by giving the State greater powers in the management of both vacant and derelict sites.  Doing so is an important part of addressing the housing crisis.</p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Foreign policy issues may also be raised.</p><p>The President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, will also chair further discussions on the future of Europe as part of his leaders' agenda, which will include discussion on migration and economic and monetary union, EMU.  We will also discuss the future of EMU at a euro summit on 15 December, in an inclusive format involving all 27 remaining member states.</p><p>Ireland is very supportive of President Tusk's task force and its efforts to drive forward the debate on the future of Europe and I look forward to a very constructive exchange of views.</p> <p> The European Council will also meet in Article 50 format on Friday to consider the Brexit negotiations.  Following long and intensive negotiations over the past weeks we have reached a satisfactory conclusion on the issues relating to Ireland in phase one.  We have achieved all we set out to achieve in phase one of the negotiations: to maintain the common travel area, to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process and to avoid a hard border.  We have the assurances and guarantees we need from the United Kingdom and support for them from the European Union.  The parameters have been set and they are agreeable.</p> <p> Irish issues were one of three critical areas that needed to be dealt with in these talks, before the EU and the UK could proceed to phase 2 issues on the shape of the future relationship and possible transitional arrangements.  Given the view of the EU&rsquo;s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, that sufficient progress has been achieved, the European Council is expected to decide on moving to the second phase.  I meet and speak regularly with my EU counterparts, including Chancellor Merkel, bilaterally and at formal and informal meetings of the European Council and I use every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests.  The support of all our EU partners has been strong, consistent and essential in ensuring that the unique challenges we face on the island of Ireland as a result of the UK's withdrawal from the EU are dealt with.  I emphasised the need for firm commitments from the UK that a hard border will be avoided under whatever new arrangements are arrived at, recognising the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland, its history and its geography.</p> <p> As he made clear in his public remarks after our recent meeting, President Tusk is unequivocal in his support for Ireland and the need to ensure that there will be no hard border.  I took the opportunity at the meeting to thank President Tusk for his strong and unwavering solidarity since the very beginning of the process.  I also spoke by phone to Commission President Juncker in relation to the EU-UK negotiations on Brexit, in particular the outline of an EU-UK agreement which would allow us to move to the second phase of negotiations.  President Juncker was also fully supportive for Ireland's position in this context.  I spoke with Prime Minister May a number of times during the week beginning Monday, 4 December.  I underlined that the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU must not in any way undermine the peace process or give rise to the reintroduction of a border on the island of Ireland.  I met Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands in Dublin on 6 December.  I expressed my gratitude for his continued solidarity on the Irish-specific issues in relation to Brexit.  We also discussed the future of Europe, the strong bilateral relationship between our two countries and the strengthening of our alliances within the EU.  As two countries that neighbour the United Kingdom we spoke about the shape and format of a new EU-UK agreement.</p></reply>

The Government has made it clear that it believes the communique commits the British state to maintain a regulatory alignment between the North and the South on all matters, even in the event of no deal.  EU ministers are reported to have agreed that Friday's communique will be David Davis proofed and they warn that Brexit discussions could be suspended.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that?</p>  <p>  I am also very concerned with the Taoiseach's response to me yesterday.  After refusing to answer this question on a number of occasions in the last weeks yesterday he accepted that citizens in the North will not have access to the European Court of Justice when the British Government removes the jurisdiction of that court from the North after eight years.  This would be a direct breach of the Good Friday Agreement.  If the Taoiseach has signed up to this then it has dire consequences around the issue of rights.  The issue of rights is at the core of the difficulties in the Assembly at this time.  I shall return to this issue later when we have a better chance to deal with the pre-Council statements.</p></speech>

While almost everybody is in favour of our Army joining international peacekeeping missions such as those in Chad or our Naval Service in the Mediterranean Sea, Fine Gael obviously has rather ambivalent feelings about neutrality.  Unlike many other countries that have positions of neutrality, in the run-up to this meeting the Taoiseach seemed awfully anxious actually to sign up in full rather than express in detail the reservations that people in Ireland are entitled to discuss and consider as they come to know more about it.  Does the Taoiseach see it as a particular advantage in respect of his communication and presentation of himself as Taoiseach, which is obviously very important to him, that he should go to tomorrow's meeting having rushed through in the last days before Christmas and without adequate discussion the arrangements and commitment to PESCO by the Taoiseach and his Government?</p>  <p>  With regard to the statement made by Michel Barnier that Ireland will be subject to a special negotiating path in the Brexit negotiations, will the Taoiseach outline what this implies strategically?  Recently the Taoiseach said that Irish negotiators and advisers would be in the room next door to the Barnier team.  I and others have commented that as Ireland gets down to the nitty gritty of very detailed provisions, regulations and laws in some wide areas, it will be necessary to have very experienced trade lawyers, for example, and people with particular skills in these types of negotiations.  Has the Taoiseach planned for this so Ireland has the kinds of skill-sets we need to negotiate the best deal for Ireland?</p></speech>

As we have only ten minutes each to speak I will concentrate on those questions on the non-Brexit items to be dealt with at the Eurogroup meeting and the full summit.  I point out to the Taoiseach that the practice is continuing whereby more information about our Government's position and agenda items is available to us in Brussels than is available here.</p>  <p>  At the euro area summit President Tusk has proposed that agreement would be reached on a specific timeline for decisions on a range of issues.  For example, it proposed a formal decision on digital taxation would be taken in March and other eurozone changes would be addressed in quick succession.  I have repeatedly raised the issue that Ireland should insist that no decisions be reached without detailed impact studies on proposals.  It is simply unacceptable that major proposals concerning tax rules should be considered in the absence of an expert review of the likely impact on individual member states and on the Union as a whole.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has a far more developed European Union and eurozone reform policy than the Government.  We welcome many of the points articulated by President Macron and others.  We can never support, however, the idea that changes presented as fundamental could be pushed through and pushed to a vote without basic work being done on the impact.  It has already been said that the parallel OECD process is the one Fianna F&aacute;il believes should be prioritised.  The March deadline, to be agreed on Thursday, is actually before the OECD proposals are due to be presented at the G20.  The announcement by Facebook yesterday seems reasonable but it does not in any way justify the push to a conclusion on a proposal where the most basic impact studies have not been carried out.</p><p> Does the Taoiseach propose to agree to the March deadline or will Ireland insist that impact studies be presented before any proposals are voted on?</p> <p> On the wider issue of the Macron reforms, the Taoiseach's only response thus far has been a general welcome and the rebranding of public consultations.  The question remains as to what Ireland's policy is towards change in the eurozone and to the Union as a whole.  Is it intended to maintain the policy of simply responding to the proposals of others or will Ireland seek to become a more active participant in the future of Europe discussions?</p></speech>

We are garnering more information about Ireland's position from leaks coming from Brussels than we are being given directly.  This is a moving platform and things are happening in real time.  I have asked many times in recent months for us to be informed as we go along.  I will shortly have an opportunity for ten minutes to make a statement about the European Council but I will raise two issues now.  </p><p>PESCO is the first item on the agenda.  Two countries, Denmark and Malta, have refused to sign up.  In Malta's case, it is because it has a particular constitutional clause enshrining its neutrality which it believes will be compromised by PESCO.  We needed more time to tease these matter out for ourselves.  I made that crystal clear last week.  We need to bring the public with us in any changes we make in our participation in either security or defence matters.  Our record in respect of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and our peacekeeping role over decades are matters of great pride and have carved out for this State a hard-won position.  It is something to which we will return.</p><p>I have specific questions to the Taoiseach regarding the Brexit negotiations.  The Taoiseach rightly says that the Council will meet in Article 50 format.  Today's edition of the <i>Financial Times </i>reports that - as we all know - in what is characterised as the new toughened EU position, future EU-UK relationship will not begin formal discussions until March.  It notes that President Tusk has issued a new letter to all EU leaders prior to the summit underlining the importance of solidarity among the remaining 27.  However, it foresees that rather than focusing on scoping out the preliminaries of a trade deal, the talks between the UK between January and March next year will concentrate instead on the conditions which the EU will set for the transition period.  That is quite a shift.  Before we make our own statements and because there will be no opportunity to do so at the conclusion of the statements, will the Taoiseach tell us what exactly has been the shift in position since the formal declaration was made after the sign-off by the United Kingdom and the EU 27 on the phase 1 issues?  Is it now the case that no formal talks on trade are to begin before March and that, as the <i>Financial Times </i>reports of President Tusk's letter, the period between January and March will focus instead on the conditions that will apply in the transition period?  I am interested in hearing the Taoiseach's views on the duration of the transition period.  </p><p>Our time here is tight and while I also wish to deal with the issue of taxation, the points have been raised already.  I am interested in specifics as these matters are very important to this country.</p></speech>

It was a calculated effort to prevent public debate on the matter.  There are many reasons to oppose our involvement in EU militarisation but I will raise one of them today.</p><p>In the past week, Amnesty International has condemned the complicity of European governments in what it describes as the horrific abuse of refugees and migrants and how the EU naval operation in the Mediterranean is colluding with the ministry of the interior, the Libyan coastguard, and the Libyan directorate for combatting illegal migration in &quot;torture and abuse of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants detained by [the] Libyan immigration authorities in appalling conditions in Libya.&quot;  It goes on to say that European governments are &quot;actively supporting a sophisticated system of abuse and exploitation of refugees and migrants by the Libyan Coast Guard, detention authorities and smugglers in order to prevent people from crossing the <i>Mediterranean</i>&quot;.  It refers to overcrowded detention centres where refugees and migrants are subject to systematic abuse.  It contends, and I agree, that European governments have not only been aware of these abuses but in actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these abuses.</p></speech>

The Commission has put together a legislative programme, the clean energy package, which affects governance, market rules, shared ambition in renewables and so on.  In every area the Irish Government is taking an active position to halt ambition and stop an integrated European approach.  For instance, only last week we received further information of the Irish Government position on assessing resource adequacy and whether it is necessary to pay capacity payments.  I apologise if this is somewhat technical.  The Irish Government position is that a state should not assess resource adequacy including its neighbour's ability to share energy with it.  We are taking an active role in stopping other countries' ambitions to start working together on a collaborative basis in energy integration.  That is one example.  We are also taking a similar aggressive attitude in stopping the setting of high renewable targets, or ambition in high climate targets.  That is the reality of what we are negotiating this month in Brussels on key directives which are in the middle of a trilogue process.</p>  <p>  Is that in tune with what the Taoiseach will say regarding our vision for European integration when he attends the Council?  Are we just going to integrate in military matters or will we try to restore our reputation somewhat by being progressive in environmental legislation?  What the Government is doing this week and in recent weeks is seen in Europe as not only showing a lack of ambition for ourselves but also restricting the ambitions for other countries which wish to act collectively.  Will the Taoiseach investigate this issue and report back?  Will he set an environmental goal in his vision for the future of Europe?</p></speech>

I could not write them down as quickly as they were asked so I expect I will miss many of them.  I will do my best.</p>  <p>  On the joint report which was agreed last week, many people will put their own interpretations on it - that is the nature of politics - and will do so for their own reasons.  All I can offer is elucidation and the best thing to do is to point to what is there in black and white.  According to paragraph 43, the United Kingdom "recalls its commitment to the avoidance of a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls".  That is the definition.  Paragraph 46 states the commitments "are made and must be upheld in all circumstances, irrespective of the nature of any future agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union".</p><p>In respect of full regulatory alignment, that provision only applies in the backstop scenario if there is no option A or B or an agreement between the EU and the UK that provides for unfettered free trade and-----</p></speech>

I refer to the all-island economy and North-South co-operation.  It is not all things and we do not have regulatory alignment on all things with Northern Ireland at present.  There is a specific paragraph on rights reaffirming the commitment to ensure there is no diminution of the safeguards, equality of opportunity and other protections that currently exist under European law in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, can apply only to countries that accept its jurisdiction.  If the United Kingdom does not accept its jurisdiction then that cannot apply, although there will be an eight-year period as that changes.  I am not sure if that is a breach of the Good Friday Agreement but I will look into that.  </p>  <p>  Brexit is a dynamic process.  It is very hard to be definitive in any answer I give because it changes every day.  I imagine it will change tomorrow and probably on Friday as well.  That is the nature of what is happening and of these negotiations.</p>  <p>  There is no date set or period agreed for the transition phase but people are talking in terms of a transition phase of two years.  That is also a matter for negotiation.  It is intended to focus in quarter 1 of 2018 on the withdrawal agreement and the transition phase rather than trade because it is accepted that both sides will have to prepare quite a lot for the talks on the new arrangements between the UK and the EU, which involve more than trade.  They concern other matters such as security, defence, aviation, EURATOM, you name it.  Our objective is to make sure that what was agreed last week in the joint report is fully reflected in the withdrawal agreement, which will be an international agreement and will be legally binding. </p>  <p>  I wish to reassure Deputy Burton that she is wrong.  The Government is not ambivalent about neutrality and the permanent structured co-operation arrangement, PESCO, is nothing to do with my impression of myself.  The Deputy is much more concerned about myself than I am but I will leave that for another day.  We are talking part in PESCO because it is in Ireland's interest.  That is the only reason for signing up to it.   We are doing so on an opt-in opt-out basis because we see that it is in Ireland's interest to opt in on certain issues.  An obvious one is cybersecurity, with which even large member states with lots of resources have difficulty dealing.  The Government firmly believes that as a small country of 4.5 million people that is a digital country with many big digital and information technology, IT, operations we should be part of Europe-wide action on that.  Another area is training.  As our soldiers take part in international and EU missions in Africa and elsewhere, it makes sense that we train together and are able to work together in those missions.  That makes our troops safer.  </p>  <p>  Denmark has decided for now not to take part in PESCO.  It is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO.  The other non-NATO members, namely, Sweden, Finland and Austria, however, have decided to take part.  We are among four neutral countries that have signed up to PESCO. </p>  <p>  In terms of skill sets, as we prepare for phase 2 that is dynamic.  We have a lot of expertise in-house but it is acknowledged that we will need outside expertise as well.  We will consider that over the next couple of weeks.  We have beefed up our permanent representation in Brussels and for example, the number of staff members from the Office of the Attorney General there has risen from one to five.  This is in recognition of the fact that we are going to be the only full common law country &ndash; Malta and Cyprus are partial common law countries &ndash; left in the EU and we need to take account of that and other matters.  </p>  <p>  On the reform of the eurozone and the EU's agenda, I outlined my views on this in a speech I made at the launch of the public consultation on the future of Europe with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy McEntee.  I made that speech in the Science Gallery some weeks ago.  It did not get much attention or notice but I did outline in some detail my views on the future of Europe and how we should reform the eurozone.</p>  <p>  The Government's position on tax is, as it always has been, that tax is a matter of national sovereignty, that member states and their parliaments should set national taxes and that those national taxes should fund national budgets.  It is also our view that big corporations should pay their tax when and where they are owed and in full.  Ireland is not a tax haven.  It has no interest in being a tax haven nor does it want to be seen as a tax haven.  </p></speech>

Citizens have a right to know what Government is doing and why. </p>  <p>  The strategic communications unit was established earlier this year to bring that consistency, clarity and professionalism to all Government communications.  It means communication is treated as a strategic, whole-of-Government activity, which must be conducted to the same level of professionalism as any other activity, such as human resource management, or financial management.</p>  <p>  To date, the Cabinet has approved the strategic communications unit in my Department to work on the following campaigns in the coming months: the ten-year capital plan, Brexit, the national children's hospital, the Healthy Ireland framework, the Creative Ireland programme, global Ireland and rural Ireland.  Further information campaigns will be added to this list in due course.</p>  <p>  The unit's work on campaigns is informed by major Government initiatives that have an impact on the lives of our citizens, its focus is to streamline communications by working with other Departments to deliver on these major cross-Government campaigns. </p>  <p>  It will help to ensure clear simple citizen-centered communications, so that it is evident when the Government of Ireland is communicating or delivering a service.  This will lead to more co-ordinated and cost-effective communications that will generate efficiencies and increased value for money. </p>  <p>  The national children's hospital represents the largest single investment in health care in this country and will provide world-class medical care to the children of Ireland.  This new model of care for all paediatric services is for the whole country and will help tackle current and future challenges in child health and will deliver on the huge advances that are possible in children's health care. </p>  <p>  Staff from the strategic communications unit in my Department will work in partnership with their communications colleagues in the Department of Health and other organisations involved in the delivery of the hospital.  The focus of the campaign will be to keep citizens fully informed of progress in the delivery of the hospital and the new model of care it will provide, which involves much more than the hospital as it is a piece of national infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The contract for the research and insight survey, which was procured by the Office of Government Procurement, has been awarded to Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes.  Results of the survey will be published.</p></reply>

Many believe that so naming it would be a recognition of her important historic role in delivering medical care for the women and children of Dublin.  It would be appropriate that her role as a suffragette, as a volunteer in the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 Rising should also be marked.  The Taoiseach might like to take time to reflect on this.  I would prefer if he did not just say "No" but that he gave this proposal some mature consideration.</p>  <p>  Trade unions have expressed concerns about bogus self-employment on this site.  What measures will be taken to ensure this does not happen?  Will there be union negotiation on contracts and subcontractors?  Can he confirm that union rates and agreed national pay rates will apply to contractors and subcontractors alike?  Will these provisions be part of the tender where applicable?  In the light of Brexit, has the Taoiseach given consideration to protecting the cross-Border arrangements that will see patients from the other side of the Border travel for care because this is an all-island children's hospital?</p></speech>

I thank the Taoiseach for informing us that Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes have won the contract for market research.  What was the cost of the tender finally?  He said the results will be published.</p> <p> Deputy Adams referred to the naming of the national children's hospital, which I raised last week.  I made a suggestion at the time to which the Minister for Health responded positively, which was to hold a national competition in our school system.  Among those who will use it into the future are the children of Ireland.  I have since written to the Minister for Health to ask him to consider that.  It would be a useful and real way to set out what the children's hospital is about and to involve the children of Ireland in that process.</p></speech>

One of the problems we discovered in the freedom of information process was that key discussions were shielded from release because they were described as an essential part of preparing a memorandum for Cabinet.  It is understood that the unit made or was scheduled to make a presentation to Ministers yesterday.  Can the Taoiseach assure the House that this will not be used as another excuse to shield information?  Can the Taoiseach explain why the unit has not sought to discuss its plans with Members of the D&aacute;il but is doing the rounds of marketing groups instead?  Given that the Taoiseach has asserted central control on the branding and oversight of public advertising, can he explain the decision to spend thousands of euro on a full colour advertisement which was supposedly directed to minimum wage earners last Sunday?  The advertisement was placed on the cover of the finance supplement of a business paper, beside an article about what people should do with buoyant dividend income.  Does the Taoiseach accept that it is unacceptable to pretend to talk to low income people in an advertisement placed beside the headline "Splash the Cash"?  Is this the type of propaganda we can expect from now on?</p>  <p>  The core premise of the unit is supposed to be the addressing of a public information gap.  The Taoiseach commissioned research on this but decided on priorities and budgets before receiving the results.  Amazingly, the priorities for the largest marketing campaign ever run by a Taoiseach's office fit exactly with the Taoiseach's stated policy priorities.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is something fundamentally rotten about him deciding what the public wants to know about before actually asking the public?  It would have been easy to carry out research listing a range of public policy issues and asking whether the public was happy with the availability of information in different areas.  Perhaps the Taoiseach did not want the feedback that people would support advertising which gave them easier access to figures on hospital waiting lists, homelessness or other areas the Taoiseach believes are receiving too much attention from the media.  Fundamentally, this is a political propaganda unit.  It is a worrying trend and it is wrong from an ethical perspective.</p></speech>

I am open-minded on the issue.  I do not intend to make the decision personally but I am not keen on it being a political figure of any variety or colour.  That would not be a good way forward.  I have heard some people propose Kathleen Lynn.  I have even heard people in my own party propose WT Cosgrave given his association with the site and the South Dublin Union.

To venture an opinion, I would go for one of the following two options.  It should either be called what it is, namely, the national children's hospital.  Most of these hospitals around the world have simple names like that.  Alternatively, if we are going to choose a unique name, I would like it to be as Gaeilge.  It is an opportunity in Bliain na Gaeilge to choose an Irish language name for the hospital.  I do not mean someone's name translated into Irish but rather an Irish word.  My favourite name is "Starship" which is what the children's hospital in New Zealand is called.  It was not called that by politicians, rather it happened by accident because it looks like a starship and that is what the children started to call it.  It was subsequently adopted as the official name of the hospital.  As it is taken, I do not think we can use it, however.  Whatever name is chosen should be child friendly and, ideally, as Gaeilge.  It should not be about politics, a political figure or make a political point of any sort.</p>  <p>  I do not know the cost of the tender referred to.  It is probably commercially sensitive.  I am not aware of any presentation by the unit to Ministers yesterday.  The head of the unit and its staff meet Ministers and officials regularly but I am not aware of any particular presentation yesterday.</p></speech>

I can, at this stage, outline my plans for a number of visits abroad, relating both to EU and non-EU business.  As the House is aware, I will travel to Brussels for a meeting of the European Council on Thursday and Friday.  Further European Council meetings are scheduled for March and June 2018.  I plan to travel to Lebanon later this month to visit members of the Defence Forces serving in the UNIFIL mission.  My visit will provide an opportunity to restate the Government's support for this important mission and to recognise the important contribution of Ireland's Defence Forces personnel to peacekeeping and other missions.  Of course, Christmas is a particularly poignant time for the members of the Defence Forces serving overseas and for their families here at home.  The dedication shown by our Defence Forces personnel in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions overseas is, of course, a year-round commitment and one that they can be immensely proud of.</p>  <p>  In January, I intend to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos.  The forum is an excellent opportunity to engage with key influencers and leaders on important policy challenges for the international community and to support the efforts of IDA Ireland to promote Ireland as a location for investment with corporate decision-makers.  In March, I plan to visit Washington DC for the traditional St. Patrick's Day celebrations and to meet with President Trump.  I have not spoken with President Trump since our phone call on 27 June, when the President invited me to meet him and to attend the traditional St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the White House.  I very much look forward to this visit, which is a unique opportunity to advance Ireland's interests with a country with which we have such deep connections and important common interests.</p>  <p>  Next June, I plan to attend a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Guernsey in the Channel Islands.  Other arrangements, including meetings with European partners, are being prepared and I will continue to be guided by our ongoing assessment of strategic priorities.  I will, of course, keep the House informed as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach's scheduled visit to the Ivory Coast to take part in the EU-Africa summit obviously had to be cancelled.  Africa is an increasingly important continent but there is no scheduled trip there among the array of trips listed by the Taoiseach.  Is it his intention to visit Africa in the next six months to 12 months?</p>  <p>  With regard to the ambitious plans to double our diplomatic representation across the globe, I am aware that a new embassy in New Zealand was announced when the President visited that country.  In what other countries where we do not currently have full diplomatic missions does the Taoiseach intend to establish diplomatic missions in the coming year or two?</p></speech>

There is also concern about the decision by President Trump to end the protections for undocumented children.  His decision to shut down the deferred action for childhood arrivals, DACA, programme has been widely criticised.  The children of Irish citizens are among those children.  Has the Government raised this issue with the US Embassy here and with the White House?  Can the Taoiseach indicate if he expects there will be a US ambassador to Ireland before he visits the US in March?</p></speech>

In light of Amnesty International's damning report which explicitly states that European governments are colluding with slavery, torture, systematic abuse and physical and sexual violence against 20,000 Libyan immigrants, will the Taoiseach look into this matter?  Does he think he might visit Libya and see the horrific detention centres and the treatment of the desperate people who are being enslaved and abused on an ongoing and systematic basis?</p>  <p>  Donald Trump has now explicitly endorsed something that flouts international law.  Is there any crime he can commit against international law that will finally provoke the Taoiseach to move beyond stating that our friendship with the United States goes beyond any single US President?  Mr. Trump has flouted international law and declared war on the people of Palestine, inflaming conflict across the Middle East.  Will the Taoiseach express anything more than concern about Mr. Trump's behaviour?</p></speech>

Comprehensive immigration reform is as far away as ever because of American domestic politics.  Given the actions of President Trump in terms of the atmosphere and curbing some of the more liberal policies of President Obama in respect of states and cities that protected migrants and their families, has the Taoiseach made any representations to the US Government on the status of the undocumented Irish and their families in the United States in the context of the move away from the previous position under President Obama?  Also, has he made any representations regarding President Trump's continuing to call out Ireland as being a type of tax outlier in terms of the United States and his identification of Ireland as a problem country, notwithstanding the obligations of the United States under international trade and competition rules?</p></speech>

I certainly would like to visit Africa but there are only so many days in the year and, obviously, I have responsibilities in the Oireachtas, Government Buildings, in all parts of Ireland and in Europe.  They must take precedence over intercontinental travel.  I am not sure if it will be possible to pay a visit to Africa next year.</p>  <p>  The new missions to be established in 2018 are an embassy in New Zealand, embassies in Bogot&aacute; in Colombia and Santiago de Chile, a new Ireland House in Mumbai and a new consulate in Vancouver to cover western Canada.  By March 2018, in advance of St. Patrick's Day, we should be able to indicate where the new missions for 2019 will be located.  I will take into consideration Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's suggestion of Tehran, the capital of Iran, which is an important economic and political power in that region.  However, it is not just about new missions.  We are also beefing up existing missions, which is of equal importance because many of our missions consist of just one person or two people.</p>  <p>  I do not have any new information on the US envoy to Northern Ireland.  Our priority is the appointment of an ambassador to Ireland.  I met the acting ambassador in the last couple of weeks to discuss a number of issues, including tax policy and undocumented Irish citizens in the United States.  Of course, I mentioned President Trump's incorrect assertion that we are reducing our corporation profit tax to 8%.  We are not.  There has been an increase in the number of arrests of undocumented Irish citizens living in the US, but I am informed by the US authorities that many or most of them have convictions, criminal convictions in many cases, not related to immigration.  I have appointed Deputy Deasy to work specifically on the undocumented Irish.  He has been travelling back and forth to Washington in the past couple of months to see if we can put something together that would assist our citizens in the US.</p>  <p>  I do not have any plans to visit Libya.</p></speech>

The European Council will meet in four separate formats over the course of the two days.  The main meeting on Thursday will focus on social, educational and cultural co-operation, as well as security and defence.  Tomorrow evening, we will meet under the leaders' agenda, as part of the debate on the future of Europe, to discuss migration.  On Friday morning, a euro summit will consider the Economic and Monetary Union.  We will then meet in Article 50 format, without the United Kingdom, to discuss progress in the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  I will speak first about the Thursday afternoon meeting of the European Council, which will consider and adopt conclusions on social, educational and cultural matters.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will say more about this in her concluding remarks.  However, I note that this item follows on from discussions which took place in Gothenburg in November.  I participated actively in those meetings and I support the general outcome of the exchanges.</p>  <p>  Under the item on security and defence, we will welcome the launch of permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and also have a discussion with the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, on co-operation between the EU and that organisation.  PESCO provides a mechanism whereby military crisis management capabilities can be developed by member states in support of common security and defence policy operations.  Ireland took full part in the discussions on setting up PESCO and we have supported its establishment.  As Deputies are aware, the D&aacute;il debated PESCO last week and voted in favour of Ireland's participation.</p><p>I assure everyone that our core, long-standing policy of military neutrality remains in place.  We do not participate in and will not join any military alliances.  However, as I have said before, this does not mean that we are neutral about everything.  Common threats such as terrorism, cyberattacks, drug trafficking and human trafficking concern all Europeans and it makes perfect sense to work together to respond to them.  Our participation in PESCO will facilitate greater co-operation here.  I would also recall our proud history of UN peacekeeping and EU common security and defence policy operations.  Participation in specific PESCO projects is on a voluntary basis and we will, therefore, participate in a way that complements what we do in those operations.</p> <p> On migration, we will examine how best to achieve an effective and sustainable policy which respects the concepts of responsibility and solidarity while also looking at the root causes and preventing mass arrivals.  This is intended to be an open and free-flowing exchange of views with the aim of unlocking some of the more contentious aspects of the issue.  As a result, there will be no formal conclusions.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will provide more detail on this item in her wrap-up remarks.</p> <p> On Friday morning, the Euro summit will meet in an expanded format of the 27, with presentations from the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, and the outgoing Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem.  The focus will be mainly on deepening the economic and monetary union, EMU, and on banking union.  As a founder member of the euro, Ireland supports taking the necessary steps to safeguard and strengthen our single currency for the future.  This means completing the banking union, in particular, through protecting citizens' deposits on a pan-European basis.  We also believe that a genuine capital markets union would provide a useful, extra level to the European economy.  In general terms, we believe that we need to concentrate on completing what has already been agreed.  The European Commission published an ambitious set of proposals on 6 December.  We will examine these carefully and reflect on their implications.</p> <p> Finally, we will meet in Article 50 format to discuss progress in the Brexit negotiations.  As Deputies are well aware, this will be a pivotal meeting at which we will formally decide whether there has been sufficient progress on the three phase 1 issues - the UK financial commitment, EU citizens' rights and the Irish-specific issues - to allow us to move to phase 2.  There we will consider the shape of the future relationship between the EU and the UK and possible transitional arrangements.  After long and intensive negotiations over the past weeks, the EU achieved a positive and strong agreement on the Irish-specific issues.  I am satisfied that sufficient progress has now been made on these.  Under the agreement, the Good Friday Agreement, in all its parts, is protected.  Everyone born in Northern Ireland will continue to have the right to Irish and, therefore, EU citizenship.  The common travel area will continue to allow people to travel freely between Great Britain and Ireland.  British and Irish citizens will continue to have the freedom to live, work and study and to access housing, health care, pensions and welfare in each other's countries as though they were citizens of both.  The United Kingdom has committed to avoiding a hard border as an overarching requirement with which any future arrangements must be compatible.  There will be no physical infrastructure or related checks or controls.  </p> <p> As I have stated before, our preferred option for achieving this is a deep and comprehensive agreement between the EU and the UK which will allow us to continue trading as we do now.  However, if that is not possible, there is a backstop arrangement in which Northern Ireland - and perhaps all of the UK - will maintain full alignment with the rules of the internal market and customs union which are relevant regarding the avoidance of a border, North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  It is important to stress that this agreement will be held in all circumstances unless and until all other possible options for the future relationship between the EU and the UK have been agreed.  The UK has also made clear that it intends to ensure that Northern Ireland business will continue to have unfettered access to the whole of the UK and that no new barriers will develop between Northern Ireland and Great Britain unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree to it.  EU funding under PEACE and INTERREG will continue until 2020 and we will favourably examine continuing it beyond that into the next budgetary period.  The UK has committed to ensuring that, in Northern Ireland, there will be no diminution of human rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in European law.  Just as importantly, there will continue to be a distinct strand on Ireland in phase 2 of the negotiations.  </p> <p> We have to bear in mind the concerns of the unionist community in Northern Ireland and reassure its members that the Irish Government has no hidden agenda.  While we aspire to Irish unity and an agreed Ireland, I have been very clear throughout these discussions that we are not seeking to use Brexit as a move to a united Ireland without consent.  Brexit undoubtedly presents challenges but, notwithstanding those, we want reconciliation and respect to grow.  We have also been clear that we also have no desire to see a border in the Irish Sea any more than we want a border between Letterkenny and Derry or between Newry and Dundalk.  Our strong preference remains to allow travel and free trade across these islands to continue as it does now and has done for the past 20 years.  Our only ambition has been to ensure that the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement continue to operate in full after Brexit and that people can go about their normal lives and business as before.  The agreement we have reached explicitly recognises the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement with regard to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent.</p> <p> At the same time, we have protected the interests of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland throughout these negotiations.  Their birthright, as Irish citizens and, therefore, EU citizens, will be protected.  These rights will, of course, be available to everyone in Northern Ireland who chooses to exercise his or her right to be an Irish citizen, regardless of his or her political persuasion or religious beliefs.  With this agreement in place, it is now even more important that the Northern Ireland Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council get up and running again.  The institutions can be a vital voice helping us to move forward into phase two of the Brexit talks.  No one party of any colour can speak for Northern Ireland but the Executive, the First Minister and deputy First Minister working together could.  The agreement reached last week between the EU and the UK is very significant for everyone on the island of Ireland, for our neighbouring island and for all of our fellow members of the European Union.</p> <p> The Government has been united and firm in its resolve.  I thank the Opposition leaders and their parties for the strong and very practical support they have provided to date.  We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the EU negotiators led by Michel Barnier, President Juncker, President Tusk, President Tajani of the European Parliament and other representatives of the EU institutions and, of course, to all the other member states.  Their support and solidarity has been invaluable.  It is the best of the values of the European Union and indicates why small countries are better off being members of the EU.  It puts beyond any doubt that our future lies in the European Union at the heart of the common European home we helped to build.  I also acknowledge the good will shown by Prime Minister May and her careful consideration of our concerns.  While we regret it, Ireland has always respected the British people's democratic decision to leave the European Union.  We want to assure them of the continued friendship and good will of the Irish Government and the Irish people into the future.</p> <p> The European Council provides the framework for resolving the shared challenges at EU level and I look forward to engaging with my colleagues while always keeping in mind the best interests of this country and of Europe.  I will report back to the House in due course on the outcome of the European Council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300025#X00200"><p>Now that phase one is over and as we head into the most difficult part of the Brexit negotiations, it is important to review where we are and the key challenges which we face.  The first point we should all recognise is that Brexit is not some distant issue; it is already under way and causing damage.  Firms in various parts of this island are suffering because of a combination of uncertainty and the chronic weakness of the British currency that is directly linked to Brexit.  In light of the instability in Westminster, the major contradictions in the agreement and the deterioration of key relationships which has been exposed in recent weeks, we need a lot more reflection.  It would be an enormous error to believe that anything is settled.  Equally, given the existing damage since the referendum and the further damage likely due to the UK's confirmed decision to leave the customs union and Single Market, Ireland has a wider and urgent agenda, much of which has seen little or no progress.</p>  <p>  From well before the Brexit referendum was held, Fianna F&aacute;il has been actively engaged in addressing the implications of a decision by the UK to leave the European Union.  It has been a priority for us since 2013 when David Cameron announced that a referendum would be held on the topic and it has been addressed in detail by us in an ongoing series of speeches and manifestos since then.  During the recent instability caused by the Government's resistance to basic political accountability, Fianna F&aacute;il took action to ensure that there would be no doubt about Ireland's position on Brexit.</p><p>I wrote to the lead negotiators for the Commission and the Parliament to state very clearly there is a wide consensus in Ireland on Brexit which was reflected in the Government&rsquo;s negotiating position.  I further stated there was full political agreement that written guarantees were required from the United Kingdom before proceeding to phase two could be considered.  Subsequent contacts have confirmed it was a reassurance that irrespective of events, Ireland&rsquo;s core position would not change.</p> <p> When one steps back from the breathless commentary of recent days and looks at the current state of the Brexit project, it is striking how the core analysis which we set out in 2013 remains valid.  The British Government has still not reconciled itself to the fact that ceasing to be a member will lose it many of the benefits of being a member.  Brexit remains a deep and urgent threat to Ireland.  It remains a move by London away from the principle of rules-based international co-operation.  Most fundamentally, the core Brexit challenge remains how to limit its damage because there is no possible scenario where there is no damage.  As of last week, the worst-case scenarios appear a lot less likely.  However, what has been agreed is a statement of important principles which is very broad and contains within it clearly contradictory statements.  The status of trade within Ireland and between these islands is very far from settled.  The negotiating position of the Government early this year was that the fate of Ireland should largely be divorced from the final status discussions.  While the statements are important, Ireland's fate remains integrally bound up in the wider negotiation and this carries with it inherent risks.  These risks may have been unavoidable but it serves no real purpose to ignore them.</p> <p> The British Government has repeated the statements made by its leaders at various points during the past year and a half.  It has said it will protect the Good Friday Agreement and that there will be no disruption of cross-border activity.  However, it has also confirmed that the United Kingdom as a whole will leave both the customs union and the Single Market and has added a new point that Northern Ireland will not be treated any differently.  The broad statements of principle made concerning Ireland are unquestionably welcome but they are very far from being a final statement on the matter.  The specific statement entrenching the idea that Northern Ireland is no different from the rest of the United Kingdom is not only not welcome, but it is a reversal of over 40 years of policy and practice.  </p> <p> President Donald Tusk described the phase one deal as "the easy part" of the negotiations because it is a general agreement.  There has been a lot of back and forth in recent days about the legal enforceability of this political agreement.  The current status is that the British Government says it will be legally enforceable as part of the exit treaty.  It is hard to disagree with this interpretation.  Everything must be done to hold it to the agreed principles, but please let us not pretend we have anything we can use to walk into a courtroom and demand the maintenance of an open border.</p> <p> Before speaking further on Ireland-specific measures, I should say that we warmly welcome the agreement on the points about the rights of European Union and United Kingdom citizens post-Brexit and a methodology for computing the United Kingdom&rsquo;s financial responsibilities that will protect the current multi-annual financial framework.  Even more importantly, we welcome the formal acknowledgement by both sides of the continued right of current and future residents of Northern Ireland to claim full European Union citizenship as per the Good Friday Agreement.  This was a matter we raised soon after the referendum and which we lobbied to be included in the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating guidelines following the failure to address it in the Council&rsquo;s formal round one document.  I acknowledge this progress.  </p> <p> This week&rsquo;s summit is likely to unanimously and without significant difficulty endorse the recommendation to move to phase two of the Brexit negotiations.  This is the right decision.  The agreement for at least a two-year transition period which will most likely involve no significant change is a welcome inching away from the cliff edge and extremely important.  The current most likely scenario, as confirmed by Michel Barnier yesterday, is that any exit treaty which can be agreed before the end of next year will contain a framework for a trade agreement rather than a negotiated text.  As such, it is an issue which will not be settled until beyond next year and the eventual trade agreement will be subject to potential revision over time.</p> <p> There are four general areas where we believe it falls to our Government to act with urgency.  First, we need to address the core contradiction in the text between the commitment to no border in Ireland and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s uniform exit from the Single Market and customs union.  As we saw yesterday, the Taoiseach is continuing his predecessor&rsquo;s policy of refusing to say what he means by maintaining an open border beyond the issue of no checks at the Border.  There are many scenarios where continued regulatory alignment will still involve significant practical barriers to trade.  The core British position remains that they want full access to European markets while limiting regulatory compliance to industry-specific matters and without the European Court of Justice and Commission maintaining their current legal powers.  This is incompatible with the core European Union position.  </p> <p> So what happens to Ireland, particularly in the new context where the refusal to treat Northern Ireland as a special case has been elevated to the level of a core principle in London?  We must proceed on the basis of showing how Northern Ireland could maintain unhindered access to the customs union and Single Market in any likely scenario.  Otherwise we will remain fully hostage to the overall negotiations, the outcome of which is still deeply uncertain.  We should also remember that the leadership of the British Labour Party is currently enforcing a policy in the House of Commons which is of little practical comfort to Ireland.  </p> <p> The second action we need is a far more urgent push to have the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive re-established and working.  Their absence has been Ireland&rsquo;s greatest handicap in recent months.  I will address this and other Northern Ireland-specific Brexit issues in more detail during this evening&rsquo;s statements.  </p> <p> The third action we need is to move on to implement proposals to help businesses and communities deal with the dislocation that is already under way.  The urgency of diversifying both products and markets is becoming more acute by the day.  We need a range of supports, many of which require a temporary change in European Union rules, and we need to understand that actions to date are not even as good as being a sticking plaster.  Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate to the House later whether it is the Government's intention to publish impact studies on the various sectoral areas.  Our understanding was that sectoral studies had been carried out and that studies would be published on the different sectors such as agrifood, tourism and so on.  It would be useful to get clarification from the Minister of State on that point.  </p> <p> Finally, we need to address the serious deterioration of vital relationships which have in the past been so central to progress on the island and with Britain.  In recent months our officials have worked diligently and as effectively as ever in the background, but at political level things have at times reached the level of leaders talking at each other through newspaper headlines.  The basic relationships of trust between political leaders on a north-south and east-west basis have to be renewed.  Otherwise we risk constant roadblocks in addressing the highly complex bilateral issues which have to be dealt with in the next few years.  </p> <p> There are other very important issues to be addressed at the summit.  I addressed some of them during Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions.  We will not have time next week to deal with them but I hope we will have time during the next sitting week to deal with them properly.  </p> <p> The amount of time being allocated for these deliberations is far too short.  Our spokesperson on Europe cannot contribute.  That is not satisfactory.  Others would also like to contribute.  The time available to Deputies to contribute to key debates is unsatisfactory.</p></speech>

Our approach was vindicated by subsequent contradictory statements from British Government Ministers.</p><p>Of course, the joint report is not the conclusion of the process or the final binding legal deal on Brexit.  It sets out broad principles and represents some progress, but there are many unanswered questions on key issues.  The Irish Government needs to remain focused and vigilant and should not over-egg the achievements.  There have been some achievements.  The joint report recognises the unique and special circumstances of the North - although it could hardly do otherwise - the importance of the peace process and the need to ensure that there will be no hard border.  It also asserts that the Good Friday Agreement will be at the heart of any eventual agreements.  However, it also contains important contradictions, including some relating to the Good Friday Agreement.  For example, the insistence by the British that the North must leave the customs union and the Single Market is of particular concern and totally disrespects the democratic vote of the people in that part of our island.  The British assertion that they will leave the customs union and the Single Market contradicts the British Prime Minister's claim that there will not be a hard economic border.  Michel Barnier has already stated that it is very difficult to see how these two competing imperatives can be reconciled.</p> <p> On Sunday, the British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, described the contents of the joint report as merely a "statement of intent".  On Monday, the European Commission confirmed that the joint report is not legally binding and described it as a "deal between gentlemen".  This morning, it was reported that the EU Ministers might suspend Brexit negotiations if Britain reneges on its phase 1 commitments.  It will be interesting to see if the Taoiseach supports that approach.</p> <p> It is stated in paragraph 53 of the joint report that there should be no diminution of citizens' rights caused by the UK's departure from the European Union.  However, when I pressed the Taoiseach on a number of occasions on the joint report's possible impact on the rights of Irish - and therefore EU - citizens in the North and, in particular, whether they would have access to the European Court of Justice, he would not and did not answer.  There was no clarity.  It took until yesterday to get that clarity.  Then we learned that, after an eight-year period, the British will not allow the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice to apply to the North and, apparently, the Taoiseach has agreed to this.  Citizens in the North, therefore, will not have access to the European Court of Justice.  If this be what has been done, the Government will have signed up to an agreement which will strip Irish citizens living in the North of their EU rights.  When I asked the Taoiseach about this earlier and said it was a breach of the Good Friday Agreement, he said he would check it out.  With respect, he should have checked it out long before this.  As he said in his statement earlier, under the Good Friday Agreement, people in the North have the right to Irish citizenship which includes the right to European Union citizenship.  That has to include access to the European institutions.</p></speech>

That includes the people in the North who, the Taoiseach said an Irish Government would never leave behind again.  Let us be very clear about these positions.  Even in the past 20 years, I could outline ten agreements the British have made which they have not honoured and in which they have poked holes in the intervening period.</p>  <p>  In addition to its position of withdrawal from the European Court of Justice, the British Government will also withdraw from the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It will repeal the Human Rights Act by which the European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated into British law.  These decisions threaten the role of the European institutions and the human rights elements and safeguards, which are fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  I do not raise these issues to score points.  This is too important for party-political boxing or a Punch and Judy show.  These are fundamental issues.  I hope the Taoiseach will have noted the letter from civic nationalism, if I can use that term, in the North, which is all about the rights and the denial of rights at this time.  The Government needs to be conscious that this refusal to embrace rights is at the core of the current difficulties in the political institutions and the collapse of the Northern Executive.  We will continue to make the case for special status in the North; we do not care what it is called.  We still believe there is an opportunity to achieve this in the coming years if the political will exists and if the Government is committed to standing by our national interest - that is, our all-island interest as a nation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300027#Z00800"><p>We have consistently said that if the Government acts in the national interest, which means protecting all of the people of Ireland, then Sinn F&eacute;in will support it.  We will be strong supporters of any Government which ensures that we get the best possible deal for Ireland in what are very complex negotiations on Brexit.</p><p>Our position has always been clear: we want to avoid any hardening of the border; we want to protect the Good Friday Agreement, in all its parts; and we want to protect the rights of citizens.  In rhetoric terms, that is also the position of the Irish Government, the British Government, the European Commission and the European Parliament, all of which is to be welcomed.  Some of the contents of the joint report that was agreed represent a degree of progress.</p><p>We have always said that the best way to achieve those objectives and high-level principles is for a special arrangement or special status for the North within the European Union.  In the Taoiseach's response to an Teachta Adams on citizens, he missed that point entirely.  The Taoiseach suggested that an Irish citizen who lives in the North of Ireland will, by birthright, be able to claim Irish and EU citizenship.  However, he or she will not be able to vindicate that right because he or she will no longer be living in the European Union.  What the Taoiseach said does not make sense.  In addition, it makes a mockery of what should be special status and special solutions for the North.  We have always said that the only way to avoid a hardening of the border is for the entire island, including the North, to stay in the customs union and Single Market, and for the Good Friday Agreement to be attached as a protocol to the eventual agreement.</p><p>What has been agreed is a backstop arrangement for Ireland.  The backstop arrangement only kicks in if there is no trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  This is important because the joint report states:</p><blockquote>In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with [the] rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 [Good Friday] Agreement.</blockquote><p>We have asked for a detailed breakdown of what is meant by North-South co-operation and what is meant by the all-island economy.  This is defined in a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and relates to education and training, intervention to support research and innovation, development of the knowledge economy, and other areas.  It does not mention trade at all.</p><p>What will happen in the event of a backstop arrangement where we have what the Taoiseach calls full alignment in these areas but not in all areas?  Without full alignment in all areas of trade, what will happen when goods are imported from third countries into the island of Ireland and where country-of-origin rules have to apply in the event of no deal?  Goods then cannot move north and south if they do not originate on the island of Ireland.  If there is any area where there is not full alignment, it will mean a hardening of the border.  I think the Taoiseach has missed that point entirely.  That is glaringly obvious from the joint report, which has already been exposed as being full of holes in some areas.  We have a responsibility to point out these concerns and ensure we get the best possible arrangement.</p><p>A question I asked the T&aacute;naiste this morning, which he has still not answered, is: what is the difference between full alignment in the context of the all-island economy and the North staying in the customs union and the Single Market?  If the Government had done its homework, it would know there is a huge difference.  That huge difference is that it does not align all rules and regulations on trade - only some.  If it only involves some, it means a hardening of the border.  A hardening of the border goes against the principles the Government has set out as being the bottom line for the people of Ireland.</p><p>There has been some progress, which we welcome.  However, there are genuine concerns that we, as people who represent citizens, North and South, have a responsibility to put to the Government and get answers, but we still have not obtained them.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste still have not explained to the citizens of the State the clear difference between full alignment in some areas and the North staying in the customs union and Single Market, which must be the main request of any Irish Government.</p></speech>

I hope in future we will be able to receive comprehensive briefings on the agenda for meetings in advance.  I appreciate that in recent weeks the Taoiseach has been very busy, but the challenges and the future of Europe are core concerns for us in the months and years ahead.  It is important, before we have debates like this one, that we have a deeper understanding of the position Ireland takes on each agenda item.</p>  <p>  While Brexit will dominate the Article 50 Council on 15 December, the meeting on Thursday will discuss a number of other important issues.  I understand the Estonian Prime Minister is to provide an overview on the implementation of the earlier Council conclusions.  The Taoiseach might furnish us with the details of those as soon as they come to hand.</p>  <p>  The first official item on the agenda on Thursday is defence, welcoming the launch of Permanent Structured Co-operation.  Since the D&aacute;il rushed through the ratification last week, after little public debate or engagement on what is a very important issue, Ireland will now take part in PESCO.  Alongside the original 23 members announced in November, Ireland and Portugal have now signed up but as I said previously, Malta and Denmark have chosen not to, while the United Kingdom will be exiting the EU.  The Danes have had a defence opt-out since 1992.  Separately, Malta has decided to take a wait and see approach, one that might have been wise counsel for us, as it believes certain operations may be in breach of the neutrality clause of their constitution.  It is a shame that Ireland did not take the same approach as Malta.</p>  <p>  There are 17 joint projects which will fall under the scope of PESCO.  The Government should tell us which ones it intends to sign up for so that we can have absolute clarity on these matters.  It is interesting that the key point for discussion under defence is a review of progress in other fields, notably EU-NATO co-operation.  Ireland is not a member of NATO but the direction of future travel intended by some member states is becoming increasingly clear.</p>  <p>  On Monday, Jean Claude Juncker tweeted that the Sleeping Beauty of the Lisbon treaty is happening.  He welcomed the operational steps being taken today by member states to lay the foundation of a European Defence Union.  While the Government may protest that PESCO has nothing to do with a European army, it is clearly the intent of many states to proceed down that track.  The French President has said he wants an EU army, and now PESCO will provide the stepping stone to that.</p>  <p>  The second agenda item relates to social, education and culture.  I am not clear what the conclusions referred to are, following on from the Gothenburg Social Summit.  The Minister of State, who is to address the House later, might elaborate on that.  There has been a focus on the ERASMUS programme as it celebrates 30 years in existence, one that would be recognised and celebrated across all member states.  There is a proposal from the leaders' agenda to "envisage" an ERASMUS for young artists.  That is a exciting and interesting prospect.  It would be a very welcome and tangible benefit for EU citizens into the future.</p>  <p>  The Party of European Socialists, through its Act For Youth campaign, has called for a widening of the accessibility and increased funding for the ERASMUS+ programme.  That would allow secondary school students and technical and professional apprentices to benefit also from ERASMUS.  That would be very welcome, particularly when growing nationalism is a countervailing argument to the benefits we have enjoyed for many decades of growing integration in our European homeland.  I hope the Government will take these proposals on board.</p>  <p>  The agenda also states that in light of events the Council may address specific foreign policy issues.  The Taoiseach might report back to us, or the Minister of State in her address later, on what the Government intends to raise in these matters but I raise a very important issue that I hope the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to raise when the broader foreign policy issues are being discussed at the Council.  This is the decision by the United States to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy from Tel Aviv to that city, what the leaders jointly will say about that and the action they propose to take in the light of the reaction across not only the broader Arab world, but the entire Muslim world at that very negative decision.</p>  <p>  Turning to Brexit, I believe a number of significant developments have opened up the prospect of a soft Brexit.  I have repeated many times my view and that of my party that only the UK staying in the Single Market and the customs union can deliver the type of border and future trade arrangements that Ireland needs and the consensus in this House requires.  Any other arrangement less than the maintenance of the United Kingdom as a whole within the Single Market and the customs union will present real challenges to maintaining the integrated economy we now have.</p>  <p>  As others have said, the joint report published on Friday marks the start of a process, not an end.  As I said on the day, the devil is very much in the detail.  The commitment in the agreed text that the British Government will maintain full alignment with Internal Market rules on the island of Ireland in the absence of a satisfactory UK-EU agreement is a strong backstop, but I am worried.  I listened to the Taoiseach carefully today again during Leaders' Questions when he maintained that the backstop was a stand alone position.  Is that the case when the repeated view expressed in the British House of Commons is that until everything is agreed, nothing is agreed?  In other words, the backstop is not really a backstop in the event of there being no fundamental agreement.  That is the fundament point we need clarity upon because if it is to be a firewall, it should not be a flammable one.</p>  <p>  Full alignment on this island and between the two islands implies a particular kind of Brexit outcome that may not satisfy hard Brexiteers in the UK, although I believe there is a growing sense of reality dawning on even those who are the most trenchant in their views.  As we saw in the Brexit referendum, the level of debate and plain untruths told about leaving the EU now continue to infect the debate on these very important issues.  The internal politics of the British Conservative Party could derail the prospects of the best outcome for both the British and Irish peoples, and that is what we saw in the discussions particularly in Britain last weekend.  It was deeply disappointing but not surprising to hear the comments from a number of cabinet members that the agreement arrived at with the EU and Ireland was "meaningless, "not binding" or somehow limited.</p>  <p>  I am well aware of the complex negotiations that are involved in these processes and that there are many staging posts along the way.  The Taoiseach said there will be many spinners of words but there has to be a common understanding between the negotiating parties of what is meant.  When hard-won negotiations arrive at an agreed text, there cannot be different interpretations of a fundamental nature as to the meaning of those texts.  I hope that what we have seen over the last weekend is the last of that.  UK politicians and officials need to realise that the melodrama that has been played out publicly in Britain has huge negative impacts on our understanding of the capacity of the British negotiators to act in good faith and to deliver a deal that is delivered upon.</p>  <p>  A weak and divided British Government remains charged with squaring a very difficult circle.  Importantly, phase two negotiations still stand ahead of us and in reality there is now less than ten months left to finalise whatever detail will be accommodated before the actual exit proposals are put to the European Parliament at the end of next year.</p>  <p>  Donald Tusk circulated draft guidelines for the second phase of Brexit negotiations on Friday.  According to reports, EU countries have sought changes to those guidelines.  As I said, the devil will be in the detail and we will see all of that.</p><p>Ireland needs to discuss not only the details that will emerge from the arrangements that will be negotiated between Ireland and Britain, but we also needs time to discuss the future of Europe because there is a parallel agenda.  I hope the suggestion made by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, that we have more time and more engagement with officials in advance of these debates to deal with both of those important tracks for our future, is adopted.</p></speech>

For the last number of weeks we have rightly heard the Government and other parties in this House speak about the need for no Border, North or South, and yet the border that Europe imposes, which has resulted in 35,000 people drowning in the Mediterranean over the last five years, is a matter of complete indifference.  I have asked the Taoiseach three times today to comment on what is happening in Libya.  He has not uttered a word of response.  In the last week, Amnesty International has produced a report making the most damning allegations against all European governments and the European Union.  I will repeat for the record: &quot;European governments complicit in horrific abuse of refugees and migrants&quot;.  It goes on to say:</p><blockquote>Tens of thousands are being kept indefinitely in overcrowded detention centres where they are subjected to systematic abuse...<br /><br />European Governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses but are actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and detaining people in Libya.  They are complicit in these abuses.  European governments are actively supporting a sophisticated system of abuse and exploitation of refugees and migrants by the Libyan coastguard, detention authorities and smugglers in order to prevent people from crossing the Mediterranean.</blockquote><p>These people are experiencing slavery, physical and sexual abuse, extortion for money and horrific conditions of detention.  There are now 20,000 people living in these conditions.  There has not been a word from the Taoiseach on this issue and he did not mention in his speech that this would be brought up at the European Council.  He refused to answer questions on the matter twice this morning and then, probably because he knew we would raise the matter again, he walked out before the issue was raised.  The moral bankruptcy of our Government and the European Union is absolutely stunning.</p><p>We also asked if there would be any move from our Government or the European Union beyond expressing concern and hand-wringing over what Donald Trump has done in the last week in declaring war on the people of Palestine and the entire Middle East.  He has now legitimised the illegal annexation of East Jerusalem, in defiance of international law, by Israel.  It has put two fingers up to the peace process and the two-state solution, which Europe claims it supports.  Israel clearly has no interest in that solution.  Since 1993 the number of illegal settlers, in defiance of international law, on Palestinian territory has doubled to 600,000.  A 440 km wall separates Palestinians from their own land and from Jerusalem.  There are 167 different enclaves where the Israelis are slicing up Jerusalem, Hebron and other Palestinian territories in cities in order to occupy the area further in defiance in international law.  Nothing has been done.</p><p>Does anybody believe that the apartheid state of South Africa had a right to continue in existence?  We all accept it had to end.  The crimes that Israel is committing, which are now endorsed by the United States against the people of Palestine, are every bit as brutal, and in fact have been going on a lot longer than what happened in South Africa.  There have been no sanctions and no action.  There are expressions of concern.  When is the European Union and our Government going to find the moral compass and demand action rather than words and crocodile tears about the abuses of Palestinians or Libyans?</p></speech>

The negotiations are posed as a battle between a progressive EU, with an Irish Government wrapped in a tricolour on the one hand doing battle with a backward little-Englander Tory Party Government.  The reality is that working class people have no representatives in these negotiations.  They are negotiations between a capitalist Government on the one hand and a capitalist institution on the other.  It is what Connolly described as, &quot;Committees of the rich to manage the affairs of the capitalist class&quot;.  The British capitalist class are on one side and on the other side is the European capitalist class, which includes the ruling class in this country.</p><p>Neither side represents nor cares about the interests or concerns of working class people on this island, North or South.  Their interests demand that there be no increased Border between North and South or between Ireland and Britain.  Neither is acceptable because either would deepen sectarian division.  The European Commission has found it useful, for its own negotiating purposes at this stage, to use the Border, but the reality is that if it suits it can be forgotten at a later stage and it does not have to be a part of the final withdrawal agreement.  We have to restate the reality of what the European Union is.  We do not have to go far back in time to remind ourselves.  Only yesterday, the Amnesty International report which Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned concluded that the EU is knowingly complicit in the torture and abuse of refugees and migrants in Libya.  In order to stem migration the EU is actively supporting: &quot;A system of abuse and exploitation in Libya&quot;.  This is fortress Europe.  </p><p>Yesterday Jean-Claude Junker, the President of the European Commission, tweeted: </p><blockquote>She is awake.  The sleeping beauty of the Lisbon Treaty.  Permanent Structured Co-Operation is happening.  I welcome the operational steps taken today by member states to lay the foundations of a European defence union.  Our security cannot be outsourced.</blockquote><p>The Irish Government tries to maintain that there is nothing to see here concerning PESCO.  This is a Europe of war and imperialism.  Every single day we see the impact of the neo-liberal nature of the European Union in this country.  There is the housing crisis and the refusal to use the money that exists in NAMA and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  That relates to the EU rules and its neo-liberal nature.  It is the same in the case of the starving of our public services of investment.  The EU, together with successive Governments, have been decisive in creating this new norm of permanent austerity by writing austerity and neo-liberalism into law in the fiscal treaty and the various fiscal rules in the interests of bankers, bond holders and big business in Europe.  That is the European Union we are talking about.  It is a racist, militarised, neo-liberal institution.  That is the EU that working class people in Britain voted to leave.</p><p>The unfortunate reality is the bargain-basement Brexit which the Tories are driving towards will also be a disaster for working people.  Their Brexit is a Brexit in the interests of the city of London and of agri-business, with a further race to the bottom in terms of taxation and regulation on environment, consumer and labour issues.  Any trade deal done by the Tories and negotiated with the EU post-Brexit will again be done in the interests of big business.  It could potentially be a back door, via a Britain-US trade deal for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, for access to the EU, which is rejected by the vast majority of people because it will lead to a race to the bottom.  We oppose the attempts to use the crisis around Brexit to attack workers' rights and conditions.  Trade Unions have to take immediate measures to ensure that workers and small farmers do not pay the price of competition between vested economic interests.</p><p>What is the answer?  The alternative is a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government implementing socialist policies and breaking with what he has described as a rigged system of neo-liberalism and capitalism, which includes taking the key sources of wealth into public ownership.  Corbyn has suggested that he may be open to staying in the Single Market, but the reality is that the Single Market would act as a substantial block on implementing many of his most popular policies, including the nationalisation of transport, energy and the development of a national investment bank.  That is because it pushes further the liberalisation and privatisation of public services.</p><p>It is a barrier to nationalisation.  It drives a race to the bottom in terms of workers' wages through European Court of Justice, ECJ, rulings such as those on Viking Line and Laval.  If Corbyn or an Irish left government was to implement a left-wing socialist programme, it would inevitably result in a major clash with the EU, just as there was when the Greek people attempted to reject austerity before the betrayal of the Syriza Government.  Corbyn would also be forced to exit the European Union and the Single Market, not on the basis of the race to the bottom proposed by the Tories, but on the basis of appealing to workers in Ireland, Greece, Spain and across Europe to build a very different type of Europe - a democratic socialist Europe.  Right across Europe we need left socialist governments to break with the rigged system of capitalism.  With left governments here, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, the question of a border would not arise.  New relations of co-operation, of trade on a fair and equal basis and of mutual assistance would operate to ensure that borders were brought down rather than erected.  Together, these governments would build a democratic socialist confederation of Europe.</p></speech>

When we pointed out that there was not nearly enough debating time on this matter and that the public is not aware of it, the Government pointed out that as the provision was in the Lisbon treaty, it has been in place since 2009.  If that is the case and if this was a foregone conclusion anyway, why did the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, say she could never have imagined at the start of her mandate three years ago that the EU would take such steps?  Why did she say that?  I do not understand that.  The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, likened the defence push to a fairy tale come true for EU integration.  If this was all on the cards anyway, why would he say that?  It actually was not.</p><p>There is a notion that this does not affect our neutrality.  The Minister and I exchanged views on the &quot;Saturday with Claire Byrne&quot; programme.  He said that our neutrality cannot be interfered with and Claire Byrne responded that the people of Ireland would not have a vote on a referendum on opting in or out.  The Minister said that if it impacted on the Constitution it would obviously have to go to a referendum, as we are a constitutionally neutral country.  That is not actually true.  Neutrality is not enshrined in the Constitution.  Edward Horgan tested that in 2003.  Mr. Justice Kearns ruled that Irish neutrality is not in the Constitution but is Government policy, to be implemented as it sees fit.  </p><p>As it turns out, we know that we abandoned neutrality in 2001 by allowing Shannon Airport to be used for military purposes.  The Minister will remember that on the same programme, I asked whether, were an alternative government to appear in the coming years that allowed the Russians to use Shannon Airport as a military base, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour - which have all backed US military use of Shannon Airport - would say that alternative Government was acting neutrally?  They would not.  They would be right not to.  It would not be neutral to let the Russians in, no more than it is neutral to let the Americans in.  </p><p>There is an amendment in the Constitution for which Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who is a Fianna F&aacute;il man believe it or not, was responsible.The amendment states &quot;The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State.&quot;  We are actually breaking the rules.  We are joining a common defence.  That is a fact and that is against the Constitution.  We have checked it out and it looks like we would find it difficult to win an appeal on the issue but it is a fact.  Our neutrality has been sold down the river.  </p><p>The Irish people in general have no interest in being involved with any country militarily, be it the Russians, the Americans, the French, the Brits or whoever.  We do not want anything to do with them.  For whatever reason, however, a certain section of the establishment in Ireland has a love affair with American military efforts.  The militarisation of the world has gone out of control.  The US has just announced an increase in its military budget for 2018.  It will spend &euro;700 billion in 2018 on defence when it has 50 million people at risk of poverty.  It is nuts and we are helping it to bomb places.  </p><p>There is a love-in with President Kennedy.  There is a school in Wexford named in honour of him.  It is such nonsense.  People must remember that Kennedy proactively laid the foundations for what was probably the most savage war since the Second World War, namely, the war in Vietnam.  Some 3 million Vietnamese people and more than 57,000 US military personnel died.  In May 1963, Kennedy was asked to assess the situation in Vietnam.  He said:</p><blockquote>We don&rsquo;t have a prayer of staying in Vietnam.  Those people hate us.  They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point.  But I can&rsquo;t give up that territory to the communists and get the [American] people to re-elect me.</blockquote><p>What did he do?  He put his electoral ambitions before the lives of US soldiers and millions of Vietnamese people.  What a lovely man.  His picture hangs over the mantelpiece of many houses in Ireland and we have a school named in honour of him in Wexford.  One would not be well.</p></speech>

The first is the issue of Spain and Catalonia.  There will not be another meeting of the Council before the elections there take place.  This is not about taking sides.  The Spanish Government called the elections.  There is a body of thinking that this is an internal matter between Spain and Catalonia, but I believe there is a role in it for the European Council.  That role is to ensure that the elections are open, transparent and free from the kind of violence we saw in recent times.  There is also a role for the Council in ensuring that there is respect for the results of those elections.</p>  <p>  There are a couple of issues in that regard.  One concern is that those people who wear a yellow ribbon going to vote may be prevented from going into the polling stations.  There has also been evidence of pressure on the media not to give space to the Catalan candidates.  Of course, that would be a violation of the principle of freedom of expression.  The organisation DIPLOCAT has also been closed down by the Spanish Government.  I hope the European Council would support the presence of international observers at the elections.  My understanding is that it is not keen because the Spanish Government does not want this.  It is most important that the results of the election are respected.  If there is a majority from those parties that are in favour of independence, the European Council should encourage dialogue.  Even if the parties opposed to Catalan independence win, there would still be a need for dialogue to address the very real issues the Catalan people have.  Basically, the Council should be a voice advocating respect for democracy.</p>  <p>  I draw attention to Amnesty International's report on deadly but preventable attacks on, killings of and enforced disappearances of those who defend human rights.  The findings are damning in respect of states which are failing in their duty to effectively protect those who defend human rights.  These are people who are defending women's rights and the rights of LGBT people.  They are environmentalists, trade unionists, teachers, community leaders, lawyers, journalists and farmers.  The list is increasing, as is the list of those forcibly disappeared by these states.  We hear about the threats, the attacks and the assassinations but they are not being properly investigated and therefore perpetrators are not being brought to justice.  What message does that send?  Again we return to a UN declaration on human rights defenders back in 1998.  It states we protect and we recognise the work of human rights defenders, but there is no follow-up when there are attacks on human rights defenders.  One has to ask what the point of declarations and statements is if there is no meaningful action.</p>  <p>  On the Jerusalem issue, Jerusalem is an important city to people of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths.  The recent announcement by President Trump has certainly not been helpful.  It has led to violence in the area.  It also undermines the efforts of Fatah and Hamas to reconcile and create a political vision for Palestine.  It also undermines the recent ceasefire announced by Hamas.  In a bizarre, ironic way, something positive could come from this.  For the first time in ages attention is focused on the situation.  For too long lip service has been paid to the two-state solution but nothing has been done to bring it about.  There is no impetus or urgency in getting talks under way again and in the meantime, more land is being taken in order to build settlements.</p><p>Two committees of which I am a member met various Israeli and Palestinian delegations, all of whom are committed to a just and lasting peace and who want to live their lives without any fear of violence.  Perhaps it is time for the EU to consider further recognition of the Palestinian state as an impetus to bring about further talks.</p> <p> As regards official development assistance, ODA, from Europe, our ODA is focused on poverty reduction and the poorest countries but there seems to be a possible change in the definition of ODA in Europe to include expenditure on in-country refugee costs and peacekeeping, which would be a very retrograde step.</p> <p> PESCO has the potential to complement NATO.  There was a couple of hours of debate on the matter with the Minister at the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and a couple of hours of debate in the House, which is very much in contrast with the level of debate, discussion and presentations in respect of the repeal of the eighth amendment or on our foreign aid policy and which led to the One World, One Future policy.  I hope that at the European Council, Ireland will not present that PESCO is something with which everybody in the country agrees but, rather, that there has been much criticism of it and that discussion in that regard is not yet over.</p></speech>

The agreement that has been negotiated is a result of the united front the Government has been able to provide in its negotiating stance.  That is in contrast to the obvious divisions within the Government of the United Kingdom, which have been illustrated by a solemnly negotiated report and agreement being almost immediately disparaged by that Government.  That shows very poor political judgment on its part and that it does not have a coherent Brexit policy.  The UK Government is in disarray on Brexit.  It is very important that we maintain a unified front.  The trustworthiness of the British Government has been called into question by remarks made by senior figures in recent days but we must nevertheless maintain a unified front.  The British Government is trying to act tough in advance of phase 2 of the exit negotiations and realises how difficult it will be for it and that Brexit is not in its best interests.  The enormity and impracticality of the task it faces are coming to the fore.  Losing all advantages of European Union membership to be replaced by the uncharted waters of trading arrangements with third parties and trying to forge new trading arrangements with the EU will be very difficult.  What occurred in phase 1 has crystallised for the British Government the difficulties it faces in respect of Brexit.  It is very important that we have played an important part in bringing about that crystallisation.  It was very positive that the Irish question was part of phase 1 because it has crystallised people's thinking on both sides.  It will eventually dawn on the British Government that membership of the EU, far from being contrary to its national interest, is complementary to it.  Staying within the common trade area and the customs union is far more likely now that it has had to face the reality of dealing with what will happen in Northern Ireland.  It is also critically important that an Assembly and Executive be reinstated in Northern Ireland in order that people there have a forum to debate their future in Europe and how they see their future being aligned with the United Kingdom and with the Republic.</p>  <p>  The agreement states that the Good Friday Agreement will be upheld, there will be no hard border and that Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the United Kingdom and the UK internal market.  That is crystallised in paragraphs 49 and 50, where North-South and east-west relations are identified.  There is a core contradiction.  The United Kingdom remains committed to protecting North-South co-operation and guarantees to avoid a hard border and intends to achieve those objectives through an overall EU-UK relationship.  However, that is difficult to reconcile with the fact that Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of the United Kingdom.  How can that be reconciled with no hard border and maintaining full alignment between North and South?  That is the core contradiction that must be resolved in phase 2 of the negotiations.  It is very important that the principles that have been agreed are incorporated into the final agreement.  It is imperative that we maintain our stance and are not in any way distracted by negotiations in phase 2.  We have to be to the fore of the negotiations and must keep North-South alignment to the fore.</p></speech>

Throughout the discussions and again in the House today the Taoiseach has said it concerns issues such as cybercrime or peacekeeping training.  However, what has been said by President Tusk and others leads one to believe that it is the culmination of years of aspiration for a move towards a European defence union.  I am very concerned that because of that dishonest disconnect, we are not being straight with the Irish people as to what we are doing and entering and we are making a mistake in that regard.  If we are to progress towards a more integrated Union, it cannot be on the basis of inaccuracies or deceit or not telling the whole truth.  That is what I fear and it is one of the reasons I opposed and am concerned by our commitment to PESCO.</p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned about the nature of the development because it seems that the entire focus is on the southern borders of the EU and the security situation in terms of the relationship across the Mediterranean with north Africa and the Middle East.  In that regard, as was earlier mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett and others, Libya was previously thrown into anarchy and chaos by the actions of our neighbours, Britain and France, in their application of military solutions in that country.  Investment in military infrastructure will not address the security and peace issues on the southern borders of Europe.</p>  <p>  If we are serious about peace in the Middle East and our relationships with countries in that region, the Taoiseach must show a lead in joining and going further than the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, by stating that we cannot tolerate the actions of the US President in threatening to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the Israeli State.  There is a possible opportunity at this time.  The Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, today said that the US can no longer be seen as a mediator or accepted as an honest broker in a negotiated settlement.  Rather than deploying military force and might, Europe should take diplomatic and political actions against the State of Israel, seek compensation for the damage done by Israel to European-funded investments in Palestine and recognise that the actions taken in illegal settlements cannot be tolerated.  Europe must step up to the plate and not allow the further vacuum created by the actions of President Trump go without response.</p>  <p>  As regards Brexit, I said last week to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and her colleagues that I was proud and thought it was a good week for Irish politics.  We were united in the D&aacute;il and with our European colleagues, which helped us get an agreement that two weeks previously I did not think we would have been able to get.</p><p>When I read on Monday last week the original transcript I was surprised that there was such specific clarity regarding future full alignment in the North of Ireland with the Single Market and customs union.  That wording surprised and pleased me.  In a strange way, what happened last week, the political mess of the DUP having to be appeased, led to a further improvement in the communiqu&eacute; regarding a commitment to try to avoid east-west divergence as the Northern Assembly might manage and administer it.  Everything we have heard since from British Government members has completely undermined that confidence because the question Deputy Brendan Howlin asked earlier is the vital one: is their backstop guarantee a real guarantee?  Was their word their bond when they wrote the words "in the event of not getting a trade deal"?  We all know, as does anyone involved in this process, that the chances of their getting their flight of fancy trade deal is so remote that the backstop guarantee is called immediately into question.  We have a particularly difficult situation because the main opposition party in the UK seems as duplicitous as the Government in answering the obvious, straight questions we must ask.  We will continue to support the Government in trying to get straight answers to these questions.  We believe there needs to be change.  My colleague, Steven Agnew, sits in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Assembly itself needs to look at how this will be worked out.  We cannot just leave the current situation stuck as is.  We need to consider the constitutional arrangements in the North in implementing this and we will help in that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.496" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300032#EE00200"><p>In the few minutes I have I wish to concentrate on aspects of the agreement reached last week in respect of Brexit.  It is remarkable and unfortunate that we have not had D&aacute;il time this week to express our views on the agreement and I hope this will be corrected early in the new year.</p>  <p>  I have concerns that differing perspectives as to what the Brexit agreement actually means will undoubtedly cause problems over the coming year or so.  The deal references the Good Friday Agreement in several parts and on several occasions.  While the idea of a fudge in the Good Friday Agreement may have been a necessary evil in allowing people from a number of different sides to claim victory, the same does not apply in respect of the Brexit agreement.  We need to know at an early stage exactly what the deal means and that is far from clear at this point.  David Davis's "statement of intent" comments over the weekend show that there is some degree of malleability in the understanding of the phrasing being used, in particular given that the DUP has been placated, as it were, by Article 50 of the agreement.  A particular issue in Article 49 of last Friday's agreement now also needs to be clarified.  Article 49 states, "In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement."  In the context of "a guarantee" of no hard border, the use of the weasel phrase "those rules" is quite worrying as it is open to interpretation, particularly when read in the context of the preceding part of Article 49, which states, "[T]he United Kingdom will propose specific solutions to address the...circumstances of the island of Ireland" if a hard border cannot be avoided through the future relationships between the EU and the UK.  We know that the UK had 18 months to come up with these solutions in the context of phase 1 and failed to do so, so where is the succour there regarding the ability of the UK to do so in the future?  The concern is that we could be left with four or more radically different interpretations of what "those rules" that support North-South co-operation and so on actually mean.  Different interpretations are possible from Dublin, London, Brussels and, at least potentially, Belfast.  The Government needs to clarify what it understands by the phrase "those rules".  What does it actually mean?  The Government also needs to ensure that its understanding is the same as that of the European Commission and the 26 other member states.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear as to what rules we are talking about.  While the main focus of the sections on Ireland and Northern Ireland is trade and the prevention of a hard border, there are aspects of Articles 52 and 53 that need to be examined in much more detail.  Article 52 states, "The people of Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens, including where they reside in Northern Ireland."  Furthermore, Article 53 states, "The United Kingdom commits to ensuring that no diminution of rights is caused by its departure from the European Union, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination enshrined in EU law."  The text of the Good Friday Agreement states, "The British Government will complete incorporation into Northern Ireland law of the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, with direct access to the courts and remedies for breach of the Convention, including power for the courts to overrule Assembly legislation on grounds of inconsistency."  However, that is all changed now, so it is very difficult to envisage a situation whereby people will have rights as European citizens, including access to the courts, if they hold Irish passports.  What about people in Northern Ireland who do not hold Irish passports?  What about their rights in terms of what they understood those rights to be under their previous status as members of the European Union?  Article 56 of last week's agreement states that the issues related to Ireland will be examined in a distinct strand in phase 2 of the negotiations.  It seems to me that in the rush to nail down a deal, some very difficult issues were parked and left open to interpretation.  We need to bring clarity to all those areas I have identified and others before too long because we cannot continue with this level of uncertainty surrounding such critical issues, neither in respect of how the Border might actually work nor in respect of the rights of all citizens within Northern Ireland.  That circle still has not been squared and we need clarification as we go forward.</p></speech>

We have been very clear that the future of the Union is as important for us as it is for other European partners.  There have been a number of discussions on the future of Europe, including at the summits in Bratislava, Valletta, Rome and Tallinn recently.  The House will be aware that on 15 November we launched our own national citizens' engagement with a view to ensuring that everyone on this island has the opportunity to make his or her views known on this extremely important topic.</p>  <p>  I have been involved in a number of events since then, engaging with the public, stakeholders and, as recently as an hour ago, our European Commissioner for Education, school students and other people from across the board.  I know that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs is also consulting actively with stakeholders, including on the basis of the various papers published by the Commission.  On 20 October the European Council endorsed the Leaders' Agenda proposed by President Tusk.  The aim of this agenda is to guide action over the next two years on the basis of a concrete work programme and set a course for the future of the EU.  The first discussion under this format took place in Gothenburg on 17 November alongside the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth.  The outcome of these two meetings will form the basis for discussions at the European Council tomorrow and was discussed yesterday at the General Affairs Council, which I attended with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p>  <p>  On the social dimension, in Gothenburg an inter-institutional proclamation on the pillar of social rights was signed by the Presidents of the Council, the Commission and the Parliament as a signal of the Union's shared commitment to strong social values and social progress.  The aim of the Gothenburg summit was to ensure that, as we continue to develop and co-operate economically, we also protect and promote the necessary social standards and labour rights.</p>  <p>  As with the social dimension, culture and education are largely areas where member states retain competence but where the Union plays an important role in co-ordination, co-operation and the sharing of best practice and this is a formula that to date has worked.</p><p>This year, 2017, marks the 30th anniversary of the creation of the ERASMUS programme, which is a prime example of what co-operation in this area, along with some imagination, can achieve for our citizens.  In preparing for tomorrow's discussions, we are mindful of the limits of co-operation on these matters, while remaining optimistic about the possibility of delivering positive outcomes, including, for example, around greater mobility and improved language learning, by continuing to work together into the future.  This approach fits well with the national language programme launched some days ago by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p> <p> Although Ireland has been somewhat removed from the full effects of recent mass migration, we have worked to make a positive contribution to the EU response.  We have contributed more than &euro;93 million since 2012 to support those affected by the Syrian crisis.  We have supplied a series of fully crewed naval vessels to humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean which have saved the lives of more than 17,500 people.  We recently joined Operation Sophia in order to support common EU efforts to tackle the activities of people smugglers.  In addition, we have committed to taking up to 4,000 people under EU resettlement and relocation schemes.  There has been significant progress by the EU and its member states in handling both the root causes and the effects of migration.  Although the full force of the crisis has receded, the challenges will continue for years to come and we need to consider how best to respond into the future.  The President of the European Council, Mr. Tusk, has selected this issue for discussion tomorrow under the leaders' agenda format, which will facilitate an open exchange of views on the basis of a paper which addresses both the internal and external aspects of migration.  Formal conclusions will not be adopted tomorrow, but the discussion should pave the way for further work in this area in the first half of 2018.  Ireland is not automatically bound by measures on migration but, under Protocol 21, we may choose to opt into them.  We acknowledge the need to reform the common European asylum system and we intend to play a constructive role in finding shared solutions that work for all member states.  </p> <p>Several colleagues queried whether we have what amounts to a backstop or fail-safe in the text agreed last week between the United Kingdom and the EU.  At yesterday's meeting of the European General Affairs Council, Mr. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator in the Brexit process, was very clear in his statement that the agreement reached last Friday stands.  One can describe it as a gentleman's agreement or something else, but what is certain is that the Government will uphold it on our end and the European Commission very much expects the United Kingdom to do the same.  We are very clear in our interpretation of the text that irrespective of the outcome of the second phase of negotiations, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  The UK will have to square any circles that need to be squared to achieve that end in the course of the negotiations on its future relationship with the EU.</p> <p> Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked about any impact assessments that have been undertaken in respect of Brexit.  The impact of the UK's departure will very much depend on what the future relationship looks like between it and the EU.  In the meantime, contingency planning is ongoing across all Departments, encompassing all possible outcomes and scenarios.  This includes an assessment of the various different implications for specific policy areas.  We will keep the House updated in that regard.  </p> <p> Regarding the Palestinian situation, there is complete unity among member states that the EU will not emulate the unilateral recognition by the United States President, Mr. Donald Trump, of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The only solution to the conflict is a two-state solution with Jerusalem as the shared capital.  Ireland's position in this regard has not changed and is aligned with that of the EU.</p> <p>I thank Deputies for their contributions and questions.  The Taoiseach will report back to the House in due course on the discussions at the December European Council meeting.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy English, will be familiar with this issue, which centres primarily on the Leixlip local area plan.  It comes on the heel of decisions made by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for Sallins and Celbridge.  There have been three area plans in 12 months and there are more area plans for Naas and Maynooth to go through in the next 12 months.  We are seeing a pattern where local democracy and democratic decisions taken by local councillors are being overruled by either the Ministers or their officials, and certainly by the Department.  The local councillors live in the area, they are elected for the area and they understand what will work there.  This will be three in a row if this Leixlip area plan is to go ahead.  It is not good enough.  The Minster and the Department are not accountable in the same way as local councillors.</p>  <p>  The facts in this case are that St. Catherine's Park is a very important and strategic asset to the people of Leixlip, and to the people of Fingal, Lucan and surrounding areas.  The two different councils, Kildare County Council with 40 councillors and Fingal County Council with 33 councillors, have passed motions at their respective meetings to safeguard the park, to ensure no road goes through the park, and that the park be protected as an amenity for the people.  St. Catherine's Park enjoys green flag status and is an essential amenity for the people in those areas.</p>  <p>  The proposed road does not need to go through St. Catherine's Park.  The M50 outer orbital route is a viable alternative.  The Minister of State will be familiar with the Navan-Newbridge proposed route where originally there was a plan for an outer orbital route from Drogheda through Navan down to Newbridge and back to Wicklow.  If there is a need to go from north to south, it does not need to go through St. Catherine's Park.</p>  <p>  On a point primarily of local democracy and, second, of amenity value, I call on the Minister of State not to overrule the democratic wishes expressed by the people of Leixlip through their councillors and to safeguard this park.</p></speech>

With my colleague Deputy Lawless, I want to highlight and address the local concerns involved in this issue.</p>  <p>  I represent the views of the many thousands of people who use St. Catherine's Park as an amenity every day.  I am also representing the group, set up on a voluntary basis, called Save St. Catherine's Park.  This group was formed as a result of the major concerns about this issue.  People do not want the amenity of St. Catherine's Park spoiled in any way.  They do not want any infrastructure or development going anywhere close to or through the park.  People want the park kept as it is.  It is a major, positive asset not only for Leixlip, but also for the people of Celbridge, Maynooth and the surrounding areas of Kildare and Dublin, including Lucan and Clondalkin.  It is a recognised amenity and is determined as an asset at community, local, regional and national levels.  Working with the Minister of State and his officials, we want to ensure that the park is maintained on that basis.</p>  <p>  The original Kildare local area plan had a suggestion of an indicative line for a possible route for a road going close to or in St. Catherine's Park.  At a later stage, RPS compiled a report on route selection and it put out one option as an indicative route to go through St. Catherine's Park.  The Minister of State might appreciate the alarm bells and the local concerns around the Kildare local area plan and with the RPS report that reflects the road through St. Catherine's Park as an option or an indicative route.  This is a route that absolutely nobody wants, locally or anywhere else.  No group or individual wants this; they want to keep the amenity as it stands.</p>  <p>  In the Chamber today, we ask the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to commit to upholding the views of the people locally, the community groups and the public representatives.  The councillors in Fingal and in Kildare county councils have voted overwhelmingly to remove that indicative line to ensure the park remains as it is and I ask the Minister of State to commit to upholding those views.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300034#MM00500"><p>I thank Deputies Lawless and O'Rourke for giving me the opportunity to clarify matters in respect of the Leixlip and Celbridge local area plans, a matter I addressed a couple of weeks ago in a debate in this House.</p>  <p>  My role under the planning code in relation to statutory plans is simply to ensure that they are consistent with established national planning policies and that they comply with the relevant legislative requirements.  Where this does not happen, the Legislature has provided a power to issue directions under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act, which acts as a safeguarding mechanism and, mindful of the local democratic process, I am glad to say it is used sparingly relative to some 300 statutory development plans and local area plans that exist across the State.</p>  <p>  With regard to Leixlip and Celbridge, my sole concern is that Kildare County Council upholds its statutory obligations in relation to the core strategy outlined in the Kildare county development plan and given that they are at different stages I will address them separately.  With the Leixlip local area plan, the statutory process is ongoing and so it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail at this stage.  Notwithstanding this, I am very happy to refute any suggestion that my Department or I support road development proposals through St. Catherine&rsquo;s Park, which is a hugely valuable and strategic amenity for the communities in Leixlip, Lucan and surrounding areas.  To the extent that existing roads infrastructure in the area is deficient, my Department would instead encourage enhancements to the existing network.</p>  <p>  Turning to the Celbridge area plan, unfortunately, there have been breaches by the council in relation to its statutory obligations by seeking to zone for new housing at peripheral locations sprawling towards the M4 while at the same time failing to meet the strategic needs of its existing town centre.  Kildare County Council's own county development plan has earmarked Celbridge to grow in population by some 10,000 people over the next five to ten years.  We need to plan for this and we need to ensure that Celbridge has a heart and soul.  This means we need more than just sprawling housing developments surrounding weak town centres, which is so symptomatic of other Irish commuter towns.</p><p> We want Celbridge to be more than just a dormitory commuter town.  We want the population to be part of the community - the spirit of the town.  The existing historic town centre of Celbridge needs to be sensitively developed too in order to match the requirements of its fast-growing population.  This must happen without resorting to the kinds of out of town centre retailing and other services which so many Deputies in this House have, rightly, decried as undermining the vitality of existing town centres.  We had the same discussion earlier today at a committee meeting.</p> <p> My only aim is to ensure that settled national policy is upheld, that we get the matter of locating new housing right and that we support strong town centres.  It was for those objectives that I issued a direction to Kildare County Council last month.  I did not do that lightly.  I visited the town several times and saw what needs to be done.  I recognise how important it is that I use the powers vested in me for the good of the town and that I uphold long-term planning objectives.  That is not to say that decision-making on local planning policy at council level does not have an important role to play.  It is rare that I overturn decisions made by local authorities.  When I have to intervene, it is with good reason and following very careful consideration of all the issues.  My role is to provide a strategic, national perspective in administering local planning policy, which, in turn, benefits local communities in the long term.  If this were not done and these decisions were made under local planning policies, we would have a situation where the communities impacted upon by these decisions would regret the situations in which they found themselves in the context of having to provide the shops and services they need at the edges of their towns or, even worse than that, perhaps not in their own towns but in neighbouring ones.  If ministerial powers were not used, the Deputies might raise another matter to discover why we had not taken action and what we should do to enable proper and focused town centre development.</p> <p> I accept that concerns have been expressed to the effect that the development of the lands behind the main street in Celbridge is some sort of thin end of a wedge as regards wider development of lands at Donaghcumper and that it also involves the development of part of Castletown House demesne.  From my perspective as Minister of State, I want to see the demesne of Castletown House protected and sensitively conserved as much as anyone else.  It is stretching matters in the extreme to suggest that the development of lands to the rear of the main street in Celbridge, which are, visually and functionally, quite separate from the demesne, will compromise its integrity.  I am quite confident that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent any wider development proposals - or any future development proposals - on the subject lands affecting the integrity of the demesne.  More importantly, the benefits of being able to provide for the orderly and sensitive development of the town centre must not be set aside.  In addition, the development of the area behind the main street will also facilitate a new public park and riverside amenity, which will be a major attractor for the town centre.  All of those involved need to work together to get this moving.</p> <p> I emphasise that I am ready to work with Kildare County Council in implementing its plans in a way that will protect the commercial vitality of the town centre and the heritage value of the adjacent Castletown House demesne, as well as enabling the creation of a new riverside public amenity as set out in the local area plan.</p></speech>

If that is the case, this can be categorically ruled out.  It is a very welcome development.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State says that this is a rarely wielded power but my experience suggests otherwise.  In north Kildare, area plans have been drawn up for Kilcock, Sallins, Clane, Celbridge and Leixslip and there has been ministerial intervention in respect of three of them.  The Minister of State's claim is not borne out by reality.  The power is being used far too frequently, which is a matter of some concern in the context of local democracy.</p>  <p>  There are other threats to area plans from ministerial overrides.  There is the Confey master plan, which is an extension of the area plan.  Before that progresses, what kind of master plan action is envisaged for that area.  Residents are very concerned about the position in respect of lands adjacent to the Celbridge road at Leixslip, referred to in the local area plan as "KDA 2".  They would like their concerns to be given a hearing at least, even if, ultimately, the override is wielded.  This is the duty of councillors but they have been taken out of the picture.  I hope this does not become a pattern.</p></speech>

Many people will be watching this debate closely and have heard the Minister of State give his unambiguous commitment that he does not support any infrastructure or roads being constructed anywhere close to or in St. Catherine's Park.  That is a very welcome statement from him and his Department and it will be received positively by the people of Leixlip and surrounding areas.  We want to ensure that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland follow suit.  I welcome the Minister of State's comment to the effect that he would encourage consideration of other alignments close to the existing network rather than spoiling a good amenity.  That is very positive and we hope that position will remain unchanged.  We thank the Minister of State for his commitment and his clarification.</p></speech>

The Legislature has made provision for ministerial powers to issue statutory planning guidelines.  These guidelines need to be implemented in practice, they are not something to which we should only pay lip-service.  The Deputy referred to the powers being used in three of five locations but there are 300 plans ongoing and I have had to intervene in very few cases.  The Legislature has put in place powers of direction in respect of local planning and policy-making decisions for me to use as necessary.  Usually, the local process gets it right but on this occasion it got matters wrong.  The focus should now move to implementing the Celbridge local area plan and I wish to confirm again that I will work actively with Kildare County Council on infrastructural delivery and sustainable urban development.  In addition, we are ready to work with the council in tackling the wider infrastructural delivery challenges to ensure that Celbridge and Leixlip play their full part in fulfilling the core strategy of the Kildare county development plan using the full range of housing and planning policy initiatives.  Decisions will be made on the issues raised this evening in respect of the Leixlip plan in the coming week.  This discussion is timely.  I cannot go into the details now but I will keep the issues raised here in mind.</p>  <p>  I hope the position on St. Catherine's is clear.  Many of the people who approached the Deputies have also emailed me but I have not had a chance to respond to them all.  I am not sure where these rumours come from but people should understand that I have no intention of putting a road through their park.</p></speech>

The latter is a road with which the Minister of State is probably familiar.  This is a public private partnership development which will see six sites - across five local authority areas - being developed.  The numerous issues which we face in housing can only be solved by supply and there is no disagreement on that, but the placing of this development causes me disquiet and I strongly believe that the area needs serious commitments in respect of facilities to match the development.</p>  <p>  The Dublin city development plan outlines that Dublin City Council must ensure that all large developments are delivered in tandem with access to "essential infrastructure, such as transport, schools, childcare facilities, health facilities and recreational facilities."  Looking at transport in particular, the figures are confusing as to why this site was selected.  The nearest public transport is a bus route a 600 m walk away.  It should be borne in mind that this is an entirely social development and that there is no provision for car parking or at least not for every apartment.  It is confusing why people are expected to walk 600 m.  The new Luas extension was given as one reason for why the site was chosen but it is located 1.5 km away.  When representations were made to Dublin Bus that Finglas South and Finglas West - and Scribblestown within that - to the Luas line in Broombridge, a straightforward and modest request, the company agreed.  The matter has been resting with the National Transport Authority, NTA, for several months.  The Luas line has been opened but there has been no movement.</p>  <p>  The new primary school provided for Scribblestown by the Department of Education and Skills was not built in the catchment area.  It is not in Finglas or Scribblestown but in Broombridge which, as I said, has no transport links with Finglas or Scribblestown whatsoever.  That is incredible.  We are putting people in more social housing without giving them the wraparound services or facilities that they need.  Having grown up in an entirely social housing development in Ballymun, I can say that it was and is a good community and a good area but one which was not provided with the services it needed, which gave rise to the troubles that plagued the area during the 1980s and 1990s.  It is clear that mistakes have been made in the past and that lessons were learned but they seem to have been forgotten in the context of this development in Scribblestown.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State give a commitment from the Department that if this public private partnership development goes ahead, he will lobby other Ministers, Departments and the NTA to ensure the provision of the basic services this area needs.  There is not even a footpath leading to the Scribblestown estate on one side of the road.  This is incredible in Dublin city, and now we are adding another 70 apartments to the front of the estate, which was originally built as an affordable housing scheme when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  We obviously need more affordable housing schemes.</p><p>I look forward to seeing the Government's plans on that in due course.  These people in Scribblestown understandably feel somewhat shafted because when they bought their houses as an affordable housing scheme they were told this site at the front was going to be developed as a community centre but it is being used for apartments, without any of the services initially promised and no sign of that community centre whatsoever.  I would appreciate a commitment from the Minister of State that he will advocate proper transport links, proper schooling and health care facilities in the area.  The primary care centre for Finglas was promised in 2011 but is nowhere in sight.  No site has been found.  Apparently a site cannot be found yet 1 ha of land was suddenly discovered when it came to housing.  I would appreciate the Minister of State's comments and commitments on this.  Perhaps he could point Dublin City Council formally towards developing a local area plan which is sorely needed for Finglas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.513" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300036#OO00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The social housing public private partnership, PPP, programme is a critical part of the Rebuilding Ireland action programme for housing and homelessness, involving an investment with a capital value of &euro;300 million to deliver 1,500 social housing units in three bundles.</p>  <p>  The first bundle, which comprises six PPP sites, is expected to provide over 500 units in the greater Dublin area.  Two of the sites are located in the Dublin City Council area, including the one at Scribblestown, which has approximately 74 social houses.  It is expected that construction on this bundle will commence next year, following the tender award, with new homes becoming available in 2019.</p>  <p>  The PPP programme complements the increased Exchequer-funded capital expenditure which is part of Rebuilding Ireland and allows for more social housing to be built in the context of available State resources.  The PPP is part of a range of housing options being used by the Government in order to maximise social housing delivery.  It is important to note that the sites being used will remain in local authority ownership and are being provided under licence for the duration of the 25 year PPP contract.  Tenants allocated to PPP units will be drawn from the local authority social housing waiting list in accordance with that local authority's allocation scheme.  The tenants will be subject to the standard arrangements that apply to other social housing allocations.</p>  <p>  The PPP site at Scribblestown was identified and proposed for inclusion in the social housing PPP programme by the Dublin social housing delivery task force and by Dublin City Council, having regard to social housing need and the suitability of the site to be developed for social housing at this location.</p>  <p>  The Department's guidelines concerning sustainability and social mix are set out in the 2007 document, Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities.  The assessment criteria for the selection of PPP sites, including the site at Scribblestown, reflect these guidelines.  While the new homes being developed are all for social housing purposes, sustainability is achieved within the wider framework of development planning for the area.  Based on data and analysis from Dublin City Council, the percentage of social housing in the wider Finglas south area, after the Scribblestown development is completed, would be just 27%.  The social housing need in the Ashtown, Blackhorse Avenue, Santry, Whitehall, Cabra, Finglas and Glasnevin areas of Dublin City Council is in excess of 4,000 applicants, based on the city council's data.  The development at Scribblestown will therefore contribute to delivering much-needed homes for these applicants within their general area.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to and supportive of the development of the site at Scribblestown as part of the PPP programme and welcomed the news that Dublin City Council approved the Part 8 planning process early last week.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to say that all Departments have a role under Rebuilding Ireland to make sure that any new housing is blended into an area and is well serviced in respect of transport and links to the community and facilities in respect of health and education services.  As social housing delivery is the number one priority of the Government all Departments have been involved in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  They all feed into that.  They all have a role in that.  I have no problem advocating that the services required to serve this would be developed if need be, if they are not put in place in 2018 and 2019 to service the site and the 74 new homes and families.</p>  <p>  In general as a planning authority we try to encourage planning to be done in the correct way, ideally through local area plans which identify all the needs of the area.  This site has been picked out and recommended by the local authority, as is its responsibility.  It passes all our tests for suitability too.  The Deputy is correct to say every Department has a role to play here and I will certainly make sure that message is passed on and that we advocate it across the board.</p></speech>

He referred several times to sustainable communities.  He can see from what I said earlier why I feel this scheme as it stands, with the resources as provided, does not constitute a sustainable community whatsoever.  It seems that some kind of cordon sanitaire has been set up around Finglas, particularly in the past decade, in respect of developments in health care, education and transport.  There is next to no public transport available there.</p>  <p>  In the past year when the Taoiseach said he stands up for people who get up early in the morning I believed him.  I still believe him and the people of Finglas believe him.  However, it goes without saying that the people in Scribblestown will have to get up earlier in the morning in order to access school or to get to a health care centre that is nowhere near there and to get to their places of work because there will be 70 apartments lumped in front of their community with no footpath, no bus stop for 500 m, no link to the new Luas station they are being told about and no school in their catchment area.  They were told they got a new school but it is nowhere near them.  Only four people enrolled in it because it is not in the right catchment area.  That is incredible.</p>  <p>  I would appreciate a commitment and a whole of Cabinet, whole of Government approach to these problems which are bubbling.  They will get worse.  I am not against social housing or developments but it is clear that more is being added to an area that is oversubscribed and under-resourced.  We are not getting the resources to match that need.  I appreciate that the Minister of State said he will advocate on behalf of the community and work with the city council and the relevant line Ministers to get something moving there because it is sorely needed. </p></speech>

I presume there are plans for a footpath to serve it because it has passed all of our tests and that is part of the planning process.  I understand there has been extensive dialogue with local residents and representatives who are understandably interested in what happens on the site and are keen to see that the development is delivered to a high standard and is socially sustainable for the area.  This dialogue has resulted in amendments to designs for the planned development and will further inform arrangements for its management and for developing the community.  The planning decision has already been made by members of Dublin City Council.  The PPP project at Scribblestown is an availability-based PPP model in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing units over a 25 year period in return for a monthly unitary payment.  The homes will be handed back to the local authority after 25 years in a pre-defined good quality condition.  The sites will remain in State ownership for the entire period.</p>  <p>  Given that it is an availability based PPP, I have to make clear that it is not possible for me, my Department or the council to agree to a condition that the site be developed using a different model to PPP or with a different density of social mix.  It has already gone to tender.  These are intrinsic elements of the PPP model being used for social housing.  With planning permission not in place we need to move on and deliver homes from all these key sites for local households who need them badly.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy and he can be assured the site is being developed to meet pressing social housing needs while being fully respectful of the importance of good planning and community practices.  I will work with our colleagues to do that as well.</p></speech>

When such an incident happens it is a reminder of the grave dangers of the job of protecting and serving our communities and that our respect and gratitude must be extended to our Garda public servants, those men and women who put their lives on the line for us.</p>  <p>  Just a few weeks after the school holidays began last summer and over following weeks I received shocking reports from delegations of my constituents about outrageous anti-social and criminal behaviour involving joyriding and related mayhem being inflicted on residents night after night and often all throughout the night.  I was informed that up to five and six vehicles were dangerously driven around a part of one estate in Dublin Bay North and then set on fire in nightly episodes often lasting up to 6 a.m.  Community leaders complained of cars being burned directly outside family homes and then being used as blockades of those homes as the lives of local children and families were put in jeopardy on a daily and nightly basis.  This hugely distressing mayhem was captured on photos and videos sent to me by constituents.  I immediately reported the re-emergence of this appalling behaviour to senior Garda officers and to the Deputy City Manager for housing and estate management.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the initial response of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Dublin City Council in midsummer was very slow and many residents felt let down by the garda&iacute; and local authority officials.  Following urgent requests from community leaders and local community safety forums and our Dublin North Central Joint Policing Committee, a policing plan was at last put into action which resulted in a reduction in this crime by early autumn.</p><p>I have contacted local garda&iacute; and Dublin City Council about the issue repeatedly in recent months because of grave concerns of a further upsurge in the joyriding terror in the period around Hallowe'en.  I raised the matter with the previous Minister, the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on Leaders' Questions on 26 October last.  Even in recent weeks, I have received ongoing reports of cars being driven recklessly and burned out in broad daylight.  On one recent Saturday afternoon, for example, a car was being joyridden disgracefully from 3 p.m. while residents allege repeated and multiple calls to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not elicit a response until approximately 9 p.m. that night.  While tyres are wrecked and cars are driven on the wheel rims, it is reported that the alleged ringleaders were witnessed calmly changing a tyre to continue the mayhem for a further period of hours.  I have visited the worst affected district many times and can verify that some streets and green amenity spaces have been left in a disgusting state with debris and blackened damage still clearly visible even after the removal of burned out cars.</p> <p> This appalling anti-social and criminal behaviour represents just one serious aspect of a wider increase in anti-social behaviour across other districts of Dublin Bay North and, I believe, other constituencies.  My office receives regular complaints of the intimidation of citizens and families, widespread vandalism of public facilities and damage to apartment blocks and housing estates.  What steps is the Minister taking to bring this behaviour to an end and to reassure householders that mindless anti-social and criminal behaviour will not be tolerated by this House or the Government?  What action is being taken to identify and apprehend the alleged ringleaders of joyriding and other criminal behaviour, to caution them, link them with junior liaison officers and the Garda diversion programme, which has been so successful and, if necessary, prosecute those who are most responsible?  As I asked the previous Minister last October, what action is being taken to identify and prosecute adults who sell or transfer vehicles to youngsters?  The Minister might remember that I brought the original legislation to cover that issue before the House myself because most of these cars are not stolen vehicles.  When will the long-promised community policing teams under the national Garda model of community policing be introduced in Garda Dublin metropolitan region north?</p> <p> Community policing and general Garda resources were devastated by the long years of austerity foisted on us by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael blanket bank guarantees.  In Dublin metropolitan region north, which covers Dublin Bay North and most of Dublin Fingal with a population of over 300,000 people, there were just 202 and 160 garda&iacute; deployed in the R and J Garda districts, respectively, last year.  The number of community garda&iacute; was cut to only 40.  We need urgent action to stop the resurgence of this horrible criminal behaviour and to bring peace and security to my constituents.</p></speech>

I join him and other Members in extending my good wishes for a speedy recovery to the garda who was injured in the line of duty last week in Ballymun.  Deputy Broughan will recall that I responded to his oral question on that issue on 5 December last.  Today, his focus is on the impact of dangerous driving and anti-social behaviour in his constituency of Dublin Bay North.  I share the Deputy's concern about joyriding and anti-social behaviour.  We all want and deserve to feel safe in our communities.  We want our families, friends and neighbours to feel safe.  Our communities are extensions of our homes and, in that regard, joyriding and anti-social behaviour fly in the face of what we expect to experience when we are at home in our communities.  The results of such behaviour can be tragic.  The participants in dangerous anti-social activities can be injured, sometimes seriously and sometimes fatally.  They may also inflict injuries on law-abiding citizens in communities.  Innocent passers-by, including other road users and pedestrians, can, unfortunately, meet a similar fate.  Families, friends, neighbours and, indeed, communities are left to pick up the pieces.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Broughan as an active public representative in his district and ask him to appreciate that I have no direct role in the prevention of anti-social behaviour or the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular the Commissioner.  I am informed, however, that the Garda conducts operations on an ongoing basis to target anti-social activities by young drivers.  To combat this behaviour, intelligence is gathered locally and areas are targeted as appropriate.  The Garda also works closely with local authorities to reduce such incidents and the opportunities for joyriding, anti-social behaviour and wider instances of public disorder.  As a result of the dangerous and anti-social driving behaviour experienced in a number of areas in the Deputy's constituency, the Garda has introduced a robust policy of public order patrols at weekends.  This has been particularly evident in recent weeks with a view to ensuring that there is a visible Garda presence in the communities concerned, that garda&iacute; attending calls are safe, that offenders are identified and targeted and that anti-social behaviour is prevented.  Ongoing liaison has been maintained with Dublin City Council and local Garda management has engaged continuously and directly with the communities affected and with local public representatives.  As a result of this collaborative approach, the Garda reports a clear improvement in the levels of anti-social behaviour in recent weeks in the communities concerned.  I commend this approach and all those involved in it.</p>  <p>  In particular, Dublin City Council has made improvements to the railings around Darndale Park, which has contributed to a reduction in driving in the park.  A number of youths involved in anti-social behaviour in the area have been identified and plans have been put in place to bring them within the case management programme, which is an effective tool to prevent future criminal behaviour.  A specific policing operation was put in place in one of the areas concerned in late October.  It involves a range of policing activities and the deployment of more than 25 garda&iacute; drawn from across the district and public order units.  Intensive patrolling and check points were conducted and I understand there has been an obvious improvement in the area recently albeit I would be grateful if Deputy Broughan would keep me informed of developments.  The programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities as part of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  Active engagement has proved fruitful and it is now vital that this ongoing engagement continues.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, local superintendents reported at a joint policing committee for the north central region in late summer that the move towards armed specialist units had meant local units had suffered from depleted resources.  That brings us back again to the need for community policing and to ensure that the necessary resources are made available.  Will the Minister come out to the Dublin metropolitan region north Garda district to visit the affected areas himself and meet directly with residents and some of the excellent community development activists who work diligently on the ground to promote more peaceful, safe and respectful communities?  Many of those leaders have given years of service and volunteer hours but, unfortunately, they feel let down by the Government, Garda and local authorities with regard to the current wave of anti-social and criminal behaviour.</p>  <p>  Some residents and community activists have reported to me that when they have contacted local garda&iacute;, they were told that the resources were not available to send a car.  In one case, a constituent alleges that he was told to get in touch with a local Deputy.  When one's street is being terrorised on a nightly basis, it is simply not good enough to hear such a response.  People are afraid to speak out and we know that when they do, they are often targeted, intimidated and harassed.  The estate most affected is supposed to have a Dublin City Council system of camera surveillance to act as a deterrent to this type of crime.  Unfortunately, there have been regular disruptions.  Why are these cameras not being monitored from Dublin City Council headquarters at Wood Quay or from the local civic offices for the north side on Bunratty Road to provide vital information to the Garda?  Citizens have also asked whether there is a major role for plain-clothes surveillance and unmarked cars to invigilate and end this type of crime.  The citizens I represent want an urgent and total end to the re-emergence of joyriding as a crime and the associated mayhem and anti-social behaviour which accompanies it.  They want peace and security in our district.</p></speech>

The Government has committed to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 to provide the Commissioner with the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country.  This, of course, includes the greater Dublin metropolitan area.  Specific responses have been put in place by the Garda to tackle antisocial behaviour in the area to which the Deputy refers and I understand that, as a result, this past Hallowe'en was one of the quietest in recent years.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na signalled its commitment to increasing the overall strength of the roads policing unit by 10% prior to the end of this year, and the acting Garda Commissioner recently announced that a further 10% increase is planned during the course of 2018.  It is proposed to continue to increase the overall strength of the roads policing unit each subsequent year until full operational strength is restored.  Along with the greater number of recruits, I should also mention the increased funding for the Garda fleet of marked and unmarked cars, many of which are evident in the Deputy's area.</p> <p> The joint policing committees are working well.  I am always anxious to hear from local stakeholders and from the meetings on how best we can maximise the work of local stakeholders and public representatives working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in communities.  Road safety is a shared responsibility for all road users, not just An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the RSA and other State bodies.  I urge anybody affected by, or with information about, these types of anti-social behaviour to contact his or her local Garda station.  The Garda confidential telephone line is 1800-666-111.  It is a monitored free telephone line that allows members of the public to contact the Garda with information of a confidential nature.  People can also contact Crimestoppers at 1800-25-00-25.</p> <p> With regard to Garda resources, we are on target to have 13,500 garda&iacute; by the end of this year and a total of 21,000 by 2021.  I am keen to accelerate the process of civilianisation in order that garda&iacute; can go out on the streets to do the work they are trained to do.  There was also a reference to CCTV.  There is grant aid available to local community groups.  I will be happy to speak to the Deputy on these issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300038#QQ00300"><p>I wish to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, in light of ongoing concern about his Department's approach, what his Department is actively doing to bring Ireland into line with EU law by ensuring that limited companies can access our courts if they cannot afford to engage the often disproportionately expensive solicitors and barristers by whom our courts insist they must be represented.  The previous Minister said in reply to parliamentary questions in 2016 that she was:</p><blockquote>aware of case C-258/13 regarding Article 47 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights ... While there are no plans at present to introduce legal aid for the type of commercial enterprise referred to, the situation is kept under review in my Department.</blockquote><p>Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, on the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, states:</p><blockquote>Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in this Article.  Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law.  Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised, defended and represented.  Legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.</blockquote><p>In essence, this is being denied to small businesses in Ireland due to the rules that they must engage expensive legal representation in order to get redress before the Irish courts.  As a businessman, on several occasions I have been in need of legal redress for relatively small amounts, but the certainty of the expensive legal cost involved ensured that I could not pursue the matter.  Businesses in Ireland have enough stress without the added frustration of knowing that the justice system, which is paid for through our taxes, is denied to them.</p><p>With regard to intellectual property, there has been a major problem with protections for people with rights in this area.  This has been raised on many occasions in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Holders of intellectual property rights are in many instances individual people who need their rights defended without incurring massive legal fees.  They can do this in other EU countries but not in Ireland.  This has been known by the Government for some years now and many Deputies on all sides of the D&aacute;il, including the current Taoiseach, have tried to secure action on it, but it appears to have been lost in translation in the Department of Justice and Equality.  It appears that the Government knows it is breaking EU law but is doing little about it.  It also appears that the European Commission has been led to believe that the problem does not exist in Ireland.</p><p>Will the Minister tell the House what his Department or the Government has told the EU, either directly or indirectly, on this matter?</p></speech>

At its root is the question of the impact of legal costs on small and medium enterprises in terms of their access to the courts and other means of legal redress.  As such, the Deputy will appreciate that it is an issue which straddles both the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in policy terms.  That said, the Deputy will appreciate the priority that must be given to our more vulnerable citizens in the allocation of finite Exchequer funding in support of the provision of civil legal aid.</p>  <p>  It is important to note the key structural and transparency reforms that are being made to the legal costs regime under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which will also be of key benefit to business and small and medium sized enterprises.  For example, as well as obliging legal practitioners to provide better costs information, the Act allows employed or corporate lawyers to act in proceedings on behalf of their employers and for direct access to barristers on non-contentious business.  Another important development is the Mediation Act 2017, which will come into operation fully on 1 January 2018.  The Act, which deals with disputes of a civil nature, will speed up the resolution of disputes, reduce legal costs associated with such disputes and reduce or avoid the stress involved in adversarial court proceedings.</p>  <p>  In case C-258/13 cited by the Deputy, the Court of Justice of the European Union determined in its order of 28 November 2013 that it "clearly had no jurisdiction to rule on the question referred to it" including as it would have related to the interpretation of Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>  <p>  Against a background of ever increasing demand for civil legal aid, great care was taken to maintain the Legal Aid Board budget during the recession.  It has seen a budget allocation increase of 28% over the 2011 to 2017 period, with an increase of over 10% during the period 2016 to 2017.  The board received an additional &euro;1.25 million in the budget this year, bringing the budget to a total of &euro;38.9 million.  This has built on those other budgetary increases made in recent years - over &euro;8 million since 2011 - to continue to reduce waiting lists and to consolidate services across a number of areas.  This includes the Abhaile scheme for persons in mortgage arrears.  It also includes provision for pay increases in 2018.</p>  <p>  At present, the Legal Aid Board, which was established under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, provides civil legal aid and advice to persons of limited means who cannot afford to pay a solicitor privately.  Section 5(1) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 states that the principal function of the Legal Aid Board is to provide legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons, who satisfy the requirements of the Act.  The board has always interpreted the word "persons" to mean natural persons only and not to include legal persons, that is, companies.  Section 29(1) of the Act requires that a person satisfy certain financial eligibility criteria set out in regulations.  The financial eligibility criteria set out in the civil legal aid regulations 1996-2013 clearly contemplate a natural person's income and resources being assessed.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present in the Department of Justice and Equality to introduce a scheme of legal aid for commercial enterprises.  However, the Department is in regular contact with officials in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on cross-departmental matters and the situation in regard to legal aid of the nature referred to will be kept under review.  I am not in a position to make any firm commitments to the Deputy having regard to constraints on my budget.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that a sector of Irish society, the small and medium sized enterprises that play a huge role in that society, is left without any support.  To put it in perspective, we are talking about amounts in excess of &euro;2,000.  If the amount is above &euro;2,000 we must engage the legal professions.  It is equally disappointing that even the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, last September stated that there was little point in having a good court system if a great many people found it difficult or even impossible to access it for practical reasons.</p><p>He said it was increasingly becoming the case that many types of litigation are moving beyond the resources of many.  The Taoiseach said it seven years ago when he asked the very same question, yet we are back here seven years later and there is still no movement regarding this aspect of legal aid or indeed tackling the small claims court and looking at increasing the claims amount there.  I understood that this requires just a statutory instrument, which would insert language into the small claims court legislation allowing these claims to go through an easier court system, one that does not require as many complicated forms as barristers or solicitors.  Intellectual property should be considered as a separate entity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300039#RR00200"><p>While I appreciate that Deputy Casey would support the provision of civil legal aid to small businesses and enterprises, it is important that we do not lose sight of the enhanced and much more transparent legal cost regime that is being introduced at the moment under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  This will impose greater transparency obligations on barristers and solicitors in the charging of legal fees to private and commercial clients and includes discussing the legal costs implications of any new developments in a case with a client before proceeding any further.  The Act allows employed or corporate lawyers to act in proceedings on behalf of their employers and for direct access to barristers on non-contentious business.  It also allows barristers sharing a premises to advertise themselves.  This had all been prevented under existing codes.  Under the Act, it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees at a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business.  Moreover, it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees at a specified percentage or proportion of those pertaining to senior counsel.  In addition, there will be a new office of the legal costs adjudicator, which will replace the existing Office of the Taxing Master and maintain a publicly accessible register of determinations.  It will be supported in its decisions by a set of legal cost principles contained in Schedule 1 to the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Casey may appreciate, a review of the administration of civil justice in Ireland has recently commenced under the chairmanship of the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.  Among other things, this review will consider such areas as access to justice, reducing the costs of litigation, ensuring timely hearings and the removal of obsolete, unnecessary or indeed over-complex rules of practice and procedure.</p>  <p>  On the matter of extending the scope of civil legal aid to corporate entities, I again point to the enormous demand for such legal aid, including in respect of sensitive litigation in areas such as family law.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, priority continues to be given to our more vulnerable citizens in the allocation of finite Exchequer funding in support of the provision of such legal aid.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300039#RR00400"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I propose to share my time with Deputies Marc MacSharry, Shane Cassells and Jack Chambers.  I will set out the purpose and context of the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017, go through the sections and deal with the main objectives of same.  We are aware that we live in an age when online platforms are increasingly influential in political debates and in shaping public opinion.  This is to be welcomed and is a progressive and positive step.  There are opportunities for citizen engagement, further debate and a more accessible medium so it is very much a welcome development.  However, it also poses threats and challenges to our democracy and the integrity of that debate at times.  </p><p>The debate today comes on a day when the UK equivalent of the Standards in Public Office Commission published a report which, among other things, called for greater regulatory powers to control social media platforms and certainly to engage in political debate on those platforms.  The debate comes at a time when we have seen congressional hearings and the Mueller probe in the US find that up to 126 million false Facebook accounts were involved in influencing public opinion during the US presidential election.  It also comes at a time when we believe the Brexit debate was similarly shaped by similar malevolent actors and when we are probably gearing up for another referendum in this jurisdiction possibly in the next six months.  Of course, there will be more referenda and elections to come in the months and years ahead.  </p><p>While the online space has many benefits, authentication and identification are difficult.  There is an opportunity for more advanced actors to game the system in the technological space and to pretend to be other than who they are, operate multiple fake accounts or run sponsored advertising, which is the main interest of this Bill.  Sponsored advertising covers paid advertising intended towards a political purpose and the political purpose is defined in the Bill as seeking to promote the popularity of a candidate for office of a political party or to influence the outcome of a vote before this Oireachtas, industrial dispute or referendum.  It is quite a particular definition.</p><p>In respect of those who seek to place money on the table to influence our electoral outcomes, the Bill proposes that there must be a transparency requirement that they are who they say they are so it essentially brings honesty to the debate.  Similar to lobbying Acts and provisions relating to disclosure and transparency in the electoral Acts and standards in public office legislation, this Bill should be seen as a transparency initiative in the same vein.  I would say that this should be seen as the 21st century equivalent of the electoral Acts.  I did not know that our electoral Acts contained 22 electoral offences until I started researching this Bill.  I doubt many practising politicians have ever fallen foul of them - certainly not intentionally or knowingly - but they remain on the Statute Book.  However, they are really a relic of a bygone age as they date from 1992 and beyond.  Some of them are still relevant, such as the restrictions on print materials and posters, which must carry a ticker tape notification as to who published or sponsored them.  This information is already on posters and election leaflets at election time.</p><p>The proposal is that the same means be provided in respect of online advertising so if someone engages in a sponsored promotion online and puts money online for the purpose of influencing an electoral or political outcome, they would have to state who they are by means of what is called a transparency notice.  A transparency notice is proposed as a notice somewhere in the advertisement or, in the case of social media platforms, within the system where someone can click on a link or button to display a notice that would say who the person is.  It would be an offence under the legislation to give false information to the advertising portal at the time of registration in the same way as it is already an offence to give false returns to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  </p><p>There has been evidence in the past of interference or certainly interest in our election campaigns from external sources.  I am sure many of us remember when UKIP placed 100,000 or possibly one million leaflets through doors during the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign.  I remember the Ancient Order of Hibernians took out a full-page advertisement in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>prior to the vote on the Good Friday Agreement encouraging us all to vote against it.  These are just two examples that spring to mind at a time when it was far more difficult to interfere in the process because someone had to commission one million leaflets and put them through every door or take out an advertisement in the Sunday newspapers.  Now that someone can do the same thing at the click of a switch on Facebook or other online portal, it is all the more important that we update our laws and ensure that they are still relevant for the digital age and that the electoral Acts, which have been there since the early 1990s and before the Internet, broadband and social media era, are updated to reflect the modern tools available to us.  The growth of political advertising in itself is a positive step and this Bill has no provision against it.  Indeed, it encourages it.  It is seen as positive and progressive.  However, it imposes a transparency requirement that those who advertise are who they say they are.  </p><p>Most social media platforms, at which this Bill is particularly aimed, already engage in these developments anyway.  I know that in Canada, Facebook is beta testing the same type of transparency notices I mentioned.  I met representatives from Facebook at its Irish office earlier this week.  Google and Twitter are similarly inclined.  They are all very aware of this problem and have been dealing with it since the US presidential election, the Brexit referendum and the French presidential election and in Germany recently.  There have been issues in Hungary, Norway and Turkey so the social media giants have been battling this phenomenon on multiple electoral platforms and, in many cases, are updating their systems to reflect this and apply this integrity, transparency and robustness to the online debate.</p><p>We have to choose, as a jurisdiction, whether to allow them to dictate the terms and wait and play catch-up or whether we will have some role in shaping the form it will take by expressing our views as a legislature on how electoral law should be managed online.<br/><br/>The content of any materials advertised is completely immaterial.  The legislation is ideologically and content neutral.  What somebody says has no bearing.  How he or she says it and the fact he or she is paying to say it is only relevant if a person does not disclose his or her identity.  It is about bringing honesty to the debate.  There are low-tech solutions for scenarios in which a social media provider is not in the loop, whether it is a local website or a national new website.  It is not that difficult for a graphic designer to put a tick at the bottom of an ad saying who the sponsor or publisher is in the same way posters and leaflets already do.  There is often great ingenuity shown by designers at election time in incorporating it into the ad.  I am sure we can do it again.<br/><br/>The next part of the Bill is on a slightly different matter and addresses concerns that have been raised in the public domain and the media about what appears to be a pet project of the Taoiseach.  That is the strategic communications unit which was announced at the time of his arrival into office.  There was widespread concern and apprehension that &euro;5 million of public money was put aside for what is regarded in many quarters as a very slick and well-oiled public relations machine.  It appears from the newspaper pull-outs and multiple online ads on <i>Merrionstreet.ie</i>about different initiatives that it is a uniquely good news service.  Bad news does not seem to make the cut.  I submitted a parliamentary question on the matter to the Taoiseach last week and, funnily enough, I only received the response about an hour ago which does not explain the criteria for how those initiatives are selected.  The good news engine seems to power on with &euro;5 million in public money.  There is a provision in this Bill that would prohibit the use of public money for political purposes, using the definition of political purposes contained within the Bill.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. Martin Fraser, is reported in the newspapers as having expressed concerns about the strategic communications unit.  He warned officials within it to maintain the independence and political impartiality of the Civil Service and that the core values of neutrality and impartiality were to be respected.  I understand he issued instructions in that regard.  Mr. Fraser has done the State some service.<br/><br/>This Bill will address that issue.  It is an opportunity for the strategic communications unit to set the record straight.  We can put it behind us and welcome and embrace the Bill.  If it is of a non-political nature as is suggested then this provision merely clarifies that and moves ahead with it.  It is also worth noting the McKenna judgments on the European referenda of the 1990s and the McCrystal judgment of 2012.  In 2012, Mr. McCrystal challenged expenditure on the Children's referendum.  It was found that the Government, of which many members are still in place, mis-spent &euro;1.1 million of taxpayers' money advocating a particular side in the referendum.  That was &euro;1.1 million and with &euro;5 million on the table, the risk is much greater.  It would be better to be safe than sorry.  Hopefully nobody is afraid of transparency.<br/><br/>Section 6 of the Bill deals with people with multiple fake accounts and would make it an offence to misinform or mislead the general public malevolently by running 25 or more fake accounts in a deliberate and systematic manner managed by software in such a way as to present as 25 individual accounts and deliberately manipulated by an online user.  The offences, in line with existing Electoral Acts, come within the framework of the garda&iacute; and the DPP.<br/><br/>There have been suggestions that SIPO could play a role.  I am very open to that and I am open to any suggestions that come out of the Second Stage debate.  If the Bill progresses, which I hope it does, because there is support in the Chamber, issues can be thrashed out on Committee Stage.  I have never seen a Bill go through without multiple amendments.<br/><br/>I will yield to my colleague, Deputy Marc MacSharry.</p></speech>

It is very useful.  The Government should accept it and use pre-legislative scrutiny and Committee Stage to improve it if it feels there are anomalies in the Bill.  Deputy Lawless has outlined the many positives in the Bill.</p>  <p>  I will focus on the strategic spin unit.  Given the brilliance of John Concannon, in the same way that buildings throughout the world are lit up with green, will we now have buildings throughout Ireland lit up in blue in honour of Leo the Vain?  At the Committee of Public Accounts last week, I had the opportunity to question the Secretary General about a number of issues, one of which was the fantastic ad for invalidity pension.  It is very informative, just like the ones that were around for years from the Road Safety Authority, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality and so on, except at the end of this ad there is a lovely footer saying it is a Government of Ireland initiative.  Clearly somebody somewhere is trying to take the people of Ireland for fools.  This is a cheap abuse of public funds to create a false complexion of political, Fine Gael, Leo Varadkar ownership and creation of the people's entitlements.  It is wrong and dishonest and it impairs the integrity of the Government.  I am very surprised the Minister, as an Independent member of Government, stood over a &euro;5 million wastage.  What would &euro;5 million have done for the A&amp;E in Roscommon hospital, for example?  How many home care packages could it have given to the people of Roscommon and east Galway?  How many more blue light ambulance cover hours could we have in the Minister's county?  This is about the "me, me, me" approach.  It is the "Enough about me; what do you think of me?" approach of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is now wasting &euro;5 million in public funds to make himself look better.  He is tweeting and recording from the Government jet and from the office every morning.  My colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, submitted a parliamentary question asking who is paying for the Facebook boosts on the little messages coming out of the office on Merrion Street.  All of a sudden they stopped for a while.  Perhaps the way the account is funded has changed.  This &euro;5 million is being used to create dishonestly a complexion of political ownership of citizens' entitlements.  It is Mugabe-esque; one could choose another name - Chavez, Pinochet or Goebbels - but that is what it amounts to.  It is the worst possible kind of propaganda.  As an independent and very honourable member of the Government, I expected better of the Minister and thought he would hold this man to account for the abuse of public funds in this way.</p></speech>

Back in 1996 when I commenced my degree in journalism, as part of the photojournalism module we had to learn how to develop our own pictures in a darkroom.  Within a short time of passing the exam, digital cameras had become the norm, darkrooms were no more, photo film companies were going out of business and I was left with a redundant skill.  Within another short period of time, online platforms were gaining a foothold when it came to the presentation of news.  Following that came the advent of social media with Facebook and Twitter.  I mention all of these things because the amazing technological changes that happened in a very short window of time changed forever the traditional print media structures that had existed for centuries.  It also changed how news was presented and it eroded the foothold of print media.  The standards in reporting were also eroded because instead of journalists who had been trained in college or in the field reporting, everyone walking down the street saw themselves as a journalist.</p>  <p>  The lightning pace of change has also taken its toll on traditional television stations.  I have discussed already with the Minister how people choose different platforms to get information and entertainment.  Despite the huge differences between traditional print media, traditional TV platforms and social media, the one common denominator is advertising.  The financial survival of all media, whether print, TV or social media, depends on advertising.  If they cannot pay the bills, they do not have a viable media organ.  In that respect, social media is king.  The need for transparency and authenticity is essential.  The political world is not exempt from the impact this is having.</p>  <p>  We have two key concerns.  First, as Deputy MacSharry has said, is that the Government is using this highly influential platform to pedal spin it is passing off as information, brought to the public by An Taoiseach on planes, trains and automobiles, the sequel.  Second is the issue of the manipulation of this platform by bots that could distort political facts.  We have had examples from the US presidential election where one Russian company used 470 fake accounts to buy approximately $100,000-worth of political advertising, which were styled to look like the work of American activists.  In Ireland, we had an attack on our own presidential election through fake tweets, which distorted a campaign.  As Deputy Lawless said, people are very conscious of how the same thing could happen again in upcoming campaigns on very hot political issues.</p><p>The Bill, on which I commend Deputy Lawless, has very strict areas in terms of the transparency around paid political advertising and the use of bots.  I would like to see further areas tackled later, such as the protection of traditional forms of media.  One might ask what it matters if the other strands die.  Industries evolve and things change.  So long as we are getting what we are getting, who really cares about the platform on which it is presented?  I care.  I care about traditional print media, be it national or local media, such as the <i>Meath Chronicle</i>or the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>group where I worked for a decade.  If all we are getting is Donald Trump-like spin in the form of Government spin on the one hand and plethora of looney spouting garbage on the other hand, we will not live in a very media-friendly world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300041#TT00200"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Lawless, for his work in publishing the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill.  As Deputy Cassells mentioned, this has an important international context.  US and Russian media bots with fake accounts sought to influence, manipulate and dent the democratic process.  In the Irish context we are seeing the democratic process itself try to dent reality and news.  We saw similar fraudulent online accounts with Brexit.  This tsunami and splurge of online influencing seeks to undermine democracies.  We are calling for accountability and transparency in that.</p>  <p>  It is important that we modernise and progress what is fundamental in a 21st century democracy.  The Bill focuses on ensuring transparency over the source of political advertising.  If the Electoral Act 1992 requires transparency on posters, why can it not be brought online and why can the Government not support this important Bill?</p>  <p>  The source of information and political advertising were traditionally always clear and transparent and codified in law.  The Bill seeks to upgrade that to an online context which will only continue to grow.  It is welcome that Government and political parties advertise online: no one has a difficulty with that.  However, it is important that we see the source of the information so we know the motivational context in which that information is displayed.  People need to assess the source of that information so they can assess its reliability, its background and its context.  If the US people knew that Russian bots were funding and trying to undermine their democratic process, they would have had a different view of the information itself.</p>  <p>  The strategic communications unit has been mentioned.  It is interesting that one of the first things the Taoiseach sought to do was not to establish a strategic healthcare unit, a strategic education unit or a strategic housing unit; it was to establish a strategic communications unit.  He said, "Communication to our citizens is an essential public service".  However, it seems the programming and the attempt to cocoon and silo communications to the people through this communications unit is trying to undermine other core public services that he should be prioritising ahead of this spin unit.</p>  <p>  The Government is using a legislative vacuum to normalise poor policy outcomes in key areas to try to fool the people.  It also represents and reflects a worrying politicisation of the Civil Service when we have a political unit at the core of the Department of the Taoiseach, operating to the benefit of the Taoiseach and what he wants to spin.  It is a strategic propaganda unit, a strategic political unit, a strategic diversionary unit and a strategic distraction unit that puts socks over substance.  It is a shame on the Office of Taoiseach that he is promoting this unit ahead of other policy outcomes that should be at the core of his office.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill which should be supported by all sides in this House in order that we can see transparency in political advertising and not the diversionary tactics we are seeing from the Office of the Taoiseach today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300041#TT00300"><p>Attempts to thwart democracy are as old as democracy itself.  There is a long and less than distinguished history of state and non-state actors alike engaging in such activities.  Moreover, many states, including Ireland, have adopted a series of measures to reduce the risk of this occurring, including rules on the transparency of media ownership and the use of funds from international sources for political activity.</p>  <p>  As everyone in the House will be aware, there are significant indications that various recent elections around the world have seen concerted attempts to manipulate public opinion by exploiting online media, including carefully targeted online advertising and the use of social media to manipulate the views of small but significant components of the electorate.  This is a very serious issue.  It appears that entities are exploiting the legal protections we have regarding freedom of speech, online as well as offline, to turn social media and online advertising into an antidemocratic tool.</p>  <p>  These technologies and services are rightly heralded as being profoundly useful for democracy.  They allow discourse and debate on political issues to be opened up to everyone, no matter where they live.  However, it seems clear that they also allow actors to target and manipulate public opinion in previously unheard of ways.  Moreover, this activity is particularly invidious because available countermeasures are so few and so difficult for democracies to grasp.  These techniques work precisely because democracies allow for and facilitate freedom of speech.  Democracies do not censor media or intimidate journalists.  Democracies do not control access to the Internet or seek to control political speech on online platforms.  Those who seek to manipulate elections in Europe and America know this and see it as a weakness they might exploit.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Lawless has outlined, there is a significant issue here, one that we as a Parliament and as a democracy cannot ignore.  Action is being taken in this area, but more can be done.  I thank Deputy Lawless for facilitating this debate.  While I recognise the Bill seeks to raise important issues in respect of the proper functioning of our democracy and of the security of the State, I am afraid that I cannot support it as it stands.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to engage in extremely complex issues in a very broad and general way.  While it has a number of practical and factual issues and a series of inherent difficulties in terms of implementation-related issues perhaps the most serious issue with the Bill is the unintended consequences it would have for the democratic process itself.</p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge that the thrust of the Bill is aimed at reducing the risk of external actors seeking to create false political campaigns.  However, it seeks to legislate for very specific issues in an extremely broad manner and in a way that would likely give rise to a number of unintended consequences that would make the situation worse rather than better.</p>  <p>  First, the definition of a "political end' is so broad that the Bill essentially prohibits the spending of public money of any kind on advertising online any matter dealt with by the State or funded by the State in any way, for example, the Bill as it stands could prohibit a public meeting organised by a local authority on the proposed closure of a landfill.  Equally, because the Bill makes no provision for the enforcement of the measures contained in it, it essentially places the responsibility for making the decision on what is or is not political advertising in the hands of online advertisers and social media companies.</p>  <p>  In both the case of the prohibition of the use of public funds in section 3 and the proposed transparency notice system in section 5, it means that private operators based outside the State would be required to make decisions fundamental to the functioning of democracy as to who is or is not allowed advertise.  In that context, it is entirely possible that reputable companies would chose not to carry political advertising.</p>  <p>  Perversely, parties based outside the State are not bound by this measure at all, meaning that the Bill summarily fails to deliver on its stated purpose of providing greater transparency in online advertising and may even make the situation worse because of its effect in suppressing legitimate advertising by the State or anyone in receipt of State funding.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides the Minister, currently me, with significant powers regarding the standards to be set.  These could be implemented without recourse to anyone else with the simple stroke of a pen on the cusp of an election.  That is a significant power to place in the hands of any one individual.</p>  <p>  The legislation is weak in ignoring the rightful role that should be played by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p><p>Having read the Bill, I, as an Independent Member, believe that it gives significant powers to a political party's headquarters over individual candidates and also over Independent candidates.  Having experience of being within and outside political parties, I would have concerns about that.  Perhaps most critically, the Bill could have the effect of placing unintended prohibitions on political advertising in a number of ways, including by potentially banning the advertising of Deputies' clinics, both online and offline, if the paper is published in electronic form.  Identifying the owner of a social media account is not an easy or straightforward task.  In many cases, both the platform and the individual will be outside the State and beyond the reach of this Bill.  In addition, the majority of online advertising is programmatic and placed by third-party online advertising sales houses rather than the online platforms themselves.</p> <p> At the very heart of this discussion is the set of principles that are central to the way we deal with both media and the emerging challenges associated with the Internet.  As Minister, I have stated repeatedly that Ireland will continuously promote an open, global, free, peaceful and secure cyberspace where fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the right to freedom of expression, access to information, data protection and privacy and security, as well as the EU core values and principles, are fully applied and respected both within the EU and globally.  Once we start to tamper with online free speech or try to police who does or does not have the right to use social media, we run the risk of becoming more like those who would abuse the system in the first instance.</p> <p> Deputy Lawless has identified a very serious issue but I am concerned that this draft legislation will create more problems than it solves.  I respectfully suggest that the best way of dealing with this would be to draw together a group of experts to examine the issues, including us, as professional politicians, electoral law specialists and people from within the relevant Departments.  The best entity to structure this group is the Committee on Procedure, which is headed by the Ceann Comhairle.</p></speech>

Leaving aside the rules in place regarding political funding from abroad, ensuring that we have properly funded and independent public service broadcaster is a critical backstop to democracy, as is our system to ensure media plurality in the context of mergers.  Ensuring that our education system continues to teach media literacy, which is the case even in the civil, social and political education, CSPE, curriculum at junior certificate level, is a critical aspect as well.</p>  <p>  On the specific issue of social media, I am assured that social media companies are paying increased attention to multiple and fake profiles on sites and that they are taking them down on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  There are new and evolving challenges in terms of the abuse of targeted online media.  I agree entirely that the State may need to take action in this area in the future.  I have a general problem in principle with using 18th century tools to police online media because the online environment is changing rapidly.  By the time we bring legislation through the Houses and have it enacted, it is out of date.  We have seen that with legislation that has been introduced regarding protection of vulnerable adults and children in particular.  We need to examine new, innovative legislative tools to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  I agree with the thrust of the Bill but the vehicle Deputy Lawless is proposing does not meet the necessary requirements.  I agree that we need to deal with this issue and, through the Ceann Comhairle's office, we should pull all the players together in order to do so.  We should proactively deal with it and bring forward a new structure that deals with the ongoing challenges and that can be adopted and changed as the people who want to thwart democracy adopt and change procedures as well.  For that reason, sadly, I cannot support the Bill but I believe the principle needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300042#UU00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Simply put, the Bill puts forward a number of important provisions, particularly the one that political advertisements would indicate who paid for them.  The intent and basic principle of the Bill in regard to transparency is a welcome step forward.  However, the scope is beyond the political party, the politician and the political process and if the Bill is to progress, it will need to be heavily amended.</p>  <p>  The question arises as to whether the transparency notice that would be legally required under the Bill will have any power.  What power will it have?  What about the penalty or obligation on the social media platform itself?  How would it deal with accounts outside the State?  I read the Bill very carefully in order to ensure that I understood what is involved but some of the provisions are very broad.  In terms of the transparency notice, who will have the power to say "Yes" or "No" to provide this notice and, ultimately, the power to prevent online political advertising?  That is a strong power to give to anybody and that aspect will need to be clarified.  On my reading of the Bill, the Minister, or his or her appointee, will have a strong power and we could possibly have censorship.  I am not saying that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, might have inclinations to censor anybody but I refer to people who have sat in his seat.  When people such as Conor Cruise O'Brien - "The Cruiser" - and some individuals from this side of the House were seated over there, they had strong inclinations to censor various organisations on different grounds.  I am concerned about the intent and scope of the Bill in this regard.</p>  <p>  On the provisions of the legislation, there is merit in the provision in section 6 relating to the offence of using a bot and multiple accounts.  The word "bot" is new to the English language.  The Bill would create a new offence of operating a bot for political purposes, defining a bot as a user with 25 or more individual accounts or profiles online, operated by a single user but masquerading as a range of individuals with separate accounts.</p>  <p>  We have to examine the overall scope and intent of the Bill, as drafted, and the potential broad application of its provisions.  We have to examine who and what would fall within the remit of Bill.  The definition states "directed towards a political end" but the application of that wording is very wide.  For example, it encompasses a matter of political interest or a matter that is intended to go before the Oireachtas, the Assembly in the North when, please God, it is up and running soon, the EU Parliament or even a local authority.  That could be a county or town council.  What constitutes a &ldquo;matter of political interest&rdquo;?  How would that be treated before the courts as the Bill is currently drafted?  How many matters in society are of political interest?</p>  <p>  I often ask people who say they are not politically minded if they are worried whether there is a footpath outside the door or water coming out of the tap.  If they are, they need to be interested in politics.  People make political decisions to have water coming out of taps, provide footpaths, street lighting, tar on the road and hospitals.  Very few things in society are not based on political decisions.</p>  <p>  The Bill also indicates that a "political end" would include issues relating to trade unions and disputes in the workplace.  That is going into dangerous territory in terms of industrial disputes.  We question the placing of that in the Bill.  Section 3(2) states, "Online political advertising shall not be paid for from monies ... voted by the Oireachtas".  What does that take in and how far would we go with it?  Where is the policy behind the Bill directed?  Is it directed at the Government's communications unit, which was referred to earlier?  I call that unit the "Ministry of Truth" of the Fine Gael Party.  I do not see the Independents figuring prominently in the advertising campaign overseen by the unit.  In fact, I have not seen an Independent feature in it yet.  The Minister has responsibility for communications but I have not seen him appear in any of those advertisements.  Perhaps his hour will come.  The Government's communications strategy, paid for out of public funds, is completely inappropriate and the nature of the establishment of this unit is leading to the politicisation of the Civil Service and a great deal of cynicism.</p><p>Of course Governments have to give out information, but we must be very careful about how this is done.  The &euro;5 million unit is paid for by the taxpayer essentially to promote a single party.  This might reveal something about Fine Gael in terms of its past and the strain of totalitarianism in it.<br/><br/>To put this sum of money into perspective, the Government put only &euro;7 million into the renewable heat scheme to combat climate change.  We welcome any funding for that, but we would like to see more funding for it.  The &euro;5 million might have been added to the &euro;7 million so that &euro;12 million in total was dedicated to the renewable heat scheme.  If the intent of the Bill is to address issues such as the communications unit we welcome this intent, but why is there such a broad overall interpretation in the Bill?  When we are talking about trade unions and industrial disputes we are really getting into dangerous territory.<br/><br/>To return to the broad scope of the Bill, it mentions promoting candidates for election under the definition of &quot;toward political end&quot;, but it goes beyond politicians and political parties.  If its intent were related to electoral issues and political candidates why is it not placed within Acts specific to that area, such as the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 or under the Electoral Act 1997?  It is not being placed within such legislation where it might be better positioned.  As it is drafted, its direction is beyond the political sphere or the politician and one has to be careful how far one goes with that.<br/><br/>I understand we are in a new area and that the correct wording in legislation can be difficult to find, but it is extremely important that we draft legislation that is specific and that has clear intent.  We are in danger of crossing the threshold of free speech and censorship in this Bill as it is currently drafted when we try to regulate a legitimate method of political expression and give this power to a Minister or the State.  It mentions that people might seek to influence local authorities.  A local residents' group may want to run a small campaign to get a water scheme on a road or for street lighting.  The broad definition currently opens up all sorts of dangers for even localised issues such as those outlined.<br/><br/>What of the media platforms themselves?  The obligation will not be on the online social media platforms as the Bill currently stands and if there is no legal obligation on these platforms I do not see how this legislation would work in practice.  Without specific obligations and penalties on these platforms I am not sure how this Bill will function.  We are talking about paid advertisements.  Should those benefitting financially from the advertisements not face obligations?<br/><br/>In terms of the offences under section 5 of the Bill, a breach of this legislation will potentially carry a fine of up to &euro;10,000 or a five year prison sentence, or both, for using an advertisement without the transparency notice and the consent of the State.  If an individual wanted to use an online advertisement, for example in support of an industrial dispute going on within the State, they could face five years in prison and a &euro;10,000 fine.  These are heavy penalties.  It is a pity some parties in this Chamber were not as forceful when the public wanted them to go after the bankers.<br/><br/>This Bill does not directly address &quot;fake news&quot;.  Some of the media today have created a diversion by saying that this Bill will go after fake news.  It does not in itself give direction in regard to the content of a message, but it does create some accountability around the source of the advertising.  It should be remembered that the idea of fake news was not brought about by social media.  In the 19th century <i>Punch </i>magazine was popular in England and it was fake news.  There were other examples of it in this country.  It has always existed in some form of media content.<br/><br/>Social media is a legitimate platform for political debate and messaging.  It is a good avenue for giving people a voice and allowing political expression.  Some people may go overboard with it sometimes and often TDs and county councillors do not get treated fairly on social media.  However, we have to be careful that the individual is not prevented by an arm of the State from legitimate political expression.  Social media is used by many community groups to put forward a message and aid their campaigns.  Preventing or hampering this in any way should not be put in legislation.  This is referred to under this Bill.<br/><br/>As legislators we are not off the blocks when it comes to the online world and issues such as online bullying.  I believe a large body of law will develop in this area in the very near future.  We need to be careful and not have State involved in censoring online political expression.<br/><br/>The Bill does not appear to deal with people operating outside the State, which is unusual considering the allegations about Russia and America.  There have been cases in the past were people have sought to influence elections or campaigns in this country.  There was an example during the Brexit referendum, when a wraparound which cost &pound;500,000 was supplied courtesy of an organisation called the DUP.  It appeared in the London Underground, much to the bewilderment of commuters in the greater London area.  The issue of people who might seek to influence what happens here from outside the State must be taken into consideration.<br/><br/>If this Bill is to pass to Committee Stage it will require extensive amendments.  We have to test whether it can withstand that and if it is amendable.  The spirit and intention of the Bill is very good and I compliment Deputy Lawless for bringing it forward.  Overall we are in favour of it going to Committee Stage to see whether changes can be made to the Bill to improve it.  Our observations are not intended as an attack on anybody, but are made in a constructive way to highlight some of the dangers and weaknesses we see in the Bill.  I recognise that it is a difficult area to legislate for and I believe it will need extensive work at Committee Stage.  It may be worthwhile having some experts into the committee.  It can then be brought through to Committee Stage and amended.  The debate that has started is good.  It is a matter which must be addressed.  We cannot insulate ourselves from it.  It is an issue that is going to come up over and again.<br/><br/>The Minister for Communication, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, is an Independent Minister.  I would appreciate it if he would speak to other members of the Cabinet about the &euro;5 million that has been allocated to the communications unit.  It could be better spent.  I do not have an issue with a Government communicating what is available and changes to budgets and things of that nature.  However, when the unit is being used to promote individual Ministers belonging to one part of the Government we are straying into dangerous territory.</p></speech>

I was at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  There is obviously huge interest in this Bill.  This Bill has had huge media attention.  I think the reason for that attention is that social media has become a favourite scapegoat of politicians, particularly of politicians from certain parties.  They want to crack down on it and to introduce legislation to curb it.  There is a number of reasons for this.  Sometimes politicians feel that they are getting criticised on social media but it also is because social media has become a resource for ordinary people, for protest movements and for political discourse that is not allowed or permitted within the mainstream media.  The idea that people could be prosecuted for putting out what some might deem to be fake news on social media is - I am sorry - absolutely reprehensible.</p>  <p>  The first argument used is that social media is sucking advertising money away from responsible newspapers.  The second is that social media does not play by the correct rules.  I will give a couple of examples.  The most recent example in Ireland is the campaign against water charges.  For a time all of the mainstream media neglected the huge movement of opposition against water charges which was building up.  It was left to people themselves to learn about it on social media.  For example, the march of 100,000 people which took place in October - the famous first Right2Water march - was completely organised through social media.  It is not accidental that the mainstream media had no interest in promoting the issue.  It is because the mainstream media are owned and controlled by a few billionaires who do not have an interest in austerity being challenged in any way.  Over a number of protests, people turned out in their hundreds of thousands.  O'Connell Street was packed.  However, if one examines the media coverage of the water charges protests, some of the reports would lead one to believe there was only one man and a dog out on them.  It took a huge amount of time for the mainstream media to catch up.</p>  <p>  The other, more recent, protest which has become a very convenient justification for cracking down on social media was the Jobstown protest.  When the court case happened, the mainstream media reported what suited them.  The headlines were about terror and bad language.  They never spoke, however, of the contradictions in the evidence in the case at any time.  Thankfully, when it came to the court cases themselves that evidence was brought out.  </p>  <p>  Facebook pages and Twitter hashtags have been used as organising points to put pressure on politicians and to facilitate broader discussion among people outside the realms of the mainstream media and the D&aacute;il.  Pro-choice activists have organised protest meetings and published information on the campaign on social media.  These sites are absolutely vital hubs for people to organise, to highlight votes, to put pressure on the political parties and to support their demands.  This should be supported and defended.  During the Jobstown trial, social media played a key role in publicising some of the key issues central to the case.  Videos were produced by the campaign, some of which were viewed more than a million times.  The campaign's hashtag was tweeted hundreds of thousands of times.  The clear differences between the opinions of some journalists and politicians and those opinions expressed on social media were stark and showed how out of touch those journalists and politicians are.  </p>  <p>  This Bill would be highly dangerous in respect of industrial disputes.  Fianna F&aacute;il has said that the Bill is not aimed at the right or the left and that it is not ideological, however the provision which seeks to include social media campaigning in respect of industrial disputes shows that it is clearly aimed at those who would challenge the system or take action against employers or powerful corporate interests.  Workers and campaigners should have the right to defend their interests using the media they control, not the millionaire and billionaire-controlled media which they do not.  The Luas strike in 2016 showed what would happen if workers sat around waiting for the mainstream media to report their strikes fairly.  They would be waiting a long time.  Every day, media outlets were calling for them to be sacked and for scab operations to be put in place.  They were claiming the workers were holding the country to ransom.  It is rare that the media find a strike they are not against, in any case.  </p>  <p>  If social media is closed to the vast majority of people for campaigning on political issues it will become a swamp controlled by the establishment parties, product placement and corporate interests.  People have the right to use whatever forum they want to speak out, campaign and organise.  This Bill attempts to curtail free speech.  I notice the Bill only seems to apply to some people on social media.  In the last general election, Fine Gael apparently spent &euro;140,000 on social media advertising.  Clearly when politicians want to use social media, they do.  The Bill should be opposed.</p></speech>

We have heard a lot about the Taoiseach's new strategic communications unit which is, in other words, a spin machine.  He will spend &euro;5 million on this project which will aid Government Ministers and ensure the favourable political fortunes of the Government.  While there has been a long-standing convention that the State does not favour one party over another or over Independent candidates at election time, this new initiative has pushed the boundaries of that convention to a new level with sponsored posts on social media, online advertisements and multiple page pull-out sections in the print media.</p>  <p>  When I hear the figure of &euro;5 million, I think of the patients on the waiting list for cataract surgery.  When I think of those people who have been waiting three or four years, I first wonder where the money the HSE is getting is being spent.  However, if they are short-changed and need more money, this funding would cater for many of those on the waiting list, some of whom we are taking up to Dublin or Belfast next Saturday and Sunday.  It is highly regrettable that 70, 80 and 90 year-old people have to travel this distance to get the procedures so that they can see their families for Christmas.</p>  <p>  This Bill is also about modernising the Electoral Acts and bringing them to date with new technologies.  The existing Electoral Acts set out various rules about conduct during an electoral campaign including rules on materials and posters.  We all know about the rules on posters.  They must be signed and accounted for by the director of elections, whether in the case of parties or independent candidates.  It is only fair that this new system, which is available to everyone, be accountable to the nation and the State.  We should know who is putting up these posts and who is making these representations because Twitter has massive exposure and messages can be seen by many different people in many areas.  It could have a massive effect on an election campaign, especially in its dying days.  It could bestow an unfair advantage, especially if the Government parties of the time are using Exchequer funds to further their own fortunes.</p><p>That would be very regrettable.  We need new legislation to bring the Electoral Act 1992 into the modern era.  There need to be transparency notices on any online ads.  That could be as simple as text in a box or similar but we need to know who is sending what.  It is only fair that people know who is sponsoring or organising whatever is being sent out online and on social media.</p></speech>

It provides for transparency in the disclosure of information in online political advertising and related matters.  The word "transparency" can be interpreted differently and we need to focus on it.  I am happy to make some brief remarks on the Bill.  Anything that encourages a greater level of safeguards and respect online is to be welcomed not solely in respect of the political arena, but all online content and, in particular, in regard to cyberbullying and similar areas.  The Bill does not go far enough in that respect but it is a start, t&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre.  I note that it refers to persons having online accounts under multiple names, which can offer great anonymity.  As Members know, that is a method of hiding one's identity in order to convey messages or political views about which the person does not have the courage to be upfront and open.  It can be very sneaky, deliberate and nasty.</p>  <p>  All Members accept there is significant need for radical reform of how society engages online, in particular in regard to political engagement.  It is not today or yesterday that legislation was needed in that regard.  However, who will enforce the law?  Amnesty International is currently flouting the law in regard to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  I welcome today's statement by SIPO, which has reaffirmed its position.  The chief executive of Amnesty, Mr. Colm O'Gorman, has said Amnesty will not obey the law outlined by SIPO and by which every Member of the House, county councillor in the country and registered voluntary, political or third party organisation must abide.  For Amnesty to baldly state the law is not suitable or satisfactory and it is keeping the &euro;137,000 it got from George Soros is outrageous and an affront to democracy, the laws of the land and, in particular, to the House and Parliament.  That needs to be swiftly dealt with and I hope that the Taoiseach or the Minister, Deputy Naughten, or others will make a statement on the matter.   No Deputy could get away with such behaviour and rightly so.  We must be accountable and there are clear guidelines that state a person or organisation may collect &euro;100 from a donor on the shores of America or elsewhere.  However, Amnesty has received &euro;137,000 and will not pay it back.  That is an outrage.</p>  <p>  The level of anonymity afforded to people online is staggering and can be a very serious threat to personal and State security.  If one wishes to buy political advertising, there is a clear obligation to be honest and upfront about the ends and aims of such purchasing.  It is significant that legislation is needed to remind us of the simple truth.  We get carried away with so much media and spin and so many media consultancies and agencies.  We can get caught in a bubble, and often are, such that we do not know what is going on in the real world and how ordinary people are suffering and trying to fend for themselves from day to day.  We get caught up in tweeting and Facebooking and God knows what kind of spin.</p>  <p>  I, too, am hugely concerned about the &euro;5 million of taxpayers' money sneakily taken to fund the PR machine for St. Leo, the Taoiseach, "hashtag Leo".  He was unable to answer any of the questions asked of him today in the House in spite of all the media reports.  He came back and clarified he was correct that the Labour Party was in Government under the then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, God rest him, when community employment schemes were set up.  He is entitled to the truth and the truth must be there for everyone.  However, that &euro;5 million would have gone a long way to dealing with those with cataracts or waiting for knee or hip operations or the children waiting to be seen in regard to their teeth or eyes and so on.  It would have gone a very long way to dealing with the widows who are discriminated against on a daily basis in the House or, in particular, the women who had to retire from the Civil Service when they got married many years ago and are being discriminated against to the tune of between &euro;30 and &euro;90 in their pensions.  That &euro;5 million would have been a good start in that respect.  We cannot allow such blatant naked discrimination to continue.  I support the Bill, which is badly needed.</p></speech>

Its purpose is to provide for transparency in the disclosure of information in online political advertising and to provide for related matters.  There have been many changes in the House today.  As W.B. Yeats wrote: &quot;All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.&quot;  Many things are currently changing.  Online platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google allow users to pay for adverts which appear in people&rsquo;s newsfeeds.  The posts are marked as sponsored to make it clear they are advertisements.  Such advertising has been heavily relied upon in political campaigns in recent years.  One reason for that is that the potential now exists to target advertising at very specific groups.  Certain firms now specialise in analysing data in order to build up profiles of individual social media users, determine how they may be persuaded to vote and specifically target advertising at them.Such companies were reportedly instrumental in the victory of US President Donald Trump in the 2016 US election and that of the Vote Leave campaign in the Brexit referendum.</p><p>There are serious issues with regard to the transparency surrounding that method of advertising.  For example, a Facebook user can only see an ad if it has been specifically targeted at him or her.  He or she does not know what other ads the advertiser may be running and targeting at other people.  It is therefore possible that one advertiser or campaign may send contradictory messages to different groups of people but that is not open to scrutiny.  In September 2017, Facebook announced that it was taking steps to combat the problem.  Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said: </p><blockquote>Going forward - and perhaps the most important step we&rsquo;re taking - we&rsquo;re going to make political advertising more transparent...  Not only will you have to disclose which page paid for an ad, but we will also make it so you can visit an advertiser&rsquo;s page and see the ads they&rsquo;re currently running to any audience on Facebook.</blockquote><p>It is crucial that we introduce legislation to prevent that happening in Ireland.  As a nation, we fought for too long to gain political autonomy to jeopardise it in this manner.  </p><p>The Bill also updates existing electoral legislation to reflect the increased use of online advertising, the need for which is self-evident.  Through the various electoral acts, the Standards in Public Office Commission, broadcasting guidelines, and the lobbying Acts, Ireland has a strong regulatory framework around our political process.  That is crucial because no democracy can function without transparency and accountability.  Given the increasing importance of online media to political debate, the values that have served us since the establishment of the State urgently need to be applied to online media as they do to traditional media.  Given that it only applies to paid political advertising, the Bill will have no impact on ordinary citizens and social media users, who will remain free to post any type of political content on their personal pages - all Members have experienced that - with or without displaying the source of the content.</p><p>As regards paid political advertising, the Bill does not in any way censor or dictate what counts as permissible political advertising.  Instead, it applies the same principles of transparency required of print and traditional media to political messages circulated online.  In no way does it impinge on free speech.</p><p>Under current legislation, any poster or advertisement for an election candidate must clearly display the publisher and financial backer of the advertisement.</p> <p> The legislation also addresses the proliferation of bots, which are fraudulent social media accounts created to look like many different personal accounts but which are the work of just one person or organisation.  Like many of my colleagues, I have been targeted by these.  These accounts are then used to flood social media platforms with particular political messaging.  Due to the algorithms used on social media, this can lend considerable legitimacy and prominence to content that is in fact fabricated by one malicious actor.</p> <p> I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Byrne.</p></speech>

Why has it gained worldwide attention?  The reason is that two recent polling events in the western hemisphere were influenced and continue to be influenced by bots.  I refer to the American presidential election, including ongoing American political affairs, and the Brexit referendum.  One of the most influential Twitter accounts discussing and describing Brexit was an anonymous one purportedly based in the south of England but only operating during Moscow working hours.  That is the reality we face.  As Deputy Butler said, everything is changed.  The whole system of passing information to people and receiving it has collapsed from the old order into a completely new order.  This legislation is an honest, serious and necessary attempt to catch up very quickly.  We need to catch up with who exactly is pumping money into our political system.  It is very important that Deputy Lawless's provisions regarding a transparency notice are introduced as soon as possible.  We need to know who is spending money.  We will have a referendum next year and people from all over the world on both sides of that potential debate are seeking to pump money into this country.  As things stand, they will be able to stay outside our jurisdiction and target Facebook or Twitter ads here.  That is wrong and unconscionable.  They should stay the heck out of this country and let the Irish people decide these issues for themselves.  I am talking about both sides of the debate that is coming up.  This is a matter for the Irish people.</p>  <p>  This has already happened in the Brexit referendum and the American presidential election.  The result has been utter instability in the traditional democratic world order.  Facebook and Twitter ads have turned out to be a threat to democracy but they can be an opportunity and something good.  It is incumbent on Facebook and Twitter not only to examine this kind of legislation and the regulations that might come before them, but also to ensure that political advertising is treated utterly differently.  It is incumbent on them to recognise that democracy is worth fighting for and holding on to and that it is worth ensuring that no nefarious influences are at play in our democracy.  They should examine not only potential laws coming down the tracks, but also how they themselves do things.  They have acknowledged the Russian bots that interfered in the American presidential election.  One famous Facebook page, The Heart of Texas, a Texas secessionist page, organised protests around Texas.  It is closed down now because it was discovered to be a foreign-influenced Facebook page.  There were organisations on the liberal side organising protests in New York from anonymous Facebook accounts from outside America.  This is the way things have gone and we must catch up.</p>  <p>  Deputy Lawless's Bill seeks to target bots, which I have dealt with in what I have already said, but also the strategic communications unit, which is an absolute disgrace.  Let us be clear that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is not getting a slice of the advertising pie because he is not in Fine Gael.  The broad shoulders of Fine Gael have elbowed into all these paid ads.  The latest one, promoting Deputy Leo Varadkar and Deputy Paschal Donohoe in his own constituency, had 400,000 viewers and was paid for entirely by all the taxpayers of Ireland.  This is wrong and should be illegal.  I have already put it to my party that we should introduce legislation to ban any Oireachtas Member from appearing in paid advertising by Government Departments unless it is required by law, such as in the case of a signature on an official order.  I refer primarily to Ministers because they are the only ones to have done this so far.  It is utterly wrong and disgraceful that the &euro;5 million from the strategic communications unit, SCU, is being turned into paid Facebook ads for Fine Gael and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, should be clear that they are only for Fine Gael Members.  While Dublin traffic was at a standstill on Monday morning because of the Luas works, a Facebook video promoting Deputies Leo Varadkar and Paschal Donohoe and the Luas was on air for well over 24 hours.</p></speech>

It was a professionally produced video made between Saturday and Sunday morning and put up on Facebook, with massive money pumped into it to ensure as many people in Ireland saw it and the good news story it showed.  This happened in the space of a few hours between Saturday and Sunday and involved a massive amount of taxpayers' money.  The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, is not getting a slice of the pie either.  It is his senior ministerial colleagues from Fine Gael, and not including the Minister, Deputy Naughten, who are using and abusing taxpayers' money to promote themselves on Facebook videos to give a good impression.  It is wrong, it should be illegal and, quite frankly, I think it is illegal.  It is certainly unethical that taxpayers' money is used in this way.  Deputy Lawless's Bill goes some way towards dealing with this and I think it should go further.  The Government needs to accept the Bill and get to grips with the ways in which the world is changing.  I urge the Government to stop spending taxpayers' money to promote itself.  It is wrong.</p></speech>

There has been significant evidence that third parties, possibly including nation states, have sought to use a number of means to affect the outcomes of elections.  This has been well mooted in recent times.  These means include targeted online advertising and the use of social media to manipulate the views of small but significant components of the electorate.  I note the Private Members' Bill seeks to redress some of these issues both by requiring all online advertising directed towards a political end to carry a transparency notice and by prohibiting the use of bots to create multiple social media accounts.  I have a few concerns in this regard.</p>  <p>  The first concerns the timeline surrounding the Bill.  I think it was on 10 November that there was a press release announcing the Bill, yet it was not published until Wednesday of last week.  It is very important, under the new reforms we have in the Oireachtas, that we scrutinise legislation at draft stage to ensure it does not have any unintended consequences.  It is very important that we have moved on from the guillotine and various other such mechanisms through the Oireachtas.  We now need to be careful to ensure that legislation is subject to proper and appropriate scrutiny from experts.  I have a number of concerns as to what consultation was engaged in prior to the publication of the Bill.  Was formal feedback sought from any social media companies as to how to regulate the proposed provisions and how they might be policed and managed?  Was formal feedback sought from any civil society organisations that could be impacted by the legislation?  Was any formal feedback on the Bill sought from any public representatives from Deputy Lawless's party?  Was there external legal advice on the Bill and, if so, from whom?  It has only been a month, I think, since the Bill was announced and the press release published, as I mentioned, and I cannot see the rush in this regard.  The legislation could have a number of unintended consequences and could be described as legislation by press release.</p>  <p>  I have a major concern about political advertising and the effects it may have on a public representative in his or her own right.  Would the Bill make it illegal to advertise a Deputy's clinics online?  There is a huge subjective element to the Bill regarding the definition of "political end", which needs to be fleshed out.  Section 6 of the Bill proposes to create an offence of using a bot, in this case a piece of software, as previous speakers have illustrated well, used to create multiple accounts on social media platforms.  While there are a number of political and factual issues with the definitions relating to this section alone, particularly pertinent are the difficulties associated with implementing the section.  Identifying the owners of some social media accounts is often very difficult and in many cases both the platform and the individual will be outside of the State.  We therefore need much more scrutiny, the best possible scrutiny, of the mechanics and logistics of how the legislation would work.  I am concerned about the unintended consequences.  I note concerns that have been raised about political advertising, but legislation should not be rushed and the Bill leaves one totally in the dark as to what consultation has taken place on this drafted legislation, which is a huge concern.</p><p>I do not agree that this is an emergency situation requiring emergency action.  We should afford interested stakeholders time to consider the Bill in detail and identify any flaws it may contain.  Effective scrutiny is a critical part of the process of producing good legislation in this House.</p> <p> On the question of nation states interfering in elections, we must ensure social media outlets are precluded from hosting that type of activity.  Several Members have brought forward proposals recently seeking to make it a criminal offence to engage in discussion about criminal trials on Facebook and other platforms.  We must examine all of these issues carefully and ensure that any legislation we enact does not have unintended negative consequences for the public or for us as politicians in the carrying out of our duties.</p></speech>

However, I join my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, in recommending that these proposals be opposed on the basis that they are likely to have a number of serious unintended consequences.  The issues we are discussing this evening are undoubtedly of grave concern.  The idea that nation states are engaging in active subterfuge by orchestrating false political campaigns is a serious and ongoing threat to our democracy.  While I acknowledge the effort in this Bill to address these concerns, there is an incoherence of approach in its provisions.  In particular, there are insurmountable challenges in how the Bill deals with issues of implementation.</p><p>Accepting these proposals would pose a very real threat to the open and free political discourse that is so central to the Irish political process.  On the European stage as well as at home, Ireland has consistently promoted an open, peaceful, global, free and secure cyberspace, where fundamental rights and freedoms such as the right to freedom of expression, access to information, privacy and security on the Internet, and data protection, are fully applied and respected.  The requirement to determine and define what constitutes a &quot;political end&quot; is an extremely difficult one.  The Bill leaves the question of what is or is not political to the online platform selling the advertising and makes no provision for any governance mechanism in this regard.  The obligation to ensure a transparency notice is displayed on any online platform is placed clearly on the shoulders of that platform, as per subsection 3(1) of the Bill.  This would be extremely difficult to implement in practice given that many online platforms are based outside the State and identifying the owner of an account on social media is not easily done.  In addition, the majority of online advertising is placed by third parties rather than the online platforms themselves, the latter being merely a stage for others to disseminate advertising information.  This is the mere conduit principle referred to by the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  Consequently, political advertisements produced in other jurisdictions would not fall under the provisions of the Bill.</p><p>Reference was made to the activities of bots on online platforms, which has recently come to public attention as a serious problem.  Section 6 of the Bill seeks to address this issue without properly engaging with it.  The idea that we can track down bots and prosecute the persons or organisations behind them ignores the reality that if the person running the false accounts is based outside the State, as most of them are, then they will be beyond the scope of the Bill.</p><p>There were numerous references to the strategic communications unit, SCU, the purpose of which will be to streamline communications between Departments to enhance the delivery of Government campaigns.  It will help us to produce clear, simple and citizen-focused communications, so that it is clear when the Government of Ireland is communicating or delivering a service.  This will lead to more co-ordinated and cost-effective communications that will generate efficiencies and increased value for money.  An internal audit of communications work across government found that more than &euro;170 million is being spent annually on communications by Departments and the agencies under their remit.  It is intended that the SCU will drive savings across all Departments over time through efficiencies generated by cross-departmental collaboration on major campaigns, more efficient use of technology platforms, consolidated media buying, efficient third-party contract management, rationalisation of design projects, streamlining of participation in national events and increased communications capacity within Departments.</p><p>  For 2018, the budget of the Department of the Taoiseach will decrease by 2% compared with 2017.  The SCU's budget of &euro;5 million derives from a reallocation of existing resources within the Department's overall budget for next year.  The vast bulk of this &euro;5 million allocation is being earmarked for major cross-departmental information campaigns.  These campaigns will include an allocation for media buying across all media platforms, both traditional and digital, which will maximise efficiency and value for money.  The unit will carry out its work objectively and without bias and in accordance with the Civil Service code of standards and behaviour, published by the Standards in Public Office Commission, and the Civil Service values as delineated in the Civil Service renewal plan.  All of the staff to be assigned are serving civil servants or public servants.  This is designed to ensure political impartiality and that the unit is developed as a service that will be available to all future Governments regardless of their composition.</p><p>In the context of ongoing concerns about fake news, it is important that the Government should be able to get its message out.  When hundreds of millions of euro are spent on the Luas upgrade, it is right that it be advertised as a Government of Ireland project.  What is the difference between advertising the good works of Government, which come at a cost to taxpayers, and the services available to all Deputies and Senators to advertise themselves, such as the Houses of the Oireachtas printing service, which also are paid for by taxpayers?  If we go too far along that line, we will end up in a position where no taxpayer spending is permitted to fund the important job we do in these Houses.</p></speech>

That is a good feature of Irish politicians.  People who work hard enough can get elected to this House on very modest sums of money by international standards.  We have seen in other countries how people with money can seek to influence social events, social policy and politics.  This legislation is an effort to constrain that type of influence seeking.</p>  <p>  I have not had a chance to go through every line of the Bill to pick out all the flaws.  That is the purpose of Committee Stage.  The purpose of Second Stage, on the other hand, is to decide whether or not the House accepts the principle of a Bill.  I am surprised the Government cannot accept the principle that we must do something to ensure that no outside parties can, in a furtive and secretive manner and because they have huge resources, seek to exert a disproportionate influence on the electorate.  I ask the Government, between now and when the division takes place, to reconsider its position and allow the Bill to progress.  It will be subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny before proceeding to Committee Stage, where any possible unintended consequences may be ironed out.</p>  <p>  It is a disturbing development to see Amnesty International Ireland, an organisation which prides itself on its advocacy of civil rights, metaphorically putting its two fingers up to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I do not care which side of the argument the money was intended to promote; that is not the issue.  I would be saying the same thing if a large amount of United States dollars had gone to the other side of the campaign in question.  It is outrageous that a body which claims to be a human rights organisation should thumb its nose at the laws passed in this House for very good reason.  That action must be condemned in the strongest terms.  Nobody is above the law and it is a job for the Standards in Public Office Commission to pursue the matter.</p><p>A very bad example has been set in not adhering to the law.  If those involved feel the law is unjust, they could work to change it.</p></speech>

The Government will accept that social media, and how it has evolved and how it impacts on us - not just as politicians but also societally - is a matter to which we will have to return to again and again.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked, why not allow the Bill to pass Second Stage and then debate it line by line on Committee Stage?  I take the Minister of State's point and I did not hear any reflection of negativity against the idea in principle.</p><p>I very much welcome the Bill.  In the old days, politicians generally communicated in two ways with their constituents, namely, by telephone or by letter.  Now, there is an avalanche of possibilities available, be it through a Facebook profile page, a Facebook political page or Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn, Instagram, WhatsApp or all the other various means of communicating.  It is a huge amount of engagement and it is right that we look seriously at the issue.  All of us have examples of how it can be abused.  The topic of social media and how it relates to politics is one to which Deputy Lawless is clearly alive.  It is a topic to which we should consistently be alive as a result of its potential to be abused and to abuse in such a hidden and secretive manner.</p><p>The Minister of State touched on my next point, which relates to blurred lines.  It may in part have been a little naive on the part of the Taoiseach - and I do not mean this is a dramatic sense - but I would question the appropriateness of the Twitter handle <i>@campaignforleo</i>for a prime minister.  When we look at the Twitter handles of prime ministers across the globe, including some of the more famous ones, we see that they generally just use their names.  The title <i>@campaignforleo</i>is very much a political one.Deputy Varadkar is now a serious office holder and this is where the blurred lines occur, as referred to by the Minister of State.  Why should the position of Ministers be different to that of Members of the Oireachtas who avail of the facilities here?  Members of the Cabinet are officeholders.  They are not just responsible to their constituencies, they are also responsible to the entire State.  The classic example is the Taoiseach's broadcasting from the Government jet and putting it up on the Fine Gael website.  If that was me, as a Deputy, and given that the taxpayer pays for the Government jet, I would have to state who paid for the facilities to allow me there, who recorded the video and who paid for it?  Was it the Government press office? I would imagine it could not have been the Fine Gael press office given that the Government jet was involved.  These are the blurred lines in respect of which the Government must be much clearer.</p></speech>

I listened intently to the different views expressed and I took note of what was said.  I hope the Bill progresses to Committee Stage at which point we can consider the various issues.</p>  <p>  I shall address the Government response first.  It strikes me that said response is actually symptomatic of the Government's general response to most of the problems facing the State.  The Government acknowledges that there is a problem, it is very concerned about it but it does not want to do anything.  It certainly does not want Fianna F&aacute;il to do anything about it.  In that vein, I do not believe it is a particularly progressive response.  I do, however, take on board the Minister's various concerns.  I do not have time to deal with them all in detail but I believe they can be tackled on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I listened very carefully to Deputy Stanley, who made a number of very considered points.  I thank the Deputy and Sinn F&eacute;in for their support for the Bill.  I look forward to debating the issues raised in respect of definitions, industrial relations and political ends.  Again, these issues can be tidied up on Committee Stage and I would welcome an opportunity to do that.</p>  <p>  The Minister made a point that I did not quite understand.  He spoke of applying an 18th century solution to a modern problem.  I might have missed something in translation but if that were the case, then we could not legislate for online gambling, data protection, information systems, the knowledge box and intellectual property.  I may have missed something in the Minister's point-----</p></speech>

It was great to have a Fine Gael presence here for what is very much a Fine Gael initiative, namely, the strategic communications unit.  I salute the Minister of State and Deputy Burke for having the gumption to actually come into the Chamber to take the medicine on that one and for not leaving an Independent Member to be hung out to dry, which is exactly what the poor Minister was bravely enduring for some time before they arrived.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Burke's questions, the answer is "Yes" in respect of the points he made regarding parliamentary advice, parliamentary party ratification, civic society engagement and social media platforms engagement.  I am aware that the Deputy is no longer in the Chamber to hear this.</p>  <p>  A number of speakers indicated that, at the next stage in the process, we could have a detailed engagement with the various expert groups.  I understand that this is what happens.  My colleague, Deputy Cassells, introduced the Local Government (Establishment of Town Councils Commission) Bill last year.  That Bill passed Second Stage and just this morning a number of interested parties and officials attended a meeting of the joint committee charged with scrutinising it.  This is what we want.  Unfortunately, things do not move quickly in this House.  This is why we stress that there is an urgency about this matter.  The House does not progress Bills very quickly so the idea of suspending the Bill or putting it on hold until some other slightly different or slightly better variation is proposed does not hold water.</p>  <p>  There is agreement in the House.  Most speakers have alluded to the fact that the legislation is needed, that it tackles a real problem and that said problem is growing.  There is an urgency about it.  Referendums are on the way in the new year.  This is an international phenomenon and Ireland should not be left behind.  The obvious thing to do would appear to be to progress the Bill to Committee Stage and thrash out the detail then.  I thank all the speakers for their comments and intentions.  We will push the Bill towards Committee Stage and will propose that as the next step.  I look forward to seeing what happens at that point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300048#AAA00900"><p>I am very pleased to open these statements on Northern Ireland on behalf of the Government and I look forward to the debate.  I know the intention is to have regular quarterly statements on Northern Ireland in the House, a development I very much welcome and support.</p>  <p>  The peace process is at a critical phase on a number of fronts.  It is important that we regularly consider the issues in this House, and the discussions here will continue to inform the Government&rsquo;s engagement on Northern Ireland.  There has already been a lot of discussion regarding Brexit in the past two weeks.  However, the Article 50 negotiations impact very directly on Northern Ireland so I would like to begin with some views on that before turning to the devolved institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and some of the other critical issues relating to the peace process.</p>  <p>  The Government has worked intensively and with absolute determination over the past 18 months to build understanding with our EU partners of the unique challenges Brexit presents for the island of Ireland and for the peace process.  We are now working through the Article 50 negotiations to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement, in all its parts, and the gains and benefits of the peace process are protected.  The Government is very pleased with the unity and solidarity that all of our EU partners have shown with Ireland in the Article 50 negotiations.  I again express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the commitment and professionalism of Michel Barnier and his team in working with Ireland to secure an EU objective of protecting our peace process.  This is a shared objective with the United Kingdom, which is important.</p>  <p>  The joint report achieves the goals we set out to achieve in phase 1.  These include the maintenance of the common travel area, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement, in all its parts - including North-South co-operation - and a guarantee from the UK on avoiding a hard border on the island.  Crucially, this guarantee is now accompanied, for the first time, by a spelling-out on the part of the UK of how a hard border can be avoided.</p><p>The Government believes, as does the European Commission, that these commitments together with those made on the citizens&rsquo; rights and financial settlement issues, now constitute sufficient progress in phase 1 of the negotiations. <br/><br/>I hope and expect that on Friday, the European Council will agree with that assessment and will allow negotiations to move on to the second phase on the future EU-UK relationship and transitional arrangements.  The Irish-specific issues will continue to be worked on in a distinct stream of work in phase 2, in the same way we have seen in phase 1, which will help to ensure that all the commitments set out in the joint report are implemented satisfactorily.<br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s approach to dealing with the challenges of Brexit for the peace process has been and will remain guided solely by our responsibility as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are duty bound and determined to protect the peace that was hard won and the gains of peace and reconciliation that have been built up over the past two decades.<br/><br/> As the Taoiseach and I have made clear in recent days, the Irish Government has no hidden agenda and we recognise fully the concerns expressed by the unionist community of Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach confirmed on Friday that there is no question of us exploiting Brexit for any constitutional reasons.  On the contrary, the principle of consent is at the heart of our thinking and approach.  We also do not want to see a border in the Irish Sea any more than we want to see a border on the island of Ireland.  The Government wants to build bridges not borders, as the Taoiseach has repeatedly said.  We want reconciliation and respect to grow.  Our commitment to that and to upholding and protecting the Good Friday Agreement can be relied on by everyone on this island, nationalist, unionist or neither.<br/><br/> The Government is listening carefully to views and concerns across civil society North and South, including through the all-island civic dialogue on Brexit.  As part of my engagement in Northern Ireland, I will also continue to meet nationalist and unionist communities and all civil society interests, to hear their perspectives on Brexit.  It is a question on which there are real differences of view in Northern Ireland but we cannot allow Brexit to undo any of the progress that has been made in healing the wounds of the Troubles or to hold back the journey to full reconciliation that still has some way to go.  The peace process must be bigger than Brexit and all sides need to work together to make that so.  The Government will always work to that end and to protect our shared interests, North and South and indeed east and west.<br/><br/> The Government is clear that the devolved institutions of the Good Friday Agreement urgently need to operate again.  Only the power-sharing Executive and Assembly can adequately represent the interests of Northern Ireland, not only on Brexit but on many other areas also.  Only the Executive and the Assembly can effectively address the continuing divisions between communities in Northern Ireland and it is only the Executive and the Assembly that can ensure the delivery of effective and accountable public services for people in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/> The Government, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, working with the British Government, has spared no effort in facilitating talks to support the formation of a new Executive since the Assembly election last March.  However, devolved power-sharing government can only operate on the basis of an agreement reached between the two largest parties.  The other parties represented in the Assembly also have a critical role to play and have, indeed, shown great patience to date.  <br/><br/>While it is frustrating that there has not, as yet, been an agreement to form a new Executive, it is important to note that significant progress has been made through the several phases of talks this year.  The issues under discussion go to the heart of divisions in society in Northern Ireland and agreement on them was always going to be challenging.  However, it remains my firm belief that the parties can reach an agreed outcome, which sees the implementation of previous agreements and reflects the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement and power-sharing itself, namely, partnership, equality and mutual respect.  There is a moment now when, with a degree of trust, good faith and political leadership by the parties, the opportunity of, and the right to, devolved government in Northern Ireland can be secured again.  The North-South Ministerial Council must also resume its work to oversee and develop North-South co-operation, including to deal with the challenges raised on an all-island basis by Brexit.<br/><br/> The Government has heard clearly the concerns expressed by both communities at the continuing absence of evident progress on key issues that needs to be urgently addressed.  The Taoiseach and I have noted very carefully the concerns expressed by members of the nationalist community in their letter this week.  The Government has consistently affirmed its unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and its determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  The Taoiseach and I will continue to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to give full effect to that commitment.  <br/><br/>I remain in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and spoke with him at length again this afternoon.  We agreed that all concerned must resume and redouble their efforts to get an agreement on a new Executive.  There is a must-take opportunity for the parties to get devolved government back on track and delivering for people in Northern Ireland.  That will need to happen very early in the new year.  <br/><br/>I also reaffirm to Members the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fully implement the Stormont House Agreement framework to address the legacy issues of the Troubles.  This is one of the fundamental next steps for the peace process.  It is particularly important for victims and survivors, for wider society in Northern Ireland and for pursuing a deeper reconciliation.  At present, the system in Northern Ireland is simply not equipped to deal with the legacy of the past.  The needs and the rights of victims and survivors are not being met.  In recent months, I have met some of those directly affected by this, including the Kingsmill families and the Ballymurphy families, who still have to struggle and campaign after more than four decades to secure truth and justice for their lost loved ones.  I know that there are many such families in Northern Ireland, as well as in the South, who are still waiting for answers and are left in the same unacceptable position. <br/><br/>I am always conscious of the families of those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other atrocities in this jurisdiction.  The Government will continue to pursue the request to the British Government on their behalf, consistent with the unanimous motions adopted by this House.<br/><br/> The Stormont House Agreement provides for a comprehensive framework of institutions and services to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  This framework, including adequately resourced, Article 2-compliant legacy inquests, must now be implemented fully and faithfully.  <br/><br/>There was important progress in the talks at Stormont Castle earlier this year.  The next step will be a public consultation by the British Government on the draft UK legislation and I hope that can proceed very soon.  There should then be a move forward to legislative phases in both jurisdictions, as needed to get the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework established and working in full.  <br/><br/> The Government is advancing the preparation of the necessary legislation in this jurisdiction.  Last month, the Government approved a general scheme for an international crime co-operation Bill 2017, which importantly will, among other things, facilitate the taking of evidence from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by legacy inquests in Northern Ireland.  This is a very important development for the Kingsmill families in particular and the Minister for Justice and Equality is advancing further drafting as a priority.  This draft legislation demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting establishment of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework.  The Government also intends to bring forward legislative proposals to establish in law an independent commission for information retrieval, which is provided for under that agreement and in the 2015 international treaty between Ireland and the United Kingdom. <br/><br/>The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and all the political parties to seek an urgent move forward with legacy issues, by establishing the Stormont House Agreement framework, in order that the legitimate needs of all victims and survivors can be met and in order that we can pursue and deepen the necessary reconciliation process. <br/><br/> In concluding, I wish to state that while there are of course challenges at present for Northern Ireland and the peace process, I believe that with leadership and resolve these can be dealt with and overcome in the time ahead.<br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s responsibility is to do everything it can to get the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement operating effectively, to make sure that we protect the interests of the island of Ireland through the Article 50 negotiations and to see that the next steps for the peace process are achieved, with the continuing confidence of both communities in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The Government will never be found wanting in working to do that and I believe that we can achieve successes in the coming months for the benefit of all of the people of Northern Ireland and across this island.  I thank other parties in the context of the Brexit negotiations and what was achieved last week.  Not only was the solidarity of other countries and Ministers as well as the two institutions in the European Union essential to getting that wording agreed but the solidarity among parties in this House was extremely helpful in doing that.  I hope we can have their continued support as we move into phase 2 of this process.</p> <p> Likewise, I look forward to working with parties in this House in efforts to get the devolved institutions up and running again as soon as we possibly can because the absence of those devolved institutions effectively means the Good Friday Agreement cannot function as it was designed to function and we will be forced to consider triggering other structures on an east-west basis with the British Government which will not provide the kind of governance, decision-making or bridge-building that is needed in Northern Ireland in the future.  Parties know exactly what I am talking about.  I look forward to hearing what they have to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.578" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300050#CCC00200"><p>By any objective measure we are at a major crisis point in respect of Northern Ireland.  If we are to overcome this, our first challenge is to be honest in recognising the scale and origin of the problem.  In statements earlier today and last week I dealt with the Brexit issue in greater depth than is possible in this session.  I would like to concentrate instead on the fundamental ongoing issues we face.</p>  <p>  Nearly 20 years after the people of this island voted in three referendums for an agreed set of constitutional principles, institutions and a path to reconciliation we are at a moment of deadlock and disillusionment.  Where once there was rising hope that different sides could work together, today we find a rising detachment and cynicism.  The agreed institutions are suspended.  The two increasingly dominant parties in Northern Ireland continue to focus on their own rather than shared interests.  Public faith in politics is at a new low where civil servants and Ministers from English constituencies impose cuts across already strained public services.  The anti-Brexit majority has been left voiceless as this destructive policy moves forward.  Most damaging of all, the central engine behind past progress, which was the close and active collaboration of the Governments in Dublin and London has effectively broken down.  When even senior Ministers in the two Administrations are trading jibes in the media something is deeply wrong.</p>  <p>  This is not a situation which developed overnight.  It is the inevitable outcome of years of complacency and drift.  It has been a slow motion car crash lasting years.  Fianna F&aacute;il takes no comfort in the fact that it has been warning since late 2011 that a crisis was likely.  The Governments had moved to an explicit policy of leaving the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and Sinn F&eacute;in to sort matters out between themselves.  Initially their focus was on squeezing parties they saw as communal rivals and asserting their dominance.  In area after area their priority was to maximise their party control rather than to deliver good government.  That is why there were so many scandals about funding channelled to front groups and about sectarian appointments by Ministers.  Many key elements of the 1998 settlement were allowed to be marginalised and the dynamism of various initiatives was undermined.  Too often the emphasis was on holding meetings rather than ensuring that they achieved anything.  For example, it is six years since we were first told that proposals for developing North-South institutions were on the way yet nothing has appeared.  The British-Irish Council meets regularly but the British Prime Minister no longer sees it as important enough to merit attendance.</p>  <p>  In this House over the past six years we have paid nowhere near enough attention to Northern Ireland.  On those occasions when we did hold debates there was a consistent pattern.  First, the Government would state how well everything was going, then we would challenge this, warn against potential breakdown and point to clear evidence of inaction on key issues.  This in turn was followed by Sinn F&eacute;in agreeing with the Government that everything was going fine in Stormont and aggressively dismissing the idea that it had any case to answer on any issue.  The record is full of examples of Deputy Adams brushing off the significance of events and statements which deepened divisions.  Separately, there were regular statements from the First Minister and deputy First Minister about how well they were working together.  On one occasion Peter Robinson and the late Martin McGuinness attended a dinner in Dublin at which they said relations had never been better and problems were simply the imagination of people who should know better.  This complacency was followed last year by a new dynamic where the two parties became more aggressive.  This culminated in the decision of Sinn F&eacute;in's leadership to instruct its Executive members to withdraw and cause the second election in a year.</p>  <p>  The deadlock we have seen since that election is causing sustained damage, not least to public faith in politics.  No one can be complacent about the future in Northern Ireland.  It is impossible to miss the fact that the foundations for conflict and division, albeit at a much lower level than in the past, remain in place.  Sectarianism remains entrenched in important parts of the community.  Deputy Adams can, as he did, laugh off saying about unionists that he would "break these bastards" as a shared basis of democratic respect is not fully established.</p>  <p>  Deep poverty and disillusionment remain in marginalised communities which have in the past been exploited by violent groups.  The ideology of violence is still promoted, even by groups which have been persuaded to join democratic politics.  The Provisional movement continues to glorify an illegitimate struggle rejected by the majority of nationalists in all parts of this island.  At the recent Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis, the loudest cheers were for people who murdered and maimed in the face of the overwhelming and constantly renewed opposition of the Irish people.  Equally, in some loyalist areas paramilitarism continues to be admired and honoured.  Simply because the open violence has largely gone does not mean by any stretch of the imagination that we have fulfilled the potential of what Seamus Mallon, a genuine Irish republican hero, who faced down the sinister extremes terrorising his community, described as not a finality but a new dispensation to work for the interests of all.</p>  <p>  It is worth comparing the very different experience of devolved government in Scotland with that in Northern Ireland.  Both achieved devolution within a year of each other and with a similar level of support in referendums.  Comparable polling in 2001 and 2002 showed similar levels of trust in the devolved administrations' commitment to work in the best interests of the people.  However, in recent years there has been a stark divergence.  In Northern Ireland less than one third trust that the people they elect are working in their interests.  In contrast, nearly two thirds in Scotland show this trust.  We do not just need to find a way of getting through this crisis, we need a determined effort to address the recurring problems which have undermined the working of the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement and the delivery of the good government which the people of Northern Ireland so desperately seek.</p>  <p>  One of our most important challenges is to understand how the governments have moved away from basic principles and actions which were central to every piece of progress achieved in the past.  One of the most disturbing elements of last week's events was the repeated insistence, not just by the DUP but by the British Government, that Northern Ireland cannot be treated as a separate case from other parts of the United Kingdom.  This is the reversal of 43 years of policy.  In Sunningdale, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, most importantly, in the Good Friday Agreement the British Government explicitly accepted that Northern Ireland is distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom.  For 43 years it has conceded the principle that the Irish Government should be consulted on matters concerning Northern Ireland.  In the various agreements structures requiring such consultation were created.  It is this recognition of Northern Ireland's distinct position that has been the very core of overcoming historic problems.  Each of the four elements of the United Kingdom has a distinct constitutional status.  Each has separate rules on various matters including important taxation matters.  For example, Northern Ireland has the right to vary corporation tax.  The idea that for the United Kingdom's economy to function all parts must be equal in all things is a radical departure from 20 years of devolution and stated policy in respect of Scotland and Northern Ireland in particular.</p><p>In fact, the new policy is more extreme than that of Margaret Thatcher who abandoned the phrase "as British as Finchley" in government and signed an agreement which gave Irish officials a formal role in Northern Ireland.  Equally, she developed failed devolution initiatives.</p> <p> I am glad the Taoiseach has backed away from the wrong and self-serving statement that he is somehow departing from the practice of previous Governments by refusing to ignore the position of people in Northern Ireland.  He should now return to the policy of many of his predecessors and seek to build active and meaningful co-operation with politicians in Northern Ireland and Britain.  No matter what other crisis was at hand, taoisigh like Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen ensured they had a strong and productive set of relationships in Belfast and London.  Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have spoken about how their strongest bilateral relationships were with Dublin.  The relationship between Albert Reynolds and John Major showed that breakthroughs could be achieved with London even while a weak Tory government was in office.  The absence of this type of dynamic and of permanent, informal and formal engagement across the community in Northern Ireland has led to a situation where the Governments are speaking at each other through the media and our Government is engaged in public sniping with a major party.  It has also led to a situation where statements from Dublin can easily be misrepresented, including the manifestly absurd idea that Sinn F&eacute;in, our most anti-European Union party, is somehow driving Brexit policy.</p> <p> An inclusive government for Northern Ireland remains its best hope of permanently overcoming entrenched problems.  It is the only way to develop and implement policies to address the unique problems faced by communities in all parts of Northern Ireland.  Of the actions we need, the first and most important is an end to the blockade on the Assembly and Executive to allow the Brexit emergency to be addressed.  The majority of people in Northern Ireland today have no voice in the running of their affairs or in addressing the overwhelming danger posed by Brexit.  Quite rightly, Deputy Adams described Brexit as the greatest challenge of this generation.  Nevertheless, he insists that nothing will be done on Brexit in the North until other matters are dealt with first.  Those other matters are very important even though they were largely ignored as a reason for collapsing the institutions in the first place.  They must be addressed and the time for that cannot be limitless.  Nothing, however, is as pressing and potentially irreversible as the likely damage of the Brexit mess.</p> <p> It is a sad reality that the only Northern Irish voice working to block the worst parts of Tory policy is the independent unionist MP from North Down, Sylvia Hermon.  Her efforts to have respect for the Good Friday Agreement recognised in Brexit legislation demonstrate that she is a fearless fighter and have earned her far more respect than for those who are blocking the pro-remain majority in the Assembly from being able to assemble and speak.  It is only when the institutions are working that the complex arrangements required for Northern Ireland post Brexit can realistically be addressed.  In fact, it is only then that an impact study can be carried out.  We also need a renewed commitment by the Irish and British Governments to the leadership required to restore the institutions and make them work.  The hands-off approach has failed disastrously and we must return to a situation where, to borrow a phrase, the Irish Government refuses to leave Northern Ireland behind in its list of daily priorities.  In developing a Brexit response, we must work to ensure that a plan is put in place that prevents the erection of economic and social barriers on this island, whatever happens on the overall UK-EU deal.</p> <p> We also need a new long-term agenda to tackle poverty and disadvantage in Northern Ireland and in the Border region as a whole.  Currently, there is no credible development model for Northern Ireland.  There is only a constant effort to mitigate the worst impact of the withdrawal of funding from London.  Growth and prosperity and the only ways to remove the foundations of division and conflict.  It is long past time we had a major effort to find a new economic approach in Northern Ireland.  Part of that involves something akin to a Marshall plan to end disadvantage in key communities in Northern Ireland.  That did not happen under recent Executives but it needs to happen and both Governments should come together to ensure that it does.  After two decades of undoubted progress in Northern Ireland, this moment of crisis cannot be dismissed as a passing problem.  It is the result of failures over a number of years and of a strategy which is, at best, complacent.</p> <p> I noted the Minister's remarks tonight on the legacy dimension of the current talks and the Stormont House Agreement.  Here, again, is an issue which has dragged on and on.  In fact, I have always been cynical about the commitment of some of the parties to sign up genuinely to the legacy agenda and to get answers for many families and communities on the horrible violence and atrocities meted out to them.  Every party and person of goodwill must acknowledge the crisis and act.  They must act to restore the institutions, develop a plan to address the damage of Brexit, renew the effort to overcome sectarianism and demand our Governments return to close and active co-operation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300051#DDD00200"><p>Before I turn to the topic of tonight's debate, I commend the committee on the eighth amendment, which has voted to repeal Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution.  I pay tribute to the Chairman of the committee, Senator Noone, and all who participated in the discussions and gave evidence.  I commend in particular the Sinn F&eacute;in team, namely, Deputies O'Reilly and Jonathan O'Brien and Senator Gavan, for the manner in which they represented the party.  This is a very historic day, especially for Irish women.</p>  <p>  I welcome tonight's debate.  It is important that there are regular opportunities in the D&aacute;il and Seanad to discuss matters in the North.  The objective of these debates should be to inform, not to misinform, mislead or waste the time of the D&aacute;il, as the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il has just done.  The objective should be to ensure that Members of the Oireachtas are abreast of current developments and possible opportunities.  There is a requirement for constructive dialogue and a positive engagement to encourage progress.  We do not need a return to the politics of the past, which saw nationalists in the North abandoned by successive Irish Governments.  It is also important to remember that for many decades, nationalists in the North were the victims of institutionalised discrimination in housing, jobs, elections, the law and the institutions of the state.</p>  <p>  Partition saw the British retain the North within their jurisdiction at a time when it was the most advanced industrial part of the island.  They were able to hold onto the North and influence the entire country when they coerced the pro-Treaty forces into accepting partition and the sectarian statelet which put a unionist elite in control.  Anything that was nationalist or Irish was banned or derided and after decades of institutionalised violence and conflict, the peace process and the work of many good people, including former taoisigh, created a new political dispensation through the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.  Equality, parity of esteem and the human rights ethos of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights are now central to building a new society.  Sadly, there are still those among the leadership of political unionism who have yet to come to terms with these new realities.  They continue to fight the old battles, defend the old sectarian attitudes and reject equality for all citizens.  That is the current stance of the DUP which refuses to embrace the need for a rights-based society.  They believe their position has been enhanced by the deal the party recently concluded with the Tories.  As any student of Anglo-Irish politics will tell them, it will end in tears, as have all unionism's dalliances with the British.  Edward Carson, the leader of unionism at the time of partition, reflected later on what had occurred and said "What a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster, and so was Ireland, in the political game that was to get the Conservative Party into power".</p>  <p>  While some progress has been made in Sinn F&eacute;in's talks with the DUP, there is no real evidence at this time of a willingness by its leadership to embrace the political institutions in the way required if they are to serve every single citizen.  The Minister knows that.  He was there and he knows what the problem is.</p><p>Diplomacy might prevent him from saying that and I certainly will not say anything that will upset the apple cart, but the Minister knows where the problem lies.</p> <p> Michelle O'Neill has been working hard to have the political institutions restored on the basis of genuine power sharing.  There is a special responsibility on political leadership.  Deputy McDonald was at an engagement last Monday morning, and at another bigger engagement the week before that, with people from civic society who are not republicans.  We believe we must bridge the divide between the people the various parties represent and establish a new dispensation which delivers for all.  If the DUP wishes to be part of this and wishes to return to the Executive and the Assembly, it knows precisely what it must do.  I have spent hours upon hours in recent months talking to the DUP leadership, along with others from the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership.  It means agreeing a process for the implementation of past agreements.  It means building respect, tolerance and equality.  It also means the two Governments stepping up to the mark as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p> Following last week's publication of the phase one communication on Brexit, there has been much discussion about the differing interpretations of it by the British Government.  Nobody in the House should be surprised by that.  For example, there is a commitment to a bill of rights in the Good Friday Agreement, but 20 years later there is no bill of rights.  The British Government refuses to countenance it.  There is a commitment to establishing a civic forum, but there is no civic forum.  In the St. Andrews Agreement, there is a commitment to an Irish language Act, but there is no such Act.  In the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements between all the parties and the two governments, measures were agreed to deal with legacy issues.  The British Government is blocking those.  Teachta Martin knows the British Government is trying to insert what it calls a special security or national interest clause, and that has blocked the process ever since.</p> <p> The Taoiseach and the Minister know, because I spoke to them about it, that in recent weeks the British tried to insert a statute of limitations covering all Troubles-related incidents for British crown forces in a new section - perhaps Teachta Martin does not know this - of the Stormont House Agreement.  Our party was not told about this.  To the best of my knowledge the Irish Government only knew about it when we brought it to its attention.  This was an act of bad faith and it is unacceptable.  I, Michelle O'Neill and Deputy McDonald told the British Prime Minister as much to her face.  The British want everybody else to deal with the past, but they will not.  The attitude we hear from Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, which is untruthful and dishonest, does not put the focus where it belongs.</p></speech>

Teachta Martin's phony outrage at this would be amusing if it was not such a serious issue.  The reality is that nationalists in the North were abandoned for generations by successive Irish Governments, but today, like a broken record, Teachta Martin repeats the sham argument about the two problem parties and accuses Sinn F&eacute;in of contriving to pull down the institutions or preventing them being reinstated.  He chooses to ignore, as he did when he was in office, the serious allegations of corruption, in his case in his own party but in this case made by a former DUP Minister and his colleagues about the First Minister and the enormous financial cost, estimated at &pound;700 million, it will inflict on the public purse.</p>  <p>  Teachta Martin turns a blind eye to the abundant evidence of DUP disrespect for, and rejection of, the rights of nationalist citizens in the North.  I notice there is only one other Fianna F&aacute;il Member on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches this evening.  They are probably as sick of listening to his drivel as everybody else.</p></speech>

That might be the Fianna F&aacute;il leader's way.  He has brought being a hurler on the ditch into disrepute.  He misleads the D&aacute;il regularly with untruthful statements and puts words in my mouth that I never said.  He refuses to accept the Sinn F&eacute;in mandate in the North while refusing to contest elections in the North.</p>  <p>  I have a message for Teachta Martin about nationalists in the North.  He has missed this, but I do not believe the Government has missed the sea change in the attitude of nationalists in the past year.  We will never again accept any British Government, unionist leader or any Dublin politician deciding what is or is not acceptable for us.  Martin McGuinness made a stand, and that stand was endorsed in two elections by the overwhelming majority of the nationalist electorate in the Six Counties.  It was vindicated just a few days ago in the voices of 200 nationalists from civic society.  These are not necessarily Sinn F&eacute;in supporters.  They might be, but I do not know.  They wrote to the Taoiseach and appealed to him to reassure them of his commitment to stand for equality and a human rights based society and of his determination to secure and protect the rights of all citizens in the North of Ireland.  We want the Fianna F&aacute;il leader and the Government to stand up for, and vindicate, the rights of everyone in the North.  These were lawyers, academics, sports people, writers and citizens from all walks of life seeking reassurance on the Taoiseach's commitment.  Human rights lawyer, Niall Murphy, put it well when he asked why someone should have a right in Donegal but not have the same right in Derry.  Why can somebody who can marry in this State and in Britain not do so in the North?  Why can citizens in the North not have any of these rights?</p>  <p>  The DUP and the British Government are responsible for the political crisis in the North and for the lack of progress in the delivery of rights and in implementing past agreements.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Government have an onerous responsibility to act decisively, as does Sinn F&eacute;in.  However, we will not run away from our responsibilities.  I again appeal to the Government to take the lead.  It is not the best option but it should take the lead by convening the intergovernmental conference early in the new year.</p></speech>

It is about the Loughinisland massacre.  I thank and give credit to the families of the victims and survivors who attended the screening and spoke to us afterwards in moving terms.  The relatives in the Relatives for Justice campaign have shown incredible courage and resolve since that horrific night on 18 June 1994.  On that fateful night a group of Irish football fans had gathered in the Heights Bar in Loughinisland to watch the match between Ireland and Italy, as many of us did, in Giants Stadium.</p>  <p>  The joy of that night and of Ray Houghton's goal was lost when an Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF, gang burst into the pub and opened fire.  The sectarian attack left six men dead and five seriously injured.  A 2016 report on the massacre by the Police Ombudsman, Dr. Michael Maguire, is unambiguous.  It details systemic collusion between British agents, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, and the UVF death squad that carried out the attack.  The depth of collusion outlined in the report goes beyond the Loughinisland massacre.  The report makes a direct link with the Glenanne gang which was involved in the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I urge all Members to find an opportunity to watch "No Stone Unturned", if they have not done so already.  I also urge them to meet the survivors and the families of the victims.</p>  <p>  As we know, it was a horrible and bloody conflict.  When watching the documentary, I was conscious that people were hurt throughout the conflict.  I am conscious of the hurt inflicted on so many families by Irish republicans during the conflict.  I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that no Irish Government will again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind.  However, it also carries responsibilities.</p><p>It was the lack of that involvement that piqued my interest and got me started on that journey many years ago.  I remember talking to people in Northern Ireland who felt abandoned at that time and talking to families and relatives after Bloody Sunday.  That is history.  The important thing is that we look to the future.  Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  All of us, particularly the Irish Government, have a responsibility to ensure that the British Government abides by the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and all the other agreements.  </p> <p> Deputy Adams spoke about the statute of limitations for British Crown forces.  Again, this idea of bringing forward an amnesty goes directly against the British Government's international obligations to victims and its commitments made at Stormont House.  There is an onus on all of us to collectively ramp up our ambition when it comes to the North.  We cannot undo the past but we can create the conditions that will lead us all to a better future for everyone on this island.  </p></speech>

I hope we will see not before too long a referendum being put to the people to repeal the eighth amendment on the lines suggested and proposed by the committee.  I congratulate all the parliamentarians who took part in the committee - both those in favour of repeal and those opposed to repeal.  In particular, I thank my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, for her leadership in respect of the work of the committee.  In the context of the rather sad and defeatist debate we are having here, it is an example of what politics can deliver in respect of an issue of which people were really afraid.  Going back to when the referendum was originally held, people had a fear that the move for it and the level of subservience in Ireland would be so strong that it would be impossible to defeat it in the first place, which proved to be true, or prevent it and second, to repeal it and consequently, today is a very good day for Irish democracy.  Ultimately, it obviously will be for the people to decide.</p><p>It is in that context that I must say that to any reasonable person, the Northern Ireland Assembly is dead.  What a waste.  What a pity.  In what may well be Northern Ireland's greatest hour of need, the institutions are defunct.  Many people in this Chamber, including Deputy Adams, devoted a considerable part of their lives to arguing in favour of the creation of a framework structure and an agreement and institutions which, while not perfect - we all recognised they were far from perfect in terms of the different wishes of the different groups - had the capacity to change the narrative in Northern Ireland, to look forward, to create economic prosperity and progress and basically to create a new day on the island of Ireland.  It is that spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and of those who negotiated it, including John Hume, the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the former Labour Party leader, Dick Spring, which should inspire us to say that dark as it is at present, it ought to be possible to move to address the bigger threat that faces everybody on the island of Ireland, namely, Brexit and that we ought to look for things that can unite us rather than issues that can divide us.  </p><p>I was struck by something that my friend Claire Hanna, MLA said recently.  She pointed to how the Scottish Government continues to demonstrate the power and potential of devolution as it sets about addressing key issues in Scotland, many of which are name checked all the time in the context of Northern Ireland by both parties.  These issues range from education to health and to public investment in infrastructure, that is, all the issues we talk about and in which we invest so much time in this Parliament.  Claire Hanna contrasted what is happening in the devolved assembly in Scotland with what is not happening in Northern Ireland, which has been left without a government and without a locally determined budget for a year.  She said:</p><blockquote>It&rsquo;s been clear for about a decade now that the Scottish Government is a powerhouse that understands the difference between being in government and being in power.  As they plan to deliver a new budget ... with a focus on public services and the economy, it&rsquo;s a stark reminder that power and government have been drained from Northern Ireland.</blockquote><p>The stalemate in Northern Ireland is leaving a tide of inequality rising again in both communities, while both parties concentrate on a blame game.</p><p>Last week, the Sinn F&eacute;in MP for Foyle stated quite strongly in an article in the English <i>Independent</i>, &quot;as a Sinn F&eacute;in MP, I won't have Ireland become collateral damage in the Tory-DUP Brexit shambles.&quot;  That is a comment with which I would agree but to be honest, I do not think we heard that addressed in the last contribution because it is obviously a difficult issue to address.  Let us be honest about it.  It is a difficult issue to address because it means focusing on the future, inevitably, in the interests of everybody rather than just in a very narrow sectarian way.  Defending the economic security and future of Ireland is everyone's responsibility - everybody here and everybody with political responsibilities in Northern Ireland regardless of which side they come from.  It is not just the Taoiseach's responsibility.  It is everybody's responsibility and that includes Sinn F&eacute;in - a party at pains to tell us all about its mandate and its negotiating skills, for which there is a great deal of evidence.  I have to ask the people from Sinn F&eacute;in - I cannot ask the DUP because it is not here for historical reasons we all understand - what is going to happen in Westminster-----</p></speech>

There is a fairly strong indication that the UK Parliament will require a meaningful vote on a future Brexit deal.  If the UK parliament requires a meaningful vote, which we understand is what will happen, there is a question, tricky as it is, about the presence of those who have been voted in largely by nationalists in Northern Ireland to represent them in the UK Parliament.

In the article I mentioned, there were a lot of references to not abdicating political leadership.  It was talking about the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, but it could be relevant much closer to home.  Leadership does not fall to the two Governments alone.  It also falls to the people who have the biggest mandates in Northern Ireland, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Having run the province for nearly a decade, Sinn F&eacute;in has become more preoccupied with getting into government in Dublin rather than Belfast.  In recent years, we have observed a concerted undermining of the political institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement and an<i>&agrave; la carte</i>approach by the largest parties to human rights issues and to cherishing the rich and diverse cultural traditions in Ireland.</p><p>Rather than fostering bonds across the community divide, silos are being built and community tensions are being exploited rather than soothed.  A corrosive form of governance based on the principle of &quot;separate but equal&quot; has begun to prevail in complete contravention of the spirit if not the letter of the Good Friday Agreement.  After ten years of DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in Government, the cumulative, corrosive effect of bad government has finally resulted in a return to direct rule in all but name.  With a hung parliament at Westminster, the DUP sought to exploit a weakened Tory party to extract concessions and wield its influence.  Rather than return to Government in Belfast, Sinn F&eacute;in is taking a leaf out of the DUP's book and seeking to prioritise getting into Government in Dublin over participating in Government in Belfast.  As John Hume pointed out, there are three key relationships between the east and west, North and South and most importantly between the two communities in the North.</p><p>I would really like to see Sinn F&eacute;in, in addition to its interest in the Republic, pursue those broader political interests and the spirit of the Belfast Agreement.  As we face into the Brexit negotiations, the Labour Party and I have argued for an all-island approach and an all-island resolution.  The commitment by Mr. Barnier that Ireland should have a clear pathway in the Brexit process is very important but it will require the most incredibly detailed work.  Information that may be available to Sinn F&eacute;in, particularly those in Sinn F&eacute;in in the North, on vital issues such as agriculture will be really important to the debate that will take place in Westminster.  We have enormous economic interests North and South.  The problem with Brexit is, like the collapse of 2008, if it resulted in an incredible crash with 330,000 jobs being lost, it will not happen overnight.  It will happen slowly.  Towns like Dundalk will be strangled again as trade slips away from them.  We all have to think collectively to find a progressive solution for all the people on the island.  We cannot be shown to be divided on a North-South basis in a narrow sectarian way if we want the other 26 EU countries to maintain what has been tremendous support for the Irish case up to now.  One of Deputy Enda Kenny's very significant achievements was to have the situation of Ireland included in the three issues that have to be dealt with first.  We have to show collectively a capacity to move together notwithstanding the kind of sniping we have just been listening to.  If one goes as far as Austria or the far side of eastern Europe-----</p></speech>

Apart from Sinn F&eacute;in, we are the only other party that has elected Members both North and South of the Border.  We are a party that wants and seeks a united Ireland, not an Ireland as envisaged by some here of unity based on low corporation tax, which is a safe tax haven for the elite of the world and which denies women, North and South, bodily autonomy.  We want a truly equal Ireland.</p>  <p>  I will not be joining the chorus of demands for a deal for the sake of a deal between the parties in the North to get Stormont back up and running.  A deal for the sake of a deal represents a demand for the resumption of a Government that was mired in corruption with the cash-for-ash scandal and which was determined not to allow women have the right to choose.  The largest party within it, the DUP, has utterly reactionary politics, contempt for the campaign for LGBT rights, a vitriolic hatred of the idea of a woman&rsquo;s right to choose and opposition to and contempt for marriage equality.  This is not just about its attitude to social issues.  It is not just right-wing on economic questions.  Beneath the fa&ccedil;ade of supporting Protestant workers' interests, the real agenda of the DUP is to support the elite, which we saw in the NAMA and Project Eagle and cash-for-ash scandals.  Internationally, we saw it with the selling of the North as a tax haven and a low corporate tax jurisdiction with few workers' rights and low wages and conditions.  The DUP offers ordinary Protestants in the North absolutely nothing.  It has supported a wage freeze in the public sector and has helped the Tories to hound people off social welfare benefits.  </p>  <p>  We agree we want to see an Ireland, North and South, based on equality but we go further than Sinn F&eacute;in on this.  Our vision of equality in the North will include the rights of Irish language speakers and the recognition that this right means the right to funding and educational opportunities to speak and learn the language.  The silence here from the main parties of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael on the reactionary attitude of the DUP speaks volumes about their phoney republicanism and phoney commitment to equality of both sides of the island.</p>  <p>  Our vision goes much further.  It extends to wanting equality for women, North and South, who have to travel to England to avail of abortion.  It extends to wanting to see the ending of the criminalisation of those woman, North and South.  In the South, women face a 14-year sentence and in the North, they face a sentence of life imprisonment.</p><p>Those who claim to be committed to equality and yet want an administration that supports the <i>status quo</i>on women's rights and on LGBT rights are showing contempt for the suffering and the hurt that these Victorian laws and attitudes do to real men and women.<br/><br/>We believe winning the equality agenda also means winning economic equality.  That is why, for example, we were disappointed that the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis recently rejected a motion from the Clonard cumann in west Belfast calling for corporation tax not to be reduced in the North, as Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP plan on doing.  We cannot build an Ireland of equals by giving the corporations handouts.  We cannot build an Ireland of equals by supporting access to abortion in the South, as we did today - albeit limited in the case of Sinn F&eacute;in - and ignoring that right for women in the North.<br/><br/>On Brexit, again we see double standards and the phoney concerns of many parties here.  Let us be clear: the Brexit negotiations have been a competition between two rotten blocs.  On the one hand are the Tories, who clearly do not have a clue about this country and faced with the reality of the hard border, they know it will not be accepted here.  Nor will the vision of a Tory Brexit that attacks EU migrants be accepted.  On the other hand, we have used the Brexit negotiations to sleepwalk this country into supporting PESCO, which will end Irish neutrality and incorporate us into an EU imperial army.  What is the use of calling for an end to the British Empire where the sun never set and the blood never dried only to dissolve our sovereignty into an empire of the European Union?  It should be clear to anyone who is paying attention that neither the Tories nor the EU have any interest in protecting the people of this island.<br/><br/>We oppose a hard border, not because it is an inconvenience to trade but because a hard border will strengthen partition.  We oppose partition because, as James Connolly said, that partition will lead to a carnival of reaction North and South.  That is what the Magdalen laundries represented, what the Tuam babies represented and what the opposition to gay rights and women's rights in the North currently represents.<br/><br/>We intend to put our money where our mouth is and oppose a hard border in deeds not just words.  We will campaign to make sure this State does not co-operate with any form of a hard border, from customs officers to police and to any form of state support for a physical border.  We will mobilise to ensure any physical presence is removed.<br/><br/>We will also ensure the Government follows up on its own rhetoric.  The Government needs to use Ireland's veto in Europe to stop any deal that would result in a hard border.  We will insist that any deal should be put to a vote North and South.  In opposing this, we will not side with the bureaucrats in Brussels who do not give a damn about us.  They forced austerity on us.  We should remember the economic bullies who imposed the biggest bank bailout in the history of the world on the people of this country.  We will not be part of their EU army.  We want a social Europe, a democratic Europe, a people's Europe and not the Europe beloved by some commentators that is about the needs of big business, that locks out refugees who drown in the Mediterranean fleeing persecution and war and are currently trapped in torture camps and slave camps in Libya.  <br/><br/>We have a Europe that wants to move us into a military union as well as a market union.  That is what PESCO is about.  That is why the Government is happy to raise defence spending to more than &euro;3.5 billion, while refusing to commit anything near that in increasing spending in any other sphere that might benefit ordinary people.<br/><br/>The only consistent position for progressives in this country is the position of People Before Profit.  We serve neither London nor Brussels but fight for real democracy and a decent future for all on this island based on the needs of workers and ordinary people across Europe and not the needs of big corporations, which are bleeding dry the people not just of this island but across Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.615" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300055#HHH00200"><p>I will be speaking in this debate for Solidarity and for Solidarity alone.  Today Northern Ireland is in crisis.  Everyone here almost certainly agrees with this statement, but there are very different views as to why there is a crisis and as to the way forward.</p>  <p>  The Executive collapsed nearly a year ago and there is no sign of the necessary level of agreement to bring it back.  The short-term cause of the collapse is that the working arrangement between the two main parties fell apart in January.  However, there is a more fundamental problem.  The institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement are based on an unstable agreement to differ between diametrically opposed forces.  There is no real agreement and there never will be until the third tradition, the trade union and labour tradition, asserts itself politically and in clear opposition to both nationalism and unionism.</p>  <p>  For now, parties based on sectarian division are in the ascendancy.  The two largest parties, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, have eclipsed their rivals not by their ability to compromise but by their ability to exploit and magnify every disagreement.  When parties are based on sectarian division it is inevitable that they will use all issues to deepen sectarian division.  The end result is sectarian paralysis and sharp disagreements on issue after issue.</p>  <p>  Brexit is one of these divisive issues.  Both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are exploiting the fears of ordinary people around Brexit to bolster their positions.  The result is increasing political polarisation.  The words and actions of green Tories in this State, including the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, are contributing to this polarisation.</p>  <p>  Solidarity is clear on the key Brexit issues.  We are opposed to any hardening of the border between North and South.  A hard border would have a negative impact on the lives of working people.  We are also opposed to any hardening of the border between Ireland and Britain and for exactly the same reason.  We are not in favour of a Brexit which favours the bosses of the EU or the bosses of the UK.  The current negotiations are a battle between rival capitalists and are not designed in any way to look after the interests of working people, North or South.  Solidarity will call out every step which works against the interests of working people, North and South.</p>  <p>  Of course Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP do not disagree on everything.  Sinn F&eacute;in is loud in its support for equal rights for all but apparently this does not extend to a woman's right to choose.  It is as one with the DUP in refusing to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The DUP claims that its deal with the Tories has brought an extra &pound;1 billion and protected Northern Ireland from the worst of the cuts, but it votes through every aspect of the Conservative Party programme.  Sinn F&eacute;in claims that it stands firm against Tory austerity but hands power to implement benefit cuts back to Westminster in order to avoid any flak for these savage cuts.  Both parties are absolutely complicit in implementing austerity.</p>  <p>  Ordinary people in the North are left to cope with falling real wages and continuing attacks on health, education and welfare.  For example, on Monday of this week a major review on social care in Northern Ireland was published.  Currently domiciliary care - personal care delivered to people in their own homes - is provided free by the National Health Service.  This is not the case with nursing home care, which is charged for after a means test.  The report recommends addressing this unfairness, but not by making all care free.  Instead it recommends that care packages delivered in the home should also be charged for.  This is a clear case of levelling down, not levelling up.  Who commissioned this report?  It was Sinn F&eacute;in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill when she was Minister of Health.</p>  <p>  Yesterday it was revealed that the education system in Northern Ireland will have a &pound;350 million funding gap by 2019-20.  Almost 400 schools will be in budget deficit this year, which is the highest number ever.  The education budget has fallen by 10% in real terms since 2010.  Which party held the education portfolio at Stormont before the collapse of the Executive?  It was the DUP.</p>  <p>  The large majority of those who vote do so for four parties, namely, the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and the UUP.  There is nothing inevitable about this.  When most voters go to the ballot box they can see no credible alternative on offer and vote for their side against the other side, often reluctantly.  At present, there is no large cross-community party which opposes sectarianism, opposes austerity and supports the right to choose.  The creation of such a party is vital.  When one existed in the 1960s, it drew 100,000 votes and there is no reason this level of support could not be built again.</p><p> There are good reasons to hope for a better future.  In the 1980s and 1990s, tens of thousands of working people joined trade union-organised rallies against sectarian massacres.  Those rallies demonstrated that there was an overwhelming mood for peace, for the unity of working people and for a better future free from poverty and unemployment.</p> <p> These hopes of the early years of the peace process have been dashed.  We live in more peaceful times but it is a relative peace and low-level violence continues.  Sectarian division has hardened in many ways.  The hope for a peace dividend has not materialised.  Despite all of this, the vast majority of people are opposed to any return to conflict.  The divisions that dominate the news are one side of the picture only.  Every day, genuine labour, trade union and socialist activists stand together on an anti-sectarian basis, whatever their background.  Health campaigners are currently linking up across the North to bring local campaigns together.  The unity of working people, when they stand up to protect their services, is organic.  It is this unity which points the way to the future.</p> <p> Trade unions organise more than 220,000 workers in Northern Ireland, both Catholic and Protestant.  Those trade unionists are linked with trade unionists in the South through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They stand in solidarity with their fellow trade unionists in England, Scotland and Wales as currently seen with the dispute at the Royal Mail.  It is only the trade unions, genuine left and socialist activists who can defend working people in the difficult period ahead.</p> <p> Solidarity supports those who are endeavouring to build working class unity in Northern Ireland.  Solidarity will offer whatever assistance it can to campaigners who seek to defend the NHS and education.  We stand together with those who are fighting for a woman's right to choose, and Solidarity supports trade union and other activists who are endeavouring to build a new mass cross-community, anti-sectarian left party which can provide a real alternative at the ballot box.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Breathnach.  Is the Deputy sharing time with Deputy Brendan Smith?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.618" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300056#JJJ00300"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Smith.  I came into politics as a republican nationalist but many in this House might be perplexed to hear me describe myself as a unionist also, but not in the form people in Sinn F&eacute;in seem to oppose.  I was reared to believe that unity is about unity of purpose and in economic approach and that with that comes respect for others' view of the world.  Through trust and engagement, it is my firm belief that the unity of the island will come if we give our children and our children's children a future built on respect and prosperity.</p>  <p>  Theresa May&rsquo;s dependence on the DUP, together with the failure to form a government in Northern Ireland for some 330 days now, is clearly having a negative impact and will have repercussions for our citizens not just in Northern Ireland but in the Border communities and beyond.  The short-sighted abstentionism of Sinn F&eacute;in leaves Westminster with no nationalist voice to represent them, nor the vast majority of the 55% who voted to reject Brexit.</p>  <p>  It is unbelievable that many democratically elected Northern Ireland representatives cannot put aside or park those contentious issues to enable them deal with the greatest threat facing these islands in Brexit.</p>  <p>  It is my strong belief that the Irish Government, representing all of this island, in the absence of a devolved government in Northern Ireland, must also not be duped by the DUP posturing or by what has been described as the David Davis-proofing, DDP, of phase 1 of the negotiations.  The Minister said there should be no backsliding.  I would go further and say there should be no hunker-sliding, which is how I would describe what has been happening in terms of the British Government in recent days.</p>  <p>  It is my further belief that written signed agreements and guarantees are needed in advance of phase 2.  We have already heard David Davis describe the deal as much more a "statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing".  Many on both sides of these islands will be very aware how Britain can change its tack to suit its methods.  I said last week that there is many a slip between cup and lip.  It might have been more appropriate to say that there is many a slip between dinner and dessert, as Theresa May found to her detriment.</p>  <p>  There is a dichotomy in the statements that the UK as a whole will leave both the customs union and the Single Market while also stating that Northern Ireland will not be treated any differently.  These statements do not sit comfortably with me or with anyone and they contradict each another.  The British Government needs to be reminded also that this agreement, and the Good Friday Agreement, are sovereign and not just a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement as looked upon by David Davis in terms of phase 1.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that in a recent survey of 2,000 voters in Northern Ireland, 57.8% believe that special status should be accorded to Northern Ireland, something that has been advocated by my party since Brexit; 52.4% are concerned about a reduction in human rights; and 75.8% believe that in Northern Ireland the standards of food and products produced on these islands should have no divergence at any time or in future.</p>  <p>  A report this week outlined the gap in fortunes between the economies of Northern Ireland and Ireland, which will increase in the next two years as Brexit looms.  This EY study added that Ireland&rsquo;s GDP is expected to grow by 4.9% this year compared with 1.4% for Northern Ireland.  The report goes on to say that the state of the economy of Northern Ireland is not helped by the absence of a devolved government.  It also states that the economy in Northern Ireland remains challenged owing to inflation, reducing consumer spending and the absence of a government disrupting the many state spending programmes.</p>  <p>  Without the return of the Northern Ireland Assembly, all of the Departments are losing out on funding.  For example, the education system in Northern Ireland is facing a funding gap of &pound;350 million by 2019 or 2020 if it does not get more money, according to the Education Authority&rsquo;s chief executive, Gavin Boyd.  He has also said that almost 400 schools will be in budget deficit this year - Northern Ireland's highest ever number and a 27% rise from last year.  We need to get the devolved government up and running to encourage the future generations I spoke about earlier.</p>  <p>  I attended a conference in Newry on 10 November on the impact of Brexit on children.  It was called "It's Our Brexit Too".  We were warned by young teenagers of the potential impact of Brexit on children and young people from both sides of the Border.  The conference highlighted the fragility of the peace process in Northern Ireland and called for decisions about Brexit to be formally assessed to ensure there is no regression of children's rights in Northern Ireland or the Republic.  For example, detailed consideration must also be given on how European arrest warrants and other cross-Border child protection measures will now function.</p>  <p>  On the stage of the negotiations, in a speech yesterday Michel Barnier pointed out that sufficient progress does not mean full progress.  There are many other points to discuss for the UK&rsquo;s orderly withdrawal.  He also made reference to Ireland, where the UK has made important commitments but where he said much work remains to be done in a distinct strand of negotiations.  I welcome Michel Barnier's statement that all Ministers agree that Ireland requires specific solutions because of its unique situation.  As I have done previously, I commend the efforts of the Government in all the consultations and the officials for their diligence on this matter.</p><p>I urge the parties in the North to put aside their disagreements, even for now, and ensure that devolved government returns to Northern Ireland in order that the citizens of the North may have their voices fully heard in the Brexit negotiations.  I have absolutely no doubt that they will be given credit for that by people who want to see proper functioning administrations in all facets to represent them both in Brexit and in the ministries which are not working in the North because of the lack of government involvement.  </p> <p> Michel Barnier spoke in Irish, using the phrase, "N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile", meaning there is strength in unity.  Mar fhocal scoir deirim gur ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile a mhaireann na daoine agus na t&iacute;ortha.  Humans and countries are interdependent.  That is how we should progress.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.620" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300057#KKK00200"><p>Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Declan Breathnach have outlined very clearly Fianna F&aacute;il's strong view that we want the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive restored as soon as possible.  We sincerely hope that the parties and the Governments will reach agreement.  There is a particular onus on the two major parties represented in Stormont to ensure that the difficulties that have prevented a working Assembly and Executive for more than a year are resolved.  I heard Deputy Adams mention a letter from civic society from different people in different walks of life in Northern Ireland, which was addressed to An Taoiseach and which requested Government invention, assistance and vigilance on a number of issues.  I have been asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his predecessors about the level of engagement the Government has had with civic society in Northern Ireland over the past 12 months, particularly when the people of Northern Ireland do not have the political voice they should have in their own Assembly and their own Executive.  Only today, An T&aacute;naiste replied to me that:</p><blockquote>The power-sharing Executive is responsible for representing the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland, including in relation to how the issues arising with the UK exit from the EU be addressed.  It is imperative that the devolved institutions can urgently operate again.  The North-South Ministerial Council must also resume its work to oversee and develop North-South co-operation, including that commenced last year to co-ordinate engagement with the Government and the Executive on dealing with the challenges raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately there was a civic assembly in Northern Ireland, and Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP had it within their gift to have it restored.  There is no point in blaming the Irish Government or the British Government.  It was purely within the remit of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP to re-establish that civic forum, but the parties have failed to do it over many years.  People are now talking, when there is no political Assembly, about how the voice of civic society must be listened to.  It must be listened to when there is no political voice.  Some of us went out and campaigned for the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  Not every party campaigned for it, but our Taoiseach at the time, the British Prime Minister and representatives and leaders of many parties made major contributions in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement.  Thankfully it was endorsed by over 94% of the people in our State in that referendum in May 1998 and by over 74% in Northern Ireland.  That is the political mandate that we all have on this island, and it is not being implemented. </p><p>There is a huge onus of responsibility and blame resting on the shoulders of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in for not having an Executive and Assembly in place.  I have engaged, along with many colleagues in the Oireachtas, in many meetings about Brexit, including in committees in this House and debates in this House and elsewhere.  The best debate I have participated in and the best discussion on the matter was at the North-South Parliamentary Assembly in the first days of December 2016 at Stormont.  The North-South Parliamentary Assembly consists of members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and members of Stormont.  That day in Stormont, under the chairmanship of An Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Stormont Assembly, saw very robust but honest discussion on Brexit and the issues confronting this island.  Sadly, without that forum since, we have not had that robust discussion that is necessary on an all-island basis.  That day, regardless of what political tradition people came from, there was honest-to-God debate.  Good, progressive viewpoints were expressed.  Different viewpoints were expressed, but listened to, and people understood the concerns raised by each side.  Sadly we have not had a meeting of that assembly since the Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland dissolved themselves.  </p><p>The Minister has heard me speak at committee and in this Chamber to outline the concerns of the Border communities.  I am privileged to represent two of the southern Ulster counties.  I have great interaction with my neighbours in Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh.  From speaking to those people I know they are very fearful of the outcome of Brexit.  I compliment the Minister and his Government colleagues on what was achieved last week, and I sincerely hope that the message that the Minister has delivered will be realised and that there will be no Border on our island.  That is what we want to see.  My constituents, my friends and neighbours travel north and people travel south on a daily basis.  Thankfully the Good Friday Agreement, to all intents and purposes, did away with the Border on our island as we went about our daily business.  There is huge interdependence in the agrifood sector, the engineering sector and the construction products sector in my own region.  Raw materials travel north and south, and the finished products go in both directions.  Thankfully today we have all-Ireland companies which developed on an all-Ireland basis, facilitated by the workings of the Good Friday Agreement and the new dispensation on this island.  It is an absolute shame that we do not have the institutions that were established by the Good Friday Agreement up and running and representing the people.  They were overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of all of this island on the same day in May 1998, via referendums in the North and South.  Deputy Adams was quoted by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin earlier as saying that the challenge of Brexit is huge for this island.  There is a substantial part of our country where great, painstaking work was done to bring about new political structures.  They are not working, and it is a shame that is the position.  </p><p>As a proud Ulster man I want to see people in all of Ulster represented by their politicians at local level, in the Assembly and on an all-Ireland basis as well.  We could be working progressively towards achieving a United Ireland, but we want to ensure that the structures we have in place at the present time are working on behalf of the people who gave the politicians their mandate.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300057#KKK00300"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to talk tonight about the North of Ireland.  Even though we are furthest away from the Six Counties, it still concerns everyone in Kerry as much as it does the people of the rest of the country.  Great progress has been made over the last 20 years, after the 30 years of bloodshed, loss of life and damage to communities caused by lack of employment prior to that.  The wonderful people of the North endured that suffering for so long and we were all glad to see peace at last after those 30 years.  We need to ensure that the people of the North of Ireland benefit from the progress made, and indeed from Brexit, because Brexit is a real challenge facing the whole island and we need to have a proper plan to counteract the challenges that it poses.</p><p>Seeing the man detailed by the English Government to conduct negotiations, David Davis, contradicting himself on the public stage is not helpful in allowing the ordinary people to understand, or to have faith or confidence in, what is going on.  With talks ongoing in Europe about the North of Ireland, it is not very helpful to see a man in this pivotal position contradicting himself within the space of a few days.</p> <p> We have to acknowledge the great work and the great efforts of many people North and South.  I know I will leave some out but I will mention a few.  I will mention Garret FitzGerald and Albert Reynolds.  In fact, when Albert Reynolds was Taoiseach he put his own life in danger by meeting members of the IRA in a hotel.  One of his family members drove him to the basement and he went up to the top floor to meet people in order to talk about peace and getting the peace process going.  We have to acknowledge that.  Bertie Ahern also played a pivotal role.  Deputy Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, John Hume and Ian Paisley all played a massive role in ensuring the peace which we have had for the last 20 years.  </p> <p> It is very important that we get a good deal for the North of Ireland out of Brexit.  We should not let the North of Ireland suffer, because the Twenty-six Counties are entwined with it now.  Indeed, businesspeople around Killarney, Castleisland and Tralee have relayed their concerns to me about what will happen to them and their businesses in the future if the challenge of Brexit is not dealt with properly.  They stress that any solution must be favourable to the South of Ireland as well as the North.  They say that, even as it is, they are losing massive sums of money due to the depreciation in the value of sterling.  They are getting as much as 10% to 13% less for the goods and products they export to the North of Ireland and to England.  That is very hurtful indeed.  We need to acknowledge that and to see what we can do as a Parliament to ensure the survival of these companies, many of which withstood the downturn from 2008 to 2015.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.623" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300058#LLL00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly on this very important subject.  As my brother rightly outlined, it is right to acknowledge at the beginning that we would not be where we are without people having made what I would call very courageous decisions.  If I am to mention anybody, the first would be the late Martin McGuinness.  He was not only a great loss to his own family and community, but he also did great work politically over his time.  Along with others, he made great moves which directly led us to where we are and to peace on our streets, which of course is of paramount importance.</p>  <p>  On the threat posed by Brexit and all that it entails, I am very glad of the work of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which I am Chairman.  I thank all of the members for the work they have done to date.  As the Minister knows, we travelled to Brussels and met Michel Barnier.  We asked him to come here and address the Oireachtas.  We also asked Guy Verhofstadt.  Those trips were very significant and very timely.  When Guy Verhofstadt went to the North he saw at first hand the complexity of the problems which could face the farming community there and businesses on both sides of the Border if we were thrown any type of a hard border.  He saw the problems and complexities which could arise.  We hope we are a big part of the way towards ensuring that we will not have any type of a hard border.  If we had such a border, it would have a very destabilising effect on the whole system in Northern Ireland.  We have farmers who have lands which straddle the Border.  We have businesses which trade North and South.  We have 30,000 people going over the Border every day.  If there was to be any type of impediment or restriction on that access for goods or people it could have drastic consequences in the future.  </p>  <p>  The whole situation is still fragile.  It would be neglectful not to acknowledge the work of the Minister, in particular his work over recent weeks.  I would call the effort he has put into his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade tireless work.  It would be very neglectful not to acknowledge in the House tonight the work he has been doing on the whole Brexit issue.  It is a very heavy burden of responsibility but, in my opinion, he is discharging it in a very workmanlike fashion, which is nothing less than I would expect from him any day of the week.  That good work has to be kept up.  We all have to be united.  </p>  <p>  In recent weeks we were threatened with a completely unwanted and unnecessary general election.  If that had happened during such a key time, when we were just getting through the first round of Brexit talks, it would have really put us on a very bad footing for the negotiations during that critical time.  We need stability facing into the second phase of the talks.  We need everybody pulling together.  All of us as politicians must put our shoulders to the wheel to ensure that when Brexit is finally completed, Ireland will suffer the least impact possible.  Our recovery is at such a fragile stage.  We do not want anything to rock the boat or to impact adversely on our financial status, on our exports, on the trade we have with England and the rest of Europe, or on the passage of goods and people over the Border in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300058#LLL00300"><p>I too am glad to be able to speak tonight on behalf of the Rural Independent Group and to deliver a statement on Northern Ireland.  I note a number of things in the Minister's speech and how hard he has worked to try to keep everything on an even keel.  I also note the news from Westminster tonight that the Prime Minister, Theresa May, has lost the vote by 309 votes to 305.  She is losing all authority.  While we are panicking here - we are not panicking, but we are worried - things could change across the pond.  I respect totally the decision of the United Kingdom, its autonomy and its right to decide what outcome it will seek.  Unlike us when we had to vote twice on the Nice and Lisbon treaties, the UK Government accepted the democratic wish of the people.  We can never deny that to them or to any other democracy.  We now know the implications.  We had them here last week with the issue of the European army and everything else.  This all started with the Lisbon treaty.</p>  <p>  I respect what is going on in the UK, but I do not respect what Mr. David Davis was saying last week.  We were after getting commitments and the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach had announced the agreement.  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste on the work and time he put in because I know he put in long hours.  Mr. Davis then tried to unravel that and was saying that the agreement could be changed.  It is completely unacceptable to use that kind of language when the stakes are so high.  The stakes are high for the whole economy here in Ireland, especially for our farming sector.  It will of course affect all sectors which interact with Northern Ireland.</p><p>My wife is from Monaghan, which is on the Border.  All the gun clubs, sporting clubs, fishing clubs and hunting clubs in the area straddle the Border.  There is no longer an effective Border.</p> <p> I compliment the good work of two Tipperary men, the late Fr. Alec Reid and the former Minister and advisor, Martin Mansergh, as well as that of Martin McGuinness, God rest him, Deputy Adams, John Hume, Ian Paisley and all those who were involved, including the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who left his mother's graveside to go and tie up the deal.  We must not lose the enthusiasm that existed for the Good Friday Agreement and was evidenced by huge turnout in the referendums, North and South.</p> <p> We must not have a hard Border.  I travel to Medjugorje every year and I see the border between Bosnia and Croatia.  There is a new motorway, obviously built with the help of EU funds, on which a large border checkpoint has been built.  It is an external EU border.  If the EU is prepared to put in a big border post there, no one should cod us that it would not be prepared to put a similar one in this country.  At that border post there are queues for a couple of miles with buses and so on and passports are checked.  It would be unthinkable to return to that in Ireland.</p> <p> We must work together.  I will not lecture those in Sinn F&eacute;in who are present but it is a pity that nationalists in Northern Ireland have no representative in the United Kingdom Parliament.  They used to be represented by the SDLP and, to a lesser extent, the Alliance Party.  It is a polarised situation.  Members know who the minority holding the sway over Prime Minister May is and that is not Sinn F&eacute;in or the SDLP or any other nationalist group.  One has to admire the DUP for its tenacity and the way it has come to hold such power but I do not agree with many of its views on the issue.</p> <p> I meet many farmers from Northern Ireland who do not want Brexit.  The exports and imports of milk, grain and poultry and so on across the Border have a phenomenal impact and it is a huge sector.  I have met sales persons from companies and machinery exporters in this country which are known all over the world such as Keenan Systems, McHales in Mayo and Abbey Retail in Nenagh.  The order books of such companies are very much diminished not because they will not get the orders but, rather, because there is such uncertainty over Brexit in the food and farming sector right across the parts of Europe and beyond with which they deal.  That behoves us all to put our shoulder to the wheel, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, and have the situation resolved.  The uncertainty across the pond is of no help to any parts of markets North or South.  All the farming organisations are very worried, as is the education sector.  There are so many cross-Border initiatives at risk, such as the Collins and Healy-Rae bus that brings people for treatment for cataracts.  That bus will keep going and the Deputies will fill it and we will shame the Government into providing such a service here.  However, we might lose the connectivity of cross-Border initiatives from Northern Ireland, which would be a fierce disaster for a campaign that the Deputies have rightly gotten going to allow people to see the light.</p></speech>

We were very lucky.  Our negotiating teams have honed their skills in negotiation and international diplomacy.  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, for laying the groundwork over the past 12 months at a very crucial time for the island of Ireland, North and South.  I compliment the chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, for the way he contributed and donned the Irish jersey in promoting the cause North and South.  We should also acknowledge our European colleagues who stood so solidly with us in order to ensure that the Union prevailed and looked after itself.</p>  <p>  The people of this island, North and South, have become economically dependent on each other over the past 20 years in a way that did not pertain before that.  There has been a significant economic dividend from the relationship that has developed and the benefit of that has been seen by all.  The next stage and objective must be the degree to which the T&aacute;naiste and the Government can interact with nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland in order to represent their interests in the context of negotiations that must and will continue because there is an onus on everybody on the island to ensure that what was achieved over the years and the sacrifices and very serious calls that were made are not allowed to slip away.  There is no intention of allowing that to happen.  The T&aacute;naiste can take a bow and convey our thanks to our colleagues in the European Union, who have clearly indicated their willingness to back the Union and endeavour to do everything possible to retain the benefits we have achieved.</p></speech>

The change was accepted by the Seanad and is now before the D&aacute;il for approval.  As Members are aware, the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property was increased to 6% on budget day.  That rate applies to all related conveyances executed after 12 midnight on 10 October 2017.  This measure is intended to ensure that the new 6% rate will also apply when non-residential property held by an entity such as a company is indirectly sold by way of a sale of the shares in the company and, effectively, the company itself.  The rate of stamp duty on non-residential commercial property is now 6% and the rate applied to the sale of shares is 1%.</p><p>The stamp duty rate differential provides an incentive for parties involved in large property deals to seek to structure transactions in such a way that they will avoid the 6% rate.  Such avoidance could take the form of the placing of property into a so-called corporate wrapper or envelope before then selling on the corporate entity itself by selling its shares, which would be subject to a 1% stamp duty rate.  The measure also targets partnerships and certain investment undertakings used for collective investment purposes which would hold a significant amount of Irish property or interest in Irish property.  The measure is essentially aimed at entities that deal in land or develop land-----</p></speech>

Not all entities deriving value from property will be affected.  For example, a hotel business, car park business or office rental business might be carried on by a company.  Although the greater part of the value of such businesses might be attributable to their property assets, the sale of such companies by sale of their shares will continue to be chargeable to stamp duty at a rate of 1% because they will not have acquired or developed the property with the sole or primary aim of making a profit or gain from its disposal but from using the property for its core business.</p>  <p>  This is an anti-tax avoidance measure that is being introduced.  I wrote to the relevant Opposition spokespeople to explain the background to the measure and why we are introducing it.  I commend the measure to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.647" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="19:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300060#NNN00900"><p>I do not intend to delay proceedings.  I welcome the anti-avoidance measure in the Bill.  It is appropriate to say that this is not the best way to legislate.  The recommendation itself runs to a number of pages, and it is always better to scrutinise such things in committee, to have the appropriate time to do so, although I acknowledge there is no time limit at this point, and to have those staged phases of being able to consider legislation on Second, Committee and Report Stages.  That is not the case here but, that being said, the measure is welcome.  I have raised this through parliamentary questions and in the House as the Bill was going through.  An increase in the rate of commercial stamp duty is something we called for, and I welcome the fact that the Government has moved to increase it.  We are mindful that commercial properties were at the heart of the construction collapse and the banking collapse.  Despite many people thinking it was a housing problem, it was very much a commercial one.  Therefore, we as a State need to be very mindful when we see an overheating market or such signs beginning to emerge in respect of commercial property.  When the stamp duty rate was increased from 2% to 6%, it gave that incentive for companies to involve themselves in avoidance schemes.  This was also flagged by Davy Stockbrokers.  It flagged that this was likely to happen, and real estate investment trusts, REITs, were mentioned in this regard.</p>  <p>  I welcome the recommendation and I have no issues with it.  I also welcome the briefing note.  We were quite considerably aggrieved and displeased by the fact that we were being notified of amendments but were not receiving the relevant briefing notes.  A comprehensive briefing note was provided to us, which was very helpful and which speeds the whole process up.  I hope this practice will continue, and I thank the Minister's officials for same.</p>  <p>  Another matter I wish to raise concerns the costs.  We are aware that the four-percentage-point increase from 2% to 6% is estimated by the Government to raise &euro;376 million.  I will not rehearse all the issues again.  We have serious doubts about this.  I raised on budget night the validity of this, how robust these costs will be and what the amount of money will be.  Will we see that level of transactions?  There is serious doubt in this regard.  What is alarming to me is that we found out from the Revenue Commissioners yesterday that there was no engagement between the Department and Revenue to ascertain the figure of &euro;376 million.  Revenue informed the committee yesterday that this was simply taken from the Revenue ready reckoner.  The ready reckoner is a fantastic tool and is there to inform us, but given we were dealing with budgetary matters, particularly one that will raise &euro;376 million, a telephone call should have been made to Revenue to ask it, given the caveats in the legislation, its estimation of the amount of revenue that would come in from this measure.  I am deeply surprised that this did not happen.  It only adds to my concern that we may see a hole emerge in the budget because of this measure.</p>  <p>  The last thing I will say concerns the anti-avoidance scheme.  Given there is now more of an incentive for people to avoid paying the 6% commercial stamp duty, I ask the Minister that if Revenue identifies such schemes and they are brought to his attention, they be brought to the attention of the finance spokespersons of the Opposition as well in order that we move quickly and speedily to close down any kinds of avoidance schemes that may emerge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300060#NNN01000"><p>I also thank the Minister and his officials for the note we received on this new section, which is a significant recommendation.  I have no difficulty with strengthening the anti-avoidance provisions.  Clearly, the increase in the stamp duty rate would have created a very strong financial incentive for transactions to be structured in a manner which would avoid the 6% rate.</p>  <p>  I will ask just two questions.  First, regarding the question of double taxation, it is my understanding that if the home jurisdiction of the company also applies stamp duty, the company will have to pay stamp duty in Ireland and in that home jurisdiction, therefore paying on the double.  We have double tax arrangements with the UK but, as I understand, not with other countries regarding stamp duty.  Will the Minister clarify this point?  Second, regarding enforcement, this section will apply to companies outside of Ireland, and there is some mutual recognition of tax judgment rules.  However, the likelihood is that change will be a burden on the compliant, and the consequences may not have been fully worked out.  Regarding enforcement for companies that are based abroad and are incorporated and resident abroad, how will the enforcement work its way through?</p></speech>

I pointed out to the Minister on budget day that he had left a glaring hole in the technical framework of the budget by allowing company structure to be used as a mechanism to avoid paying stamp duty.  The expected revenue from stamp duty is a considerable complication in his budget arithmetic in a situation where he was under heavy pressure to spend more than seemed to be available at the time.  I welcome his quick response to address what was, during the last boom, one of the worst and most widely practised instances of tax avoidance and abuse in this city and across the State.  This was a notorious loophole that, prior to the cash, cost the Exchequer tens of millions of euro.  I do not know whether Revenue carried out an examination of the total cost to the State from this fairly standard mechanism of avoidance, but it was certainly considerable.</p>  <p>  I accept that the intent by the Minister in this recommendation is to close off that particular loophole.  However, in regard to the valuation of shares versus the underlying valuation of a property, as set out in the recommendation, is the Minister satisfied that the real market value at which the property is being sold for stamp duty purposes is, in fact, reflected in the value of the consequential share deal?  Has that potential disparity been accounted for in drawing up this provision?  In other words, as it is a transfer of share, it is possible to vary the price of the shares downwards while the property value is up there, which amounts to an avoidance mechanism.</p>  <p>  Another issue I raised on budget day is the resting of contracts.  Solicitors and others would argue that this is a feature of the property business.  However, at the height of the last boom, it allowed transactions to drag on for years and was effectively a mechanism for property owners, by failing to conclude a deal, to avoid stamp duty.  In some cases, a licence to develop the land and enter in on the land was given but the property was not actually transferred.  We saw examples of this practice in my constituency and the Minister's constituency when the Department of Education and Skills acquired school sites at extraordinarily high prices.  Developers engaged in lengthy delays while, one presumes, they got technical, accounting and legal advice on this particular practice.  There was a delay while they set up the arrangement and although they subsequently gave a licence to develop, very often the actual ownership of the site was delayed for a further extended period.  I am not clear whether it would require amendment in law to address this issue or, rather, regulation by the Revenue Commissioners such that they would examine the reality of these types of transactions.  Any site or property bought for development might be subject to this licensing system rather than there being an actual transfer of the land.</p>  <p>  A report published yesterday by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated clearly that the economy is heading into another bubble, particularly in respect of land and house prices.  There is no doubt about that.  As such, although it is not part of the current discussion, we must find a mechanism to reduce bubble prices, especially in the case of house prices and assets being purchased in developing areas for community purposes.  Otherwise, the State will be taken to the cleaners or forced to abandon the acquisition of essential sites, including for nursing homes, schools, community centres and sports facilities.  The Department, the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners must be alert to that danger in view of the ESRI report.  The evidence is there that we are at the beginning of, if not already in, a property bubble.  Certainly, site prices are rising at an extraordinary rate.  If we look back to the detailed reports on what caused the last crash, one of the trigger factors was the bubble in development land prices.  There is a risk that developers will seek to get back every halfpenny they lost in the crash, and will do so at the collective expense of taxpayers.</p></speech>

Will the Minister clarify whether any companies have got away with exploiting this loophole since the budget and, if so, what type of moneys are involved?</p>  <p>  The last time we discussed stamp duty with the Minister in the House, I asked several questions that were not answered.  My concern relates to the situation of people who paid a deposit on a site earlier this year but have since encountered legal difficulties that delayed the process.  We are in muddy waters here and the responses we are getting from the Department do not shed any light.  I understand that in the case of one-off sites, there are problems that can arise compared with the situation regarding housing developments.  People who paid a deposit on land before last March but subsequently came up against legal problems - where, for example, somebody has died - which required getting paperwork right and working matters through with the State, appear to be getting sucked into the efforts to crack down on stamp duty loopholes.  Will the Minister clarify the status of people in those circumstances?  We cannot have a situation where companies are getting away with not paying duty while a small farmer who buys a few acres of land is treated differently.</p><p> A relevant question was also asked about double taxation.  If the tax is being paid in another country, is it double taxation?  If Ireland has an agreement or arrangement on that, what way is it?  In fairness to Deputy Doherty, much of the budget is built on the &euro;376 million to be provided by this measure, which may not turn out to be as good as the Government expects.  I am aware from speaking to auctioneers that there is a lull in land.  Some people, unfortunately, cannot get the extra money that is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.658" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300062#PPP00200"><p>I thank the Department officials for spotting this.  There was much debate and many amendments in the Chamber from Deputies Fitzmaurice and Michael McGrath and myself about the whole stamp duty issue in respect of land and property.  I have dealt with those real estate investment trusts, REITs and such operations.  I said at the time that they were Ponzi schemes.  We had huge opportunities to bring in some much-needed revenue from these faceless institutions, and we should have done that.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that the Seanad was not disbanded when some in the Minister's party tried to disband it, or else this amendment would not be back before the House tonight.  The legislation would have been gone on out away from here.  I salute whoever it was who spotted this in order that we can block the loophole.  It could have cost the State a lot of money.  We see how ordinary taxpayers are penalised and put through the mill and scrutinised.  We see how women were supposed to leave the Civil Service when they married.  Those women are being treated horribly by the State.  It is totally inequitable, yet the Government speaks of equality.  We have not even got the money to start there.  It is vital that there is a sense of fair play.  We must be more watchful and have more eagle eyes in this regard.  It may mean hiring more staff into the Department with expertise in this area - expertise that I and many Deputies here do not have - to watch for this kind of scheme or anomaly where people can get out under the gap and go away laughing.  We, along with Revenue and our Department officials, need to be as creative and as diligent at watching those and blocking those loopholes as quickly as possible.  The Taoiseach at the time said he got a wallop when the people rejected the proposal to get rid of the Seanad.  I am glad the people did not get rid of it because the Seanad, as well as this House, has an opportunity to scrutinise legislation.  It is similar to the referendum to give more power to Oireachtas committees.  I am glad that the people also saw that proposal for what it was.  It is fortuitous that this amendment is back before the House tonight and we can have a short debate on it.</p></speech>

I am glad of the opportunity to address this very important issue.  Budgets can often throw up issues that cause confusion and uncertainty in the markets.  There was a lot of concern about stamp duty on land transfers.  Deputies were inundated with questions and when we asked questions in the D&aacute;il, there seemed to be a degree of uncertainty as to the implication of the measure, especially in cases where there might be complexity in the deal itself, as Deputy Fitzmaurice has pointed out.  This caused further confusion.  I am glad of any clarity that can be brought to the situation.  People had deals that were put on hold and they were going from solicitors to accountants and back to their clients.  They were also going to politicians to seek clarification.  It caused awful confusion.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath never ceases to amaze me.  He is obviously a very seasoned, experienced and wise politician and he has made a terribly important point in this whole debate.  Consider what would happen if the geniuses who thought it was a good idea to abolish our town councils had gotten away with their genius idea to abolish the Seanad, which was like a race to the bottom.  What were they really trying to achieve?  I would seriously question the political judgment of those who supported that move at the time.  Any politician who had thought it a good idea to abolish town councils and then thought it was a good idea to abolish the Seanad certainly was going on some other motive.  It was not for the greater good of the people on this island. We need political representation-----</p></speech>

My point is about political scrutiny.  It is very important that we have accountability and scrutiny.  This is why we needed clarification, especially on the whole issue of land transfers on deals that were in process which were held up because of the uncertainty after the budget.  At all times political accountability and political scrutiny is of great importance.  That is what politicians are there to do, to represent the people who elect them.

I will address each in turn, and I will begin with Deputy Doherty's comments.  I take his point about the stage of the process at which we are introducing the amendment.  It is a fair point.  On Committee Stage I had indicated that a further measure would be necessary.  It took my Department some time to make sure we could bring in an amendment we believed would be adequate to deal with a potential vulnerability that could lead to tax avoidance.  On Committee Stage I said that I would come back to do this, which I have done.  Clearly, in the future if we are in a position to deal with this matter on Committee Stage, that is what we would want to do.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's comment on the yield, we have exchanged views on this on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.  Early indications on transactions that have taken place since budget day are that the 6% rate has not deterred or significantly affected the number or value of transactions.  We continue to believe that the yield estimate for this measure in 2018 will be delivered.  The overall additional yield, however, to be delivered by this measure is a very small percentage of the total tax take we expect to collect next year.  There are other reasons for implementing this measure, especially indicating very clearly that we should move into a place where, if we change a rate to stimulate a part of the economy and the part of the economy recovers, we should then be willing to review what that rate should be.  A figure of 2% is unsustainably low given that for most of our recent history that rate was at 9% and then moved to 6%.</p>  <p>  I am glad that the note we shared was of help to colleagues and it is hoped it will play a role in facilitating the passage of this message here tonight.  I heard the views of Deputies about the role of notes such as this into the future.</p>  <p>  On Deputy McGrath's questions around double taxation agreements, he is correct.  We have one stamp duty double tax agreement with the UK.  Other than that particular agreement, stamp duty is outside Ireland's double tax agreements.  Do we think this will yield a risk of double taxation?  It is our view that it will not because stamp duty is a jurisdictional tax.</p><p>In other words, tax is levied where the transaction takes place.  The Deputy is correct in saying that we only have a single double taxation agreement.</p> <p> On possible compliance difficulties that might be caused as a result, this regime will apply to companies or funds located outside Ireland but where the property transaction takes place in Ireland.  We do not believe that any compliance costs will be incurred by virtue of obeying this change in our law.</p> <p> Deputy Burton referred to how, when changes in price levels are apparent, that the taxation regime should reflect that.  I agree with her entirely which is why I believe this is the correct measure.  It will deliver the yield I mentioned and it is the right measure to take because of the price levels we are now seeing in the economy for commercial property.  On Deputy Burton's question about the resting issue, I am told the legislation which deals with this is the Finance Act 2013.  My understanding is that the correct legal provisions are in place to deal with this matter but if the Deputy has any concerns on its implementation she should let me know and either myself or the Revenue Commissioners will respond.</p> <p> Deputy Fitzmaurice and another Deputy asked if we believe that in the period between the stamp duty measure being implemented and my bringing this measure to the Oireachtas this evening we might have lost tax and if we believe any companies might have taken advantage of that period.  The answer is "No" because if one looks at the length of time that has elapsed between the change on budget night and where we are now, that period was not sufficiently long to facilitate the setting up of any entities that could have led to the avoidance of the 6% rate.  We do not believe that any tax has been lost due to the time which has elapsed but we believe that if we had not introduced this measure, we could see entities being formed that would lead to the avoidance of the 6% rate which is why we are making this change.  In terms of clarity regarding transitional periods, it was, by and large, the point when a contract was signed.  If a contract was signed before this measure was implemented, it is liable to the lower tax rate.  If the contract was not signed, it is liable to the higher rate of 6%.  The Revenue Commissioners published a note on this on its website and I can have it passed on to Deputies Fitzmaurice and Mattie McGrath, if it would be helpful.</p> <p> On the points made by Deputy Mattie McGrath, it is in recognition of the danger of loopholes and vulnerabilities that we are making this change.</p> <p> In regard to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I will leave a debate on the merits or demerits of Seanad abolition to another day.  Suffice to say, it is still there. I said that when I was in the D&aacute;il, we would return to this.  While the Seanad has much wisdom and many virtues, we said it was an issue we would come back to but I thank the Deputy for his contribution.</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice and I tabled an amendment on budget night and appealed to the Minister and to other parties on behalf of small businesses, shop keepers and whatever.  We talk about the rejuvenation of rural Ireland and of towns and villages but Deputy Fitzmaurice and I were approached by people who had been caught in the middle of a transaction.  These were people who had gone to the bank and had borrowed as much as they could or people who perhaps had support from family members because the business was so weak and insecure, they would not get the loan from the bank.  These people were extended beyond their limits.  How are these people going to find the 4% extra for this 6% rate?  They cannot.</p>  <p>  We appealed to the Minister to give these people some window of opportunity that would allow them to conclude their deal and leave the rate increase to 1 January 2018, which we are nearing.  People have approached me who had done deals and had, as I said that night, spit on the hand and shook hands but there was delay with the accountants, tax clearance or solicitors, who as we know, are often not very fast in their work, and they did not have their paper work ready with all their ducks in a row and everything done.  These people were caught by that and it places a very onerous burden on people with young families looking to buy premises, especially shops that might have closed or that are going to close, filling stations or other businesses that pay rates, wages, tax, light and heat and keep a village alive.  That is the difference.  We wanted that window of opportunity and I was very disappointed - Deputy Fitzmaurice can speak for himself - that the Minister did not provide that window.</p>  <p>  Compare that to this loophole lying open for the big fellas to exploit again.  The Minister tells us that no revenue was lost but can he give us proof of that at the year's end?  There are other documents which the Minster promised us.  We are not in favour of the big people but are trying to look after the little people and their transactions.  These people are also in the Acting Chairman's constituency.  He has just looked at me as though he was in an awful hurry.  I know there are Christmas parties on tonight but there is time enough for the parties.</p></speech>

Some may also have had some money from the credit union thrown in.  We are not talking about the Four Roads to Glenamaddy, like the former Taoiseach announced in Edgeworthstown one morning.  He did not know which road to travel, but whatever one he went on it had bigger potholes than the last one.  It was only a Ponzi scheme.  It would not give a euro for any community or private projects that wanted it.  We want to support those people.  I am very annoyed that the Minister would not provide this window until 1 January.  I do not know where the solicitors were, they might have been on holiday or whatever, but there are many reasons things are delayed.

I am not happy with the answers that I have received from the Department on different cases.  I asked one specific question.  Last March a person bought land and put down the deposit.  There were legal issues.  The deal was done.  The solicitor who was dealing with the other side - for the person who died - had to bring affairs up to date.  We are talking about a person who bought land in March, paid the deposit and now does not know if they will have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty.  We have tried to get clarification on this, along with other scenarios, but we are not getting the clarification we need.  I want to know the answer, especially for those with small farms for whom it is costing a lot of extra money.  Some &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 might not be much to a big company but it is a considerable sum for a small family farm, for instance.  This is our big problem.  We cannot say "Yea" or "Nay".  One would not know what to make of the material that was given to us.  Is the response "Yes" or "No"?  Something must be done to clarify the matter in cases where someone had paid the deposit.</p><p>There was a legal issue on the seller's side to be tidied up, but they had it done in good faith six months before the budget.  It was not done on the last day or at the last minute.</p> <p> The Minister has told Deputy Mattie McGrath that there are other countries with which we do not have agreements.  What is the payment system for these countries?  Is it a double payment system?  The Minister needs to clarify the matter for those companies that are based in Ireland or that come here.  He told Deputy Mattie McGrath and me, when we asked about stamp duty at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that when the Finance Bill 2017 was being brought to a conclusion, he would deal with the issue.   </p> <p> The vulture funds are rampant.  I know of someone who is paying what is owed in two tranches over a year.  The vulture fund is looking for 10% interest and wants costs on top.  That is skulduggery.  The vulture funds are not accountable and we cannot rein them in.  It seems the Government does not want to do anything about these scumbags as there is no talking to them.  It is not the same as owning a house worth &euro;130,000 and owing &euro;200,000.  Then the person is on the pig's back because they have to take it.  They are ruthless when there is land that could be an asset and they do not give a damn about a Deputy or anyone else ringing them.  I spent a few hours recently with a person who was in a bad state.  He is going the full distance and paying every penny because the vulture fund refused five offers.  People are helpless.  This is a wound starting to fester because they are coming after people, and as politicians, we have done nothing to try to help them.  The vulture funds have bought loans at 30% and 40% of their value.  We have sold the country to foreigners who are now selling it back to us and on every euro they want to make two or three.  It is vexing.  </p> <p> I was told that the vulture funds Promontoria and Capita were in and out of the Department of Finance regularly.  Will the Minister confirm if that is case?  No one is reining them in, as I was told by a member of the Minister's party.  He needs to know what these scumbags are doing around the country.  The young guns in fancy offices do not give a damn about the people we are trying to represent and perhaps save a life, a family and a farm.  It is not big money.  I am talking about people who owe between &euro;40,000 and &euro;170,000 or &euro;180,000, and &euro;300,000 is the most.  It is not digital money.  I offered &euro;24,000 on a &euro;40,000 debt and kept making proposals, but the vulture fund continued to refuse.  The person in question is going to sell stock; the family are going to help them to pay the full amount, but the vulture fund has refused, stating it wants costs and 10% interest because I proposed paying one part in March and the second the following March.  I have it in black and white in an email.  That is the only way I can work to save a family being abroad on the side of the road. </p></speech>

We talk to the subbie they have hired called Capita or a new name.  They change their companies regularly.  The Minister needs to forget about politics.  We are talking about human beings all around Ireland.  They are Irish people whom the foreign companies have bought.  There might be 30 or 40 companies, for example, all of the Promontorias, Aran and so on, as well as Cerberus.  There is one thing behind them: torture for families in this country, which is unacceptable, but we can do nothing about them because there are no regulations for them.  It is bad enough that someone is going to pay for what he or she bought and that they will make 60% on it.  If they bought a farm for &euro;15,000, they will get &euro;40,000 and want 10% interest and add costs.  They are looking for blood money.  This cannot continue.</p></speech>

They were paying back every penny they owed.  They got money from family and friends, but the vulture funds will not accept what they are giving them.  They will lose their home and business as a result.  It is very unfair.  As Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice said, they are Irish people.  They are our own who were hit by hard times, as they hit many others, as well as businesses.  Now, after all the struggles, it looks as if the vulture funds have an idea that they will get double the amount somewhere else and do not want to give it back.  They bought it for only one third of what they are asking for now and are still not happy with what they are getting.  They want to suck the last drop of blood out of the poor people concerned.</p>  <p>  In respect of the window of opportunity on stamp duty, I will give the Minister a case in point.  A farmer had to purchase the place alongside his land.  It came up for sale when he least expected it.  As this only happens once in a lifetime, he did the deal before the Minister announced the changes to stamp duty rates.  It has meant an extra cost of &euro;22,000 for him.  He had borrowed to the hilt and got money from family and friends to make up the cost.  He was not prepared to purchase this place, but it came up for sale.  Every farmer has been taught that he or she must expand to survive.  This go-ahead man in his 40s has to pay the extra stamp duty.  It is not fair.</p>  <p>  It is the same for another person who bought a business and is being hit with extra stamp duty which they did not bargain on.  It is very unfair that some time was not given.  It is grand to say the deal was done between the purchaser and the vendor, but solicitors and auctioneers take time.  It was not the fault of the purchaser, the poor farmer.  He is now caught in a trap and not sure if he can make up the difference in the money required because the extra stamp duty will have to be paid.  I am sorry that there is not a window of opportunity to help him.   I have met many people who are in that situation, but they are the two I can remember clearly.</p></speech>

First, in relation to the timing and as I have said on a number of occasions during the passage of the Bill, if the binding contract was entered into or signed prior to budget day and a conveyance is executed before the end of the year, the rate is 2%.  Otherwise, it is 6%.  We made that clear in the immediate aftermath of the budget.  As to whether I am meeting the so-called vulture funds or companies named by Deputy Fitzmaurice, the answer is "No, I am not".  On the question that was put to me for a window of opportunity, if I did what Deputy Mattie McGrath suggests, I would create a window of opportunity for tax avoidance.  The whole purpose of the measure and what we are trying to do is to shut down an opportunity for tax avoidance.</p></speech>

I was talking about small business people and the Minister came back to say he was blocking a loophole.  This loophole is completely different.  What I was looking for related to small businesses and transactions involving families or the private entrepreneurs we badly need to keep in our rural towns and villages.  By rural towns and villages, I mean places in Kildare too.  Deputy Healy-Rae said earlier that Kildare was not in rural Ireland, but there are many villages and small towns in Kildare which are desolate and, as such, it is.  I was not looking for loopholes like this to be maintained; far from it.  That is why I say, if the Minister is not misleading me, that he is being disingenuous.  That is what I want and it is what Deputy Fitzmaurice wanted that night.  We appealed to the Minister and put down an amendment which was voted on to give people until 1 January, which is only around the corner, to get their affairs in order, wake up their solicitors and accountants and get their tax certificates, the rest of the money and the deal over the line.  Those are people who had deals done.  They had spit on their palms, shaken hands and agreed and gathered up the money.  That is what I was talking about.  I am in favour of all the multinationals and big institutions being prevented from taking advantage of any loophole they see.  They are like seagulls landing in the yard when they see one.  They would take the false teeth out of one's mouth if one were not careful.</p>  <p>  The vulture funds were going in and they had too much access to Government.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is 100% right on that.  I raised an issue with the T&aacute;naiste last week about a farmer in north Cork and I handed him details on that today.  An honest, hard-working family man is trying to do deals with a bank that has dragged him through the courts for two or three years while I and other intermediaries and financial agents have tried to intervene.  They will not talk to anyone and just keep going to court because they smell the fact that land prices are rising and that this man has some.  To hell with his family and his business; all they want is a pound of flesh.  It is not a pound of flesh at all; it is a stone of flesh.  As Deputy Healy-Rae said, they want to suck the life out of these families who are being terrorised.  They do not get much solace in the Four Courts either.  This is happening at enormous expense.  They want interest and costs, which are enormous for the high-fliers they have engaged.  One never meets a person one can do a deal with.  AIB is one of the worst culprits and will not engage with customers.  It is the job of the Minister for Finance to ensure they engage and talk.  These are our own people being marauded and plundered.  I hate to call them "foreigners" but they are outside-of-State vulture funds and they have no interest.  We have a few of our own vulture funds which have grown up in our own country.</p></speech>

The first correction is to the reference in the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992 which inadvertently referred to the Act of 1991, which does not exist.  I, therefore, request that the reference on page 60, line 12 be changed to read "the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992."  The second correction is the definition of units in section 62, which is on the cream list of amendments made in the House that is before this House today.  The definition refers to section 88(1)(a) of the Act of 1997.  This is the incorrect reference and I want to remove the reference to the Act of 1997 as the definition should refer to the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999.</p></speech>

It is important legislation.  Over recent years, we have witnessed so much destruction of cultural property due to conflict throughout the world.  In particular, the destruction in Syria was the catalyst for ensuring that the international community acts as constructively as possible and collectively to deal with such blatant violations as have occurred over recent years and during previous years.  I think the convention was set up following the destruction of the Second World War.  Recent years have shown us very clearly the need for that convention to be ratified by all countries.  Up until recently, something like 69 countries had ratified it.  We sincerely hope it will go some small way towards protecting what is the culture and history of many countries and regions.</p></speech>

I have seen at first hand through visiting the Middle East the destruction of cultural property such as all kinds of churches and mosques.  I am not speaking on behalf of any religion.</p><p>The sad part about the conflict in the Middle East is that under the so-called dictators, such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, people were allowed to practise different religions with impunity, including Christian and different Muslim sects such as Sunni Islam.  Now there is rape and plunder of all those sacred buildings and the destruction has resulted in an awful loss of treasure to the world.  The legislation is necessary and timely.  </p></speech>

As soon as a person is in shape enough to sign his or her name if he or she has VHI or other health insurance, the health insurance company will charge over &euro;800 a night for the same bed for the same patient.  That is what is driving up the cost of health insurance.  It has been highlighted to me several times.  If a person does not have health insurance, the cost is &euro;75 per night but the very minute a staff member goes into the room and gets the person to sign that he or she has health insurance, the health insurance company charges over &euro;800.  That is totally unfair and is driving up the cost of health insurance for ordinary people.  It is unfair.  It is daylight robbery.  If the same bed only costs &euro;75 in one instance, how is it fair that &euro;800 is being charged for it?  I want that looked into and dealt with because it has the country and the people who are paying for health insurance robbed.  If their income allows, most people will pay for health insurance.  It is going beyond their reach now because what is happening is totally unfair.  The HSE has ordered it.  There are five Ministers and Ministers of State in the Department of Health.  I have highlighted this anomaly before.  I want it dealt with because it has wrecked private health insurance for all those who try to access it.  It is totally unfair.</p></speech>

I know it is not relevant but I want to take the opportunity to thank the Minister of State for the way he received the deputation and the interest and compassion he showed.  I welcome his commitment to come and visit to see if we can rectify the situation and address the lack of mental health services in Tipperary.</p><p>I asked this question the last time we debated the Bill and the amendments to it.  I asked about the situation when a person is brought into hospital after an accident or when a person has developed pneumonia.  In such a situation, people, especially older people, are very vulnerable and can be on trolleys.  I jumped out of my seat the last time to demonstrate patients on trolleys with nurse managers shoving a form under them.  I will not perform the same theatrics tonight.  The Minister shook his head and said it is not happening but it is a widespread practice in public hospitals.  Patients go in as a public patients.  They are very sick, perhaps not fully <i>compos mentis</i>if they are very sick or have a fever, and are asked to sign a form.  They would sign anything at such a time to get some pain relief and treatment or to try to get into a bed.  They sign the form.  It is not right.  It is a shoddy and slippery practice.  We would not do it in a normal business.  We would not sign something without reading it.  Sometimes we do but we should not.  We are not allowed to read the form and then we are fleeced.  One might be on a trolley for three nights, which happens regularly in my hospital in Clonmel, and in the mid-west and Limerick.  A family could stay in the Gresham for the same amount people are charged for one night in hospital.  It is &euro;800 and they are on a trolley with no sleep.  When a person is on a trolley there is no space and it is normally in a corridor.  There is noise from machines and the traffic up and down of trolleys and nurses and doctors doing their jobs.  There is also the noise of other admissions during the night.  I would call it emotional terrorism.  </p><p>Mr. O'Brien, the CEO of the HSE recently called people concerned about vaccines for children emotional terrorists.  I am not commenting on the rights or wrongs of the vaccine.  The emotional terrorism is taking place in emergency departments and on trolleys.  There are vending machines running in the corridors.  I have been in the hospital.  Most of the time they do not have blankets or pillows and their families have to bring them in with them and neither do they have access to the equipment in the ward, such as drips.  There is no space in my hospital in Clonmel in a narrow corridor.  In a new hospital it is different.  If a nurse or doctor is attending to a person on a trolley, nobody else can pass because there is not enough space.  It is a fire hazard.  I had occasion to call in the fire officer twice a couple of years ago such was the concern.  It is a degradation and apart from the money issue, the treatment of patients is like emotional terrorism.  One hears lack of sleep cited in the description of war crimes.  We hear about people not being allowed to sleep because of noise and being interrupted but this is happening in hospitals.I am not blaming the nurses, doctors or attendants in the emergency departments.  They are only doing their best.  They do not have the space, facilities, equipment or wherewithal to deal with this issue.  </p><p>Discharges are another problem.  We are heading into Christmas now.  I said this the last time.  Most of those who work in hospitals, including those who work in backup administration will go off next Friday week or earlier.  They will be at parties two nights that week and there will be no admissions organised until 5 January.  There will be bedlam before we come back here whatever day we come back, whether it is 15 January or 18 January.  It happens every year.  As soon as Christmas Day comes it will happen because there will be no administration staff working, no discharges and no proper structure.  Why can a skeleton staff not work over Christmas and organise things?  It happens in every hospital in the country.  It would not happen in the Mater Private or another private hospital.  It would not happen in any of our businesses because we could not afford it.  We would be out of business.  </p><p>If the shopkeeper did not have milk and other products for the people to get messages the day after St. Stephen's Day, St. Stephen's Day or sometimes even on Christmas day now, they would not survive.  There is disorganised chaos in the hospitals and it should be dealt with.  They have the planning done for the Christmas week and most people are off.  In America Christmas, Day is all people get off.  Why do these staff in our hospitals have to be off for two weeks at Christmas?  Consultants have already taken holidays and there are no rosters or anything organised.  We are losing huge capacity.  That is why when the surveys are done equipment, such CT scanners and so on, are at only 46% capacity usage.</p> <p> We need more functionality and more output.  We need more planning in these public hospitals.  I am not blaming all the staff, but senior management and line management have to take responsibility.  This happens in every hospital, as the Minister of State knows.  There will be a skeleton staff and the rest are not back until 2 or 3 January.  They then must start writing out to outpatients to come in again.  They have to start the whole machine again.  It is as if they let the furnace go down and it needs to be built up again slowly to get the whole thing going.  It should not be happening but it happens every year.</p> <p> To go back to health insurance, people and families are paying exorbitant prices for health insurance.  I have a large family.  We have moved our health insurance to different companies a couple of times.  People get less and less cover for more and more money.  C&aacute; bhfuil an regulator?  He or she is supposed to be doing a job, but that is not the case.  We have regulators for everything in this country but the majority are not regulating anything - across the cement industry, across competition laws, everything.  It is all regulators and no one being regulated.  They and their staff are getting paid; why are they not looking at this insurance racket?  If it looks like a racket, it is a racket.</p> <p> People are put to the pin of their collars trying to pay insurance and then if they do not have this insurance they cannot get access to private treatment.  When they have it and go into a public hospital, they are sleeping on trolleys and being charged exorbitant rates.  A big family could stay in two or three rooms in the Shelbourne hotel for the price they pay to be stuck on a trolley in a hospital corridor.  It is unacceptable and it goes on year-in year-out.  Who will call a halt to it?  When will it be halted?  I  ask the Minister of State for answers.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for coming to Kerry recently to open an excellent new mental health facility in Deer Park Lodge in Killarney.  I wish the management, staff and patients well in what the Minister of State said is an excellent modern facility fit for purpose for many decades into the future where people can live in the dignity they richly deserve.  I thank him for coming to open that facility.  He was very welcome.</p>  <p>  The cost of health insurance is a major bill in the lives of individuals, elderly and families who are struggling but they pay it diligently to do their duty of taking care of their own health needs.  However, as has been highlighted here there is a complete anomaly in how the HSE structures its charges.  First, we have the issue of people, as soon as they get a bed in a hospital, being asked to sign up to the fair deal.  Second, they are asked about their private health insurance.  If they say they have that, it is just like adding on more noughts and instead of &euro;100, the bill could be &euro;1,000.  It just does not make sense.</p>  <p>  Somebody in the HSE has to tackle this.  The pricing structure and what is charged for private versus public has to be looked at.  I do not want to say anything that is wrong and I seek your direction in this regard, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The changes made in the costs border on being criminal.  How can the same bed be as little as &euro;75 and then all of a sudden be as high as &euro;800?  Surely there is something seriously wrong with that.  If someone buys an item in a shop and it is priced at &euro;4.99, it cannot change to &euro;499 for someone else.  That cannot happen.  These people are purchasing their health care.  They are purchasing the right to stay in a bed or have a room in a hospital.  If the charge is &euro;75, how can it change just because it is on the insurance and one of the health insurance companies is footing the bill?  What is happening is outrageous.</p>  <p>  I have raised this through parliamentary questions over the years.  I have highlighted it here in the D&aacute;il previously.  I am not pointing my finger at the Minister of State or at any one in particular.  However, the HSE should be made answer as to who decides the price structure can change so much just because it is covered by private health insurance.  If the private health insurance providers are to be charged an enormous amount of money, they have to shove it on at the other end to their customers.</p>  <p>  These are the people we are here to stand up for, to talk for and to highlight their concerns.  We have young struggling families who are trying to pay their mortgages, to pay for child care and  pay for their health care.  They are worried about their health care.  If a child falls and breaks an arm or has a sporting injury, they want that child to be on their health cover.  They are paying through the nose for it and they are paying more than they should be paying simply because of the enormous costs being put on at the other side.</p>  <p>  I would like this to be examined with a view to bringing normality to the charging structures in our hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-12-13a.771" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="21:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300069#WWW00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  For people who have health insurance, we hear on a regular basis that there is a threshold of &euro;100 or &euro;150 and after that the health insurance kicks in.  When they arrive in a hospital they are asked to sign a form.  The reasoning behind this needs to be looked at, even though it might be good for the person going into the hospital.  There might be a lot of people in a public ward and they might be charged for semi-private or private.  If we heard two or three people saying it, we might not take notice, but a good few people have been speaking about this.</p>  <p>  On risk equalisation, some people have gone to different companies.  People are moving from VHI to Laya and to all the other providers.  Will this continue?  We need health insurance for elderly people.  With demographic changes in a few years' time, a large percentage of our people will be over 60.  Risk equalisation obviously increases the price of health insurance cover.</p><p>During the recession people walked away from health insurance for a while but it is welcome to see them take it out again.  We looked at the situation in the United States at one time and what people were paying for health insurance in that country was phenomenal.  For what one would call average, not gold star, cover here families are paying exorbitant fees.  When does the Minister of State believe the cost of health insurance will settle because if it continues to increase at the current rate, it will be out of the reach of many people.  Unfortunately, a large number of people gave up their health insurance.  Some have taken it up again but I am worried that there are people who are chancing it in that they do not have health insurance and are not entitled to a medical card.  If something goes wrong with their health and they have to remain in hospital for a while, they would not be fit to pay some of the cost.  The first thing hospitals get people to do when they are admitted is sign a form.  As rightly explained earlier, one is vulnerable when being admitted to hospital.  One is not running around the place when one goes in the door of a hospital.  There is a bit of panic.  It might be difficult to get through the accident and emergency department but, in fairness, once one is admitted a great service is provided.  The problem is getting admitted.</p> <p> If someone who has health cover needs an operation they will be able to get it done fairly quickly.  I see that with people who need treatment for cataracts.  Another problem involves people who need scans.  I know of someone who had a medical card and was told that they would have to wait six months for a scan but if they paid for it they would be through the system in a week.  That is not the way to look after patients.</p> <p> I refer to some people with health cover who are admitted to a public hospital, perhaps on a trolley, but in terms of the rates they are charged, one would swear they were in the best hotel in the world.  Everyone will acknowledge that the doctors and nurses do great work.  However, in terms of these people who are paying health insurance, some hospitals - I cannot talk about every hospital - may be abusing the type of cover that allows them to get in more money.  They have to get what they are entitled to or whatever but some hospitals will do that.</p> <p> Another issue came up in the HSE west in the Saolta Hospital Group.  We were at a meeting in Galway and there appears to be a problem in drawing down money.  I believe approximately &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million was not recouped by the Saolta Hospital Group or it was finding it difficult to recoup it.  The financial controller said it does not write that off but goes after it.  However, it seems to be struggling to get it.  Is it the case that people are paying health insurance but there is then a big battle between the health insurance companies and the hospitals to cover their bills?  Some of the prices charged for a night in a hospital for a minor operation are phenomenal.  Is there any adjudication body, similar to the Taxing Master in the Four Courts, that examines that because the costs seem to be only going up?  If that continues, health insurance will be out of the reach of most people because many people currently struggle to pay it.  We need to be mindful of that and keep an eye on it to make sure that the problems and abuses we hear from people are addressed.</p></speech>

The Minister is pleased that this year it has been possible to maintain the main stamp duty at the existing level.  In addition, the stamp duty for non-advanced contracts is being reduced by 20%.</p>  <p>  The Bill also makes a number of changes to the lifetime community rating scheme in operation in the health insurance market which was introduced in 2015 to encourage people to take out insurance at younger ages.</p>  <p>  Many of the questions asked of me were outside the scope of the Bill.  The Bill does not purport to deal with the issues the Deputies raised.  The two-tier health system and the challenges in the health system are beyond the scope of this Bill and this debate.</p>  <p>  To answer the questions on health insurance, the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was brought in to rectify the situation where some private work was being paid for out of the public purse.  That is the reason for the forms that somebody said were being waved in front of patients.  The private insurance patient, PIP, forms were introduced at the request of the health insurers.  That came in as a result of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, which prohibits funding from the public sector going towards the private sector.</p>  <p>  The last point I would like to make is on the difference between &euro;75 and &euro;800.  Obviously, no bed in a hospital staffed by nurses and doctors cost &euro;75.  The public purse pays for that and the &euro;800 is what the health insurer has to pay for it.  That is that anomaly.</p></speech>

I am very sorry for them.  Many friends of mine lost their lives or were seriously injured in different types of accidents on our roads.  I was with a very close friend of mine the day he died.  Myself and my father were with him earlier that morning.  I was to meet him again that evening but, unfortunately, I never got to meet him again because he passed away in a tragic accident.  I know at first hand what it is like to lose people we care about on our roads.  I want to acknowledge that and put it on the record of the House.</p>  <p>  I want to address the Bill the Minister has brought before the House.  As he is well aware, I oppose the Bill and I will elaborate on the reason.</p><p>I want to remind the Minister of a way of life.  The way of life that I grew up with could be said to have been different from what people have today, but it certainly was not a bad way of life.  I believe that the people who were there at that time were very sound, very good, hard-working and nice, honest-to-God people.  This has nothing to do with people drinking or drinking to excess or anything like that.  It is the complete and absolute opposite.  In the parish I grew up in, at one time virtually every person was a milk supplier.  They went to the creamery.  At that time a lot of milking was done by hand, and perhaps people who were a bit more advanced had milking machines.  The people would do a bit of shopping after going to the creamery.  There was no such thing as tanks or lorries coming into the yard to take the milk away.  People had to carry the milk.  One of the things that might have happened on the way home was a trip to the local pub - pubs were open during the day at that time - and having a drink.  There was nothing wrong with it.  It was a sociable outlet.  It involved meeting people.  It had nothing to do with anybody drinking to excess.</p> <p> Over the years there have been changes.  The Minister knows that the Department of Health's slogan was "Two will do".  That was the limit at the time.  The Department was encouraging people back then, telling them that if they were going to have a drink then two drinks was enough.  We have to compare like with like.  The areas that I am talking about and the places that I represent do not have the public transport systems we have in Dublin.  If we go down the street, which was a road before, we can get on the Luas.  There are many excellent facilities here in this town.  What about the places that I represent?  What about the people above in Glencar tonight, where there are two pubs and a small hotel?  What about places like the Black Valley, Lauragh, Tuosist, all around the Ring of Kerry, and down into Ballinskelligs, Portmagee, Valentia Island, Chapelstown and Knightstown?  These are all places which do not have public transport systems.</p> <p> I thank and acknowledge the service provided by the rural link bus.  There are great operators in County Kerry and we have excellent bus drivers, but it is a physical impossibility for those people to provide a service to all of the areas I am talking about.  The type of people I am here to talk for tonight are what I would call terrible sound people.  They are people who want to go out, socialise and interact with people.  Again, it has nothing to do with drinking or drinking to excess.  It is people going out to meet their friends and neighbours to discuss politics or the recent football or hurling game.  Unfortunately and sadly, we have lost many of these fine people over the years because they have become elderly and died, and we are very sorry to see them go.  In the parish that I come from there are people whom I grew up with who I adored, and they are gone to their eternal reward.</p> <p> It might be thought strange nowadays and there would probably be all types of objections if anyone was doing it, but I used to run from the national school to the public house that my brother now runs in an excellent fashion and that was started by my father and go in behind the counter and serve customers.  That was my job for a few hours every evening.  It was better than going to any university.  I did not get to go to university.  I listened to the people, however.  They were forestry workers who worked very hard in forestry at a time when terms and conditions were bad, when the amount of work they were doing was measured, and if they were short a few sods, or if their drains were short a few yards, their week's pay was cut.  There was wet time and dry time.  Their wages would be cut in wet time.  These people came into the pub in the evening.  It had nothing to do with drink.  They came in, perished with the cold.  Yes, they had a pint or two, then they went home and had their supper.  They were damn tired when they went home.  The next crowd to come in were the council workers.  There were many council workers at that time.  Unfortunately now we do not have any forestry men and very few council workers because almost everything has been privatised.  I learned an awful lot from those people.  They were fine, sensible people.  Yes, they liked going to the pub, but it was not necessarily anything to do with drink.</p> <p> The Minister might ask what point I am making and what my argument is against what he is proposing.  I am saying that the system that was in place was working perfectly well and did not need to be changed.  That is why I am opposing it, and I really believe that.</p> <p> I want to talk now about the very sensitive subject of deaths on our roads, and address the situation in the place I can talk best about, which is the county I represent.  Every person we lose on our roads, in my county or in any other part of the country, is to be deeply regretted.  Unfortunately, as recently as ten days ago, we had a very sad case in the parish of Glenflesk where, tragically, a lovely young lady lost her life on our roads.  However, it had nothing to do with the subject we are talking about here tonight.  Umpteen cyclists in the county that I represent have been killed on our roads.  Again, those deaths had nothing to do with alcohol.  There are other issues concerning road safety.  I have said this to the Minister in private and in public.  When the Minister looked at this issue, the big mistake he made was not looking at the range of reasons we are losing people on our roads.  In the past, the cars were completely different.  Nowadays cars have life-saving devices such as airbags and crumple zones, providing extra protection in the car.  People should not be dying in the way they are on our roads.  However, they are not necessarily dying in motorcars or drink related accidents.</p> <p> The Minister seems to think those deaths are more common than I believe them to be.  I believe that people are dying on our roads because more people are walking, running and cycling.  It is good that people are out doing exercise.  However, those things bring about a danger in their lives.  I believe the reason that so many cyclists and pedestrians, tragically, are being knocked down and killed is because of the fact that there are so many of them on our roads.  They are entitled to be on our roads.  I have a bicycle here myself.  I laugh when I think back on the first time I cycled here in Dublin.  I thought I would not be able at all because I got such a fright from the buses and the way they would pass so close.  The more cycle lanes we have for the safety of our cyclists, the better.  Every effort should be made to provide cycling lanes on every road that is realigned or that money is invested in.  There should be places where our pedestrians can be on our roads and be safe and out of harm's way.  It is an unfortunate risk that comes with so many people being on the road in that way.  Their lives are in danger, and again it has nothing to do with drink.</p> <p> I have tremendous respect for the publicans of Ireland.  I obviously have to declare my interest in that my brother owns and operates a pub, and I have an off-licence of my own.  I would far prefer the system of the public house as compared with the off-licence because the people behind public houses are responsible people.  Every publican I know is what I would call a responsible person.  I probably go into 40 or 50 pubs every months doing my clinics.</p><p>Every publican I know is the salt of the earth.  They are intelligent and respectable people.  In many instances, their pubs have been in the family for generations and they want to pass them on to the next generation with their good names and reputations intact, rightly so.  They pay their taxes and are fully compliant.  I like the system of the public house more than anything else because of the simple fact that there is a boss or a person in charge.  Whether it is the man or the woman of the house or an employee, he or she is in charge.   When I say he or she is in charge, I mean that he or she is entitled to refuse to serve a person a drink.  If the person in charge thinks someone has had enough to drink or is not behaving properly, he or she can say he or she is sorry but that he or she will not serve the person any more drink that night.  </p> <p> There is also the matter of measures. as surely the Minister has seen.  Many of the deaths and fights which occur happen at weekends, late at night, in many cases in private houses.  Why is that the case?  In many instances, it is because people drink to excess.  Why do they do this?  It is because they can pour from the bottle without using a measure.  When they are in a public house, they are given a measure of alcohol.  They cannot pour and drink to excess as they could in an uncontrolled environment.  That is why I want to express my support for publicans.</p> <p> I was very glad when the Minister went to County Kerry and met publicans there.  My only disappointment is that when they made a very good case to him on why what he was proposing to do was wrong and the gave the reasons they were against it, he, unfortunately, decided to keep going with the Bill, as he is perfectly entitled to do.  I would have preferred if he had listened more to the voice of publicans.  It is not a matter of a vested interest trying to look after itself, rather it is about a group of people who have provided a service during the years which they want to continue into the future.  </p> <p> Many of the public houses to which we used to travel in our run when I started to attend clinics many years ago with our late father, Jackie Healy Rae, have sadly closed and it is with great sadness that I have seen them close.  I do not want to start naming any of them, but I must name one - the Shebeen in Lauragh.  It was open for many years.  Unfortunately, circumstances change and the changes which have been made by Governments during the years have led to a situation where pubs such the Shebeen and many others have disappeared.  It is so sad to pass a place in which people once sang songs, played music and cards, came together to have debates about politics, football and life in general.  Again, they were all great people.  The doors are now closed and the lights have been turned off.  It is an attack on rural Ireland.</p> <p> The idea behind the Bill constitutes a provoked attack on rural Ireland.  It will further decimate communities.  I passionately believe this, which is why I wanted to have this opportunity.  I would have gone through steel and fire to come here to speak about this matter because I feel so strongly about it and I would not say it unless I truly believed it.  I say in a very special way to every publican in the country that Deputies will have an opportunity to either vote with the Minister or with the people of rural Ireland.  In the intervening period before votes are cast I ask publicans to ask their Deputies, of whatever party, if any, if they are for rural Ireland or the Minister's proposal.  It is as simple as that.  That is the divide and on what we will be asked to vote.  </p> <p> The Bill is a retrograde step and I truthfully do not believe it will lead to one life being saved.  I could talk about what I believe the Minister's motivations are for doing this.  He believes he will save lives, but he is wrong.  I am entitled to my opinion and he is entitled to his, but I truthfully believe he is not looking at the issue of road safety from an overall perspective.  He is just homing in on one single issue.  That is regrettable because there are so many other good things he could be doing in his Department.  He could save lives in so many other ways.  He should be asking why it is that many roads are so much better than they were in the past and why vehicles are so much better.  We have garda&iacute; who are doing their job to the very best of their ability.  I compliment them on the work they are doing, even though they are often criticised both inside and outside of this House.  </p> <p> Coming back to why we are debating the Bill, the Minister is focusing on the wrong issue.  The Bill is creating a cloud and people are misreading or exaggerating the contributory factor of drink in accidents.  That is wrong.  If there was a breakdown and in-depth study was carried out of the reasons people are dying on the roads, it would be found that people being over the limit was the least significant issue.  The people about whom we are talking are never involved in accidents.  They actually do not have accidents.  In the case of the public houses I know very closely and the publicans running them, there have never been situations where people left them and caused or been involved in any accident.  I could stand over this any day of the week.  Of course, we hear horror stories about people who drink to excess or take drugs and then get into a car and cause carnage or chaos.  These cases are highlighted on radio and in the media, but they are not the people about whom I am talking.  The people about whom I am talking are country people who go to a public house, have a drink or two and snail away home on country roads.  They are never involved in accidents or hurt anybody.  The Minister has to differentiate.  I know that he might say he cannot do so, but he can.  He can differentiate by abandoning this proposal which is wrong.  It is a retrograde step. </p> <p> When we were together during the 70 days in which the programme for Government was negotiated, it was stated all policies should be rural-proofed.  The Minister supported that suggestion at the time.  Any policy brought forward by the Government should be rural-proofed.  This Bill has not been rural-proofed.  If it had been, it would have been blown out of the window as being completely anti-rural and discriminatory against people living in country areas.  As I said, any person leaving the D&aacute;il Chamber tonight has many options.  There are taxis, buses and the Luas if one puts up one's hand.  What options do the people living in Glencar have to get home apart from their motor car?  That is it.  They cannot walk home as it would be too far and they would be in the height of danger.  I ask the Minister to take on board my views and those of the other like-minded people who have spoken and will speak about this issue.</p></speech>

Nearly every Member of this D&aacute;il does not condone it.  The laws in place should be strongly enforced by the Garda and the judicial system.  Of course,any death on the roads is one too many.  This point is particularly true when one considers the lives lost as a result of drink-driving.  The Minister was before the the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for days when it was considering the Bill.  I will read a section of its report: "Based on the evidence presented to date, some Members of the Joint Committee believe that the proposed amendment to the penalties applicable to drink driving could possibly be regarded as disproportionate," - the word "disproportionate" is very important - "particularly so in rural areas of the country where access to public transport services is limited."  That is one thing the Minister never took on board.  I am a rural Deputy and, as such, represent the people of rural Ireland.  This measure is disproportionate.  The laws in place until now, if implemented, were sufficient to stop anything from happening.</p><p> It is illegal to drink and drive under the current legislation.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced mandatory testing and supported legislation that decreased alcohol limits to among the lowest in Europe.  The Bill seeks to introduce an automatic three-month disqualification for those found driving with a blood alcohol level of 50 mg to 80 mg.  The offence is currently punishable with three penalty points, provided the offender is not a learner or professional driver and has not previously been found guilty of the offence within the preceding three years.  That covers a lot.  The Minister has portrayed the legislation as a catch-all Bill that will prevent more people from drinking and driving.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not condone drink-driving, as I said, nor are we prisoners to the Vintner's federation as the Minister wrongly alleged.  I refute that charge.  I speak for those in rural Ireland who I represent.  I refute that I am a spokesman for the Vintners Association, as if I were on its payroll.

Stronger enforcement of the existing laws is needed, along with ways to address all causes of road deaths.  That was highlighted by the "Prime Time" programme broadcast on RT&Eacute; last Monday night, which concluded that current legislation governing drink-driving is not consistently enforced.  It was worth watching and proved a point.  I happened to be at home to see it although I often miss such programmes.</p>  <p>  As regards social isolation in rural Ireland, the Government does not understand how rural Ireland operates nor the damage this legislation could do there.  The Minister is from Dublin and is urbanised and he does not understand what the Bill would mean for rural Ireland.  Deputies from rural constituencies have to listen to their constituents.  I do not condone drink-driving.  I have to keep saying that.  However, the proposals the Government is bringing forward in the Bill would make it impossible for people to go to a rural pub.  For many people, that is their only social outlet.  That is an important point.  Such people may have always gone to the pub as a social outlet on a Friday having travelled four or five miles down lanes from their homes in rural Ireland.  They may collect their pensions and do some shopping and the husband or wife may go in to have a drink, meet people and have a chat and then go home without doing any harm to anyone.  The rule that the Minister is trying to bring in will stop all of that.  Such people may have to get behind the wheel of a car to go to work the next morning but the new focus on testing in the morning time will make it impossible for anyone to do so.  Even if people do everything right, such as getting a taxi home if there is one available, and then try to go to work the morning after and the Garda has set up a checkpoint, they will be caught out.  That is another issue that is very important for rural Ireland.  It would be ideal if people in very remote parts of rural Ireland could rely on public transport to get to  work but they cannot.  People in rural Ireland cannot rely on the Luas, the DART, regular buses going by their door or even taxis in some cases.  Even in the bigger provincial towns around the country, if one is out late one must rely on a good taxi man to take one home without charging a fortune.  If the Government is serious about rural regeneration it will not enforce laws that will confine older people to their homes and put small rural pubs and bars out of business.  Such businesses are one of the few remaining employers of young people, who would also be driven out of rural communities if they could not work or socialise after 6 p.m.</p>  <p>  There are no proposals from Government about increasing the number of Garda checkpoints.  Given the recent breathalyser test debacle, of which all Members know, the public need to know that the Government is serious about Garda presence on our roads to prevent and detect drink-driving and decrease speeding.  I watched the debate on this issue  in the House yesterday morning and was shocked by issues read into the record by my colleague, Deputy Eugene Murphy.  He said that he came across a figure while researching the issue that showed that the number of garda&iacute; in the traffic corps this year was 663, a decrease of 400 garda&iacute;.  That issue should be looked at.  Deputy Murphy is correct in what he said about speed vans.  Some people say we do not need checkpoints if there are sufficient speed vans.  However, speed vans do not detect drunken drivers.  Most fatal collisions in which alcohol is a contributory factor involve drivers whose blood alcohol content is higher than 100 mg.  The Bill will affect a country person who goes to the pub and has one drink or, as we used to call it, a half and a small bottle, perhaps a bottle of stout.  That is completely different to drunk drivers who are plastered and should not be behind the wheel.  No law will stop that unless it is enforced by the Garda.  Those are the drivers who should face much higher sanctions.  Evidence suggests that closing loopholes and strengthening provisions would be a far more effective means of saving lives than the measures proposed in the Bill.</p>  <p>  In the United Kingdom it is mandatory for high risk offenders, including those found with a blood alcohol content of greater than 200 mg and repeat offenders, to pass a medical examination before getting their licence back.  Perhaps that should be considered rather than passing the Bill.  A study by the European Road Safety Observatory highlighted that alcohol ignition interlocks, which prevent a person from starting a car when they are over the legal limit, are 40% to 95% more effective in preventing drink-driving than traditional measures such as licence withdrawal or fines.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be bringing forward legislation to have alcohol ignition locks installed in the cars of severe first-time offenders and all second-time offenders.</p>  <p>  Punishments mean little to people if they do not believe that they will be caught.  There must be more Garda checkpoints to enforce the existing law.  Given the sorry state of Ireland&rsquo;s enforcement mechanisms in respect of drink-driving, that is hardly a surprise.  Recent controversies over falsified breathalyser tests have revealed the hollow nature of Government rhetoric on alcohol-related road offences.  While the final figure has yet to be confirmed, it is possible that more than 1 million breathalyser tests were faked, as has been addressed.  Where is the credibility in any regime involving that level of falsification?  Even when convictions occur, the risk of losing one&rsquo;s licence is meaningless if a person is already disqualified or knows that the punishment will not be enforced.  Of 206 drivers involved in a fatal alcohol-related collision, 41 were disqualified at the time of the incident.  That represents almost a fifth of the cases covered.  There is a gap between deterrents on paper and in the real world.  No amount of automatic disqualification will deter people if they do not believe the punishments will be enforced.  Although disqualified drivers are obliged to return their licence to the Road Safety Authority, 98% of them do not do so.  Drivers are disqualified in court but 98% of those drivers do not have their licence taken from them.  That is an incredible statistic.  How can something be enforced when the courts do not take away the licence of disqualified drivers?  It is a disgrace.  It is no wonder that there are so many disqualified drivers on the road when one considers that the overwhelming majority of them do not have their licence confiscated.</p>  <p>  We support increasing the maximum prison sentence for driving while disqualified from 6 months to 2 years and the maximum fine from &euro;5,000 to &euro;15,000 for repeat offenders.  That would ensure appropriate punishment for repeat offenders.   We also support allocating increased resources to the Road Safety Authority, RSA, for the management of the system and to increase enforcement.</p>  <p>  I cannot understand why the Minister has not addressed the funding imbalance that favours urban bus services over rural bus services nor why he has not modernised bus services in rural Ireland.  If all these laws are to be enforced, why is a service not being provided to look after people?  That would be step one if the Minister really wanted to provide a better quality of life for people in rural communities.  The Government has not been active on policy for that area.  It is not a matter for the National Transport Authority,  NTA, or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, but, rather, for the Minister and the Government.  If there were adequate public transport services in rural Ireland, people would have the option to put their car keys in the drawer and make use of an alternative mode of transport to get home or to go to work the morning after having a few drinks.  The rural link transport network is currently available during the day.  We should urgently seek to investigate the viability of enhancing the network and making it available at peak times during the on weekday and weekend nights.  The social fabric of rural Ireland is currently very strained.  I view the expansion of the rural link transport network as a socially positive policy and I ask the Minister to strongly consider it.</p>  <p>  Education is also needed.  Between 2008 and 2012, 39% of drivers involved in fatal  collisions where alcohol was a factor were aged between 15 and 24.</p><p>This statistic is very alarming too.  This means that we continue to fail our young people and that we are not getting through to them on the dangers of drink-driving.  During Question Time in February 2017 the Minister admitted that the education piece of road safety has not been as effective as we might have hoped, yet he has failed to address this.  We do not have a mandatory driver safety programme that covers the dangers of drink-driving.  While this is an optional module for transition year students, it is far from universal; only 70% of students are enrolled in transition year, and it is up to schools whether to feature a driver safety programme.  The RSA has also highlighted that young people need to be educated about drink-driving from a younger age than that of transition year students; young people typically begin to drink when they are about 14 or 15 years of age.  We should educate them at that stage.  We should make it mandatory for transition year students to receive a course on road safety, drink-driving, etc.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will table a number of amendments to provide for this.  We propose that the current penalty point sanction of three points be increased to five and that the fine be doubled to &euro;500.  I think this would be a sufficient deterrent for anyone found driving with between 50 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  We also support increased penalties for those found driving with a blood alcohol content in excess of 100 mg as these drivers are responsible for eight in ten fatal road collisions involving alcohol.  We also support an increase in the penalties for those breaking a driving disqualification, who account for approximately a fifth of fatalities involving road collisions.  To show our good faith and intentions on this issue, Fianna F&aacute;il believes the Minister should accept the compromise we have suggested, that is, that five penalty points be given to a person found driving with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml of blood.</p> <p> I have not even spoken about rural Ireland and the mental problems and isolation out there.  These are important matters as well, and we never consider them.  As I said, people in rural homes have no outlet but to go to the local town or village and meet people.  They are afraid.  Rural isolation is already an issue.  Suicide is a problem in rural Ireland.  With all these laws we are introducing we are becoming a nanny state.  We are dictating how people should live their lives and telling them what they can and cannot do.  We are frightening people in every way of life.  These draconian measures do not necessarily mean anything.  I know the Minister does not understand this because he is not from a rural area.  He should visit a rural area and see what happens every day to people living four or five miles from the nearest town.  They sometimes have the opportunity to come into a town, meet people, socialise and have a drink if they so wish - one or two drinks.  I know people who go into towns and have a flutter of drinking and then try to drive home.  I am talking about people who come in for the social aspect.  We are not taking this on board.  We are also not taking on board the morning after, when people have done the right thing the night before and got their taxis home and then try to get to work to make a living and keep going.  Perhaps it is a little late in the day now, but I ask the Minister to take all this on board and reconsider where we are with the Bill.</p> <p> Another issue is the condition of the roads.  We can talk about the various problems in rural areas.  I spoke about the need for a rural bus service.  I know we cannot have a bus service that will go up every lane and boreen in rural Ireland but we can have some kind of bus service from village to village that would help alleviate people's problems.  I do not think this legislation has been thought out or worked through enough.  I ask the Minister again to reconsider what we are asking and take all this on board.  I do not like voting against legislation on drink-driving.  I do not like to support anyone drinking and then driving a car, but I am talking about the minimum that we need.  The law we had that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced is adequate to look after anyone with a blood alcohol content of between 50 mg and 80 mg, and I ask the Minister to consider that.  Do I have a minute left?</p></speech>

I am always speaking about CCTV cameras.  I know this is moving away from drinking and driving but it is another issue in rural Ireland.  I refer to thieves coming from the big cities and frightening people in rural areas.  We saw robbery in Tipperary last month.  In my area, Kilkenny, we saw people coming out of view of CCTV cameras.  I have asked several times that they be looked at again in order to keep people safe in their homes and give them credibility.</p></speech>
