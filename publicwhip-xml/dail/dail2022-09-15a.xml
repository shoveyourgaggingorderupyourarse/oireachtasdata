Will the T&aacute;naiste outline the estimated timeframe for delivery and the benchmarking that will be used to calculate it?  We can all agree we are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.  This is going to have more of an impact on those workers on low pay than on those who are not.  They do not have a cushion or savings.  They are the people most desperately in need of that protection.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500003#A00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  We want to reward work and ensure that work pays more.  Minimum wage workers are among the hardest working people in Ireland and deserve to paid more, particularly at a time of rising prices.  Yesterday the Government accepted the Low Pay Commission's recommendation to increase the national minimum wage by 80 cent to &euro;11.30 per hour commencing on 1 January 2023.  At least 164,000 people will be in line for an increase but the real figure is likely to be much more, given that there will be knock-on increases for those currently earning slightly above the minimum wage.  It works out at roughly &euro;30 a week, &euro;120 a month or &euro;1,600 a year if working full-time.  As the Deputy is aware I want to move from a minimum wage to a living wage so that work pays more.  I outlined proposals back in June after which we started a public consultation seeking submissions from the public on the Low Pay Commission's recommendation and our straw-man proposal.  That provides an example of how a living wage might be phased in over four years.  The public consultation closed in August.  It received 46 submissions.  The work of an interdepartmental working group and public consultation results will inform a final Government decision on the adoption of a living wage over a specified number of years.  I hope to be able to make an announcement on that this month or next.  The new national minimum wage of &euro;11.30 is in line with the living wage straw-man proposal.  As such, next year can be considered the first year of a four-year plan to reach a living wage calculated at 60% of the median wage.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the advances that have been made by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, specifically in regard to the straw-man proposal and the public consultation.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, however, the 80 cent increase in the minimum wage was recommended by some, but not all, of the members of the Low Pay Commission.  When are workers going to see a very real move towards the living wage?  The T&aacute;naiste has given himself time to do it but events have overtaken the announcement he made in June.  People are in a serious crisis at the moment.  What they need to see is a step change quickly towards a living wage.  Will the T&aacute;naiste also, as in my question, outline the mechanism by which he will calculate that living wage when eventually we get there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500003#A00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The recommendation was made by a majority vote of the Low Pay Commission.  Two members dissented but eight or ten were in favour so a very clear majority was in favour of this recommendation.  What we will see next year is a not insignificant increase.  It brings us closer to the 60% median, not as close as the Deputy or I would like, but it does bring us closer to the 60% median so we are on the right trajectory.  The sum of &euro;1,600 a year is not a small amount of money.  It is enough perhaps to pay the rent or mortgage for a month.  It is enough, depending on how far a worker travels, to fill the car for several months.  It is not an insubstantial amount of money but also it is not the limit of what we are going to do to help people on low pay or on minimum wage.  It is just the start.  There is going to be a good deal more.  This will be seen in the budget, particularly in what we will do to help people with energy bills and welfare increases.  We will take other actions as well.</p></speech>

It is not that I do not acknowledge that there is a move.  However it is not adequate.  It goes without saying that I agree with the minority report of the trade union representatives.  The majority may have voted in favour of the 80 cent but the workers' representatives on the commission did not.  That tells a tale in itself.</p>  <p>  If the T&aacute;naiste sticks with the timetable as outlined, the commitment given in his programme for Government will not be realised.  He has pushed it out to beyond the end of the term of this Government.  If he is going to put something into the programme then there should be a realistic timeframe for introducing it and he has pushed it out beyond the term of Government.  How can people take seriously commitments given in the programme for Government if those that affect low-income workers and the people who most need it are going to be pushed beyond the end of the lifetime of the Government?</p></speech>

All of the employer representatives favoured the 80 cent increase.  That is not to say that all employer organisations do by any means.  Many have been very critical of the increase yesterday.  All of the independent and academic members favoured the increase, as well as one of the workers' representatives.  I always have to bear in mind that I do not want to increase the minimum wage to the point where businesses cannot survive any more and are forced to lay off staff or cut hours.  I do not think that will happen with an 80 cent increase by the way.  I think we will see a further increase in employment next year but it is something we have to bear in mind.  That is why the recommendation is for a four-year introduction period.  It can be quicker, I am certainly not ruling that out, but that will depend on economic circumstances.  I do not think anybody would say that wages should just go up or down regardless of what may be happening in the wider economy or the wider world.  We need some flexibility in that regard.</p></speech>

What sort of analysis has the Department made on the potential impact on employment in the coming months?  What supports will be put in place to prevent businesses going under and for unemployment to increase as a result of that?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500004#B00100"><p>It is fair to say that the Government has not been found wanting when it comes to helping businesses to get through difficult periods and indeed saving jobs.  The multibillion euro financial assistance provided by the Government during the pandemic was unprecedented whether it was to help businesses with their wage bills so that they could keep staff on, or their overheads, or with the introduction of a cheaper easier way to restructure and survive that examinership.  The commercial rates waiver and the reduction in VAT for the hospitality and retail sectors are other examples.  I am conscious of how worried businesses are as they go into the winter and the real concern about energy costs.  Putin&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine is having significant consequences for the whole of Europe and not just Ireland.  We are working on new proposals to help businesses with rapidly rising energy prices and I expect to be in a position to make announcements about these in and around budget time.</p>  <p>  We will also be looking to raise awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses to reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of approximately 20 different schemes we have already have in place for business.  For example, in June we announced a new &euro;55 million green transition fund to help businesses move away from fossil fuels and towards more sustainable cheaper alternatives.  To date, about 120,000 people are directly employed in gas-intensive manufacturing sectors.  That is where 40% of final energy consumption is in the form of gas.  Gas-intensive manufacturing sectors include the basic metals and fabricated products subsector, chemicals and man-made fibres subsector, which includes the pharmaceutical plants, food and beverage subsectors as well.  This represents 41% of the total final gas consumption nationally in 2020 and the majority of industry use. </p>  <p>  While it is useful to consider the numbers employed and the energy intensity of the economic sectors to gain a broad understanding of sectoral exposure to energy, it would be incorrect to imply that all jobs in energy-intense sectors are at risk.  It is also difficult to forecast the impact that higher energy costs might have on the staffing of energy-intense firms as any potential job losses would depend on decisions taken at individual firm level and therefore it is very difficult to predict given the unique nature of each firm&rsquo;s cost base.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500004#B00200"><p>We need to see from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department some kind of projections and worst-case scenario as to what sections of the economy are more at risk from higher energy prices and the knock-on effect of unemployment.  I am sure that there are senior officials in his Department who can have some kind of an opinion as to what we are facing into in a worst-case scenario and what supports may be needed to be prepared for in such a scenario.  Has the T&aacute;naiste spoken to the energy regulator when it comes to energy prices right across the board, but particularly, in this instance, for small and medium-sized enterprises?  Could the Department have a scheme that it may be able to roll out which could prevent job losses?  It could have some kind of employment support scheme, as it had in the past.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, some businesses across Dublin, across the country and in my own constituency, did not survive the Covid-19 pandemic and some that did might not survive this crisis.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste again about the type of analysis that his Department may be doing as to worst-case scenarios.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500004#B00300"><p>We certainly can do analysis, we have and we will do more.  We can make projections but, unfortunately, I do not believe that these projections can be particularly helpful.  The truth is that no one of us can guess how long this energy price crisis will go on for and no one can say how high gas and electricity prices will go.  That is the reality of the situation.  One can make one&rsquo;s projections but they are entirely based on assumptions and those projections essentially, to be polite about it, are going to be guesswork if prices double, treble, quadruple or increased tenfold.  One can do it oneself but it will not be particularly helpful for decision-making.</p>  <p>  We are developing three schemes that will help a business.  One is a loan scheme similar to what we had for Brexit and Covid-19.  The second is a grant scheme for manufacturers and exporters who are the higher energy users, again similar to what we had during the Covid-19 period.  Then we have a broader measure to help small businesses, in particular, namely, the retailers, hospitality sector and so on.  That is what I am trying to put together between now and budget day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500004#B00400"><p>I appreciate that we have experience through the Covid-19 period as to what is necessary and we are going to have to do that at least but I hope the Department may be in a position to prepare for that worst-case scenario because it is going to need to have some plans in place that, hopefully, it will not have to revert to.  If we have a situation where businesses go under and unemployment increasing, that is a winter that none of us really want to face into.  As I have said, many of these businesses have been wounded during the Covid-19 period.  Some of them came out of the financial crash ten years ago, Covid-19 has hurt them deeply and now they are facing into this.  We do not want to see businesses struggling but, if they do survive, doing so on the basis of laying people off.  While I understand that none of us can predict how long this is going to last or how deep it is going to be, we nonetheless need to give some comfort to businesses and to workers that they will not be left alone and stranded by any Government or potential Government scheme.</p></speech>

We did not put all of the resources into saving so many businesses and jobs during the pandemic to have those businesses fail now during this energy crisis.</p>  <p>  What I have learned from experience from helping to lead the country through a number of crises: the bailout and the banking crisis ten or 11 years ago with the Labour Party; Brexit and avoiding a hard border and no deal; and more recently the pandemic, is that one needs to be dynamic in one&rsquo;s response.  The worst-case scenario, which is highly unlikely, is of gas being unavailable or totally unaffordable, in which case businesses cannot operate.  We then would something like the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, or the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  The businesses would be surviving and the staff would continue to get paid but they would not be able to operate.  I hope we are not in that worst-case scenario.  The more likely scenario is of businesses still operating but having to do so with very high energy bills.  That is why one&rsquo;s intervention would be more linked to helping them with the bills than an employment subsidy.  It depends on where we end up and we will need to be flexible and dynamic.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste will know, this is a long-standing policy of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Recently, IBEC have publicly backed a similar idea.  We believe that this would be a great benefit to our small and medium-sized businesses, micro-businesses and indeed the family business sector.</p></reply>

The Government and we as a Department recognise that domestically traded sectors account for a significant number of firms in Ireland and, more importantly, for a high proportion of employment across retail, construction, accommodation and food, play and leisure and many other sectors also.  They contribute to the economic and social fabric of towns and villages across Ireland and every region and help us create jobs in all of these areas.</p>  <p>  As highlighted during the pandemic, these sectors also provide vital services and ensure the supply of essential products and services and as a Government we want to reach out and support as many as we can.  Government policy has ensured a competitive business environment for all firms based on a world-class economic infrastructure; a competitive tax regime that supports start-ups, scaling and investment; and strong institutions that provide access to skills and research and development. </p>  <p>  On direct interventions, the local enterprise offices, LEOs, provide various training and consultancy programmes to small businesses, as well as acting as a "first stop shop" or signposting for all firms to find out about resources and programmes available from Government Departments and agencies, such as Revenue, Microfinance Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the LEADER programme, Enterprise Ireland, Skillnet, education and training boards, ETBs, and many others also. </p>  <p>  Over the past number of years, the Government has responded quickly and effectively through these existing State bodies to the challenges faced by domestically-focused firms, whether it is access to finance, supporting firms through Covid-19 or helping firms to navigate the twin transitions of climate action and digitalisation, as well as dealing with the pressures coming from the war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming White Paper on enterprise, which will outline the medium-term strategic direction of enterprise policy, will set out how we can leverage these structures further to improve the overall productivity of this important sector of the economy.  We will look towards having that paper published before the end of the year.  In this important sector, the local enterprise offices have dramatically expanded their reach over the past number of years.  I also have engaged directly with them right throughout the country to see how we can enhance that and increase those limits even further again.  They have a new relationship now with many more sectors that they would not have had in the past and we will certainly continue to build on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500004#B01000"><p>In October 2020, the T&aacute;naiste, in response to Deputy Quinlivan, said that the idea of a new agency is certainly something that he had an open mind on and that many business people he spoke to felt that there was a gap.  When business is very small it can get help from local enterprise offices and when it is a bit larger or is an exporter, it can get help from Enterprise Ireland but there is a gap in between.  It is that gap that Sinn F&eacute;in policy is addressing directly.</p> <p>When we speak to domestically trading small to medium enterprises, they continuously highlight to us the lack of an agency to act for them at national level.  It is very tough to navigate the world of business.  It is especially so for a small or medium-sized family-run business or a microenterprise.  With this in mind, Sinn F&eacute;in has long sought the establishment of an Irish enterprise agency focusing on scaling existing Irish businesses and providing a strong agency for non-export focused start-ups and established companies.  It is that gap which we have identified and, to be fair, I think the Minister of State has agreed with us that that gap exists.  We have a policy as to how that would be filled but I would be interested to know what the Department will be doing in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500005#C00200"><p>We are trying to reach all of these companies through our various agencies.  A lot of effort has gone in but our focus through the Department in the past couple of years is how we can fix relationships with Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices to capture all of those companies.  Very often, the gap that is presented to us and, no doubt, to the Deputy, is that when companies go beyond that ten mark, they can fall between the two agencies.  The Deputy will see in the Enterprise Ireland strategy that was published last January the new focus to work with the local enterprise offices and to develop a new framework to make sure we capture all of those companies on their way up, although some of them might come back down, and if they were at 15, they might come back down to eight or nine.  I can see that relationship has been greatly enhanced over the last couple of years.  The framework, which will be published in the new year, identifies how best we will do that.</p>  <p>  In addition, through a range of supports through the local enterprise offices, we are reaching many of those companies that the Deputy has identified.  We are engaging with them through the Department in order to find the best way.  The White Paper that the T&aacute;naiste is leading out on, which will be published before the end of the year, will identify the best way to address any structural deficits to make sure we reach all of these companies.</p>  <p>  The conversation about the third agency has been around a long time and I have heard it many times.  Our focus has to be on what is the best way to reach these companies to make sure we can assist them in their journey of competitiveness and productivity, their green journey and their digitalisation journey.  We are able to do that through all of the competitiveness offerings through the local enterprise offices and through Enterprise Ireland.  Of course, every option is being looked at and we would be happy to take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestions in our review over the next couple of months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500005#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  While we disagree on a huge amount, there is broad agreement that the gap needs to be addressed.  We know the IDA has attracted thousands of multinationals since its establishment.  The success can be seen in the results for 2021, where we see more than 275,000 people employed in the multinational sector.  Enterprise Ireland is also doing a good job in its responsibility for developing and growing export markets.  It is just that gap that has been identified.  We see agencies like InterTradeIreland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which do good work in that area.  However, for the non-foreign direct investment, FDI, non-exporting companies, there is that gap.  Now is the time to move in.  We are talking all the time of reasons why businesses might fail.  We have the experience of businesses being supported through Covid and the need to protect jobs, particularly at this time.  We would welcome the opportunity to work with the Department on this.  As I said, it is long-standing Sinn F&eacute;in policy.  We have identified that gap and we have some ideas.  I would be happy to share those with the Minister of State and work with him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500005#C00400"><p>Again, the ambition and the focus has to be to work with companies and to encourage more and more companies to take on international markets.  That is the win-win for Ireland and that is where we can create more sustainable jobs.  In any of our policy interventions, and I think most businesses get this, we have to also recognise there is a displacement issue.  If there are four or five businesses trading domestically, all beside one another, grant-aiding one with direct financial grants can displace jobs in the other, so we always have to be mindful of that.  When we sit down and have this conversation with businesses, they recognise that.  That is where the ask is and our response has been how we can help them on the competitiveness journey, the green journey and on digitalisation, working with their skills and with their staff.</p>  <p>  That is open to companies of all sizes, so I would encourage any company out there to engage.  I often hear that companies regret leaving it too late to engage with the local enterprise offices.  I would say that from day one, no matter who they are, what they are or what company they are in, right from the start, they should have that conversation with the local enterprise office.  It is the signpost that will direct them to all the various supports across many Departments and Government agencies that can assist business.  When we talk to them, many businesses had not realised some of the supports that are there, even through the Departments of Education and Social Protection and the Pathways to Work scheme.  There are many supports for companies trading domestically and internationally.  We want to work with them and to assist them on that competitiveness journey, and to assist them to be able to upskill their staff and create more jobs, which we need.</p>  <p>  To be clear, as a Department, we also recognise that we cannot take this for granted.  At this current time, we are at a high employment level.  We want to build on that and work on that, and work with those companies in a regime that is supportive of job creation, which I do not always hear from Members in this House.</p></speech>

The multibillion euro financial assistance provided by Government during the pandemic was unprecedented, whether it was help with businesses' wage bills so they could keep staff on, their overheads, the introduction of cheaper, easier ways to restructure and survive, the small companies administrative rescue process, or SCARP, scheme, the commercial rates waiver or the reduction in VAT for the hospitality and retail sectors.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of how worried businesses are as we go into the winter and they see the high energy bills.  Putin's invasion of Ukraine has had massive consequences for the whole of Europe, not just Ireland.  Indeed, we are now facing a global inflation crisis.  We are working on new proposals to help businesses with rapidly rising energy prices and I expect to be in a position to make a positive announcement about that on budget day.  We will be looking to raise awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of the approximately 20 existing schemes that we already have in place for business to help them reduce their energy costs.  For example, in June, we announced a new &euro;55 million green transition fund to help businesses move away from fossil fuels and towards more sustainable alternatives, which, increasingly, are cheaper alternatives as well.</p></speech>

I get a huge number of contacts from companies, firms and retailers in County Clare in regard to the cost of energy and the impact it is having on their business, their ability to trade and their ability to retain employees.  We are seeing a doubling and a trebling of costs.  It is not before time that a significant package is put in place to help these traders.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned a &euro;55 million green transition fund.  That is very welcome but the retail sector is not eligible for that.  I would ask that strong consideration be given to amending that and allowing retailers into that particular scheme.  I would also encourage the T&aacute;naiste to look at introducing a grant scheme for accelerated capital allowances to enable retailers in particular to upgrade their refrigeration so they are more efficient.  The T&aacute;naiste might come back to me on that.</p></speech>

I welcome the action that the Minister and the Government have taken in regard to Covid, which was praised universally.  We need to be in a position to praise a new dynamic response, which the Minister appears to be promising right now.</p>  <p>  This is having an effect right across my county and my constituency.  I know of a company that has 140 employees whose bill has gone from &euro;15,000 to &euro;50,000 per month.  I know of a well-established Drogheda company whose electricity bill has gone from &euro;10,000 to &euro;25,000 per month.  There is a food hall in Dundalk which is 38 years in business and its bill has gone from &euro;3,674 to &euro;9,000 per month.  It is unsustainable and they will not be able to meet the increasing cost.  They are looking at reducing workers&rsquo; hours, lay-offs, increases in prices, closing temporarily and, in the case of manufacture, possibly moving to another jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  I believe that all and every opportunity must be grasped in regard to all other possible supports, like reducing other taxes that may be on these companies and subsidising wages if there is a proven bill and there is now an excess on that.  There might be other ways of finding supports for companies other than what is happening right now.  It is unsustainable for these businesses.</p> <p>We are inundated with calls.  I appreciate and acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste's concern.</p></speech>

Owners of supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and many other businesses locally have been highlighting to me the threefold increase they are seeing in their electricity and gas bills.  It is just not sustainable for them.  Not alone is it wiping out any profit but it is costing them to open the door and do business.  Many of them have already taken a number of different steps, including reducing their energy costs by changing fridges, for example, reducing opening hours and closing their deli counter.  That is having a knock-on effect on staff and their income, putting them under further pressure.  The cost of installing any new energy-efficient equipment will put huge pressure on businesses as well.  There will need to be support for them to do that.</p>  <p>  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that many of these retailers worked through the pandemic.  Local businesses are an important part of the fabric of a community.  They provide the first job for many people and they sponsor community groups and others.  It is essential that they are kept operating.</p></speech>

I had a meeting yesterday with a group of business owners in the city centre.  They painted a very bleak picture of what trading may look like there.  With the rise in energy costs and the need for efficiency that will come with it, we will see businesses turning off their lights at earlier hours.  The city will become darker and, therefore, less safe, with people choosing not to come into it.  Is that being factored into the Government's considerations?  What can we do to ensure we keep our city centre bright and vibrant, particularly coming into the festive period, when energy demands will soar?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500006#D00600"><p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  As we all appreciate, businesses are going to be affected in very different ways.  Some businesses are very energy-intense; for others, labour costs outweigh energy costs many times over.  Some have been able to recover their costs, often through price increases, which are unwelcome.  Some businesses are very profitable and will simply face lower profits, while others are barely profitable at all and face being pushed from profit into loss.  That is a very serious situation indeed.  When it comes to retail, I think the big impact there is because of refrigeration and the enormous cost of running fridges.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I will examine the proposal by Deputies Carey and O'Dowd to extend the green transition fund to retail and the issue of accelerated capital allowances.  However, we all appreciate that doing that kind of work will pay back at some point in the future, but it is not going to get businesses through the winter period.  Therefore, we are working on a number of schemes we think will help businesses.  One is a low-cost, low-interest loan, similar to what we had in place for Brexit and the Covid pandemic.  The second is a grant scheme, in essence, which already has state aid approval from the European Commission and will be targeted at manufacturers and exporters with high energy bills.  In addition to that, we need a broader measure that will help SMEs, particularly in hospitality and retail, which are facing very high costs.</p>  <p>  It is going to be a real challenge.  I have seen some extreme examples of bills going up when people have come off contracts or they are with a discount supplier.  It is typical now to see bills trebling; not doubling, but trebling.  That is quite typical and it is a huge increase in electricity and gas bills for businesses.  I would love to be able to say the Government is going to be in a position to pay those bills or pay two thirds of those bills indefinitely, but I cannot say that and I cannot promise that.  What I can say is that we will help and it will be a significant and meaningful intervention.  We hope to have that in place for budget day.</p>  <p>  I share Deputy Gannon's concerns.  If our towns and cities, including Dublin city centre, are darker, they will be less safe.  Of course, nobody is talking about turning down the streetlights, which will remain on as they are now, but the general streetscape is illuminated by lights in shops, businesses and public buildings.  We need to be careful about that in terms of our messaging around it.  While we are encouraging people to use less energy, we do not want to make our streets less safe.  That is something I am very concerned about too.  Luckily, most lighting, particularly LED lighting, does not use up a huge amount of electricity.  It does use electricity but nothing like the electricity that is used for heating things up or cooling things down.  We need to get that balance right.</p></speech>

There is a need for an immediate response for both the short and long term because this issue will not go away any time soon.</p>  <p>  There is a chance for some premises to install solar panels on their roofs and get energy supply into their units, but they are being prevented from selling that electricity back to the grid.  We need to cut up the red tape that prevents them from doing so.  Will the T&aacute;naiste look at proposals in that regard?</p></speech>

In the case of manufacturing industry in my county, this is a very significant issue if a company has 140 workers and is considering lay-offs.  It cannot increases its costs because it is tied into contracts internationally.  The problem is that if people are laid off, they will be making claims on the State by way of supports.  It is terribly important to try to add in those supports now and keep people at work if at all possible.  There is not one formula to fit all the problems but I go back to what the Government did during the Covid period.  The opportunity is there to do now what it did then.  I know these are different problems and would involve different schemes and opportunities, but the Government must tackle this.  People have confidence because it did it in the past.  We need to prove our capacity as a Government and a State to respond to this dreadful international crisis.  It was not caused by the Government but we must attempt to solve it.  We must pull out all the stops on this.</p></speech>

I draw his attention to the hospitality sector.  Often, when money is tight, eating out and staying somewhere overnight are things people will tighten up on as early as possible.  Those businesses will possibly see a dramatic drop-off in their income.  They are going to be pushed from both sides because many of their costs will remain high even if their restaurant or other facility is only half full or two thirds full.  They will still have to run the same demand on fridges, heating, lighting, staff and so on.  Will there be particular measures for businesses that are going to be hit from both sides?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give an outline of the scale of supports and whether those measures will be in the form of direct supports to enable such businesses to continue to operate?  They are essential businesses in that they are providing jobs for people locally, including, in many cases, the first job for students and younger employees.  It is essential that we keep them operating.</p></speech>

We have all heard from the owners of small businesses and industries.  We need to deal with the cost of energy at both a domestic and international level, where we can do so, but we will also have to look at grant schemes.  I refer to Suretank in Dunleer and Castlebellingham.  To lay it out cleanly, the company is looking at its cost of &euro;15,000 per month for electricity going to &euro;50,500, and gas going from &euro;3,200 per month to &euro;18,000 per month.  It is saying this will mean all its profits are gone and it will be out of action in a number of months.  Anglo Printers in Drogheda is looking at its electricity bill going from &euro;160,000 per year to half a million euro, which is an approximate cost of &euro;10,000 per worker.  As I said, it is absolute carnage.  We need to act as quickly as possible, as was done during the Covid period to keep the ship afloat.  I accept this is an issue that is happening across Europe, but we need to deal with it domestically and internationally.  We have no choice.</p></speech>

I met with members of the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, in my county recently.  While they prepare monthly accounts, many smaller businesses in the hospitality sector, such as coffee shops and caf&eacute;s, only prepare annual accounts.  It will only be in October they will get the real shock factor.  The costs of utility bills are spiralling through the roof.  We must do everything possible to ensure, just as we did during the Covid-19 pandemic, that these businesses stay afloat.  They are part of the fabric of Ireland, part of the employment sector and significant employers in the economy.  Outside of greater Dublin, the tourism and hospitality sector is the greatest employer in the west.  Therefore, I ask that everything possible be done in this context in the lead-up to the budget.</p></speech>

I agree a response of scale is required.  I cannot put a figure on that now.  It may not be possible to put a figure on it, because we just do not know how long this situation will continue.  We probably will be able to put a figure on it for this year, but I am not sure about next year.  That will depend on how things develop.  The objective, however, is clear: it is to protect viable but vulnerable businesses from failing and to protect the jobs of the people who work in those businesses.  There must be an adequate response, because if there is not such a response, then there is no point in having a response at all.  I would rather spend enough and achieve what I want to achieve than spend a lot and not achieve what we need to achieve.  This is going to be our guiding principle.</p>  <p>  This is a very different crisis from Covid-19.  When the virus arrived in Ireland, we were talking about somewhere between 20,000 and 80,000 deaths if we did not act the way we did.  The response to the Covid-19 pandemic, of course, was not just about providing money to people and businesses; it was also about taking away people's freedoms.  This is a very different crisis.  We will not be doing things like that, for example.  It is, though, comparable in some ways.  It is comparable in respect of the anxiety and fear people have when it comes to being able to pay the bills.  It is also comparable in respect of the uncertainty, because people just do not know how bad this crisis will be or how long it is going to go on.  This is why it does require a comparable response.</p></speech>

Ireland's employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists, which determine roles that are either in critically short supply or are ineligible for an employment permit.  These lists undergo regular, evidence-based review, guided by relevant research, public and stakeholder consultation and the views of the economic migration interdepartmental group.</p>  <p>  My Department chairs the economic migration interdepartmental group to oversee the review process, which includes membership drawn from senior officials of key Departments, including the Department of Health in this case.  The aim of the group is to promote an integrated approach to address labour and skills shortages in the economy.  This includes assessing proposals received through the public consultation for changes to the occupations lists.</p>  <p>  We announced changes in June 2021 to assist in the shortages being experienced in private and voluntary nursing home establishments and hospital settings.  These employers can now apply for the general employment permit for non-European Economic Area, EEA, nationals wishing to take up employment in the State.  Since January this year, about 1,873 employment permits for healthcare assistants have been issued to more than 193 nursing homes.  Therefore, this scheme is working quite well.  It involves a great deal of training and upskilling as well, and an ongoing commitment to training, which will help the sector overall.</p>  <p>  In addition, to help alleviate some of the ongoing skills shortages, we announced further changes in June this year to enhance access to employment permits for other key professional roles in the health sector.  These changes included roles that may be employed in the private and voluntary nursing home sector, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, podiatrists and chiropodists etc.  Employment in these occupations is now eligible for the critical skills employment permit, which again should help to bring more people into the sector.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are now actively engaged with the Department of Health regarding recruitment challenges for the care sector.  A major focus in this regard is care in the home.  My Department is a member of the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group.  It is chaired by the Department of Health, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is in charge of that and tasked with considering the recruitment and retention challenges faced by the care sector.  The Department continues to keep the employment permits system under review in light of changing labour market circumstances.  We will respond to the advisory work group when it presents its findings.  I understand it is due to report in September.  We have engaged directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on this issue and she is very concerned about the shortage of talent in this area.  Resulting from that, we will be able to adjust the work permit schemes, if need be, to accommodate this situation.  As I said, we do have the ongoing review quite regularly.  This issue was examined in the previous two reviews.  There were issues around the contracts on offer and terms and conditions, and we must work on these aspects too as best we can.</p></speech>

I refer to the changes and reviews.  He is a very hands-on Minister of State.  I recall him facilitating a workshop with members of the Shannon Chamber of Commerce several months ago.  It was very informative for the businesses that engage in the context of the work permit issue.  A particular issue, however, is emerging regarding recruitment for our nursing homes sector.  Basically, there is a shortage of healthcare workers in Ireland and throughout the EU.  We must streamline this process.</p>  <p>  To give an example, some of these people get their work permits, but then they must wait for the critical skills permit to come on stream after that and it may take several months to happen.  Those people may also have to wait for an entry visa.  More co-ordination is needed between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Justice and others to ensure this process can be streamlined.</p></speech>

The first is the reform of the overall system.  In recent years, especially in working closely with the T&aacute;naiste and the Department over the past year, we put extra resources and staffing into that area.  The number of staff available to work through the backlog in permits has nearly trebled.  Thankfully, the processing time has been reduced.  We had been seeing timelines of nearly 20 weeks, and more in some cases.  In most cases now, though, the waiting time is back down to four or five weeks, which is correct.  We will continue to drive on with this work with more forms and more changes, including using IT and more skilled staff to enhance this process and to reduce the waiting time even more.</p>  <p>  Legislation will also be coming through the Houses this autumn, which will again help to streamline the process.  Therefore, the process itself is being addressed.  The Deputy, however, also raised two other issues.  One was our engagement and work with the Department of Justice on this issue, because it can be complicated for certain sectors and for people from certain countries coming in as well.  Therefore, we have regular engagement with the Department of Justice.  We have made changes that have worked quite well in the medical profession in general, and we will home in on other areas that have been identified in this regard as well.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and I will be meeting in the next week or two to focus on some of the changes also coming through at EU level which might help us to align our two systems.  We do, however, try to respond.</p>  <p>  A working group specific to this sector, involving representatives from all the relevant Departments, has been established to focus on this issue.  This has been done because this is not just about finding an answer to this problem involving work permits; other issues are involved.  We must put in place permanent solutions, and I will be very happy to work with Deputy Carey to make this happen very quickly.</p></speech>

I ask this because I can see on the ground that this is an issue now.  Nursing home proprietors are contacting me regarding this issue.  They have managed to get some people, but the delay in trying to process applications is what is in question here.  I welcome the addition of occupational therapists and physiotherapists to the critical skills list.  The important aspect, however, is to ensure people get critical skills permits in a timely fashion after they get work permits.  Perhaps the two processes should happen together.</p></speech>

Streamlining is needed across the board, in respect of everything from healthcare workers to chefs.  Beyond that, the Minister of State spoke about the task force.  We all know the issues, whether we are talking about healthcare workers in nursing homes or home carers, which is a particular issue.  The Minister of State mentioned a level of engagement with this task force.  My understanding is that, to a degree, there has been some sort of draft interim review report.  I imagine that is with the Government now.  This is an issue we really need to be dealt with.  Many families cannot get care for their loved ones at home to keep them in their homes.  We know the necessity of doing this.  Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister of State could give us any update in this regard and perhaps even a preview of what is going to be proposed in the budget.  We will keep it in the room.</p></speech>

In the previous budget, &euro;666 million was allocated to this area.</p> <p>An unprecedented amount of money was committed to the home help sector but the problem over the past 12 months has been that they have not be able to fill many of these roles.  They simply cannot get the people.  I suggested at the Fianna F&aacute;il think-in - this feeds in also to the T&aacute;naiste's Ministry - that we would look in budget 2023 at special taxation which would allow people, after doing the school drop-off in the morning, to be able to provide home help in the community and be able to fulfil the school collection obligation in the afternoon without penalising that person or his or her spouse or partner from a taxation point of view.  Taxation treatment here could unleash the potential of people to serve in their community, provide home care and keep people out of the acute hospital setting.  I hope it can be considered by the Department and, indeed, the Department of Finance in the lead into budget 2023.</p></speech>

Close to 2,000 permits have been issued.  We have streamlined our process and we focus in, whether it be on home-care assistants or chefs, at different times of the year when there is a high priority.  I think we have managed to do that, but the simple question the Deputy asked was on whether we can align that better with the Department of Justice.  That is something I would agree with the Deputy on.  We are trying to do that too and it is trying to focus its resources where we are to match up with the individual sectors.  Nursing home care and home care are the two key areas.</p>  <p>  We were able to make the change in the case of the healthcare assistant issue because the evidence was there.  The same evidence was not there to address the shortage in the home care sector.  I have engaged directly with that sector outside of the strategic advisory working group as well to hone in on the contracts that are on offer, the subsistence and the terms and conditions because the T&aacute;naiste is very clear on this.  Work has to always pay and we have to make sure that we are working with high-quality jobs here.  The permit is not the solution to everything and we must see good contracts on offer that deal with all the issues concerned as well.</p>  <p>  That advisory group, I understand, is to complete its work in September.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, is anxious that it does.  We can respond to that as well.</p>  <p>  On the third point in relation to the tax regime, we would agree that there are quite a high number of people who for whatever reason are not available to work in this country.  I do not mean people who cannot work or are on social protection, but that there is a large number of people who might have retired early or have not gone back to work.  We need to find new ways to unlock that potential.  This is one area where there is a great deal of potential for it.  That is something that is being looked at by the advisory group.</p></speech>

The FDI performance in the region has been consistent over the past five years with employment by IDA Ireland clients increasing by almost 30%.</p>  <p>  The mid-west is now recognised as a global cluster location of choice for advanced manufacturing, including both life science and semiconductor manufacturing multinationals.  With the completion of the Advanced Manufacturing Centre in the National Technology Park this value proposition is further enhanced.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Future Mobility Campus Ireland based in the Shannon Free Zone, which I had the pleasure to visit a few months ago, is home to several existing IDA Ireland clients with activities linked to smart mobility.  The continued development of the connected and autonomous mobility sector is positive with great companies, such as General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, and recent investments from Exida and Renovo benefitting the mid-west region.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue to engage with multinational online selling and distribution companies as part of their strategy to attract investment.  Several IDA Ireland client companies manage supply chain and distribution from Ireland already, including DHL and DB Schenker which have operations in Shannon.</p>  <p>  The mid-west has also developed a strong professional services and technology ecosystem including companies like Dell, Extreme Networks, Fiserv, IQEQ and Waystone.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Shannon Estuary Economic Taskforce was formally established on 21 April 2022 following an open expression of interest.  We have our regional enterprise plan for the region as well.</p>  <p>  The work programme for the task force is focused on an assessment of the strategic strengths and potential areas of opportunity for the Shannon Estuary across four sectors, including transport, logistics and connectivity, which is the matter the Deputy is raising.  This strand is looking at interconnectivity, sustainable transport, innovation and development, and alternative fuel sources such as synthetic aviation fuels, as well as the potential for the Shannon Estuary region to be developed as a logistical hub, serving not just the region but the entire country.</p></speech>

Shannon and the mid-west is only scratching the surface of its potential there.</p>  <p>  Many people are shocked in Ireland to discover that only 1% of cargo leaves our country via the air.  Given the number of planes that crisscross this country every day, we are uniquely geographically positioned between Europe and the United States.  We have so many natural advantages and we should be capitalising on that.</p>  <p>  Luxembourg has Cargolux.  It is a small country but, minute though it might be, it is a world leader in terms of Cargolux and getting cargo shipments throughout the world.</p>  <p>  I look with envy every time I pass Baldonnell in Dublin.  The new Amazon facility there of 58,000 sq. ft. employs 500 people.  Only two weeks ago, it shipped out its first parcels from its Ireland facility.  There are 30 of these facilities in the UK.  It is inevitable that Amazon will want more facilities in Ireland.  We would like to know, I suppose, specifically, has the T&aacute;naiste advanced proposals for it to locate in Shannon Airport, particularly given the new facility that will soon be built there for cargo handling and shipment.</p></speech>

The zone around the airport has been an enormous success in the past couple of years.  There has been a huge increase in employment, and the quality of employment, there as well.  For the airport itself, it is always a bit more of a struggle but we all want to see passengers numbers increase.  I was pleased to engage with Deputy Carey, as head of the airport group, and to see also that the flights to Paris have resumed, which is really positive news as well.</p>  <p>  Luxembourg is a little different.  One should bear in mind that if a plane lands with a cargo in Luxembourg, it can be transshipped by road or rail to almost anywhere in Europe.  That is not the case for Ireland.  If something lands in Dublin or Shannon and is taken off the plane, it has to be put back on a ship to get to Europe.  It is a different proposition in Luxembourg.  However, when it comes to air transshipment, there is a great deal of potential in Shannon going from one plane to another.  There is a great deal of space there as well and very few objections to development, which is really important too.  We have had some discussions and conversations with particular companies involved in this space.  I cannot get into the detail of them here.  I might be able to talk to the Deputy off-line.  We are pursuing a number of opportunities.</p></speech>

This will be a massive facility.  It is right by the runway.  It is perfectly positioned to receive transit cargo and take it worldwide.  We really want to see this happen.  I am sure there is a tenant in mind for this.  We would love to see Amazon there.  I would imagine every Deputy in this House has the Amazon app on his or her phone.  It is how people shop these days.  A pair of jeans comes in from the UK.  Tops come in from America.  There are Prime vans on every road in Ireland in the mornings but we really need a second facility.  The facility in Dublin is fantastic but Shannon still has huge advantages over Dublin.  In spite of the new runway opening in Dublin in August last, we still have Ireland's longest runway.  We have incredible hangarage.  We are uniquely positioned, as I say, as a stepping stone to the United States and the European Union.  With Brexit having happened and with all its woes, Shannon and the mid-west are positioned perfectly for a new cargo facility.  Let us not get to the point in 12 months' time where we are still talking about 1% of air cargo leaving Ireland.  We need to increase that.  It is far more sustainable in terms of shipping things worldwide.</p></speech>

I look forward to the official opening of MeiraGTx tomorrow by the Taoiseach.  It is a progressive company.  It is a real example of what has been done in Shannon over the past decade.</p>  <p>  Many of those firms have been in touch with me in relation to the question of energy, the issue of blackouts and the Government message around that.  They are looking for assurances around this question of how will the Government deal with it and I would like the T&aacute;naiste to give some assurance to those companies that provide so much employment in the mid-west on our policy in that regard.</p></speech>

I must confess, I do not have the Amazon app on my phone.  I use Amazon from time to time and have nothing against it but I like to support local too and, particularly in the run-up to Christmas, will try to buy as much as I can in retailers in west and central Dublin.  I know that Deputy Carey is a big supporter of local businesses in Clare as well.</p>  <p>  I am familiar with the plans Shannon Group has.  They are really exciting.  I can certainly say to the Deputy, without giving away any commercially sensitive information, that the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Group stand ready to incentivise any large company that may want to make use of that facility.  We are definitely working on that.</p>  <p>  As for Deputy Carey's question about energy security, we anticipate that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will publish in the coming days, if not in the next week or so, the analysis that has been done on energy security in Ireland.  It is largely favourable.  We are fortunate in Ireland in that we do not rely on gas from Russia and that we have two other ways to bring gas into the country, that is, from the Corrib field and across the two interconnectors from the UK.  However, I share Deputy Carey's view that having gas storage and another way to get gas into the country, whether through Cork or Ballylongford, but having a different source of gas should something go wrong with the UK interconnectors, makes a lot of sense.</p></speech>

On the one hand, when there is an industrial dispute, he and others in government will advise people to use the third-party machinery of the State, and that is entirely appropriate.  On the other hand, however, we have agencies funded by his Department that then ignore these rulings in some instances.  This case relates to bogus self-employment.  It relates specifically to Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council Ireland - this has been reported in the newspaper - and a judgment, a ruling, made against it.  I want an update from the T&aacute;naiste, if I could, in light of this judgment specifically, on what is being done to tackle the scourge of bogus self-employment.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500009#G00500"><p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising this issue.</p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that workers are correctly classified in a way that matches the reality of the relationship between the worker and the business.  Therefore, we take very seriously any bogus employment.  The T&aacute;naiste is very clear on that and has set up a working group on the matter.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, mechanisms exist for the determination of the employment status of individuals or groups.  Where an issue arises in respect of the employment status of an individual, cases are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and-or the scope section of the Department of Social Protection for investigation, either solely by the recipient or jointly with the labour inspectorate of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The WRC may also determine employment status as a preliminary issue at an adjudication hearing dealing with an employment rights dispute.</p>  <p>  In July 2021 a revised code of practice on determining employment status was published by the Minister for Social Protection.  This code is the key guidance document for employers and workers and others on deciding the employment status of a worker.  The code was revised to take account of newer labour market developments, including platform work.</p>  <p>  The misclassification of workers as self-employed when their terms and conditions mean that they are, in reality, employees is a matter of concern to us.  However, in the changing world of work, correct classification of the relationship between employers and workers is not always a straightforward matter, and each case must be judged on its individual circumstances.  That is the system we have operated here very successfully for a long number of years.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the complexities in this area, it is important that false self-employment is tackled wherever it occurs, and we are very clear on that.  To that end, the T&aacute;naiste has requested our Department to convene a working group consisting of officials from the Department, the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners as well as representatives from ICTU, IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation of Ireland and ISME to examine closely this issue.  I chair that group and we have met on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a broad suite of employment rights legislation.  All businesses including those in receipt of public funds - we are very clear on this - are obliged to adhere to the law of the land, including those obligations arising under employment rights legislation.  The WRC is the organisation within the State which is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation and it does a good job in doing so.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Reilly raised a specific issue.  I cannot comment on any individual case-----</p></speech>

Of course, it has not.  I was trying to work it out there, but I think it is about 17 years since the first time I heard the phrase "no mutuality of obligation" in a Labour Court recommendation.  The Minister of State will know what that phrase means.  It has been knocking around for a very long time.  For years people thought that the bogus self-employment issue was something that existed only in certain parts of the economy.  It is now invading every part of the economy.</p>  <p>  What the WRC found in the case to which I referred was that the employer had been evading their legal responsibilities under employment law, namely, that they had sought to force a worker into bogus self-employment in respect of her job as an instructor.  That just denies her permanent employment.  It is not just a case of not getting a contract; the worker does not have access to sick leave, does not have access to a pension and does not have access to paid time off.  It is a really serious issue.  The Minister of State will be aware of this.</p>  <p>  I would appreciate an update on the consultative group and the work it is doing.  It is good that it meets but we want to hear what is actually coming out of that group.</p></speech>

It is representative of all parts of society.  It is important we continue to focus on the area to see if we can enhance and strengthen our legislation and our regime.  Part of the work of that group over recent months has been to assess the situation at the moment and the numbers that we believe are in this sector and to see if Revenue and the Department of Social Protection have the right staff and the extra staff they need to be able to deal with the current situation.  They say they do.</p>  <p>  There are delays in the system when a case goes into a review, an appeal or suchlike, which can be very lengthy.  Most cases are now dealt with in, I think, less than six weeks.  That is the initial judgment.  It is always an individual assessment of every individual case.  The working group is trying to see if we can add to that and make it better.</p>  <p>  In fairness, the initiatives in this area have been updated over many years at different times to reflect changes in work.  The big change at the moment - it has been going on for the past couple of years - is platform work.  There are changes afoot at EU level as well.  We will take all that on board with the new EU directive and bring it through that working group and back, with a recommendation to the T&aacute;naiste through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, as well.  It is important that we will act on that if need be.  A part of that is gathering the evidence and seeing what sectors we can focus on.  There are often phrases used like those Deputy O'Reilly has just used that this is a major problem.  The research does not always show that, but wherever the issue arises we want to stamp it out.  The T&aacute;naiste is very clear on this.  It denies people their rights when it comes to supports from the Department of Social Protection or any other bodies.  In addition, it causes loss of revenue to the State.</p></speech>

As I said, there was a  time when people thought it was a niche issue.  It is not.  It is in the gig economy, IT, construction, universities, journalism and broadcasting.  We know that it is happening; what we do not know is what the Government is actually going to do about it.  The workers themselves miss out on so much when they are misclassified.  I am talking about things like maternity benefit and other stuff that is really important.  Workers are being excluded from that.  They are coming into work.  There is a mutuality of obligation that has to be established, but even when it is established, and if we take the case I have outlined, which has now been appealed by the employer, the employer now, presumably a State-funded agency, is spending the State's money to fight one of its workers because that worker has been forced into bogus self-employment.  As part of the group, the Department should look at that and at how much money is spent by the State fighting workers who have an entitlement through the machinery of the State.  That has to be looked at, but where the State is facilitating it, it is especially egregious.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500009#G01100"><p>To be very clear, the State does not facilitate it.  The State expects anybody who is in employment to have the full protection of our employment legislation, and we are very clear on that.  There are two agencies, Revenue and the Department of Social Protection, that do a well-recognised good job in this area.  Our regime in Ireland is well recognised for protection of employees.  It is something we are very proud of and put the resources into, and we will strengthen that.</p>  <p>  We have also extended a lot of the benefits to self-employed people through social protection, and rightly so, because we have seen how they were left behind at the last financial recession, so we have made sure to extend that.  That is something we have worked very clearly on and it is an agenda the T&aacute;naiste has driven through the Department of Social Protection previously and now in our Department as well.  That is very clear.  The State will never support bogus employment or self-employment or anyone being forced into it.  That is why this working group is carrying out a review to see if we can enhance that.  We have sat down with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection to see if they need more resources to tackle the cases that are there, but we are very clear on this.  As part of the work, we will end up with a much stronger communications campaign.  There are certain key areas Deputy O'Reilly and others have identified, as the Government has as well, and there are certain areas that need to be addressed.  We will deal with them.  It is not the case, however, that we are sitting back and doing nothing.  The legislation is there already, and we want to be very clear on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500010#H01500"><p>"Viable-vulnerable" is a commonly used term when it comes to the various schemes we have.  It is designed to ensure we do not provide taxpayers' money to businesses that we know will fail, regardless of what support they receive.  We take a liberal approach, which sometimes involves supporting businesses that cannot succeed, but we err on the side of supporting a business or protecting jobs any time we can.  For example, we provided the sustaining enterprise fund during the pandemic.  We will have something similar for the energy crisis.  We would expect businesses receiving large amounts of taxpayers' money to present a plan to show how they will survive, bounce back and reduce their energy costs if they can.  That does not apply to every scheme.  For example, in the commercial rates waiver we did not ask businesses to prove whether they were viable, but when it comes to other schemes we will.  That is for a very good reason; to make sure we do not give hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of taxpayers' money to a company that does not have a realistic plan.</p></speech>

There was an issue during the pandemic when companies were on the one hand in receipt of State aid and on the other hand paying massive dividends to their shareholders, and that is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the need for businesses to reduce their energy costs.  I am aware of a hotel which used to have a monthly energy bill of &euro;21,000.  That has now risen to &euro;71,000.  You can bet your bottom dollar that the people in that hotel are doing everything they can.  Growers in north County Dublin have no choice but to use gas to keep their tunnels warm.  They are doing everything they can to cut their energy use but they are energy-intensive companies and are worried their businesses will fail.  What they want to hear from the T&aacute;naiste is that the money will be directed directly to them, that viable businesses will be kept afloat and that money will not be funnelled into businesses that will come through this unscathed.</p></speech>

Many companies paid back money they received through the employment wage subsidy scheme.  I am glad we gave it to them because at the time it looked as though they might not succeed.  They were able to keep on their staff and make profits during the pandemic, and they gave the money back.  It is important that we have clawback arrangements in that regard.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that businesses are facing huge energy costs.  Two days would not pass that I do not meet someone in business who shows me their bill and tells me all the efforts they have made to reduce their energy costs and, notwithstanding that, the bill is triple what it was only a few months ago.  We want to help businesses to move towards more modern ways of providing heat and light, such as using LED lights which cost a lot less.  I visited the Iveagh Garden Hotel on Harcourt Street not too long ago where they have a heat pump.  It is a massive thing in the basement of an old building.  The hotel can have much lower energy costs than the vast majority of hotels that traditionally rely on gas and electricity.  However, I understand one cannot install a heat pump in a week or two, or even a few months.  We have to help now but also help in the long term.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is right; they have to be helped now.  The longer-term solutions can wait.  What businesses want to hear and what I want to hear from the T&aacute;naiste is what that will look like because there is so much uncertainty.  There are things far beyond the control of any person in the Chamber and we fully accept and appreciate that.  Notwithstanding that, as much certainty as can be given should be given.  We hope when the schemes are announced they will be simple and easy to access.</p>  <p>  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste does not mean this when talking about helping people to reduce their energy costs.  I have spoken to business owners in my community and beyond who say they are doing absolutely everything.  If there is something the T&aacute;naiste believes can be done that those businesses are not doing, perhaps he should share that with them sooner rather than later.  He should accept it is part of a longer term solution and that a short-term solution will be needed.</p></speech>

Long before the current energy crisis, we provided about 20 different schemes through my Department and its agencies, and through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, not just to help businesses reduce their carbon footprint and invest in modern energy systems but also to enable them to carry out an energy audit.  I have met many businesses that have availed of those vouchers that have had the audit done.  Even though they are progressive businesses that have done a lot to reduce their energy costs, they often find out things they had not considered.  That is a programme put in place by the Government.  It is not about us hectoring them and telling them that they need to reduce their energy costs.  It is about us providing them with vouchers, support, and professional advice that shows them how they can reduce their energy costs, which is more relevant now more than ever.</p></speech>

What actions will the T&aacute;naiste and his Department take to ensure workers across the board will get a pay rise?  Not least of which the reason would be to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and energy bills they are facing in their households.</p></reply>

The Government does not centrally control wages but there are different mechanisms by which we can influence how much people are paid.  In the public sector, for example, we have negotiated a new pay agreement, which will go out to a ballot.  That agreement has been made by the Government and recommended by various unions.  I hope it will get through.  That would see people receive pay increases this year and next year to help them with the cost of living.</p>  <p>  In some sectors, the Government also has a role to play.  The Deputy will be familiar with the childcare sector.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has just signed off on a new employment order, which involves significant and well-deserved pay increases for that sector.  I recently signed off on an increase to the national minimum wage, which mainly covers people in the private sector, but in some public sector agencies as well.  That was an increase of 7.6%, just below inflation.  In other parts of the private sector, it is negotiated at individual level.  I am not telling the Deputy anything he does not know but they are the kinds of measures we are taking: a public sector pay deal to increase the pay of our own staff, increases in the national minimum wage, and wages in the sectors that are covered by employment regulation orders, EROs, and sectoral employment orders, SEOs.  What is happening in the private sector depends on the enterprise.</p>  <p>  Maintaining standards of living is not just about pay rises.  Pay rises have to be part of it.  At a time of high inflation, people need a pay rise to help them with the rising cost of living but it is not the only thing.  The Government can also help by reducing income taxes, which is something I am very much in favour of.</p> <p>The Government can help by increasing welfare payments.  For example, the working family payment can help some people.  It is also helping to reduce costs, such as the cost of childcare.  It is not just about how much people get paid, it is about how much people get to take home after taxes and government levies and about how much it costs to get by on the money people have.  It requires these three approaches of pay increases, tax reductions and reducing some costs of living such as childcare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500011#J00200"><p>Herein lies the debate.  What we have had for a very long time in Ireland is a disproportionate number of people on low pay.  We also have a disproportionate number of people in insecure work.  Perhaps the more we say this the more people will notice.  A statistic I always tell the T&aacute;naiste, and I know that he knows it, is that 23% of Irish workers are on low pay.  He does not have to accept the recommendation of the Low Wage Commission.  He could just decide to go immediately to a living wage of &euro;12.90.  It would have a knock-on effect throughout the economy.  Many employers do not want to be accused of being a minimum wage employer.  It would also increase wages all the while.  There are also other issues.  As the Minister knows, workers here are expected to pay for services for which other European countries do not expect their citizens to pay, such as GP care and childcare.  Back to school costs are a classic example.  We are in a bind as we have a disproportionate number of low-paid workers and families have disproportionate costs.  On top of this will be an extra layer of expense during the winter.  The pay rates of those on the lowest level are within the Minister's remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500011#J00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  We both know how statistics work and it depends on how they are measured.  I appreciate the figure the Deputy has used on the proportion of Irish people on low pay but it is skewed by the fact we have such a high number of people on very high pay.  This brings up the median.  It is equally true that average pay in Ireland is 30% to 40% higher than in the average European country.  Of course the cost of living is also higher.  Our national minimum wage is in the top three or five in cash terms.  Even when we adjust for purchasing power parity the cost of living is still in the top five or six of European countries.  These are other facts.  What the Deputy said is true but what I have said is equally true.</p>  <p>  When it comes to the national minimum wage governments, including governments the Deputy's party was involved in, have always accepted the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission.  It is true that we do not have to and we could reject it.  We could say it did not matter that there was a very clear majority in favour of a recommendation and that we were rejecting it.  I have to have regard to small businesses also.  Many of them say they will struggle to pay the increase in the minimum wage.  I think I have made the right call.  If the number of people in work in Ireland this time next year has not fallen then I have made the right call but if it does fall I have to have regard to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500011#J00400"><p>The Minister mentioned again that he does not have to accept the recommendation.  My point is that he could take it as the minimal rate by which he could increase it.  He could increase it by more.  He has to recognise the number of people on low pay and the costs they already have.  We have had a cost-of-living issue in Ireland for as long as I can remember.  There are various costs I have listed that people in Ireland are expected to pay that those in other countries do not.  Those who come down from the North to live here are stunned by the fact they have to pay for school books and GP visits.  These are very real things in the cost of living in Ireland.  I have not mentioned housing or accommodation.  I did mention childcare.</p>  <p>  The point on the minimum wage increase is that the Minister could take the recommendation as 80 cent at a minimum.  He has already made a commitment to move to a living wage so let us do it.  We recognise now that all of these elements in the Irish economy are building up on families who are not able to afford them.  Those at the lowest level will need extra support from the Government.  The living wage would be a realistic measure to take to address it and give comfort to those workers at the lowest level in our economy.  Most of them are women and they are disproportionately migrants.</p></speech>

There is a cohort of workers not covered by either of these who are being creased by inflation.  They desperately need a pay rise.  The Minister and I both know, whether we say it publicly or not, that the best way for a worker to achieve a pay rise is not to wait around for the Government to grant it but to join a trade union, get active in that trade union and bargain at local level.  In this regard I ask the T&aacute;naiste for an update on the transposition of the directive on collective bargaining.  When can we see legislation for the right to collective bargaining before the House?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500011#J00600"><p>I thank the Deputies.  The directive is still under negotiation at European level as far as I am aware.  It has to be agreed at European level before it can be transposed.  I cannot give the Deputy a timeline on it unfortunately but we will transpose it once it is agreed.  We are supportive of its general principles.</p>  <p>  With regard to the increase in the national minimum wage, it is an 80 cent increase.  It is the biggest single increase that has ever occurred other than the reversal of the &euro;1 cut but I do not consider that to have been an increase.  It is worth approximately &euro;1,600 a year to somebody on the minimum wage who is working full-time.  It brings us closer to the target of a living wage, which is recommended to be set at 60% of median wages.  That would be &euro;13.10.  We are indicating to employers that this is where we would be if we had a living wage today if they could afford to pay it.  It is an increase of 7.6%.  It is not at the rate of inflation but it is not that far behind it.  Other help is on the way, and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in will see that the other help on the way in the budget will be of particular benefit to people on low incomes.  When we add this help to the 7.6% it will fully protect people on the minimum wage from inflation.  I agree with the Deputy's fundamental point that it is not just about pay but about how much of it people get to take home.  It is also about how far that money goes.  This is why we need pay rises, income tax reductions and a reduction in the cost of living in areas such as childcare and education.</p></speech>

Construction of the third advanced building solution in Waterford will also benefit Carlow as will the various developments in Kilkenny.  There is a lot going on in the counties represented by the Deputy from IDA Ireland's point of view and rightly so because it is very committed to the regions.

This approval is a key step in the delivery of the next LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  A number of further steps will now be completed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in advance of bringing the CAP plan to Government for final approval in the coming weeks.  My Department's focus now is to finalise the design of the new LEADER programme in conjunction with key stakeholders.  There will be a two-stage process to select local action groups to implement the new programme.  The first will be an expression of interest by eligible groups, followed by a more detailed stage which will see them develop their LEADER strategies.  I hope to confirm full details of this process shortly.  I am confident the programme will fully adhere to the seven core principles of LEADER and comply with all the EU regulations that govern the programme.</p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;180 million has been allocated for the LEADER programme for the period 2023 to 2027, and I am confident all of this funding will be allocated to the local action groups.  It is now important the key public and private stakeholders in communities throughout Ireland come together in partnership to deliver a LEADER programme that will build on the fantastic success of the programme over the past 30 years and ensure LEADER  continues to play a central role in supporting rural communities into the future.</p></speech>

There is no doubt it has made a real difference in communities.  The Minister cited the budget and the &euro;180 million for the four-year period, which is approximately &euro;36 million per year.  We know in the previous period of 2017 to 2020, there was a budget of &euro;250 million, which meant approximately &euro;55 million for what ended up being almost a four-and-a-half-year period.  The Minister will know that the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, has raised concerns about the budget for this upcoming period.  Is the Minister looking at that &euro;180 million in this budget or is she leaving is at &euro;180 million?  She will be aware that the ILDN has asked for the maximum allowable Exchequer funding for this 2023 to 2027 period.</p></speech>

Some &euro;70 million has already been provided to fund the transition programme from 2021 to 2022.  A further &euro;180 million has been committed to for 2023 to 2027.  We will be funding that.  On top of this core funding, additional administration Exchequer funding has been put in place for LEADER groups which have exhausted all such existing funding in 2022.  I wanted to make sure there would be no stoppages and groups would be able to continue to pay staff, because we knew this programme was coming very soon.  It gives local action groups certainty regarding their funding until the new programme is operational.  As far as I concerned, they got &euro;250 million of LEADER funding in the last programme and they will get &euro;250 million in this programme.</p></speech>

I also want to ask the Minister about the timing for the programme.  I know she has gone through the stages, and stage 1 will be launched this month.  That is what has been said.  Regarding the start of the LEADER programme for 2023, does the Minister have any idea when that will be?  I presume, with the process that has to be gone through for the selection process, it will not be ready for January.  Perhaps the Minister could speak to that.</p>  <p>  I note, and the Minister will be aware of this, and she said there was extensive engagement on the next LEADER programme, that consideration was given to the establishment of a stand-alone subregional area for the offshore islands.  The Minister will be aware those representative bodies for the islands are disappointed that has not come to fruition and that they will not have their own stand-alone local action groups which they sought.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that also.</p></speech>

I will be happy to give further details at that stage.</p>  <p>  On the issue of steps, the first step is the expression of interest, which we hope to put out in the coming weeks.  When expressions of interest come in, I want stakeholders to collaborate and put together their strategies, which will then be submitted to us.  Partnership is the key message in LEADER.  When the strategies come in, they will be evaluated.  I was asking my officials how we would allocate the funding to each successful group.  It will be similar to the last time in that it will be based on population and deprivation.  The stakeholders have also been asked for their views.  We have consulted all the way on this.  An independent panel will assess the tenders when they come in.  This is an important LEADER programme and I am delighted it is on its way now.  We got confirmation from Europe sooner than we thought so we are ready to go.</p></speech>

Will she outline what engagement she and her officials have had with the Minster and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with regard to what is a very exciting fund and scheme especially for rural towns and villages?  It is very welcome.  I wonder what role the Minister played with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

The fund is initially focused on supporting the refurbishment of vacant homes in regional towns and villages and is a key funding support under the town centre first policy which was jointly developed by my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The publication of town centre first was a key deliverable under Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  The fund is being delivered by local authorities and will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages throughout Ireland, initially through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, with priority given to areas where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high.  There are more than 500 towns and villages in Ireland with a population of more than 400 people.  It is intended that the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund will apply in all such towns, and also to some smaller villages.  Funding is not currently available for towns within the city and suburb boundaries of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</p>  <p>  Each local authority should prioritise consideration of applications in town and village locations based on the following criteria: the overall levels of vacancy and dereliction within the town or village; alignment with policies of the relevant development plan, including areas identified for regeneration; and the role that the fund might play as part of wider town regeneration, especially in the light of emerging town centre first plans.  I am committed to ensuring the continued roll out of the town centre first policy will work to deliver on the goal of revitalising rural towns and villages as set out in Our Rural Future.</p></speech>

I have come across a number of cases, for example, a young lad on the road from us is in a village in a country area that does not have a population of more than 400 people.  The house he has bought has been empty, definitely throughout my lifetime.  He is doing it up but he will not get any assistance because the population of the village is not greater than 400.</p>  <p>  Do local authorities have autonomy in this scheme?  I appreciate the rules are there for a reason, but would it be the case that if they prioritised all of the eligible applications and there were a few that did not meet that 400 figure, there would be wriggle room?  Any house that is being brought back into life in villages should be supported.  Is there any wriggle room with regard to eligibility?</p></speech>

I am sure there will be more cases like the one she has just outlined.  The criteria were set as towns and villages with a population of over 400 people.  First of all, this is a great scheme and I think everybody agrees with that.  I am getting a lot of calls from Fine Gael Deputies in particular.  Even last night at a meeting it was raised with me.  I have been asked can we not expand it further and can we not bring it out into rural areas and can we not make it available for towns and villages with fewer than 400 people.</p>  <p>  I worked with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and fair play to him, he got this up and running.  This is a new scheme.  It is out this year.  If we can just let it bed in then we can look at expanding it further.  I expect there will be good interest in it.  It is a good start.  I said to somebody last night that we will have to crawl before we walk on this one.  It is something I talked about a long time ago and fair play, it has become a reality now.  It is the right thing to do.  We all know these houses in towns and villages.  They are serviced, that is, the water supply and sewerage is there, so we should be able to renovate them easily.  They are great as a starter home for young people who want to get on the property ladder.  We are doing other stuff in my Department as well.  I take the Deputy's point.  I will raise it with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, but to be fair to him we had better let this get bedded in first.</p></speech>

It is a good one and is needed.  However, I take it from her answer local authorities do not have autonomy.  It would be great if where the authorities have an allocation of X amount of money, do not spend it all and there are a few applications that are on serviced roads where the water and all that is there, they could decide to allocate it to those sites.  The decisions about that would be best made by local authorities on the ground that are closer to an area.</p>  <p>  I have another point to raise.  I read in the document there would be interim reviews as this goes along.  Does the Minister know when the first review will be?</p>  <p>  This is a really good scheme.  It is an exciting scheme for towns and villages.  However, the figure of 2,000 homes to be delivered by 2025 is low given we probably have about 166,000 vacant homes across this State.  Those are not all in rural areas but that figure should be looked at.  We should perhaps be more ambitious about the number of houses we want to see restored because in many cases, in many towns and villages, we do not need to build as we can restore what is there and make a massive difference to communities.</p></speech>

She is right that the fund is being rolled out through the local authorities.  As to the flexibility, I am not all over the detail but you can get &euro;30,000.  If the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of &euro;30,000 then a maximum top-up grant of up to &euro;20,000 will be available where the property is confirmed to be derelict.  This brings the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.  Applications are to be made to the vacant homes officer in the relevant local authority, so maybe that officer could write to the Department to see if there is any flexibility in that.  I take the Deputy's point and fully understand where she is coming from because I am sure we will all be getting these same questions in our constituency offices.  As far as my role in town centre renewal and regeneration is concerned, there are a number of funds there.  Only this year I gave local authorities funding of &euro;400,000 to acquire buildings.  These are old buildings in the towns, be that the Garda station, the old post office, bank or whatever.  Each local authority was given &euro;400,000 and they could identify two properties and buy them to turn them over to community use.  The Deputy knows there are loads of other initiatives for addressing dereliction and bringing new life back into our towns.</p></speech>

Funding of &euro;279 million has been approved to date under the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, for 191 projects nationwide costing over &euro;379 million.  Calls for applications to the fund are sought under two categories, namely, category 1 and category 2.  Category 1 relates to large-scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place and which are ready to proceed.  Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls for category 1 applications.  The third call for category 2 applications was completed in January 2022.  I announced funding of &euro;21.5 million for 27 projects from this call.  This included &euro;1.2 million for the Rialto Digital and Enterprise Hub project located in Nenagh.  The fourth call for category 1 applications to the RRDF closed on 29 April.  My Department received 42 applications to this call, which together sought funding of over &euro;149 million.  I understand that three applications for projects located in Tipperary were submitted to this call.</p>  <p>  The application process for the fund is competitive in nature.  Applications are currently being assessed by my Department under the oversight of the project advisory board, which is comprised of representatives from key Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department will prepare a report setting out recommended projects.  My role as Minister will be to consider that report and make final decisions in relation to the allocation of funding.  I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I thank her also for visiting Tipperary.  She visited Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Tipperary town and went on to some towns in the north of the county.  Towns like Nenagh have got major funding and we do not begrudge them that but Carrick-on-Suir has been devastated by lack of industry for decades.  Cahir has good employment.  It is a beautiful town and indeed the new King visited there in spring of this year.  It is a big tourist town and the county council has put huge work into car parking and redevelopment of the square, though everybody might not agree with it and I have my own concerns about the parking issues.  Roscrea is also a town that has been hammered and has not got any major investment.  These are the kind of towns that, as I have said before, must get some of this funding because they are falling off the ladder if they cannot get the funding.  We cannot have it all for the main towns; it is a rural redevelopment fund.  I look forward to a favourable outcome for the three applications from Tipperary of the 42 submitted nationally.  We hope there will be good news for Tiobraid &Aacute;rann and good news for Carrick-on-Suir, Cahir and Roscrea.</p></speech>

Over &euro;15.1 million in funding has been allocated to projects in Tipperary in that period.  The Deputy was with me when I was down there and the work that is going on is wonderful.  I was in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and I was on the blueway.  That is a wonderful connection and a real boost to that whole area.  I was in Tipperary town and there has been good investment there.  It was only this year I announced a further &euro;500,000, I think it was, for Tipperary town for town centre work.  That was in February under the town and village renewal scheme, so there is major development going on there as well.</p>  <p>  I am aware there are three more applications in and as I said they are being assessed.  I do not see them until they come to my desk, having gone through the process.</p></speech>

She is welcome any time in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  I acknowledge we have been successful in funding in the major urban centres of Nenagh and Clonmel but this scheme is tailor-made to try to bring vitality back to rural towns.  The Minister will not be disparaging the fact we got the fourth-highest funding allocation in the country.  As she knows, "Where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows" was the old adage.</p> <p>The Minister would be welcome any time to come back, and please God she will come back and make the announcement of the funding for Carrick-on-Suir, Roscrea and, indeed, my own town of Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh.  I thank the Minister for visiting the last time.  I compliment the county council and the task force in Tipperary town and the groups in Nenagh.  Without good, proper applications and a lot of detailed work, people will not get any funding.  I compliment all involved in the towns that have been successful and those involved with the present applications that are gone in.  Enormous work has gone into them and great enthusiasm which it is hoped will be rewarded.</p></speech>

He is right that good applications have to come in.  I cannot give them funding unless I get the applications.  For those towns in Tipperary that have not got any funding, they should work with the local authority.  The applications come in through the local authority, as the Deputy knows.  If I do not get an application, there is no chance of getting funding.  I see here that the activating Cahir's town centre regeneration strategy is seeking funding of &euro;11.9 million.  Carrick-on-Suir is another town looking for money.  Reimagining and regenerating Gantly Road is seeking funding of &euro;4.5 million, and then Cahir's town centre is a fairly big project, looking for funding of &euro;11.9 million.  It involves a number of interventions that will assist regeneration in the centre of the town and allow for significant future growth.  It includes refurbishment of prominent buildings to create an enterprise hub, a new library and public realm.  There are good, exciting applications coming in from Tipperary.  They are in the assessment process.  If the county's past record is anything to go by, it has been very successful in its applications.  We will work on that.</p></speech>

I raise the issue of the increase in costs that community groups are suffering under at the moment.  With the increasing fuel and insurance costs coming home to roost for every community group, they are going to find it very hard to continue providing their services in community areas unless there is recognition by the Department that additional funding is required.  The object of the exercise is to make sure they continue to provide the services.</p></reply>

Given this, the supports provided by the Department to assist communities are more important than ever.  The Department was allocated &euro;378 million for 2022, which will enable continued delivery of a wide range of measures to support communities and address emerging needs.  Last November, we launched the &euro;9 million community activities fund under the community enhancement programme.  This fund allowed groups in disadvantaged areas to apply for funding for their running costs, such as utility or insurance bills.  Groups could also apply for funding to carry out repairs and to purchase equipment within their communities.  It is hoped to run another programme later this year.  I also refer to the expansion of the community services programme support fund, which I announced last week.  An additional &euro;1 million was added to that for the remainder of this year.  We have in excess of 400 community services programme projects throughout the country.</p>  <p>  A key part of the Department's mission is to support social enterprises, and the &euro;1.5 million scaling up scheme for social enterprise was launched by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys in July.  It will provide some much-needed capital to social enterprises nationwide, including those operating in the circular economy.  This will enable them to grow their operations and strengthen their impact on the communities they serve.  In addition, the Department continues to provide a wide range of supports to communities, including, among others, the community and voluntary supports programme, the empowering communities fund and the scheme to support national organisations.  I am confident these funding supports and policies provided will continue to deliver tangible benefits for all communities.  The Department continues to engage with rural and urban stakeholders to identify and respond to issues that are having an impact on communities.  I will also continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues to monitor issues that have an impact on communities in order to respond to emerging needs.</p></speech>

It is important this continues.  With the unprecedented level of increase that is happening in trying to keep community groups and facilities open and running between heating, lighting, insurance and the cost of buying materials to maintain these facilities, it is important that additional funding is made available as part of the cost-of-living element of the upcoming budget.  This would ensure these community groups can continue to put on the lights and heat, run the card games in their facilities, cut the grass and keep the places looking well, as well as providing additional resources within the community facilities when they have them.  Oftentimes the easiest part of a community group's action is to provide or build a facility.  The biggest problem is maintenance and sustainability going forward.  Right now there is a crisis.  I am hoping additional funding will be provided.</p></speech>

That case was made when I was in Galway and Ballinasloe last week.  Galway Rural Development made the case very well.  I also had a good meeting in the Connacht Hotel with a group of 60-plus community employment supervisors.  They certainly made the case around costs and made some good suggestions about what we could do in terms of materials grants as well.  That is not a matter for this Department but it is relevant to the wider community and voluntary sector which they work with on a community-wide basis throughout the country.  To give wider assurance, I and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, have discussed this issue.  It has an impact on other Departments as well.  There is live consideration being given to the broader issue that is facing the community and voluntary sector in terms of the increased costs they are going to have this winter.</p></speech>

I will state again the importance of what the Department of Rural and Community Development has been doing for community groups throughout the country.  It has been the backbone of the revival of a lot of parishes where they had facilities but did not have the wherewithal to get them running and back into use.  We now see a lot of that.  I have seen it right across my own constituency, where pristine facilities are now in place, and the question is how we keep them going and keep them up to the standard that was created with the help of the Department.  I acknowledge the work that was carried out by the previous Minister, Deputy Ring in making sure communities throughout the country received the support they deserve.  They appreciate it as well, which is the important thing.  We want to make sure they are protected through this phase of the crisis we have at the moment.</p></speech>

It is a good opportunity for me to mention another avenue in respect of cost issues such as lighting and heating, namely, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  On energy generation projects, the climate action plan sets a clear goal for renewable energy delivered through local community-based projects.  These projects will be delivered through the dedicated community category in the renewable electricity support scheme, as well as through microgeneration and small-scale generation schemes.  These are real options for community groups as well.  Only last night in Skerries in my own constituency I attended a meeting of the Skerries sustainable energy community.  They are working with the SEAI to do an assessment of the energy needs and energy consumption of the whole town.  They are working with community and sports groups in the town to see what needs to be done to upgrade their facilities, and they will do so in a cost-effective way by doing it collectively.  I flag the opportunity for community groups to work with the SEAI to improve the running of their facilities and their costs overall in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

The ones that have commenced working are working very well and I congratulate the Minister.  As other Deputies have said, she is very welcome to visit County Louth any time.  I refer to Ardee, Carlingford, Drogheda and St. Fechin's GAA.</p>  <p>There are huge benefits to local connected hubs.  They are keeping commuters at home and keeping families closer together.  It is hugely important.  Does the Minister have any plans for future hubs in County Louth?</p></reply>

Therefore, in May 2021, I launched the national hub network and its online platform, namely, <i>connectedhubs.ie</i>.  The network brings together a. range of hubs catering for a wide variety of enterprise, community, remote and co-working needs.  The national hub network currently comprises of 281 hubs across the State.  I anticipate that 300 hubs will be live on <i>connectedhubs.ie</i>by the end of this year and at least 400 hubs will be on board by the end of 2025.  Eight of the 281 hubs on the <i>connectedhubs.ie</i>platform today are located in County Louth and a further ten hubs throughout the county have been invited to join the network.</p><p>I am pleased to confirm that my Department continues to provide support for the establishment and development of hubs through a range of its schemes.  For example, a number of the hubs in Louth were successful under the first two connected hubs funding calls which provided support for hubs in developing their facilities and their capacity, while my Department also continues to invest significantly in hubs through schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund.</p><p>I remain committed to leveraging Ireland's hub sector as a key asset in ensuring that we can deliver on the Government's vision for rural Ireland as set out in Our Rural Future.  The Deputy was absolutely right when he said that people can work in a hub the same way as they can work in a city.  The hubs are all well kitted out.  I have been to see many of them.  We would like to encourage more people to take them up because it saves that long commute and it is better for the environment.  Remote working has been a game-changer for rural Ireland.  I am very committed to it.</p></speech>

If I heard her correctly, there are ten other hubs in County Louth that have been invited in.  If I could have the list whenever it is available, it will be very welcome.</p>  <p>  Dunleer needs a new library, and putting a hub in Dunleer would be a great idea.  I appreciate that I do not have all the detail on who has applied, also in Louth village and in east Meath.  At the bottom line, the transformation of our society because of Covid, and obviously the fact that we want to reduce our commute and climate change, mean the Minister&rsquo;s connected hubs are a key facility for everybody.  They should have a huge transformational impact on those communities which would otherwise have nobody in them during the day.  It helps the local economy but, most of all, it keeps people near their families and their children going to and from school.  It has huge other benefits as well.  I hope the Minister keeps up the good work and circulates that list.  </p>  <p>  My other question is on east Meath.  I did not ask it in the parliamentary question.  What is the situation in east Meath?  I can follow it up with the Minister later.</p></speech>

Those are two outstanding centres in terms of what they are doing there.  I recall it was in The Mill in Drogheda that I launched the remote working app.  I have been in both places this year.</p>  <p>  The connected hubs fund is there to support centres, whether they are private or publicly owned, to upgrade their facilities.  For example, they could put in a privacy pod and improve their facilities.  </p>  <p>  It is up to the local authorities to bid for funding and there are a number of different funding streams in my Department where they can acquire buildings and have a remote working space in them.  They can apply under the town and village renewal scheme.  There is also the buildings acquisition fund, where I give every local authority &euro;400,000 to allow it to buy two properties to turn those into community facilities, and part of that could be for a remote working hub.  Perhaps some of the places that do not have it need to engage with the local authority and see what they can do there.  There are private operators that get the support as well. </p>  <p>  On Dunleer, libraries fall under my Department as well.  Perhaps the Deputy wants to engage with me on that.  I do not have the list of the ten hubs, but I can get it for him.</p></speech>

Again, it is the transformation of our society.  It is focused on keeping people as near to their homes as they can to work.  As I said, it is a huge benefit to those communities.  We hear much criticism of the Government but the funding that the Minister announced that she spent and will be spending is what the country needs.  It is a banner she can be proud to hold high.  Indeed, I welcome all the work the Minister is doing.</p></speech>

It was designed to encourage those who have never used a hub to try it for free.  It was like a sample or taster.  A person could go in and use the hub for three days, free of charge.  I was encouraging people to go in, try them out and see what they thought, because sitting at home is not a good idea.  At least in a hub one can have a bit of interaction and talk to people.  It is secure and the desks are at the right height.  One will not be going home in the evening or getting up from the kitchen table with a sore back.  It is much better for people to use the hubs.  I am encouraging people to get out there and try them.</p>  <p>  In June, we had 1,800 users registered on the connected hubs platform.  Since the announcement of the voucher scheme, the number of registered users has gone up to more than 8,000.  We want to keep this momentum going; I do not want to lose it.  I want to encourage employers as well to engage with their staff and see whether remote working would work for them.  I do not believe that remote working means less productivity; in fact, I think productivity goes up.</p></speech>

It is the first stretch of road that people will drive in the morning, the last they will drive in the evening and probably the most frequently driven piece of road.  The local improvement scheme is the only hope for tarring these roads.  Having enough funding and making it available to the widest number of people is important.  Can the Minister give an outline of funding to run that important scheme?</p></reply>

I am well aware of local improvement schemes because there are many lanes where I live that have benefited as, indeed, I am sure the Deputy is aware of many in his area as well.</p>  <p>  As part of Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to ensuring that the local improvement scheme, LIS, is funded into the future.  The LIS supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities.  The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  There is a strong demand under LIS, not only in Cork, but right across rural Ireland.  The scheme was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding.  From 2017 to 2021, improvement works have been completed on more than 3,000 non-public roads and lanes, benefiting more than 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas. </p>  <p>  In 2021 alone, &euro;1.4 million was allocated to Cork under the scheme.  I was pleased, as part of budget 2022, to announce an increase in the base funding from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million this year.  I then announced details of the first round of funding under LIS in early April.  That included the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency in Cork, which got &euro;879,099.</p>  <p>  To address the strong demand, and following the identification of savings in other capital areas, I was delighted to be in a position to double the overall provision for the scheme to &euro;22 million this year.  In 2022, LIS has &euro;22 million.  Under the second round of funding, I increased the allocation to Cork to almost &euro;1.3 million this year.  </p>  <p>  Since LIS was reintroduced in 2017, aggregate investment has now surpassed the &euro;100 million mark.  This is clear testament to Government&rsquo;s commitment in Our Rural Future to improve rural connectivity.  County Cork has been allocated more than &euro;7.36 million since its reintroduction in 2017.  In fairness, the former Minister, Deputy Ring, was the man who brought this back.  It is a good scheme.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the increase in funding, as it is very constructive.  What it means locally is that in our own area, there are four lanes instead of three being tarred.  Additional families can benefit from that.</p> <p>As well as the increase in funding, there is also, unfortunately, an increase in the rules and conditions that apply.  That is a difficulty for many of the participants.  The Minister is familiar with the demand for the scheme and that some people have been waiting for several years to be approved.  When their turn comes, they may find there are two landowners and everybody involved has to take part in the scheme.  This makes it difficult in some cases.  People who qualified when they originally applied find they are in trouble several years later.  Not everybody will be able to participate in the scheme.  There are people who genuinely cannot afford to do it and will not put their name on the application.  There may be people who do not agree with one another.  The land may be rented or the farmyard may be on another road and the farmer may be not using the road.  They are required to provide a significant amount of information such as a map, herd number and so on.  These are additional conditions that are not required of householders.  There is an increase in conditions that makes it more difficult to access.  We want it to be available to the widest possible range of people.</p></speech>

My priority is to deal with the applications on hand in the local authorities based on the current criteria and to continue to support the rural farming community.  Once this backlog of applications is addressed, we can look at widening the criteria.</p>  <p>  There are many schemes.  My Department is a small one and we do not have a massive budget.  The Deputy might urge me to put more money into the scheme.  I have put more money into it in the past two years.  The baseline is &euro;11 million and it will take time to clear the backlog.  The Minister for Transport, however, should be matching the funding I am putting into the LIS because that would mean we would get more done and would be able to look at the criteria more quickly.  I have raised the matter with him.  I do not know if the Deputy agrees with me but I think if the funding were matched, that would be beneficial.  It always came out of the Department of Transport.</p></speech>

We want to make sure the maximum number of householders can benefit from it.  In the context of the change in the conditions, people who were queueing for several years may now find they are not able to get everybody involved to participate in the scheme.  It may be that a landowner is not taking part or the land is rented.  By the way, there is no appeal mechanism available for people to question or challenge a decision.  That needs to be examined.</p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the question referred to all local authorities in Cork.  There are two local authorities in the county.  The expanded boundary change means people who were making applications in Ballinora, Blarney and other locations that were in the Cork County Council area are now at sea.  Is there funding available for them?  It is important they are able to access funding and have an opportunity, similar to that available to people in the rest of the country, to have their roads tarred.</p></speech>

The money has been allocated to the county.  I would love to give every county more money for the LIS, but if I were to do so, I would be taking the money out of other schemes.  I have to try to balance these budgets.  The point is Cork County Council and Cork City Council can figure that out themselves.  The funding is being made available.  The boundaries were changed but I continue to support County Cork in terms of the allocation it gets.  It got &euro;1.4 million this year.  There is a lot of funding going into the county.  The Deputy is aware that only last week there was a further announcement of CL&Aacute;R projects.  There is a lot of investment.  Millstreet Community Council got another &euro;50,000 for a gym, for example.  I am trying to do a lot of things.  Sometimes it is a case of loaves and fishes but we try to spread it out as fairly as we can.</p></speech>

Indeed, the programme for Government includes a commitment in this regard and, as Minister with responsibility for the islands, I am determined to ensure the policy is delivered.  I have received an initial working draft of the policy, which sets out the context for the policy and defines strategic objectives.  I will be meeting with my officials in the coming days to review the overall direction of the policy and discuss the next steps and timeline for completion.</p>  <p>  The Government's ambition for a national policy and action plan for the islands was set out in chapter 10 of Our Rural Future, the action plan for rural development 2021-2025, published in 2021.  The Deputy will be aware an extensive consultation process has been completed by my Department, including meetings with island communities and relevant Departments and agencies.  The feedback from this consultation process provided a valuable insight into the key priorities, and indeed challenges and opportunities, for our island communities.</p>  <p>  An interdepartmental committee for the islands was established and its most recent meeting was held on 22 June 2022, where it was agreed committee members would review their Department's draft input and revert with revised actions.  I understand the interdepartmental committee is scheduled to meet again in October, when members will be able to share their feedback, observations and recommendations regarding the initial draft of the policy.  I expect the policy and action plan to be finalised between now and the end of the year.  It is a long time in the making but it is nearly there and I am glad that is the case.  I am glad I was able to attend the AGM of Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann on &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r, where I got a chance to speak to the representative groups who were there from islands around the country.  It is 26 years in the making and it is nearly there.</p></speech>

She has given a publication date of before the end of the year.  I will be holding her to that.  I take a cynical attitude to this, given the background here.  There has been no policy for the islands.  We have had interdepartmental workforces going back to 1996, yet through that time we have had no development with regard to policy.  By contrast, the islands in Scotland have a comprehensive policy based on legislation and their population is increasing.  The opposite is the case here.</p>  <p>  As regards the working draft, what issues have been identified, given that Members have been inundated with issues from the islands?  The islands are working in a vacuum and we receive constant representations about the c&eacute;anna ar Inis O&iacute;rr agus ar Inis Me&aacute;in, for example.  There is also the debacle relating to the LEADER payment, which I understand Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will be raising later.  The islands have asked that they be treated as one region for the purposes of LEADER .  Of course, there is the issue of housing.  These issues are being raised all the time in a vacuum, with no policy.</p></speech>

There is the need to attract young people back to the islands.  Planning permission is a significant issue.  The islanders are concerned they cannot get planning that would allow young people to return.  I was given the example of a young man who was coming back from America but could not get planning permission to build a house on the island.  There is no doubt there are environmental issues but I do not see why we cannot address these things.  What make islands are people, including young people.  They are looking at issues relating to schools and additional funding for teachers who work on the islands.  I said I would raise that with the Minister, Deputy Foley.</p> <p>The point is that this island policy means that I have to hold other Departments to account.  I want to make sure I get strong commitments from each Department as to how we can improve the situation on islands.  There is no point in having a policy unless we have strong commitments and then I have to keep their toes to the fire to make sure they deliver on these commitments.  We are working with them on that particular issue to get the policy finished and get the commitments from all the different Departments.</p></speech>

She is aware of the issues.  My question is, are those issues reflected in the draft report that is before her?  That is very important.  In regard to the ongoing issues, we can learn from the islands.  They have survived.  They have shown us a sustainable way of living.  Each Government, not just this Government, has utterly failed to deal with the islands in a just and equal way with a comprehensive report based on legislation.  Housing is a major issue on all the islands and particularly the Aran Islands and Inishbofin.  We have problems with the lack of health centres and ongoing problems with na C&eacute;ibheanna.  I am reading correspondence from Inis Me&aacute;in.  People there are despairing in regard to the process on An Caladh M&oacute;r, and the simulation exercise that is going on in the marine centre in Cork, and so on.  Equally people in Inis O&iacute;rr have contacted us as a representative body telling us that the funding model under LEADER is not going to do anything for the islands and will continue the division that has happened up to date, which is not acceptable.  I will not go over my time.</p></speech>

I was on Bere Island, Inishbofin and the Aran Islands over the summer.  The regression in policy in the past ten years is absolutely astounding.  To be honest, the big plan of drawing up a plan is a time-wasting exercise because for example a health policy was developed for the islands and published with great fanfare, but nothing happened.  Things have regressed on that also.  Islands that had full 24-7 nursing cover do not have it anymore.  What they need is not rocket science.  Every time you sit down with the islanders they tell you straight out.  As Deputy Connolly has pointed out they want roads, better ferry services, air services, health and education services and so on.  Nearly every island is unique.  Some are inshore and others are much further out to sea.  Will the Minister tell me how much control has her Department exerted on the other Departments?  Has she insisted that it is her island policy or are we going to get a copy and paste and we normally get with these comprehensive policies, from each Department, telling her what they are already doing, for example telling her what they are doing on planning on the islands, which is as she points out an absolutely critical issue?</p></speech>

I have taken the trouble - I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is a regular visitor to them himself - and have been on Bere Island, I have been on Aranmore twice this year already and one of the visits was to open a wonderful new seafront facility for the islanders there with huge investment under the rural regeneration fund in conjunction with Donegal County Council.  I am personally committed to making sure that we deliver on this island policy but there is no point in having a document if I do not nail down other Departments so that they must deliver.  I mean that.  I will do that.  I will make sure that whenever the document comes, and there has been much consultation on it, that it is a meaningful document with very clear objectives and actions to back up those objectives.  That is what I want to achieve.  It is not easy living on an island.  Deputy Connolly refers to Inis &Oacute;irr and the difficulties there on the pier and the simulation that is going on in Cork.  As I said the last time, it comes up every time in Questions in the House, if I could do it myself I would do it because I am sick wondering when it is going to move on.  How many times do you have to do this or how long does it take to develop it?</p></speech>

It does not work so now it is about how we can make it better.  It is complex.  Significant consultation has been undertaken with island communities.  There has been wide consultation with the Departments and agencies.  Bilateral meetings have been held with 13 Departments and other relevant bodies such as local authorities and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Good progress has been made but I am going to make sure we have it in writing and I will hold them to account.</p></speech>

Rural connectivity is an important element of Our Rural Future.  Such roads represent a vital piece of infrastructure for rural residents providing access to people's homes and farms as well as outdoor amenities such as lakes, rivers and beaches.  The scheme is administered locally by the relevant local authority which is responsible for prioritising and selecting eligible applications within broad parameters set by my Department.  I acknowledge there is strong demand for the scheme and in some counties local authorities have significant levels of applications on hand.  The LIS was re-introduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding in place.  As outlined earlier I am tackling the situation through sustained investment.  Since the LIS scheme was re-introduced in 2017 aggregate investment has now surpassed &euro;100 million.  I have prioritised the scheme in my Department.  While of course there are competing demands on finite resources, in four of the past six years additional resources were directed to the scheme mid-year to address strong demand for the scheme across rural Ireland.  County Clare has secured combined funding of &euro;2.64 million over the past two years.  Indeed since the scheme was re-introduced in 2017 following the establishment of my Department, County Clare has been allocated almost &euro;5 million, representing the sixth largest investment across relevant local authorities.  I am happy that the LIS continues to play an important role in the delivery of our rural development policy, Our Rural Future.</p></speech>

It would be a good idea and I ask the Minister, in view of the fact that so many Deputies are raising this question, that she would ascertain from the local authorities around the country the total value in each case of the valid applications they have on hand and as Deputy Moynihan pointed out that is with restrictive rules.  Only then will we see the absolutely minuscule amount of money that is going into these roads compared with other roads throughout the country.  These are the roads that often lead to people's houses, the one mile of road that they always have to travel.  Will the Minister give an undertaking today to ask each local authority to value the total number of valid applications on hand?  I can guarantee that this is a very large sum of money and needs much more than has been given to it.  If we had that information we could go to the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform and say this has to be dealt with.  It is a national scandal.</p></speech>

I gave &euro;22 million this year in local improvement scheme funding, which I believe is the highest amount that has ever been given.  I doubled it last year also.  There are many competing demands in my Department.  There are other schemes and with each scheme, one may want to know why funding is not forthcoming, whether it is town and village renewal or outdoor recreation schemes, or whether it is the regeneration fund, all of which are investments in rural Ireland.  I have to try to balance things.  From unspent moneys, I was able to move money into the LIS programme because it is also a priority for me.</p>  <p>  I have to say, however, that LIS is tar and that is what it goes to fund, that is, tar and roads.  I would like and I have asked the Minister for Transport to look at providing matched funding to my Department for the local improvement schemes.  It is a priority here and has been raised with me on numerous occasions but I cannot produce all the money.  Money did come out of the Department of Transport at one stage in the past and that Department should look at matching what I have put in from my Department.  My Department is only a very small one and if there was a roads project which was delayed, one would clear the whole list if this money was then diverted to the LIS programme.</p></speech>

When I became Minister, I topped up and matched money from the Department of Transport in the CL&Aacute;R areas as part of the CL&Aacute;R scheme.  If that Department did not give the money I did not give the money.</p>  <p>  To be quite honest, members of the public just see the Exchequer.  They only see one Government constitutionally.  They do not care which pocket the money comes out of because it costs the same thing to the taxpayer, no matter what pocket it comes out of.  Were the Minister to agree to find out what the total demand of valid applications is, we could go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and, if necessary, he could take the money off the Department of Transport and give it to somebody who will spend it on these completely vital roads.  Will the Minister find out what the total demand for the scheme is around the country in order that we have the ammunition to fight her cause for her?</p></speech>

I also have to acknowledge the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, of &euro;2.64 million over the past two years to County Clare.  She actually doubled the funding this year, which is greatly welcomed.  I also believe that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the Department of Transport should be contributing to this scheme.  I also acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s reference in that regard where she has reached out to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  I put in questions as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development in the previous D&aacute;il where we also made recommendations around this.  The Department of Transport needs to come up to the plate and to provide funding for this vital scheme for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister and I have raised it before, which is exactly that same question in respect of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan&rsquo;s Department.  Can the Minister inform the House as to what the response to that question from that Department has been because it is something she has said previously she has sought?  Again, in my constituency in Roscommon and in Galway, but particularly in Galway, there is a very significant backlog and demand is nowhere near being met in respect of the funding that is there.  I believe there may be a job of work for all of us to put pressure on the Department of Transport, together with the Minister, to get this scheme either match-funded or at least to clear the backlog.</p></speech>

I will ask every county council.  My officials are engaging with the local authorities and I will find out how many such applications are outstanding and what the story is.  Believe you me, one gets a great deal of varied information from the different local authorities because they have different ways of working things out and of carrying out assessments.  In any event, I will ask them and I will be delighted to get the support of all of the Deputies in getting more money for the LIS programme.  If I get more money, it will be allocated across the country.  I am doing my best.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said, it was always a Department of Transport fund, but in fairness to the then Minister, Deputy Ring, in 2017 he reopened the programme and we got the ball rolling.  We have a long list, it is in every county in the country and I know all about it.  It is something of which I am very conscious.  I would appreciate the Deputies' support in trying to get more money for this particular fund and I look forward to working with the Deputies.</p></speech>

The Government's ambition for a national policy and action plan for the islands was set out in the programme for Government and included in chapter 10 of Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, an action plan for rural development, published in 2021.  Indeed, the process commenced in December 2019, when a consultation paper was prepared with input from the participating Departments to act as a basis to advance the development of an island policy.  Over the intervening period, there has been an extensive public consultation process with the island communities, through a combination of in-person and online meetings. </p>  <p>  The interdepartmental committee for the islands was established and is chaired by the Department.  The most recent meeting was held on 22 June 2022, where it was agreed that committee members would review their Department's draft input and revert with revised actions.  The next meeting of the interdepartmental committee is scheduled for early October, where it is expected committee members will be able to share their feedback, observations and recommendations regarding the initial draft of the policy.  An initial draft of the policy sets out the context for the policy, provides a high-level analysis of the current opportunities and defines strategic objectives for the policy. </p>  <p>  Finalisation of the policy and action plan is due to be completed in the coming months and it is my intention to have it published by the end of the year.</p></speech>

For her information, the Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands paid a visit to Bere Island and the message that came out strongly was that there are great opportunities for people on the island.  The remote working has a chance to be transformative and the quality of life there is second to none.  The resilience and adaptability of islanders in general was acknowledged.  Common themes across the islands are coming across.  The provision of health services is a another significant one.  In the case of Bere Island, it is the need for a 24-7 cover for their nursing services.  Education is a significant theme and now that the islands allowance has gone, it is very difficult to source substitute cover because if one hears that at 8:50 a.m. that there is no teacher available at the school, one will have a hard time getting somebody in from wherever, in Cork, who may be travelling to Bere Island.</p>  <p>  Childcare is a very significant issue also, as are housing and the cost of living, all of which feed in.  Can the Minister give perhaps some broad outline and are those strands also being reflected in the island policy?  Are these the kinds of common themes that we are going to see reflected in the final strategy?</p></speech>

Indeed, I was on Bere Island last year and I managed to dial in remotely to attend a Cabinet meeting from there.  I have to say that the hospitality I received was second to none.  It is a lovely island.  I met a representative of the island when I was at the annual general meeting, AGM, of Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann on &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r only two weeks ago.  All of the issues the Deputy has mentioned are the ones that keep coming up and the issues that were raised with me at the AGM.  I am happy that because of the extensive consultation, those issues will obviously be part of this new policy on how we are going to address them.  Housing is probably the biggest issue that I took from the meeting, in any event.  I have not seen this draft policy yet.  My officials have it and there are a few bits and pieces that are being attended to and they will be bringing it to me very shortly.  We will have the policy and will get it published then as quickly as we can.</p>  <p>  I also said to the islanders that while a great deal of consultation has gone on, this policy will be a living document and, if we need to change it is as time goes on, we will do so.  The important bit for me is that we get buy-in from the different Departments because we cannot deliver it from my Department alone.  My job will be to pull it all together, ensure it addresses the issues that the islanders have raised, how we look forward, but also to hold the Departments to account to ensure that they deliver on it.</p></speech>

However, I want to share one personal story.  As the Minister knows, I have young children at home myself.  I was talking to a young parent there and I asked about that spectre where, at 3 o'clock in the morning, somebody wakes up with a high fever.  For me, that is a run into Caredoc.  We bundle them into the back of the car and in we go to Caredoc.  I was asking this parent what she does in her situation and she answered with a shrug.  The nurse who is working on Bere Island is nominally not 24-7 but, of course, what happens at 3 a.m. if that child is running a fever?  It is the nurse who receives the call.  These are the kind of basic impediments that stop people living on islands - that basic level of service provision.  All of us here want to see flourishing populations on our islands but I believe we need to provide that minimum level of service on islands that allows people to wake up at 3 a.m. and know where they are going to bring that child with a fever.</p></speech>

There is a really exciting project taking place on Clare Island, where they are looking at e-health and at how they can use new technology to enhance living on the islands.  It is not easy.  I have been there in the good weather but I cannot imagine what it is like in the wintertime.  It cannot be easy.  We want to support our island communities and I am very committed to doing that.  I have been to a good few of the islands and I will continue to maintain that engagement and to keep those lines of communication open.  I am happy to work with the islands.  I know I will get the support of the Deputies in this House when we move forward with this policy to make sure it addresses those issues and that it is an ambitious policy.  I launched Our Rural Future only a year ago and it has been a very successful policy.  I want to see the islands policy in that same space.</p></speech>

Everyone knows that the vacancy and dereliction of community buildings in our towns and villages are a blight not only on those towns, but they are a missed opportunity to deliver an asset that can be really valuable, not to mention the impact they can have on better climate policy.  I urge the Minister to take this very seriously.</p></reply>

The challenges relating to vacancy and dereliction are clearly recognised within Our Rural Future.  Earlier this year, the Government published Town Centre First - A  Policy Approach for Irish Towns.  This is a whole-of-government policy and aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into our town centres.  The policy is underpinned by significant levels of public investment spread across major Government schemes, such as the rural regeneration and development fund, the urban regeneration and development fund, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund and the town and village renewal scheme.</p>  <p>  This year's town and village renewal scheme launched on 27 May with funding of &euro;17 million.  As part of this year's scheme, I have already approved funding of &euro;7.5 million under the building acquisitions measure for 36 vacant and derelict buildings to be purchased by local authorities in rural towns and villages for development as community assets.  This includes the revitalisation of old Garda stations, bank buildings and courthouses for community use.  In August, I announced &euro;2.6 million for 26 rural towns to implement the streetscape enhancement measure to add colour and vibrancy to our town centres.  Further funding is available under my Department's rural regeneration and development fund, as well as the recently launched Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund.</p>  <p>  I have also provided funding for the recruitment of town regeneration officers and the development of Town Centre First masterplans across the country.  These supports will further help local communities to ensure the regeneration of their local towns and villages and to address issues relating to vacancy and dereliction.  I am committed to ensuring that the continued roll-out of the Town Centre First policy will work to deliver on the goal of revitalising rural towns and villages as set out in Our Rural Future.</p></speech>

The reality is that, in climate terms, it takes one tonne for every metre squared for a new build, but just half of that if we bring a previously occupied building into use.  Therefore, not only is this urgent in terms of our need to access community and housing uses, it is absolutely in line with a long-term strategy.  It is an opportunity, at a time when there is a focus on better use of energy and better avoidance of waste, to have a cross-government strategy to address vacancy and dereliction.</p></speech>

Let us face it, the power is connected, the water is connected and it is also connected to the sewerage, so we do not have all of those added costs that apply when a build is started outside the town.  We have been working very hard with local authorities.  Revitalising rural towns and villages is a central objective of Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  The town and village renewal scheme was repurposed with provision for the purchase of vacant properties, and priority was given to projects that bring vacant and derelict buildings and sites back into use as multipurpose spaces and remote working hubs, and for residential occupancy.  More than &euro;19 million was announced for projects in February, &euro;7.5 million for the building acquisitions measure in July and &euro;2.6 million for streetscapes in August.  The streetscapes initiative has proved very popular because it means a town is identified by the local authority and it gets &euro;100,000.  Businesses or community groups can apply for a grant to upgrade the premises or improve the shopfront and paint it.  That is taking place in a few towns and it really has transformed them.  It is a simple enough measure.</p></speech>

The CPO process has been dogged by slowness in moving.  There is only one county that I know of that really takes it seriously, and only one, County Waterford, takes the repair and renewal scheme seriously.  If we want to have a strategy on bringing derelict property into use, we have to get a national focus and not rely on overstretched local authorities, which do not seem to have the capacity to use some of the instruments necessary to drive this on.</p></speech>

There are buildings that are lying vacant for years and we are all wondering why something cannot be done about them.  As the Deputy and I well know, CPO is a complicated process as it stands.  If a project misses one stage on the ladder, it goes back to the start, and that slows it down and delays it.  The Town Centre First policy framework does contain a range of actions designed to achieve these objectives, such as the social and economic revival in towns.  We have appointed Town Centre First officers and these are the things we will expect them to deal with.  We obviously have to look at how we can acquire buildings that are falling down around our ears.</p>  <p>  That is what we have to do.  We will continue to work on it.  It is fair to say that we have made considerable progress, when we look at some of the buildings in towns across the country that have got rural regeneration funding.  There is massive investment to allow them to be repurposed as remote working hubs and for community use.  If somebody cannot get a premises for some service in the town, there is no reason that they cannot go to that community building and find a space there.  There has been massive investment and it is working.  However, as the Deputy said, we have to keep at it and we can never take our foot off the accelerator when it comes to investing in and regenerating our towns and villages.</p></speech>

Community centres are the centre of communities and a place where young people, and not so young people, can gather to do community activities that are badly needed.  From my previous role in the Department of Justice and Equality dealing with youth justice, I know how important these centres are, but many communities do not have one.  What plans does the Minister have to assist those communities to get a centre?</p></reply>

Under the 2022 town and village renewal scheme, where there is a clearly identified and defined need in a town or village that cannot be met by an existing premises, I have included a provision for funding for new-build community centres.  The deadline for applications under the scheme was 22 July 2022 and I expect to be in a position to announce successful applicants later this year.</p>  <p>  Funding for community centre projects may be available through the LEADER transitional programme.  This covers the period 2021 to 2022 and came into effect on 1 April 2021 for new project applications.  The LEADER programme is administered by local action groups, LAGs, in each of the 29 LEADER sub-regional areas around the country.</p>  <p>  The CCIF is a new capital fund with a budget of &euro;15 million to support community groups with the upgrade and refurbishment of existing community centres.  It should be noted that the development of new community centres is not covered by the fund.  It deals with existing centres.</p>  <p>  Separately, my Department currently has a number of schemes that are relevant to community centres, such as the community enhancement programme, CEP.  In 2021, the programme provided &euro;4.5 million in funding for small capital grants for the improvement of facilities.  It is envisaged that the CEP will run again later in 2022.  However, details of the fund and the allocations available have not yet been confirmed.</p>  <p>  I also launched the community activities fund, CAF, last year to support community and voluntary groups impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  This fund helped community groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs, such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities.  The CAF is currently closed for applications.  However, I will keep a future iteration under consideration.</p>  <p>  I am looking at a new scheme for new centres, on which I will elaborate further presently.</p></speech>

Can she tell us when successful applications under the CCIF will be announced and made available?  Many people around the country are waiting for them and I note that a number of colleagues have tabled questions in this regard.  Does she agree that in many communities that do not have a centre, people find it hard to organise themselves to get together, in a situation where there is a lot of responsibility put on communities?  Will she consider supporting community councils in parishes and areas around the country that are trying to establish, or have already established, forums for organising?  As she knows, applying for funding is not easy and there are lots of boxes to be ticked.  Sometimes, people even have to establish a community group as a public limited company and get charitable status.  There is much to do in order to get things done.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that some of them need a good bit of work.  During the Covid period, they were not able to fundraise and carry out the type of annual work they do.  We now have this fund in place and it is very popular.  We got more than 1,000 applications, which, when one adds them all up, amount to a funding request of &euro;72 million.  That is a large amount.  There is a lot of interest in it and I am delighted with that because it shows there is a need for the scheme.  The money is going where it will be used and spent.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there are areas that have had population growth and where a new community centre is badly needed.  I am looking at a scheme for new centres.  Deputies Grealish and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Senator Kyne and the other Galway representatives, including Deputy Connolly, met with me to raise this issue very forcefully.  There is one project in Galway that is shovel ready.  I am looking at a scheme for new centres, which is all I can say to Deputy Stanton.  Any support he can give me in getting a new stream of funding for new community centres would be most welcome.</p></speech>

A total funding request of &euro;72 million from a fund provision of &euro;15 million is a big discrepancy.  We can see there is a large need for this and that great work is being done through the scheme.  Will she respond to my question as to when the results of the CCIF applications will be made known?  There are a lot of people who are anxious to know.  I congratulate her on the work she is doing.  I am sure she will have everyone's support in looking for extra funding for new community centres, especially in new towns and built-up areas that need them badly, particularly in the context of youth justice.</p></speech>

The Newcastle action group in Galway has fought for a centre for a long time, as all Members for the area know.  It has fallen between two stools, having been led in one direction via urban regeneration funding.  It lost out on that, notwithstanding its brilliant application.  This group is a good example of the gap in funding that needs to be met.  I hope the Minister will comment more on the new fund and when she hopes to bring it to fruition.</p></speech>

The applications are being assessed and there is a lot of work in it.  We are going to do it in three phases, with the smaller applications first, the results of which I hope to announce in October.  That is the plan.  They are all being processed and assessed independently and we hope to have the first announcements in October.</p>  <p>  I am working on a new fund for new centres.  I take Deputy Connolly's point about the particular situation in Galway, which has been raised with me on a number of occasions.  All I can say at the moment is that we certainly are looking at what we can do around a new scheme.  The Deputies will appreciate that we have to find &euro;72 million for the existing applications.

That changed in 2018 when the islands lost LAG status, but Comhar na nOile&aacute;n still managed to run the project in Donegal and the Beara Peninsula, including the Cork islands.

This alignment will help to ensure coherence of LEADER funding with other initiatives and policies delivered on a county basis, thus helping to deliver the best impact and value for money under LEADER.  The county structure also allows for the most efficient allocation of funding across the country.  The offshore islands will continue to be aligned with their relevant subregional area and a separate Island LAG will not form part of the LEADER delivery model.</p>  <p>  However, I am aware that island communities have particular needs and priorities and, within the context of the emerging programme, they can play a key role in delivering on those needs.  In recognition of this, a number of important elements will be included in the model for the new programme.</p> <p>Any LAG selected in an area that includes island communities will be required to identify specific actions developed in consultation with the island communities themselves in its LEADER strategy and to include an indicative budget to implement such actions.  In addition, a representative of the island grouping in each subregional area must be included in the decision-making body of the LAG.  I assure the Deputy that the important contribution island communities make to rural and island development has been considered in the design of the new LEADER programme and I am confident this programme can continue to make a real contribution to island communities in the years to come.</p></speech>

Many parents who relied on this service have been left high and dry after being told their children no longer have seats on the school bus.  Incredibly, the public and Deputies are being told by Bus &Eacute;ireann that additional capacity is not being sought for pupils who did not secure a ticket for this school year.  Meanwhile, other parents who applied and paid on time had their children lose out due to the unfair lottery nature of the scheme.  Families that expected to realise savings of &euro;500 will now instead have additional costs heaped on them as they try to find alternatives.  We have a crazy situation where parents are being forced to give up work to get their children to school.  This is an utter mess.</p>  <p>  My constituency offices in Mullingar, Longford and Athlone have been inundated with communications from very worried families who have been relying on the service and now find themselves unable to get their children to school.  I do not doubt that this has also been the case in the offices of the T&aacute;naiste's colleagues.  This has happened because of a Government idea that has been poorly thought out and lacking the necessary investment.  At the root of this problem is the failure of the Government and of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to plan and to deliver the required additional capacity.  The Minister should have anticipated the increase in demand following the introduction of free school transport.  She should have worked with Bus &Eacute;ireann to deliver additional capacity to ensure no child was left behind.  Instead of facing up to her part in this debacle, however, the Minister spent the last few weeks in hiding.  She refused to appear before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to provide answers and, more importantly, solutions for families, despite being offered no less than five alternative dates.  This demonstrates a real lack of respect and understanding of the impact this situation is having.  It is only now, when the school term is well under way, that the Minister has agreed to come before the joint committee.</p>  <p>  Parents were also truly taken aback by the T&aacute;naiste's reported comments at the Fine Gael meeting regarding the Government having made a mistake in waiving school transport fees.  Waiving the school transport fees was not the mistake; the mistake was the failure to invest in the required additional capacity.  Frankly, the Government has made an absolute bags of this situation.  Families need solutions, and they need them now.</p>  <p>  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and O'Rourke, have consistently called for an additional 10,000 places on school transport.  This is the level of investment necessary to get on top of this issue, to get children onto buses to get them to school and to give relief to those parents across the length and breadth of the country who are pulling their hair out with frustration.  The worst part of this situation, though, is that the Government is not even trying to fix the problem.  In black and white, Bus &Eacute;ireann has stated that it is not looking at additional capacity for these children.  The message has been loud and clear: no more buses are planned, simply get on with it.  </p>  <p>  How is the Government going to respond?  What is the Government's plan to ensure that every child in need of a school bus place will get one?  Will the Minister, Deputy Foley, pick up the phone and tell Bus &Eacute;ireann to look for more capacity and more buses to provide more places to undo the existing chaos in the school transport system?</p></speech>

I am keen to answer it.  This is my first time taking Leaders' Questions since the summer break, however, and I am conscious that I do so on the day that Thelma and her little brother Mikey, who died tragically in Westmeath, are being buried today in St. Mel's Cathedral in Longford.  This brings to mind the other children in Ireland who died violently over the past few months.  It was hard not to feel for the fact that we had so many tragedies involving children dying violently over the summer.  Therefore, as we begin this new term, our thoughts are with the families and communities in Tallaght, Westmeath and Waterford who are grieving for loved ones taken too tragically and too soon.  The deaths of children affect us all in ways that we can barely put into words.  It is a sadness that cuts deeply because we know in our hearts that it is not the natural order of things.  It breaks our hearts to have so much joy and laughter silenced in this way.  Therefore, we pray for healing and peace in the days and months ahead.  In this time of tragedy and terrible pain, we in this House share with the families and communities affected our sorrow, our compassion and our love.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question, I acknowledge that school transport is a vital public service.  It benefits tens of thousands of pupils and families around the country.  It is really important, particularly in rural areas, in ensuring that children can get to school.  We are very much aware of the concerns being expressed by parents.  The Deputy can be assured that this has been the biggest issue encountered in recent weeks in the constituency offices of Deputies across the Government parties, particularly in rural constituencies.  This initiative was introduced as a Government measure to help with the cost of going to school, along with an increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the extension of the school meals programme.  The decision was made to waive all fees, saving families up to &euro;650, relative to last year.  There may be a nominal fee next year, perhaps, but that is a matter for next year.  I accept that the issue this year is one of capacity.</p>  <p>  In total, 124,000 tickets have been issued as of September, and this is an increase of 21,000 on last year.  Therefore, there is a lot of extra capacity, and it is not fair to say that the Minister, Deputy Foley, did not plan for that.  The additional 21,000 tickets do not represent a small number but I appreciate, however, that it may not have been enough.  This capacity has been secured from Bus &Eacute;ireann and it continues to process applications.  It is scheduling additional services in line with the scheme's eligibility criteria.  The Minister, as Deputy Clarke mentioned, is going to go before the joint committee soon and she will be happy to answer any questions Deputies have, including questions and proposals they may have concerning additional capacity and engagement with Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with the passer-by who came to their aid, those in the medical services, the staff in the hospital and all those first responders, as well as with the children of St. Cremin's National School and the Montessori institution that the children attended.  Their loss has left an indelible mark, not just on Multyfarnham and Rathowen, but extending to the wider community and across the country.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the importance of school transport to rural areas.  He is correct about that.  He referred to the concerns of parents as well.  He is again correct.  He also mentioned the vital nature of the service, and he is again right in this regard.  I must, however, put it to him that those 21,000 additional tickets come nowhere near meeting the demand existing in rural communities.  If we are serious about tackling our carbon footprint and if we want to increase accessibility to schools, then a vital part of doing that is the school transport system.   It requires fundamental reform and significant investment to ensure it is fit for purpose, not only for children now but also in future.  We have an utterly bizarre situation now where staff in the regional hospital in Mullingar cannot get their children to school.  What does it say about us as a society and a State that we could not simply do the maths in this regard and figure out what additional capacity was needed?</p> <p>I cannot be the only TD in this room whose phone started ringing the minute that announcement was made with expressions of interest from parents.  I do not doubt for one second that the Minister, Deputy Foley, received those calls also.  What I do not understand and do not accept is the utter failure to plan in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500022#U00200"><p>As I pointed out in my initial response, there was planning and additional capacity was provided.  Twenty-one thousand extra tickets this year means 21,000 more children across rural Ireland on school buses this year versus last year.  That is a big increase in additional capacity and would be welcomed by many families, who did not have school transport before, now availing of it.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where they are in operation.  For those who are eligible, we are confident that they will be accommodated.  Where it comes to concessionary tickets, as the Deputy will be aware, and as is always the case, that is more complicated.  That requires there to be availability and that is the issue that is arising now.</p>  <p>  As I say, the Minister, Deputy Foley, will be before the committee and will be happy to answer questions and hear suggestions from Deputies as to how we can resolve it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500022#U00400"><p>I too would like to be associated with the T&aacute;naiste's remarks about the awful tragedies we have seen in relation to children in the past month or so.</p>  <p>  Energy prices are now out of control.  They are obliterating the incomes of workers and families and threatening the survival of so many businesses.  In June, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, reported that a record 29% of households were in energy poverty.  Following recent price hikes, that figure has already jumped to 43%.  In a few weeks or months, we could be facing a catastrophe in which 70% of households are in energy poverty.  This is not sustainable for either families or businesses and the immense uncertainty about how bad the crisis could get and how high prices could go is causing a huge degree of stress and anxiety.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the energy market is broken.  When markets are broken, it is the job of the State to intervene.  Given the scale of this crisis, that intervention will have to be huge.</p>  <p>  One of those interventions must be a windfall tax.  It is grotesque to see the level of obscene profiteering by energy companies which is accompanying an energy crisis caused by Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine which is causing so much death, destruction and suffering.</p>  <p>  While it is welcome that the EU is now moving ahead with a windfall tax, it is regrettable that it has taken so long to act.  Energy companies have been making lavish profits all year.  In fact, profits surged last year when energy prices soared as economies came out of lockdown and demand increased.  Vermilion Energy, which owns the Corrib Gas Field, increased its profits four-fold to &euro;152.8 million last year.  The average price it received for gas in the final quarter of 2021 was more than nine times the average price for 2020.  We can only assume the prices it is receiving this year are off the Richter scale.</p>  <p>  Renewable energy companies are reaping profits they never imagined in their wildest dreams.  It is not because of any innovation on their part.  It is because the price of electricity produced with renewables is linked to the price of gas.  The EU has now proposed capping the price renewable companies can earn to &euro;180/MWh with the remainder being recouped by governments.  It is not clear why this figure of &euro;180/MWh was chosen.  It is true it represents a halving of recent market prices but those prices were signs of a market imploding.  This week gas prices fell to &euro;200/MWh, which is still six times what was being charged last year.  Is not the point of renewable energy that it is clean and much cheaper than fossil fuels?</p>  <p>  I hope the T&aacute;naiste can clarify some of these points.  When will the Government introduce the windfall tax?  Will it be backdated to capture the obscene profits that have been made this year?  How much does the Government expect to raise?  Why, under the EU plans, is the cap proposed on renewable energy generators so high?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500022#U00500"><p>I want to acknowledge that everyone in government is very much seized and very much aware of the cost-of-living crisis, how it is impacting on people's household bills and many people having to make difficult decisions about what they spend their money on over the course of the next few weeks.  We see it at the pumps, we see it in our utility bills and, increasingly, we are seeing it feeding through to other bills, such as groceries.</p>  <p>  The Government has acted already.  I will not go through the list of things that we have done.  It is long, as the Deputy knows.  The Government will act again, into the winter and, indeed, into next year.  We will be able to help people in many different ways, for example, pay increases.  We have the increase in the national minimum wage.  We have a public sector pay deal going through at present.  We will be able to reduce income taxes in the budget.  We will be able to increase the pension and other welfare payments and also we will be able to take specific action to help people with their energy bills.  All of that will be ready for the package that is announced on budget day.</p>  <p>  In relation to a windfall tax, it is our intention as a government or at least we are minded at this point to introduce a windfall tax.  We need to work out the details of that but, certainly, in principle, the Government has agreed that that is something that we will pursue and it will form part of the budget.  What we have to work out is how it will apply and how it will work and that is not straightforward.  However, as it would apply to profits made this year, it would be backdated to the beginning of the energy crisis earlier this year because profits are taxed on an annual basis.  It would, of course, apply to profits made this year hitherto.  If that is what the Deputy means by "backdated", the answer is "Yes".</p>  <p>  Quite frankly, when it comes to the EU proposals, I cannot explain them for the Deputy or interpret them.  They are not Government proposals.  They are proposals of the European Commission.  They are not yet agreed and, quite frankly, they are not entirely clear.  We need to figure them out, ideally, before budget day, because what is done at European level will impact on what we want to do here.  However, the principle is there that there will be a windfall tax and we will use the proceeds from that windfall tax to help reduce the cost of energy for families and businesses.</p>  <p>  As a footnote, the Deputy mentioned the ESRI energy poverty index.  Of course, the Deputy is correct in what she says but it is important to point out that the way the ESRI calculates energy poverty is essentially anyone who spends more than 10% of his or her disposable income on energy.  Quite frankly, at present, that is probably most people in the country.  It is a different index to consistent poverty or deprivation, which are different things.  Perhaps that particular index does not reflect the reality of the new world that we are going into which probably is one of higher energy costs.</p></speech>

That crucial reform is not part of the plans that were unveiled this week and we may at best see something in 2023.  The reality is that the spiralling cost of gas is what is contributing to the misery.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the Government, which opposed reform of the energy market last year, is lobbying strongly for this critical and crucial reform at EU level?  Can the T&aacute;naiste outline exactly what is our approach to the EU in relation to this and other matters that may well impact on the actual cost of energy?  Why was the &euro;180/MWh set at that level?  It seems incredibly high and way more than the cost of producing the energy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500022#U00700"><p>In relation to the &euro;180/MWh, I honestly cannot answer that question.  That is a question only the EU Energy Commissioner can answer.  As I say, it is not agreed.  It may be the case that when this action is agreed, that figure will come down.  I agree with the Deputy that it seems higher than it should be but, as I say, it is an EU proposal, not a Government one and not one that has been agreed yet by the governments of the EU.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will be attending those meetings.  It is intended to have agreement before the end of the month but, hopefully, we will know what the shape of that agreement looks like because it will influence the decisions that we make on budget day.</p>  <p>  I absolutely agree that we need to reform the way the EU energy market works.  It made sense in the past to give wind and solar generators the best price - the price that the gas generators were getting at peak time - because that was all about encouraging investment in wind and solar, which we need and need more of.</p> <p>Nobody ever anticipated, however, that gas prices would go so high.  As a result, wind generators and solar generators are making profits and booking revenues they never in their wildest dreams thought they would be able to get.  That is what needs to change and that is what is being worked on: a new way of pricing electricity so it is not linked to the marginal, peak price of gas.  That cannot be done right away, however.  It takes a while to reform a market.  We therefore need interim measures as well as long-term ones.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500023#V00200"><p>My question to the T&aacute;naiste today is quite simple.  Will funding for North West Simon Community's early intervention and homelessness prevention pilot project be included in the forthcoming budget?</p>  <p>  On 26 August the Government published the most recent homelessness statistics, which show that 106 individuals, including 22 child dependants, were provided with local authority-managed emergency accommodation in counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo during the week of 20 to 26 July 2022.  The overall statistics represent an 8.1% increase month on month, with 98 people homeless in June 2022, and an increase of 13.97% year on year, with 93 people homeless in July 2021, while the increase year on year in the number of children homeless is a massive 29.1%.</p>  <p>  In January 2022 North West Simon Community submitted proposals to provide homelessness prevention and outreach services in Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo to the three local authorities.  If accepted and fully funded, the associated income, together with the agreed funding for the resettlement and tenancy support and sustainment services, RTSS, contract in County Donegal, would have put North West Simon Community in a stable financial position for the year.</p>  <p>  As no decisions on the proposals had been notified to North West Simon Community by May 2022, the board of directors sought direct engagement with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to request that a special provision to secure the services be included in budget 2023.  On 12 July two directors and the CEO met with officials from the Department.  The officials repeated the standard explanation that the Minister defines policy, the regional management group develops homeless service plans at a local level, and the Department issues the requested funding.  On this basis, it was asserted that the Department could see no reason North West Simon Community's homelessness prevention services would not be eligible for funding under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 if included in the forthcoming north-west regional homelessness action plan.</p>  <p>  However, when the discussion turned to the specifics of North West Simon Community's current proposals, it was acknowledged that the Department had raised questions about the rationale for a funding proposal submitted by Leitrim County Council.  The implications of this acknowledgment are quite significant.  First, it illustrates that the Department has made a determination on what constitutes acceptable funding for a particular type of service.  Second, the Department very clearly exercises a degree of oversight of the service plans developed by individual local authorities, which far exceeds the arrangements described earlier.  This belies the supposed independence of regional homeless forums.  Again, it was stressed that a funding proposal for such a project could only be considered by the Department if submitted by the north-west joint homeless consultative forum's management group.</p>  <p>  However, the immediate obstacle to adopting this approach is that it would require the three local authorities to commit additional funding in excess of &euro;100,000 to the pilot project over three years.  The recognition that the local authorities could have great difficulty allocating these additional funds is one of the key reasons for North West Simon Community developing the pilot project in the first instance.</p>  <p>  The need for this service has never been greater.  It is imperative that the Department funds the much-needed development of the North West Simon Community service to ensure that homelessness is battled in all areas of this country.  My question to the T&aacute;naiste is therefore as follows.  An essential homeless service in the north west is in danger of closing before Christmas.  Is this going to happen on the Government's watch?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, the budget for 2023 is under negotiation.  I am sure there will be funding for homeless services next year.  There will have to be, given we have seen the fall in homelessness that had occurred now eliminated, essentially, and we are seeing very high homeless numbers again.  All of that will form part of the budget negotiations currently under way.  As I said, there is &euro;194 million last year and a figure to be agreed for next year.</p>  <p>  I cannot give the Deputy a commitment here on North West Simon Community.  As he outlined in his question, funding is often allocated on a decentralised basis and there is a process to be followed.  Certainly, however, any proposals that are made are reviewed.  I imagine that this is something the Deputy will be able to take up directly with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in a different format.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500023#V00400"><p>There will be funding next year all right, and that seems to be case, but it will be focused on Dublin mainly.  Homelessness is a nationwide problem in this country, unfortunately.  The figures released for the north west showing 106 individuals and 22 child dependants are based on local authority-provided respite centres, which are full all the time, so they are not actually the real figures.  There is a huge number of people in homelessness right across the north west who are couch-surfing, staying with friends, sleeping on the floor and so on and who are not counted in any figures.  It is the same here in Dublin as well, but the figures here are a lot higher because there are more services here.  The reality is that these homeless people will be left behind if this funding is not brought forward.</p>  <p>  We tried to engage with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and to have meetings with him.  Unfortunately, he did not turn up to that meeting.  We met officials and so on and they were adamant that they had nothing to do with the funding, yet then they held back funding for Leitrim County Council.  This is the way the Government controls funding actually getting out to local authorities.  It sets up a local authority group that filters the funding applications such that they send to the Department only those applications they know will get funded, but then the Department questions and queries them.  It creates this barrier and funding is not got out to the bodies that need it to help homeless people.  I therefore ask the T&aacute;naiste that funding be made available urgently to ensure that a pilot project may proceed.  If that pilot project does not work, so be it, but at least let it proceed.</p></speech>

That is why the Minister was unable to attend.  I am sure the meeting can be rearranged and can proceed.  The Minister does chair the national homeless action committee, and some of the people involved sit on that.</p>  <p>  As I said, budget negotiations are under way.  There will of course be funding for homeless services next year.</p>  <p>  As for the particular proposal the Deputy mentioned, North West Simon Community, I might ask the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to come back to him on that in more detail because he would be more across it than I am.</p></speech>

Despite these challenges, we have a Government that is on the ropes and completely out of ideas.  It is now clear that the Government lacks the required energy, pardon the pun, to decisively help the public and to do what is right.  Instead what we witness is a complete detachment from reality and chaotic messaging by Government Ministers.</p>  <p>  One of the scariest kites in the political sky at the moment is the Government's projected &euro;6.7 billion tax and spending package for 2023 - regardless, in other words, of what may happen if we have another winter of continuing crisis next year.  The Government has completely failed to protect households and businesses from energy price rises.  It has continued to drive ahead with more inflationary carbon taxes at a time when energy prices are at their highest level ever.  The Government's narrow and disjointed focus on electricity credits, which are a short-term measure, has failed to address the cost of the problem that is there now.  There is the coupling of gas and electricity prices and the record level of Government-mandated energy taxes, which are taking in billions in extra income for the Department of Finance.  What the Government is doing is a con job, really.  It completely rejected all calls from my rural Independent colleagues and me to slash the carbon tax to 5% until this crisis ends - not for ever.  The carbon tax should be axed.  It is costing every household a minimum of &euro;600 this year.  I am talking about the Government's carbon tax, which it voted for, supported by the Opposition as well.  The Government then imports oil from dodgy dictators when the Russian supply is cut off.</p>  <p>  We are in the worst energy crisis and cost-of-living crisis in generations.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, and some Independents, like to add even more fuel taxes to be more punitive and to lump more hardship on ordinary people.</p> <p>Hiking the carbon tax further in the budget at this time would be completely irresponsible and would send out a clear message that the Government and the Ministers could not care less if people freeze or starve in their houses this winter.</p> <p> In reality, the carbon tax is an unfair punishment that barely affects the carbon emissions - that is the fact of it - and the Government wants to increase it.  The Government voted to increase it annually without even having a debate, so get real here.  The Government should stand by the people who elected us all to this Parliament and who now need help, not sending press releases and mixed messages.  The Government should cut the carbon tax and all the energy taxes, which would be something tangible we could do in this House, as well as capping the big profits of the electricity companies.</p></speech>

As recently as January, all the budget measures kicked in such as lower income taxes and increases in the minimum wage, the pension, weekly welfare payments, and the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  In spring, the Government intervened again by reducing excise on petrol and diesel, by 20 cent and 15 cent, and reducing the cost of green diesel.  We reduced VAT on electricity and gas to 9%, the lowest ever rate.  We gave households &euro;200 off their electricity bill.  There was also a bullet payment of the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  In the summer, the Government intervened again by providing increases in the student universal support Ireland, SUSI, grant for students.  There was an increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for those who needed it most.  A public sector pay deal was agreed in recent weeks, which is about to be voted on.  The increase to the national minimum wage, which was announced yesterday, is worth &euro;1,600 per year to a person working full time on low pay.</p>  <p>  We will take further action in the budget which will take the form of increased welfare and pension payments.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is examining what we can do on the fuel allowance, in particular making it available to more people.  There will be a tax package meaning working people will be able to keep more of the money they earn.  There will be actions to help people with energy bills in particular.  What is seen from the Government is a dynamic and evolving response to what is a rapidly changing situation.  That will have to continue to be the case because we do not know how high bills will go or for how long this will go on.  The response is not a blank cheque.  The right response would not be a blank cheque.  It is dynamic response, responding to the situation as it develops and emerges.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows carbon tax is not a budget measure.  It has already been legislated for and the funding from it is ring-fenced for climate action, green farming, retrofitting, and many other things.  </p></speech>

It is shocking.  Why is the Government so staunchly opposed to bringing in oil from Barryroe and to gas exploration off our coasts?  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept the fact that the data centres are guzzling electricity and will continue to do so?  Will he accept that the fastest way to help our citizens is to cut the energy taxes, which is a budgetary measure?  The Government has a trick o' the loop job done on the carbon tax in saying that it is not a budgetary measure.  Governments passed it here for ten years.  Every Member, bar six or seven of us, voted for that in this House.  The Government cannot con the people.  It can take tangible measures instead of window dressing and moving money here and there.  People are hurting.  They are in an awful situation.  The Government made a mess of school transport with its big announcements, which were ill-thought out or not thought out at all.  So the Government's thought process seems to be divided.  All it seems to want to do is keep the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in power.  Whatever he wants, the Taoiseach to be and the current Taoiseach, ask him "How high?".  The Minister is destroying our nation, our families and our children, and Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Independents are supporting him and his Green Party.  Independents are giving other Independents a bad name by supporting the Government on every whim.</p></speech>

Of the 13,000 waiting on treatment, more than 11,000 of them are children, almost 4,000 of whom have been waiting over a year for an appointment.  This represents a 7% increase between January and May this year.  This is not sustainable and immediate action is required.  There seems to be a persistent crisis in the provision of mental health services across the country.  The HSE invested &euro;38 million in fees and salaries of trainee clinical psychologists over the past five years, yet did not directly recruit one newly qualified clinical psychologist.  The psychologists and resources are there but the ability and will to hire them is not.  At this time, when we are experiencing an unprecedented demand for psychological support in primary care, what action will the Government take to make real efforts in addressing vacancies in psychology services and to reduce the waiting list to deliver these services?</p></speech>

That is an extraordinary and alarming figure.  We know that already the cost-of-living crisis is biting hard on so many households, families, and individuals across the country.  In the face of this, the Government has only committed to an increase in the minimum wage to bring it to &euro;11.30 per hour, amounting to an inadequate response.  There has been a real cut in wages for the lowest paid in our society and, furthermore, people will have to wait six months before they see any increase in the money in their pockets.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, raised this issue with the T&aacute;naiste this morning.  The Labour Party wants to see a meaningful increase in the minimum wage.  We want it brought to the living wage of &euro;12.90 per hour.  We want that ambitious and radical measure taken by the Government, because we believe Ireland needs a pay rise.  We want to see people having more money in their pockets to enable them to meet the scary increase in the cost of living that is frightening so many families and individuals as we face into this bleak winter.

It will not take six months for people to experience it.  It will kick-in in January.  Most people who are paid the minimum wage are not paid monthly but are paid weekly or biweekly.  Therefore, people will see the increase much quicker than in six months' time.  It works out as an increase of &euro;30 per week for someone working full time, or &euro;1,660 per year.  It is the biggest increase agreed by any Government.  No Labour Party Minister ever signed off on an increase greater than that-----</p></speech>

I send my deepest condolences to his family.  Please tell me the Government is aware of the increase of addiction in the city, that it has a plan to do something about it and that it understands the urgency of the need to invest in more medically supervised recovery beds.  There is a need to provide medically supervised injection centres.  In their absence, we have unsafe injecting in parks and flat complexes throughout the city and the country.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of the urgency?  Will we see an increase in funding for medically supervised injection beds in the budget?  What will we do to ensure people can access treatment where they need it?</p></speech>

It is Government policy to bring in supervised injection centres.  We have plans to do so at Merchant's Quay.  The Deputy knows the difficulties and complications that have arisen around this but we certainly have not given up on it.  The policy remains an objective.  I absolutely agree that we need to continue to invest more in drug treatment centres and drug treatment beds.  It is money very well spent.  The fact we can rescue people from addiction makes a huge difference not only for them but for their families and the communities around them.  If we do not do so, the costs we bear in terms of the criminal justice system, emergency departments and homeless services are enormous.  The benefits of the investment phenomenally outweigh the costs.  The Deputy can be confident that we will continue to invest in this area.</p></speech>

It is the reason so many people will come out on the streets for the cost of living coalition's demonstration on Saturday, 24 September.  The other connected crisis that will also prompt people to join the demonstration is an ever-worsening housing and homelessness crisis, in particular the spike in the number of people being evicted because landlords are selling properties.  People are terrified they will face homelessness over the coming months through no fault of their own.</p>  <p>  I want to make a very specific and positive proposal.  The Government has had a windfall in corporate tax receipts.  I understand we cannot depend on this over the long term but the Government could use this money to purchase properties where people face evictions into homelessness through no fault of their own.  It would be a good investment.  It would stop people going into homeless services and save money on homeless expenditure, the rental accommodation scheme and housing assistance payments.  I ask the Government to consider a major programme of purchase in these situations.</p></speech>

The Deputy may even have been one of those who has been critical of us for doing so.</p></speech>

What the Deputy has said about corporate tax is also valid.  We should not rely on our corporate tax receipts to fund day-to-day spending.  Capital is not day-to-day spending.  Once we buy something, we do not have to buy it twice.  Once something is built, it does not need to be built twice.  Many people are pushing the narrative that the Government is somehow being reckless in committing corporate tax receipts to day-to-day spending.  In reality we are not doing so.  We are massively increasing capital budgets across the board, building new schools, new hospitals and more social housing, and purchasing private assets in some cases.  This is not spending that has to be repeated.</p></speech>

It has left many parents without the transport for their children to go to school that they had in previous years.  Yesterday evening I received a call from the principal of a school with an ASD unit where transport for pupils has been approved but is not now available.  Four children will be withdrawn from that school.  It is a rural school that has an ASD unit.  The service will fall if a bus is not provided.  The escort on the bus has been interviewed.  A contract has been signed.  Everything is in place but we do not have a bus to bring the children to school.</p></speech>

I am very alarmed to hear this situation has arisen in his constituency.  I am sure we will have to find a solution to it.  If I have picked up the Deputy right, it is not so much an issue of finance as the availability of a bus.  I cannot give an answer on it here but I appreciate the fact he has raised it.  Perhaps we will engage offline or with the Minister, Deputy Foley, to see whether we can come up with a solution.</p></speech>

I am wearing their badge.  It is a small token of what I can do.  In successive budgets they have not received the recognition they deserve, especially when it comes to getting payments such as fuel allowance.  There are strict criteria.  Carers play an important role in keeping people in their homes where they are happier and live longer and where they do not block up badly overcrowded emergency departments or hospital beds.  Family and child carers are in a very difficult situation looking after loved ones.  Family carers need special supports in the budget because of the cost of living, the cost of oil and the cost of travelling to people's homes.  I salute them and the dedicated work they do.  Will the Government please give them the due recognition they so richly deserve in the budget?  I sympathise with Catherine Cox on her recent bereavement.  She is an organiser.</p></speech>

Of course we will give consideration in the budget as to how we can help them out.  Everyone, particularly carers and some other groups, are feeling the bite of the cost of living much harder, especially people who have to be at home a lot and generate costs relating to heating.  We will absolutely bear this in mind in the budget package.  I point out that anything we do in the budget will be additional to what we have done for carers in recent years, which should not be forgotten.  There has been an increase in the carer's allowance and the carer's support grant.  More respite is being provided throughout the country.  There has been a relaxation of the means test to qualify for the carer's allowance, which was pioneered by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  There is also the extension of free GP care to recipients of the carer's allowance, which was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Harris.</p></speech>

This came as a big shock to the students.  I heard the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the radio on 31 August explaining the situation.  He recognised that the main priority of the students was to try to get registered.  I have received an email from Sarah Downing of the Fatima Day Care Centre.  On Tuesday she received an email from Dublin Business School stating it had no further update to provide from Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and detailing the transfer options being investigated.  She has sought a transfer to another college.  At this stage the students still do not know what is the situation.  Will the Minister give us an update on it?  What is he doing to intervene, especially with regard to the college as it is something in which he can intervene?</p></speech>

She is correct that I was very concerned to hear about this situation.  It relates to a situation where a QQI-accredited programme is still a valid programme but CORU, the independent regulator, has expressed concerns about its ability to put the students on the register.  My understanding is that individual meetings were to take place between the college and students to look at the options.  There were also refunds on the table.  The Deputy is correct that people being able to progress their careers is the most important issue.  I understood those individual meetings were under way and I will come back to the Deputy specifically on this.  I will inquire today as to where this matter is at.</p></speech>

Of course the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Government are to be complimented on the scheme itself but it has left many families who had been concessionary ticket holders without transport to school.</p> <p>I will give the T&aacute;naiste one example of a family that have been loyal Bus &Eacute;ireann users for the past 15 years, have always paid for their ticket and now they have no transport to school.  The mum is a carer and the father is self-employed.  Their daily lives have been thrown into disarray without school transport.

I know the Minister, Deputy Foley, will testify before committee about it.  There are an additional 21,000 tickets this year and plans were made for additional demand.  Unfortunately, those 21,000 are not enough.  Everyone entitled to the service, as I understand, will get it.  However, we have a particular issue with - Deputy Smyth put her finger on it - people who had concessionary tickets in the past, had a reasonable expectation that they would into the future and now do not.  That is the crux of the issue that we need to solve.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has the full backing of the Government in trying to do so.</p></speech>

I realise and accept that a review is taking place and is due to report fairly shortly.  I request that the matter be resolved in good time for those left standing, for want of a better word, and for those, some of whom were children in very sensitive cases, who were asked to leave the bus, even though their immediate next-door neighbours were on the same bus and there were vacant seats all around the bus.  We must try to ensure that whatever we do, we do not have a situation whereby a child of 12 or 14 years of age is asked to get off a bus and walk home.</p></speech>

I do not know exactly all of the rules and regulations around school transport.  I know most Deputies here do.  It would not be as big of an issue in my constituency, perhaps, as in the Deputy's.  I do not, however, see the logic in telling somebody not to get on a bus if the bus has empty spaces on it.  Whatever the rules and regulations are, there is also the rule of common sense.  If there is a vacant seat on a bus, why would one not allow someone to use it?</p></speech>

There is a bit of mixed signalling coming from the Government, because every time I have asked about it, I have been told it was not something the Government was considering.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste could clear that up.  Is the Government prepared to put in place a proper public transport policing service to protect people and keep them safe on our public transport system throughout the country?  As we encourage more people to use public transport for carbon reasons, we also want to ensure that it is safe and secure for people to use.</p></speech>

That is a real problem and it is not just a perception.  People see incidents occur on the Luas, buses and on trains and it makes them very worried.  It also very much goes against what we are trying to do in encouraging people to use public transport more often, which is why we brought down the fares in the past year.  Ultimately, a decision on whether there is a dedicated transport police is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, rather than the Government, but, obviously, there is an interaction between the Government and the Garda Commissioner as to what we think is sensible.  It is not so much whether one calls it a transport police, it is more that we have a more visible presence of members of the Garda in and around stations, Luas stops and places that are known to be areas where public-order incidents occur.  Whether it is a dedicated division is not really the most important point.  The most important point is that people see and feel and have a visible experience of more security and more garda&iacute; on public transport and at stations and stops.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, we live in an economy that has far too high of a burden of personal income tax on people who are working hard and are trying to put bread on the table and to keep the lights and heat on.  Certainly, there is an opportunity to reduce the burden of the universal social charge and to look at bands and the potential introduction of a third rate.  Is this a priority of the Government as we approach the budget?</p></speech>

It will be the largest income tax reduction package in any budget for quite a number of years.  I guarantee the Deputy it will never go as far as we want it to go, which is always the case, but it will be significant and, of course, the objective is to make sure that people get to keep more of their own hard-earned money and especially that people on middle incomes do not see any pay increase, overtime or increment that they get mostly being lost to tax, PRSI and the universal social charge, USC.  The shape of that has to be decided but it will form part of the budget and the help that we will provide people to help them with the rising cost of living.</p></speech>

I have raised this several times already this year.  People are being approved but still there is no home help arriving.  It is a natural desire for elderly people to want to stay in their homes.  Elderly people in places such as Killarney, Rathmore, Headfort, Kilcummin, Curragh, Castleisland and Killorglin are waiting for extra hours and some of them that do not have any home help at all are waiting for the home help to materialise.  They are finding they have to go into hospital more often and it is a disaster.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste what is happening.  I have been promised by the Taoiseach that it was being sorted out.  It is still not sorted out.  Is the Government paying the home helpers enough?  Is it covering the extra costs for travelling out to houses?  I know one woman whose daughter has cancer and is begging and hoping to get home help to help her to keep her mother at home.  I ask the Government to do something.</p></speech>

As the Deputy says, it is a vital service.  It keeps people out of hospitals.  It makes considerable sense that we fund it well and, indeed, we do, but there is a shortage of people willing to work in the area.  Among issues being examined at present by the Minister is whether we need to improve pay or mileage rates to encourage people who might be willing to work a few more hours per week to provide that service.</p></speech>

I also formally welcome the decision to proceed with the reopening of the railway line from Limerick to Foynes.  That is very progressive but is it not logical to extend that line directly to the main sources of rail freight along the west coast - because that is the big justification of it - in Ballina and Westport, by reconnecting and reopening the short piece of line between Athenry and Claremorris, which would immediately then connect Ballina, Westport and all the main towns and cities of the west coast to Foynes?  This should be done in the interest of regional balance and transport connectivity.  Can we expect that the Government will be equally brave with that small section of line, which is even cheaper, and proceed with it immediately?</p></speech>

We want to move freight off the roads and on to rail but we do not want to spend considerable money building a train line which is uneconomic and then requires many more subsidies.  As the Deputy points out, capital is a one-off, but subsidies are not.</p> <p>Thus, if we open a rail line and it can wash its face that is one thing but if we open a rail line and have to keep subsidising it every year that is a different thing.

It is something I have personal experience of.  The report of the working group has been really widely welcomed by many of the constituents I am dealing with who are in this situation but it is not helping them foot the bill.  Many cannot afford the remediation work and they are worried; they are worried about their safety, the costs and their insurance cover.  They need help and need it now.  If a tax credit for owner-occupiers was introduced in this budget, it would provide some help for some of these people immediately and it is just one of the recommendations in the report to help people in this situation, including people who have already completed works.

We helped people with pyrite, we are helping people with mica and it is important we do the same for people in our cities who have been affected by defective apartments.

The hospital covers a population of 180,000 from Castletownbere to Kinsale, as well as parts of Kerry.  Following its inspection in 2019, the Mental Health Commission found the unit in Bantry to be 88% compliant and recommended investment be made.  It was the same in 2021 when the unit was again found to be 88% compliant but previous recommendations for improvements had not been implemented as no finances were spent on the unit.  What is extraordinary is the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Butler, and the Taoiseach were both in Bantry Hospital recently and to the best of my knowledge both walked past the mental health unit and never went in.</p>  <p>  We only have a matter of hours to set the wheels in motion to save the seven beds in the mental health unit in Bantry as the HSE can appeal this restriction by the Mental Health Commission by Monday, thus giving time to get immediate funding in place to rectify the shocking wrong being done here.  Will the T&aacute;naiste step in here and contact the HSE immediately to appeal this decision on bed closures in Bantry?</p></speech>

I have a family in my constituency whom I know well, whose child, due to the exceptional care she has received, has reached the age of seven years and made her first communion earlier this year.  This child cannot walk, cannot talk and she has no swallow but due to the exceptional care her mother has given her she has managed to survive.  However, this family are under huge financial pressure.  Earlier this year the husband received a bonus at work and because of this his wife's carer's allowance was cut to &euro;46.50 per week.  She gave up a very good job to look after their child and they are saving the State an absolute fortune by looking after their child at home.  They have other expenses with other members of the family that have increased because of the huge care they are giving to this child.  Medical cards for incapacitated children are not means-tested.  I ask that in the budget due the week after next, there would not be a means test for carer's allowance for families who have an incapacitated child.  It is a very small cohort of families who are affected and the difference to the Exchequer would be very small.  I ask that the Government give this consideration in the budget.</p></speech>

I should say that the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is not means-tested but the carer's allowance is.  I would love it if it were possible for there to be no means tests but unfortunately they are necessary because financial resources, even in a very wealthy country, are limited.  However, sometimes means tests are too mean and when knocking on doors over the summer I came across a number of examples where people have lost eligibility for the carer's allowance or a student grant because they got a pay increase, a promotion or worked overtime.  That is not fair and we must take that into account across the budget so means test thresholds are realistic.  As wages, rise, the thresholds should rise too.</p></speech>

It was launched in July and was very welcome but its criteria are very restrictive.  Properties must be in areas with a population of 400 people.  I ask that the criteria be re-examined and that rural areas outside towns and villages be included in the scheme.</p></speech>

We have a proud history of co-operatives in Ireland.  They play an integral role in the form of housing co-operatives, food producer co-operatives, group water schemes or locally-owned co-operative shops.  On the energy side, community-owned renewable energy co-operatives helped insulate from the fluctuations in energy prices internationally and provide a cheap, clean and secure energy supply for communities.  However, co-operatives have been hindered by being based on a literally Victorian-era legislative framework.  We in the Green Party are delighted to see progress on the co-operative societies Bill and we have engaged with the Department at several stages on it.  Will the T&aacute;naiste provide an update on the timeline for when he expects the general scheme of that Bill to be published?</p></speech>

The Deputy proposes extending it to rural areas.  I like that idea and think it makes a lot of sense but we need to take a little time to see what the take-up is like on the existing scheme.  We do not know yet whether the &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 is going to be enough to move the dial or what the take-up is going to be.  However, in principle, if it works and if we get take-up in the towns and villages, why would we not extend to rural areas too?  That makes sense to me but let us see what the take-up is first before we start changing the scheme.  I do not think that will take too long; we will know in a matter of months.</p>  <p>  In answer to Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's question, I signed off on a memo in relation to that Bill only in the last couple of weeks.  We expect to have heads of new legislation early next year.  That will be the general scheme and will go to committee for scrutiny.  We agree we need to update our legislation in that area to bring it more in line with company law and the protections that come with that.</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as I have said publicly, stands at the apex of our planning system and plays a crucial role as the final arbiter of many planning applications.  In this light, I treat and have treated any allegations of inappropriate actions or behaviours by its members with the utmost seriousness.  The public must have trust in the impartiality and integrity of our planning system if it is to function effectively in facilitating the sustainable development this country needs.</p><p>In the light of recent allegations I want to reassure the House of the significant and swift steps I have taken to ensure the public can have confidence in the integrity of the decision-making process while ensuring it continues to function in facilitating appropriate development.  The Government has sought to act, and has acted, openly, quickly, and effectively in responding to the immediate problems, to address underlying issues and to maintain a fully functioning planning system.</p><p>The actions broadly fall into three categories, namely, dealing with specific allegations of wrongdoing, implementing internal reform of the process, procedures and workforce plans of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and a fundamental overhaul of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's nomination process and its broader legislative framework.</p><p>The planning system must be made fit for purpose while still moving forward.  The series of reforms arising from this controversy will be rolled out without delaying critical housing and infrastructural development.  I have asked all Opposition spokespersons for their input into the process and I assure the House that I will engage with their specific proposals.</p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the national independent statutory body with responsibility for the determination of planning appeals and direct applications for strategic infrastructure and other developments under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and certain other Acts.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent in the performance of its functions under the Planning and Development Act.</p><p>Approximately 30,000 applications are considered by the planning system on an annual basis and about 10% of such applications are appealed to the board.  In addition, the board considers substantial cases associated with strategic infrastructure, which will increase in the coming years through the major investment under the national development plan and together with the new functions coming to the board under the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021, as amended, the board will play a really significant consenting role for a range of critical infrastructure projects, not least those required to tackle the energy crisis and to move swiftly to renewable energy.</p><p>As Members will be aware, I have brought an end to the strategic housing development, SHD, planning arrangements following a commitment made in the programme for Government not to extend them post their legislative expiry.  I firmly believe that it is more appropriate for decisions to be taken at a local authority level and our new Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act 2021 restores decision-making on these schemes to our local authorities.</p><p>There are transitional arrangements in place and SHD planning applications are currently working their way through the system.  I have no doubt this will have an impact on the caseload of the board.  Dealing with this increasing caseload in an efficient, effective and timely manner, is absolutely critical and the cornerstone of this is ensuring that there is public confidence in the decision-making process, in its impartiality, its integrity and its transparency.  I therefore treat any allegations of inappropriate actions or behaviour by the members of the board with the utmost seriousness.  Today is an important chance to outline to the House the range of actions taken and planned in relation to the recent allegations while respecting, as the Ceann Comhairle mentioned, the ongoing Garda investigations.</p><p>It is important at the outset to commend the staff of the board who work extremely hard in challenging conditions to deliver on current requirements.  I know they are willing to work with the changes that will be required to meet new demands and to respond to process changes recommended through various reviews.  This is being supported by increased staff resourcing and acceleration of the digital agenda.</p><p>In tandem with this, the review of planning legislation, which had started in advance of any allegations being made and on which there has been significant engagement with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, will bring greater clarity to the legislative code in which the board works, aiding both practitioners and the public alike.  Apart from the streamlining of the legislation, as the committee will have discussed, a particular focus of the review is on ensuring that the plan-led nature of the system is enhanced and that there is more meaningful public engagement, particularly at the earliest part of the process, which is the development plans across our country.  This will set the environment context for decisions of planning authorities and the board into the future and should lead to a system where there is less contention at application stage because there has been more debate at planning stage.</p><p>Through the various measures I will outline today, I will underscore to the House the importance of maintaining trust and confidence in our planning system.</p> <p>The Government is taking action on a number of fronts to ensure there is a fundamental change to equip us for the future and maintain the full ongoing operation of the system to ensure the right development takes place in the right place at the right time to meet the increasing challenges we face in housing and infrastructural provision.<br/><br/>Before getting into the specific matters of concern, I will outline the existing statutory and other provisions relating to the corporate governance of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Under section 147 of the Planning and Development Act, all board members are required to make a declaration of certain interests at least once per year.  The register of interests is available for public inspection.  Under section 148 of that Act, &quot;[w]here a member of the Board has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or which is material to, any appeal, contribution, question, determination or dispute which falls to be decided or determined [upon] by the Board under any enactment ... he or she shall disclose to the Board the nature of his or her interest&quot; and shall take no part in the discussion, consideration or decision-making on that matter.  Failure to comply with sections 147 and 148 is an offence under sections 147(11) and 148(10).<br/><br/>In the same manner as other agencies, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is subject to the code of practice for governance of State bodies and is required to furnish to the Minister, in conjunction with its annual report and financial statements, a comprehensive report covering that State body, confirming its adherence to the code of practice and that it has a code of conduct in operation.  All members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la serve in positions subject to the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001, including the making of annual declarations as appropriate.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, processes complaints regarding compliance with those Acts.<br/><br/>On the allegations of wrongdoing, in April 2022, certain allegations against the then deputy chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la came to my attention.  I recognise that board members have critical roles in the board and in the planning system.  These allegations, which were denied by the board member concerned, warranted a serious and immediate response.  In light of the allegations, I appointed senior counsel Remy Farrell to provide a report to inform my consideration of the matter.  The terms of reference for the report were published on my Department's website on 12 May and, in accordance with those terms, Mr. Farrell was tasked with providing a report to me within six weeks.  On 22<sup></sup>June, I received and agreed to a request from Mr. Farrell for an extension of time to 29 July to allow him sufficient time to complete his work and finalise the report.  I received the report into the management of conflicts of interest and relevant disclosures by the deputy chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to certain decisions of that board from Mr. Farrell on the 27 July.  On 15 August, on the advice of the Attorney General, I referred the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Standards in Public Office Commission.<br/><br/>I recognise the vital public interest in this report and that the public must have trust in the impartiality and integrity of our planning system if it is to function effectively.  With this in mind I inquired of the DPP if there was any reason that should prevent my publishing of the report in full or in part.  The DPP has asked that the report not be published until such time as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has completed its investigation into this matter and a decision has been made on any possible or potential prosecution.  As such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter.  I am sure Deputies will be conscious in their contributions that this matter is the subject of ongoing Garda investigation.  That has been agreed by all and the Ceann Comhairle has already referenced that.<br/><br/>With regard to broader issues that have been raised relating to the board's internal processes, and taking account of the urgent need to progress measures aimed at restoring public confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, initiated its review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la systems and procedures as part of its review programme on 24 August 2022.  This two-stage review is being carried out by independent planning experts from other jurisdictions and Conleth Bradley SC, who is heading up the first phase of the review.  I have been informed that staff of An Bord Plean&aacute;la have an opportunity to engage substantially with this review.  It is my intention that the outcome of the review will help inform other internal changes as required in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and will assist in identifying legislative amendments that may be required.  The terms of reference for this review have been published on the OPR's website.  In addition to the matters being focused on in this review and those previously announced, An BordPlean&aacute;la will be included in the OPR's programme of general reviews on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>I await the conclusion of a separate internal report from the senior management team within An Bord Plean&aacute;la which was requested by Mr. Dave Walsh, chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It should be noted that the roles of this senior internal team do not involve them in any active participation in the processing of, or the making of decisions on, any planning cases that have been determined by the board and that may be the subject of this examination.  I understand this internal report will consider other allegations, including a review of a number of decided cases where public commentary has raised issues and concerns around the procedures and processes applied in those cases.  This process of internal investigation of certain files is under way and is expected to be completed quite shortly.  The internal team is due to report back to the chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will engage further on this when the report to the chairperson is complete to see what further action may be required to ensure public trust in the board.<br/><br/>There are some immediate measures we have taken already and I will outline them.  In addition to the review that is completed and the two that are under way, several additional measures are being undertaken as a matter of urgency to ensure the impartial and effective functioning of the board.  These measures include a comprehensive review of the internal code of conduct of An Bord Plean&aacute;la being undertaken by the board, the complete cessation - not suspension - of the two-person decision-making panels, and the overhaul of internal compliance procedures on ethical requirements.  As a matter of priority, it is intended that a senior legal adviser will be appointed to the board and that there will be a requirement for monthly reports from the board to me as Minister on corporate governance implementation under section 109 of the Planning and Development Act.<br/><br/>It is vital, as I think we all agree, that there is full confidence in the functioning of the board as a fair and impartial cornerstone of our planning system.  To uphold trust in the board, I have announced that the current appointment process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be overhauled and the process for nominations in place at the moment will cease.  I have instructed my Department to work on the reform of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la board member appointment process as a matter of priority and I will bring a plan to Cabinet in the coming weeks - I intend that to be in this month, September - which will outline a new appointments process for board members, underpinned by new legislation which will come to the House and the committee.  It is intended this new process will reflect modern best practice for recruitment to senior executive positions within the Irish public service.  This plan will also outline a range of additional measures to improve the operation of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to deliver an efficient and high-quality planning decision-making service in accordance with the highest standards of corporate governance.</p> <p>As I previously stated, I do not underestimate the work undertaken by the staff of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is increasing as we work to meet our targets set out in Housing for All, and other major infrastructure being provided under the national development plan.  I have already sanctioned a further 24 posts for An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the board's request, which are currently being recruited.  I intend to approve a further substantial increase in staffing resources for An Bord Plean&aacute;la shortly to ensure it is fully equipped to meet the demands of our planning system, including the new functions it will take on as part of the new marine planning arrangements, in particular.  The additional staff members will be hired in tandem with the recommended organisational reforms set out by the Office of the Planning Regulator review to create a fully fit-for-purpose body, including any legislative changes required to achieve this aim.  <br/><br/>Under Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, a number of objectives are set out with the aim of improving the functioning of the planning system, including the comprehensive review and consolidation of planning legislation, which is nearing completion.  I have already referred to that in my remarks today.  The review is being led by the Attorney General.  He has established a working group of professionals with planning law expertise to assist him in this work.  It is intended that the review will be completed and the Bill will be finalised in the fourth quarter of this year.  <br/><br/>An organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la was undertaken by an independent expert panel and published in March 2016.  Legislative proposals contained in the 2016 organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la are being considered in as a part of this broader review.  As part of the review, recently, both the planning advisory forum and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage considered a paper on the corporate provisions in relation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  They have also considered themes such as plans and guidelines, planning consents, enforcement and environmental assessment and will shortly discuss issues concerning judicial review and planning.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I recognise the important role An Bord Plean&aacute;la plays in our planning system and how the decisions made by the board have an impact across the breadth of planning in Ireland, from rural family homes, to strategic infrastructure programmes, to large-scale residential builds.  I am confident that the actions taken to date will start the process of restoring confidence in the organisation and will assure the public of this Government's commitment to ensuring the highest levels of accountability and transparency in the work of our agencies.</p></speech>

That crisis has, in part, been created by an avalanche of concerning revelations since April of this year.  The crisis has also been caused by Government policy, in particular, a number of very controversial mandatory ministerial guidelines introduced by a previous housing Minister and a failure of successive Governments to implement a number of key recommendations of the 2016 report into the operations of the board.  The combination of these three factors has led to a dramatic collapse in confidence among the public in the operations of the board.  It is not just a collapse of public confidence.  A number of large local authorities, including Cork City Council and my own South Dublin County Council, have voted on motions of no confidence in the operations of the board in recent months.  There is also a widespread view across the planning community that the board is no longer performing its functions as it once did.  All of that means that there is an absolute urgency for the Minister to act, and act speedily, to restore public confidence, as well as the confidence of the elected members and planning professionals.  As he endeavours to do that, if he does the right thing, he will have the active support of our party and, I believe, many in opposition.</p><p>With respect to the avalanche of revelations, I want to pay tribute, in particular, to journalists of an online publication called <i>The Ditch</i>.  They have produced 29 separate news reports since April, outlining very concerning allegations with respect to the operations and decision-making of the board.  The Minister has spoken both to the allegations and his response to that.  These revelations also covered, in particular, in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, not only relate to the former deputy chairman of the board, Paul Hyde.  Unfortunately, they also relate to seven members of the board, including the current chair, David Walsh; the director, Rachel Kenny; and members, Michelle Fagan, Terry Prendergast, Terry O'Niadh and Chris McGarry.  I am not going to go into the individual allegations and revelations in relation to individual members for the same reasons as the Minister outlined.  However, it is important to give people a sense of the areas in which concerns have been raised.</p><p>There does seem to be a pattern across individuals of not declaring very significant conflicts of interest when taking decisions on both small and large planning applications and appeals.  There seems to be a widespread practice of decisions being made by board members where those board members live in what is called the immediate neighbourhood - something which is not permitted under the board's own procedures.  There seems to be a pattern of interference with, and the amending of, inspectors' reports to suit decisions that are then subsequently being made, and as the Minister himself alluded to, decisions being made by panels of two, which is explicitly prohibited under the legislation and the procedures.  As the Minister said, this avalanche of revelations has led to three separate inquiries, one resignation, possible criminal charges and to the board's reputation being in tatters.</p><p>One of the questions that has to be asked, alongside those around the allegations against individual members, is what the chair and the director were doing while these alleged breaches were happening over and over again.  How many decisions have potentially been compromised by decisions that are in breach of protocols, procedures or indeed, the underpinning legislation of the board?  What has been done to ensure that these kinds of breaches of procedures are brought to an end?</p><p>As I said, it is not just the individual actions of individual board members and the failure of the corporate governance of the board that has caused the crisis in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  When former Eoghan Murphy, as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, introduced, in particular, two sets of mandatory ministerial guidelines, namely, those on the design standards for apartments and the removal of the caps on building heights, it created a perpetual conflict in planning law between central government policy and city and county development plans across a range of local authorities.  When you get that kind of conflict between two sets of planning lawmakers, things end up going to the courts.  In fact, as a direct result of that conflict, we saw a dramatic increase in the number of judicial reviews being taken against strategic housing developments, some very significantly taken by Dublin City Council in defence - rightly, in my view - of the democratic decision-making of its councillors in terms of strategic development zones and the city development plan.  Worse still, the board, time and again, lost those judicial reviews in the courts at enormous cost to the taxpayer, and yet individual board members were allowed to continue to make subsequent decisions on the same flawed legal basis.  The figures are startling.  In 2019, before this avalanche of judicial reviews of legally suspect decisions by the board arrived, the legal costs of the board were around &euro;3.6 million.  From 2020 they shot up to &euro;8.4 million, and in 2021 they were &euro;7.7 million.  The outworking of subsequent judicial reviews as a result of the conflict between decisions made by the previous Government, upheld by this Government, and the city and county development plans is that the legal costs will continue at those exceptionally high rates in the time ahead.  The big question is this: why were legally questionable decisions allowed to be made over and over again?  What mechanisms were put in place to try to address this?  What has been done since to ensure the number of legally questionable decisions by the board is dramatically reduced, to in turn reduce its exposure to judicial review?</p><p>Finally, with respect to the 2016 report, I do not agree with all of the recommendations of the report, and the Government is completely entitled to agree, disagree or want to amend those.  However, there has been a slowness, particularly in the previous two Governments to either implement or explain the failure to implement those aspects of that review that are the responsibility of the Government and the Department.  I look forward to the Minister's legislation because clearly it is going to deal with some of those outstanding matters.  As I said at the start, the most important question is what the Minister is going to do.  In fairness to the Minister, he has outlined a series of actions as he moves forward.  In response, I would say that first of all, we need to have the prompt publication of each of the individual review reports as soon as they are available.</p> <p>I appreciate the advice of the Attorney General with respect to the Garda investigation, but as soon as that report can be published, it should be.  So too should the internal review of the board and the report of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  I welcome that the Minister has just said he is now going to get monthly reports on the improvement of the governance operations of the board.  They should be shared at a minimum with the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and, if possible, published so we can keep track of that as well.</p> <p> More important than anything else, what is clear is we need a fresh start at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This can only be achieved with a significant change of board membership.  Ultimately, responsibility starts at the top.  The Minister must be bold and act in the interests of the planning system overall.  I note the inclusion of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la appointments Bill in the legislative programme that was published yesterday and look forward to sight of a general scheme.  What I would say to the Minister at this stage, and I made the same point to the committee, is that we need a hybrid system.  There is merit in having nominated bodies so long as those nominated bodies actually exist and are functioning and represent important interests.  That list needs to be updated and expanded.  There is an argument to say the environmental sector needs to be involved, possibly organisations like the Irish Environmental Network, given the increasing importance of EU environmental law in our planning system.  Also, in recognition of the fact the board was originally meant to be a jury of our peers rather than a body of professional planners, there is an argument for expanding nominating bodies to ensure the public, the community and the citizen's voice are also represented.  Organisations like the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance, for example, would be a case in point.  What we need is a public competition.  I am calling it a kind of public appointments commission plus, where we use the Public Appointments Commission for open competition, interview and recommendation but we might add to that to ensure the necessary level of skills is ultimately on the board.  It has to combine expertise in planning, place-making and environmental law with that key idea of the board as it was originally designed in the 1970s as a jury of one's peers.</p> <p> I am glad to hear the Minister is indicating the Bill will do more than provide for appointments.  The Bill needs to go further than just tackling that issue of the appointments process.  One of the small things that needs to change is the name of the board.  When people hear the phrase An Bord Plean&aacute;la, they think of a board of directors, people who meet six times a year in a part-time capacity.  This is a planning authority.  This is a body in respect of which the State pays individuals significant sums of money to be planning officials.  To avoid confusion and in line with that fresh start, actually renaming it as what it is, a planning authority, and recognising that the members of that planning authority are effectively full-time planning officials would be a small, symbolic but useful step in the right direction.  There not only needs to be clarity in terms of the requirements of members and staff of the board, but also there needs to be sanctions of an appropriate nature where people fail to declare interests or fail to adhere to proper procedures, ultimately such that people can be stripped of their membership of the board for multiple failures.  We need to strengthen those existing procedures.  We need to get rid of subpanels.  There is no justification for them and they are contrary to the original legislative requirements of the board.  We need to have proper monitoring and publication of information, including the declaration of members' interests, rather than just having them available for inspection, to increase transparency.  I simply do not understand the idea of divisions within the inspectorate.  It is a terribly bad practice.  I do not believe it is in the spirit of the original legislation either.  Just as files should be allocated on a random basis, so indeed the requirement for the work of the inspectorate.</p> <p> There should be no role for any board member to request or seek to amend the inspectors' reports.  Board members can disagree with those inspectors' reports.  That is published in a transparent way in the final decision of the board.  Inspectors' reports should reflect what those inspectors wanted them to reflect rather than being in any way pressurized or required to consider amending them.  Ultimately, we need to ensure there are measures to mitigate groupthink.  We need diversity, dissent and critical thinking in all operations of the board.  We need to ensure there is a distancing of the decision-making of the board from the interests, whether individual or collective, of industry or other commercial views.  I acknowledge the Minister had made provision for additional staffing, although there is going to need to be more, particularly in respect of the maritime requirements.  The board must have adequate resources and clear statutory timelines for all forms of decision-making, not just on large-scale residential developments, which I welcomed, but for all others.</p> <p> Beyond An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we have to deal with the legacy of bad Government planning policy.  We need to scrap those mandatory ministerial guidelines.  The very phrase "mandatory ministerial guidelines" is Orwellian in its conception, and therefore the inferior design standards for apartments, the removal of caps on building heights need to go.  We need to restore democratic decision-making to our communities and to the democratic decision-making process of the development plan, strategic development zones and, ultimately, the urban development zones, which the Minister has included in his plan.  We need to accelerate the use of place-making as the Minister has outlined.</p> <p> We also need to establish, as a matter of urgency in the next 12 months, a dedicated, fully resourced planning and environmental court.  The Minister should be warned.  Restricting access to judicial remedy will be done at his peril.  The problem is not that there is too much litigation.  The problem is those conflicts I mentioned earlier and that, where legal access or redress is sought, the judicial process is too long.  The best way to deal with that is a dedicated court with the expertise and resources needed to expedite judicial reviews as quickly as possible.  Crucially, we need to have participative planning at as early a stage as possible in our process, and statutory timelines for all aspects of the planning process and the court, as I said.</p> <p> The Minister has a unique opportunity to address these issues.  He has to act and act now to restore public confidence and the confidence of the wider planning community in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to undo the damage of previous governments which, to date, the current Government has continued to support.  If he does all of that, he will have our active support as participants in this reform agenda.  Now is the time for a fresh start in the operations of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure the mistakes of the past are not repeated in the present or into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500031#HH00200"><p>The Minister stated we have to have trust and integrity in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I agree with him that we should have trust not just in An Bord Plean&aacute;la but in the full planning process and in our civil servants.  It is difficult at times, when decisions have been fundamentally flawed and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has often been a closed shop.  Now board members and their actions have been called into question.  Despite the fact An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected to hold oral hearings in cases of applications involving national and significant issues, or when such hearings are requested, this is routinely refused and dismissed out of hand.  It indicates the decision-making process of planning authorities should be more open to scrutiny.  That is the reason those decisions are taken.  How often have we seen the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la ignore its own inspectors' reports?  This was alluded to.  They correct them for their own value or change them to support a decision they were going to take.  How often have we seen An Bord Plean&aacute;la ignore not just the concerns of local council planning officials and authorities but also development plans or the zoning confines of a particular site?  Far too often in my view, and it has been happening more of late.</p>  <p>  It would be interesting to look at the decision of the board members now under scrutiny when it comes to the destruction of our historical heritage in this city in recent years.  Were the members who are now under investigation party to decisions to grant consent to the demolition of the O'Rahilly family home at 40 Herbert Park in Ballsbridge, a key house in the revolutionary years of the early 20th century?  I do not know, but if they were, I do not know whether there was a conflict of interest or for what reason that decision was taken.  I know that some of those named An Bord Plean&aacute;la officials who are under scrutiny played a role in refusing to grant an oral hearing on three planning applications before them regarding Moore Street.  They are now adjudicating them at present.  I am not aware if there is any specific conflict of interest.</p> <p>I have to say, from a heritage perspective, shame on them.  There is no more important site being earmarked for development at present than Moore Street, and I know the Minister has a specific interest in this.  It is historically significant and of national and international importance, with legislation seeking its full protection before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Many local authorities are opposing its destruction.  A national monument would be interfered with.  A historical building survey and assessment reports that the local planning authority have are not being considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la because they were produced after the deadline.  Yet, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused an oral hearing.  </p> <p> This is a national monument.  This terrace held a retreating GPO garrison at the end of Easter week.  This was where the last meeting of the 1916 Rising Military Council met and where the surrender was decided to avoid further loss of civilian life.  This is where the soldiers of the republic, namely, the IRA, were told that there would be a day soon when the war would be waged again.  However, there are some who would rather erase our history.  In this context, let there be no illusion that some people would rather it would be destroyed.</p> <p> Does anybody bar me find it obscene that those presiding on planning applications often have skin in the game?  Some are definitely not independent.  Some are developers and holders of development land.  Given the scandals of the past in this city, in particular Wood Quay and Frascati House, we need to be very careful with who is on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I agree with the Minister on the importance of maintaining trust and confidence in our planning system.  However, I am sorry, but I do not have it at the moment.  I will explain why.</p> <p> I know there were underhanded goings-on in relation to Moore Street in terms of the State, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage officials and Dublin City Council officials lining up with the current owner of the site to offer a package for loss of earnings to the area's street traders.  However, that &euro;1.7 million was tied to three conditions, thus making it a bribe.  The figure quoted is not disputed.  A trader has put it that they received three offers: the first one was &euro;1 million; the second was &euro;1.5 million; and the third and final offer was &euro;1.7 million.  How much value is put on the disruption of history?  </p> <p> The traders on the most recent ministerial Moore Street Advisory Group, MSAG, were being told to endorse the Dublin central vision of the Hammerson group, involving the destruction of much of the historic Moore Street site.  They were specifically told to vote for a report to the Minister that also endorsed the same.  They were instructed to issue a statement going back on their earlier support for the Ceathr&uacute; Chult&uacute;ir 1916 Bill, my own Bill, which had unanimously passed First and Second Stages in the D&aacute;il and is awaiting Committee Stage.  They were also told to give a commitment not to submit any planning objections to the applications that Hammerson was about to make late last year regarding that site.  That is a bribe - there are no two ways about it - because it is conditional.  The supposed package was conditional on them taking those actions.  That is also gross interference in the planning process.  It is gross interference in the legislative process given that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, had earlier indicated here in the D&aacute;il that he would take his lead in relation to my Bill from the MSAG report.  It is also interference in the function of the same Minister&rsquo;s own advisory group.</p> <p> Thankfully, the traders walked away in disgust literally minutes before the MSAG&rsquo;s finally deliberative meeting in May 2021.  While I made that charge to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, earlier this year, he dismissed my concerns as being unfounded allegations, without asking me for any proof, without asking for the help of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, without even picking up the phone to ask his own party members who are on the MSAG whether those allegations stood up or without even asking the traders who walked away who had been in the media backing up the allegations I had made.  As far as I am aware, the allegations have never been directly put to the traders by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or anybody else.  </p> <p> Was the Minister aware of what was happening in his Department under his watch?  Did he agree the bribe figures and amount?  Did he agree that officials from his Department were colluding and were allowed to so with a private developer and the city council to interfere in this way to attempt to bribe ordinary Dublin citizens concerned about their future livelihoods to act illegally?</p></speech>

It is timely and important.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a critical arm of the State.  Since it was established, it has, by and large, served this country and its citizens well.  My party, namely, the Labour Party, has been a strong supporter of the principles of An Bord Plean&aacute;la when it is acting at its best.  We believe in the organisation and its importance.  We believe in robust, transparent decision making and adjudication systems and third-party statutory independent appeals processes to vindicate citizens&rsquo; rights.  What is also vital to the functioning of a robust appeals system, especially one dealing with important planning matters - issues that have massive impact on our personal lives, how we develop and plan our communities, our economy and our society and how we protect our environment - is the question of integrity and public trust.  We know only too well, and experience in relatively recent history tells us, how the greed and avarice of some politicians and some public officials over the years destroyed confidence in the political system, local government and some other important institutions of State.</p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has, by and large, commanded the confidence of the public.  It was seen as a body that was fiercely and correctly independent, that protected its independence from local authorities, the Department and central government for good reason, and was the last bastion and form of protection outside recourse of the courts for the vindication of the rights of citizens on planning matters.  While one may have, from time to time, quibbled with individual decisions it made or policy positions it may have taken, it was with a degree of confidence that we could follow the logic of a decision or adjudication.  We understood, largely, how decisions were made in compliance with the law, regulations, local development plans and other national obligations and requirements.</p> <p>For many years, it seemed to be a body that was almost above criticism or, at least, saw itself as being above and beyond criticism.  It was beyond reproach.  We were not advised and it was never suggested that we were permitted to publicly criticise An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I recall the - I was going to say &quot;veiled&quot; - less-than-veiled criticism from some quarters that was levelled at one of the Minister's predecessors, namely, Deputy Alan Kelly, when he initiated a review into An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2016.  Frankly, there was hostility from the Department, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and some other actors in the planning and development community to that initiative - one that we can now conclude was very important.  I will return to that initiative.  In truth, no public body is beyond criticism.  That should always have been the case, especially for a body as omnipotent, almost, as An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Informed criticism and regular review are crucial to the proper functioning of all public services and no public body should be immune from that.<br/><br/>Recent events have rocked public confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la<b>.  </b>By any stretch, it is extraordinary that the alleged actions of a former deputy chair of the board were considered to be so serious that a senior counsel had to be put on the job and undertake a review into those actions in the context of alleged conflicts of interest.  I note that, as the Minister put on the record in August and now in the House, the report has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  That suggests the report was provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.  It is advisable, of course, that we do not comment any further on the substance of that but, rather, allow the independent DPP to come to a conclusion.  I understand why the Minister is unable to publish the Remy Farrell report, although I would like it to be otherwise.  It is clear there are matters contained in the report that are of ongoing interest to other authorities.  We will allow that process to conclude uninterrupted. <br/><br/>There is also an internal review that is being undertaken by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on its rules and procedures.  We do not know exactly what it is considering because, as far as I can establish, the terms of reference are not available.  This is all somewhat opaque and I would prefer if that were not the case.  As the Minister said, there is a review ongoing with the Office of the Planning Regulator, and that is to be welcomed.<br/><br/>I return to the 2016 review.  Arguably, if the bulk of the key recommendations of the 2016 review initiated by Deputy Alan Kelly had been implemented, we would not be here today discussing these issues.  Although the independent review chaired by Gregory Jones noted &quot;a well-deserved high reputation for its integrity and professionalism&quot; at the time, it listed 101 recommendations that were needed to reform An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Earlier this year, Deputy Kelly highlighted that only a miserable 36 of the 101 recommendations made in 2016 had been implemented in the six years since the independent review was commissioned and the report published.  It seems that another 23 non-completed recommendations are now going to be examined again under different reviews.  Six years on from the Jones review, much of this seems to be a rinse-and-repeat job.  The reality is that many of the issues that were identified then are long-standing issues.  They are still issues now and they cannot be ignored.  As my colleague, Deputy Kelly, said, this has been going on way too long.  Six years have been wasted, quite frankly, due to the lack of political will to deal with the scale of some of the challenges and changes required.<br/><br/>It is worth putting some of these recommendations on the record, especially in the context of the Government's housing crisis.  They include giving the board legally binding timelines of 12 weeks to process general cases, giving the body the power to award costs against any party that has acted unreasonably in its planning appeal to the board and the reform of outdated processes for appointing members of the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la<b></b>by recruiting two members through open competition.  All these issues feed into this debate and the situation the board finds itself in at the moment.  I recall well the resistance to the initiation of the Jones review in 2016 and, quite frankly, attempts to bury some of the more important recommendations contained in that report.  If many of the recommendations in the report had been implemented, there would be more transparency in terms of how An Bord Plean&aacute;la does its business.  There would be much more clarity and accountability.  There would, for example, have been reform in respect of how long a board member can serve.  That would have promoted new thinking and fresh perspectives, as well as more rotation and fewer potential conflicts of interest, with strict rotation in the context of who is making decisions on what kinds of cases.  There would have been measures to widen the definitions and scope of what constitutes a conflict of interest.<br/><br/>I am interested in the view of the Minister on this because it is an issue that also impacts on the ongoing review of ethics legislation more generally.  The broader definition of what may constitute a conflict of interest needs to change and be modernised and updated.  There would have been changes to make more transparent the appointment of board members.  There would have been provision, for example, for greater support in internally reviewing decisions.  We have had six wasted years and that has allowed issues such as these to emerge and a controversy such as this to fester.  For trust and confidence in the board to be built up, we need to act quickly and the Minister needs to act expeditiously.  What has been going on and come to public attention is really damaging but it is important that those matters came to public attention.  If this Government and the previous one had acted, there is a good chance we would not be here discussing these issues today.<br/><br/>In essence, the earlier remarks of the Minister covered my final remarks.  I suspect that morale in An Bord Plean&aacute;la is very low at the moment and that should be an issue of concern for us.  All Members know there are good, professional and dedicated public servants who work there.  They work there for the right reasons and they discharge their responsibilities in a professional, efficient, open and transparent fashion but there is a cloud hanging over them now and that cloud should be lifted from them.  The Minister needs to move quickly and decisively to restore trust and confidence.  I will elaborate on a remark made by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, earlier.  If the Minister is taking this reform in the right direction, the Opposition will support him.  This is a matter on which we can unite if the Minister gets it right.  We in the Labour Party are happy to work with him to get this matter of serious public interest resolved once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500033#KK00200"><p>I thank the Minister for the opportunity to have this debate today.  It is vital because, as all present are aware, the planning system is at the heart of everything we do and, right now, there is an urgent need to restore trust in that system.   Planning objectives and decisions impact on every person and town in Ireland.  The planning system decides where we live, the type of houses and apartments we live in, how we get to work and where those employment locations will be.  It decides the location of our places for education, public services and community and recreational activities, as well as how our towns grow and how we relate to those towns.  It goes well beyond our built environment.  Planning must also protect, preserve and restore our natural environment and be to the forefront in climate action and protecting our water quality and biodiversity.  Without a reliable, resourced and functional planning system, we will fail to build the houses we need to build for our people.  Without it, we will fail to build the transport links that are needed or to deliver renewable energy infrastructure, schools and employment opportunities.  We will fail to address our climate challenge and fail future generations as we destroy our environment.  The planning system is an essential step in the delivery of those objectives.  The planning system needs to be trustworthy.  The decisions from local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la have multiple impacts on families, residents and individuals.  The decisions impact on local areas, as well as entire communities or regions, both in the short term and for decades into the future.  The decisions are based on a hierarchy of planning objectives from the highest level in the national planning framework, such as compact growth, decarbonisation and regional balance, to the lowest effective level in county development or local area plans, down to the more granular detail applicable to the objectives for that county or town.  Trust in the planning system is not obtained as a result of getting or not getting the decision one wants.  Rather, it is earned through consistency and adherence to the principles of sustainability and proper planning, with the common good to the fore in all those decisions.</p> <p>Trust in planning is earned through the democratic process of elected public representatives to agree objectives in those national, regional, county and local development plans and trust is earned by public participation through consultation and public submissions to craft those development plans, and through public observations submitted on planning applications based on the democratically agreed objectives for our towns, counties or regions.</p> <p> Trust in the planning system was badly eroded by the introduction of strategic housing developments, SHDs, in 2017.  It eliminated a vitally important stage in public participation and local democracy in planning.  Despite the findings of the Mahon tribunal which exposed endemic political interference and corruption in land zoning and decision making from a generation before, the SHD legislation appears to have created greater damage to trust in politics and planning.  Thankfully SHD applications have been ended by this Government, which is a positive move, and we have replaced it with a new system called large scale residential development.  That restores the decision making back to local authorities and enables vitally important public participation at that stage.</p> <p> A further concern on erosion of trust in the planning system and local planning objectives is the use of the specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs.  They were introduced under section 28 ministerial guidelines and they can and often do run roughshod over locally agreed planning objectives especially in relation to height and design standards.  The SPPRs have recently been criticised by many professional planners.  Indeed the Irish Planning Institute has called for them to be revoked.  That is something we need to look at closely.  We need to carry out research to see what the impact of revoking the SPPRs would be.</p> <p> Those who are privileged with the responsibility to make planning decisions that shape our towns and cities also have a critical role in protecting trust in the planning system.  The recent allegations regarding members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la have further eroded trust in the planning system.  It is important that these allegations are investigated quickly and thoroughly and that the findings and recommendations of any investigations are acted on effectively by this Government and by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien.</p> <p> As allegations began to surface and were reported in the media in regard to some decisions of board members at An Bord Plean&aacute;la the Minister appointed senior counsel to carry out an investigation entitled Report into the Management of Conflicts of Interest and Relevant Disclosures by the Deputy Chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in Regard to Certain Decisions of the Board and Related Matters.  My Green Party colleagues and I were of the very strong view at the time that the investigation needed to be swift and thorough and to report back within an short timeframe.  I am satisfied that the Minister took this view on board in his actions.  The report was commissioned in April and finally agreed in May to be completed by July when it was given to the Minister who immediately sent a copy of it to the Attorney General for legal advice.  I understand the Attorney General advised the report be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Minister, acting on that advice, referred it to the DPP, the Garda Commissioner and the Standards in Public Office, SIPO.  It is now a matter for the DPP as to whether a criminal prosecution should be undertaken arising from the findings of the report.  It is vitally important for the restoration of trust in our planning system and in the public interest that the report is published as soon as possible.  Indeed all of the investigations and the reports must be investigated as soon as possible.  I understand the Minister has received the advice of the DPP which is to await the Garda investigation.  I stand by that sensible advice.</p> <p> We need all of these investigations to be completed thoroughly and published.  When that is completed I suggest that we scrutinise them in the Oireachtas committee.  I know the Minister would be open to that.  To begin the process of rebuilding confidence the Minister has outlined measures he intends to take and is seeking engagement with the committee and others on these measures which will include the independent organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, with senior counsel and independent planning experts from other jurisdictions and a new appointment process for board members.  Other measures underway include a review of the code of conduct of An Bord Plean&aacute;la being undertaken by the board, the cessation of two-person decision-making panels, an internal review to determine any revision of processes pertaining to the allocation of files, decision procedures and amendments to inspectors' reports.  It is also intended that a senior legal advisor will be appointed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to support these measures.</p> <p> The Minister has communicated with me as chair of the Oireachtas committee and has given an undertaking to furnish the reports to the committee pending the advice of the DPP.  There will be further engagement with the committee and with officials from the Department.  We will participate in the procedures to address matters at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I issued an invitation on behalf of the committee members to the chair of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Mr. David Walsh, and I expect Mr. Walsh to appear as a matter of urgency at the committee.  I expect that the committee with the agreement of the members will also invite the Office of the Planning Regulator to appear at an appropriate time in relation to its review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p> It is a priority and in the best interests of everyone in our country that issues at An Bord Plean&aacute;la are addressed quickly, that malfeasance if any is identified and that anyone who has been found to have not acted in the best interest of the people and for proper planning is removed and appropriate actions taken against such persons.  It is important at the same time to recognise that there are good people working hard throughout that organisation and it is critical to the future of planning in this country.  There are good planners and staff in our local authorities in forward planning, developing local and county plans voted on by councillors.  There are professionals across the planning system who act in the best interest of society for sustainability and the common good.  There are good people working through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on policy and legislation consistently to improve the planning system.  Those people need to be acknowledged, supported and protected from those who give planning a bad name.  It is important that there is a robust system in place that identifies and holds those accountable that seek local planning objectives and zonings that are against the advice of council chief executives, senior planners, the planning regulator and against the advice of professional transport planners in transport agencies.</p> <p> It may be suggested that non-compliance with advice is minor or insignificant, however there is a cumulative impact from these decisions that manifests many years later through lack of local services, school places, transport deficits and a general poor quality of life for people who have to live in those areas.  Many of us in this Chamber may have sat through county development plan processes where poor decisions are made and advice is dismissed; where a lobbyist or individual landowner's gain may be beneficial to a councillor or party but that comes at the expense further down the road in the form of flooding, car dependency and lack of access to services for future residents.  I only wish more residents had the time and opportunity to witness and attend a county development plan vote.  Planning is not an exact science but paying heed to professional advice is rarely a bad idea.</p> <p> The planning system is currently under review by the Attorney General and the Oireachtas committee has met on four occasions with senior departmental staff to engage with the review of the system.  The committee will have a full part to play in the legislative changes that may arise from the Attorney General's review with the expectation that legislation will be ready over the coming months.  This aligns with the programme for Government commitment to "review and reform the judicial review process, so that such reforms come into effect upon the establishment of the Environmental and Planning Law Court, while always adhering to our EU law obligations under the Aarhaus Convention".  It is critical to the future of our country and to the overarching infrastructural energy, transport, housing and development needs to address climate breakdown, that there is a fully functional, trustworthy, accountable and resourced planning system both at local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la level.  The system must enshrine the principles of proper planning, sustainable development and the common good in all decisions.  Those decisions, regardless of who makes them, must be taken with integrity, honesty and independence and be capable of standing up to scrutiny at every stage.  Public trust must be restored and planning must be seen for the benefit it brings to all, now and for future generations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500034#LL00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I will focus on the need to improve An Bord Plean&aacute;la as it has an important role in this State realising its renewable potential, in particular at this time its offshore wind potential.</p> <p>We know that we have a great resource in this State and there is a long-term potential of 70 GW of ocean energy opportunity from wind, wave and tidal sources.  Unfortunately, decades of under-ambition and painfully slow regulatory advancement has suffocated the development of this natural resource.  This is highlighted by the fact that we have just one small wind farm currently in operation.  The climate crisis, our energy security concerns, and the skyrocketing costs of light and heat reinforce the need to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind potential.  The European Union has encouraged countries to ensure that their planning systems and authorities are sufficiently resourced to deliver on decisions on these projects as quickly as possible and that they should receive priority.</p> <p> We need to ensure that offshore projects that are now planned are not unduly delayed due to Government inaction, that they are robustly scrutinised to assess the biodiversity and environmental impact and that communities have an opportunity to have their say.  I would like to see that as many of those projects as possible are State-owned or led or community-owned or led.  We need timely decisions which do not necessarily need to be quick but agreed ones.  </p> <p> We need proper statutory timeframes that are enforced and adhered to.  We have statutory objectives but they are being missed by a country mile.  For example, in decisions on planning appeals for renewables projects, of the ten planning appeals cases taken to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, none were decided within the 18-week statutory objective.  The average time for a decision was 60 weeks and the average time for the board inspectors to make a recommendation was 35 weeks.</p> <p> On strategic infrastructure development, SID, applications, of the three SID applications heard by the board, none were decided within the 18-week statutory objective and the average time for decision was 69 weeks.  The average time for the board inspectors to make a recommendation was 47 weeks.  That is completely inadequate.  </p> <p> As for achieving those timelines, I am aware of the deep frustration and I hear from State agencies and private developers that their deep concern is not so much with the prospect of getting a refusal but is of the inordinate delay in obtaining a decision one way or the other.  Those statutory timelines need to be adhered to and to do that, they need to be resourced.  We know that it is the case that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's marine and climate unit is significantly under-resourced.  This is an issue I have raised with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on numerous occasions, which is the resourcing of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, our planning authorities, but also the wider planning system, including the notified bodies whether that be through BirdWatch Ireland, the Irish Environmental Network, and the agencies and NGOs that it supports.  The system needs to be provided with the resources and the capacity to do its job in a timely manner.</p> <p> That brings me to my final point on the need, which is committed to in the programme for Government, for a planning and environmental court.  This commitment in that programme is to establish a new planning and environmental law court managed by specialist judges and on the same basis as the existing commercial court model.  I understand that there are ongoing discussions taking place with the Department of Justice on that and as to how it might work.  It will have a very important role, particularly to bring Ireland in line with its European and international obligations.  That is something the Minister should take on board and ensure that it happens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500035#MM00200"><p>At the outset, with reference to the 2016 report that was ordered by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, I wish to state that some of the recommendations in that report, if implemented, would be a disaster.  If that is not clear to people after recent events, I do not know when it will be clear.  One of those recommendations was that some decisions would be made, in some cases, by a sole or one board member.  For any party or Deputy to think that those sort of recommendations should be implemented is highly questionable.</p><p>I agree with previous comments that we should have a full response from the Minister on which recommendations have been implemented, why the other ones have not and which ones are still under consideration.  I would certainly not fully endorse that report and all of the recommendations in it.  I also agree with the need to abolish the so-called mandatory ministerial guidelines and to restore local democratic development plans, which is very important.  I also am concerned, arising from the Minister&rsquo;s speech, that there are multiple allegations in regard to multiple members of the board and about the manner in which these are being investigated.  I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s speech that they are not being independently investigated and are only subject to an internal review by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that the investigation by the OPR is more general in its processes.  It is acceptable that those multiple allegations about multiple board members should only be subject to some sort of internal review.  These should be robustly and independently investigated.</p><p>The reason we are having this debate now is because of excellent investigative journalism done by <i>The Ditch</i>website and also followed up by the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  We should not have to rely on the media to be doing that if State bodies had been doing their job properly.  It is entirely legitimate to ask the question as to why the Office of the Planning Regulator did not act on a very detailed complaint it was given on 28 November 2021 by retired <i>The Irish Times</i>journalist Frank McDonald.  He submitted an 18-page complaint to the Office of the Planning Regulator detailing many of the issues that have subsequently emerged in the media.  We need to know from the OPR why that complaint was not fully investigated and what steps are in place to ensure that in future, such complaints are treated seriously.  That was a detailed complaint from a credible source.</p><p>We need to know from the Minister why there is not an independent investigation going on in regard to the other allegations in respect of the other board members.  I will not go into the details of these; they have been published extensively in the media.  There are allegations about conflicts of interest in terms of board members making decisions that affect them directly in their local area, conflicts of interests on their personal connections, a great number of decisions being made in one meeting and decisions being made by two members of the board when the legislation is clear that in respect of strategic housing development, SHD, applications, the minimum number of board members required for such decisions is three.  Indeed, there are allegations about a high level of refusals and of overturning of inspectors&rsquo; reports.  We need to have robust independent investigation into that, as well as answers given.</p><p>We need to hear from the chair of the board as to why it did not notice that anything wrong was going on or, if it had noticed that something wrong was going on, why it did not act upon it and why there were not sufficient internal checks and controls.  How was it that the legislation could be breached by two members making decisions and did the chair knew of that or not?  We also need to hear about the practice of random allocation of files and why that was abandoned by the board.  That was a key safeguard.  We need to know when that decision was made, by whom and on what basis it was made.  We need to know why a large number of decisions, especially on strategic housing developments, were concentrated among two board members, in particular.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la spent &euro;8.2 million defending itself against legal challenges when it came to strategic housing development rulings.  That alone should have raised significant alarm bells internally for the board.  Why did it not?</p>  <p>In terms of the issue of inspectors being put under pressure to amend their reports, we need to have the answers on that and we need to ask were any inspectors assigned to different areas because some board members or members of the senior management may not have agreed with reports.  Has that question been asked?  Is the Minister asking that question and looking for answers?  Will there be any independent engagement with inspectors to get their views and input on this?  As said previously, the practice of randomly allocating files to inspectors needs to be brought in so we do not have a situation where certain inspectors are being allocated certain files and other inspectors are not, where this could be based on previous reports fitting or not fitting with the wishes of senior management or the board.  All of that needs to be very thoroughly and robustly investigated by the Minister if we want to restore confidence in the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p> We must also have an analysis of strategic housing development decisions by the board to see whether there are any patterns emerging in terms of who was making decisions on particular applicants and developers, and whether there is any pattern as to applicants or developers getting their permissions granted very consistently by the same board members.  That presumably would be quite an easy analysis to conduct.  It should be conducted and the findings of that should be shared with us as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> These allegations have been in the public domain since April and, several months on, some of these basic questions have still not been answered.  I am not sure if some of these basic questions are even being asked by the Minister or the Government.  Of course, if we do not ask these questions and do not look for answers, we are not going to find anything.</p> <p> On the question of a new appointments process for the board, it is very important that board members are appointed and that the board has independence, and that any changes in the appointments process do not further undermine the independence of the board.  There is considerable concern that any changes could, in fact, mean that rather than the board being more independent, for example, of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, if it is a process where that Department is heavily involved and effectively has a veto through the Public Appointments Service, that could further undermine the independence of the board, which would be highly problematic.</p> <p> It is very important that the planning review that the Government is undertaking is not rushed through.  We saw before the end of the last D&aacute;il several amendments and changes to planning legislation rushed through, so the Government&rsquo;s form on this is incredibly poor.  If there is anything the Government should learn from all of this in terms of what has gone wrong in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is in regard to the strategic housing development legislation that was brought in back in 2016.  The research conducted independently by Dr. Mick Lennon of UCD and Dr. Richard Waldron of Queens University, Belfast, where they interviewed people involved in that legislation, including lobbyists for Property Industry Ireland, is very clear.  A lobbyist from Property Industry Ireland states that the proposals were given to the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Simon Coveney, and they were implemented lock, stock and barrel.  We all know at this point that that legislation, rather than making delivery of housing faster, has led to delays, more litigation and more judicial reviews.  It was a disastrous approach.  I urge the Minister and the Government, in terms of any changes in planning legislation, not to rush it through and to look for proper scrutiny so we can ensure further mistakes are not made in this area.  We must avoid what Dr. Lorcan Sirr described in terms of the strategic housing development legislation as &ldquo;regulatory capture&rdquo;, where the Government and the regulators were, in fact, captured by those they were seeking to regulate.  That should not be the basis for forming planning legislation.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity for statements on the matter.</p>  <p>  The landscape around planning has changed dramatically in the last decade but, as the previous speaker said, it was changed very dramatically by the introduction of and the acquiescence of Government to the strategic housing development process in 2016.  For people listening who might be new to it, the strategic housing development process was intended to be a fast-track planning process, possibly well-intentioned, to ensure that new homes - at the time, in my mind, homes equated to houses - would be delivered on sites in a much more efficient manner.  The whole idea was that a local authority would essentially be cut out from the process and the application would go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, thereby eliminating the input of local people, local communities and their representatives, and also overriding county development plans, local area plans, height prohibitions in particular counties and densities.  It drove a coach and four through what had preceded it, all with the intention of delivering more homes on the ground more quickly.</p>  <p>  When we eliminate the role and ability of the public to contribute meaningfully to a planning process, they will always find an alternative way.  When An Bord Plean&aacute;la made decisions, suddenly there were communities taking judicial reviews, a process that had previously been considered to be only for those with deep pockets.  Community organisations and residents associations discovered, as one person said to me, that all they need to do is hold ten cake sales and that will finance a judicial review.  On top of that, successful judicial reviews do not have to be paid for at all by the individuals, groups or organisations who take them.  What has resulted is a situation where what was intended to be a fast-track planning process has become mired, bogged down and tangled up, never mind the controversy piece, with groups who never saw the need to take legal action against decisions by a planning authority now queueing up.</p>  <p>  What was very interesting and refreshing was when Mr. Justice Hunt, in the case of an SHD in my own constituency, overrode the unbelievable decisions of the local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to say that a development consisting of 400 or 500 units would have little or no impact on local traffic and that no provision had to be made in regard to public transport.  I think that has set a very useful precedent that the NTA and South Dublin County Council, in making their planning decisions and in contributing to planning applications by way of commentary, need to take note of.  A judge of the High Court said, to the best of my knowledge, that transport and public transport are issues and are grounds for the refusal of a planning application.</p>  <p>  That is the background.  It means that because An Bord Plean&aacute;la became the only port of call for people who wanted to lodge an observation to a planning application, it started to increase the kind of oversight, scrutiny and interest that people took in the decisions of the board whereas, previously, if the local county council had turned down the application, people had often been happy with that.  Of course, if they had not objected at council level, they could not object at board level.  Sometimes, they appealed to the board and if the board upheld the decision of the council, then the public felt they had had their say - while they may have been very unhappy, dissatisfied and frustrated, they felt they had had their say.  There is a real need to restore the efficacy of the planning system in Ireland to ensure people have confidence in it.</p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la was almost seen as a court of independent opinion.</p> <p>I have become alarmed over a number of years at the lack of transparency we see.  I do not have time to say much about the stories that were recounted by a previous speaker, such as that of a local authority approving a planning application, someone appealing it, the inspector at the board approving it, but two or three members of the board then overturning that decision.  There is no transparency in such a case as to how that minority of board members came to the decision.  Whether the public agrees or not, there is a lot to be said for those decisions not being held <i>in camera</i>, in order that people can see exactly the process that led the board to its decision.<br/><br/>Having been party to oral hearings at An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I acknowledge it does incredibly good work, as do its officials.  In regard to its oversight of planning appeals taken to it by third parties, I have always found it to be very thorough.  However, the events of recent months, in which there have been question marks over a number of board decisions and some of its members, have led to a situation that must be answered.  The efficacy and good name of the board must be restored, if they are restorable, in order that the public can have absolute confidence that when people submit a submission on, or objection to, an application, it will be dealt with fairly and transparently, leaving no gaps for confusion or frustration at the end of the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500037#OO00200"><p>I would be very slow to comment on any content in the Remy Farrell report or any of the allegations that have arisen.  Due process will take effect and we need to be cognisant of that in this debate.  Nonetheless, it is fair to register on the record our concerns regarding some of those allegations.  The public must have trust in our planning system.  People must trust in the impartiality and integrity of the system if it is to function sustainably.  We need to ask ourselves a fundamental question, which is whether that environment and culture of integrity and faith exist at present among the public.  The honest answer is "Probably not", as faith in the agency has undoubtedly been shaken.</p>  <p>  To that end, I welcome the interim steps the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State have taken.  I welcome their sanctioning of a further 24 posts at An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with a commitment to review its staffing resources shortly.  That is much needed and long overdue.  We must ask ourselves whether a system that can take anything up to 18 months to deal with a one-off housing appeal is fit for purpose.  Given the current inflationary cycle, the price of building a house could increase twofold by the time a decision is adjudicated upon.  We need an appeal process that is quick, fair and transparent, not one that facilitates prevarication and sleepless nights for people looking to build a home.</p>  <p>  The thing that irks me the most about the current appeals process is that I find myself actively discouraging people from appealing refusals on their own submissions, as it is not justifiable to appeal a decision and then sit and wait for 12 to 18 months for it to be reviewed.  It is far more appropriate, and sometimes more economical of time, to revert back to local authorities, if possible, to address concerns.  In such cases, I ask myself afterwards whether I gave the right advice to those people.  Hindsight is a great thing but one never knows at the time what is best.  No public representative should be in the position of having actively to discourage people from going through a perfectly legal and sound appeals process because it could cost the person too much time.  That highlights one of the main problems we have with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is key to the question of whether it is fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  I understand the review by the Attorney General, which the Government has undertaken for the past 12 months, will come before Members shortly.  The one thing on which I disagree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan is on his point about taking our time on this.  Yes, it is important to take the necessary time, but it needs to be done quickly because we are facing a massive challenge in the next few years in terms of green and renewable energy.  Let us face it, a lot of the projects in question are contentious and cause considerable concern to people locally.  We need a board or another agency that is fit to deal with the large number of applications that are likely to come before it in the next few years.  As I have outlined before, any process that takes two, three or four years for some of these developments to progress is not fit for purpose.  If we are sincere about challenging the energy crisis we face and converting as much as possible to renewable and green energy, we need a vehicle that is able to streamline applications and prioritise projects that will help us to get out of this energy crisis.</p>  <p>  Under An Bord Plean&aacute;la's own guidelines, members and staff are subject to its code of conduct and its internal grievance and disciplinary procedures.  As of now, I understand the Minister has no role in such matters relating to staff or members of the board.  When it comes to any future legislative changes and any organisational changes that may be addressed in the review, it is imperative that there be avenues for the Minister of the day to intervene where there may be cases of impropriety or question marks about any board member.</p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la must be adequately resourced.  I welcome the sanctioning of an initial 24 additional staff but, in the long term, we probably need multiples of that if we are to have an efficient and transparent appeals process.  Decisions must be expedited, particularly in the area of green and renewable energy.  We cannot have a situation where people go on waiting endlessly and facing missed appeal dates only to get new letters giving another appeal date that will undoubtedly not be met.  We need to ensure transparency.  A number of speakers referred to two board members sitting and adjudicating on what sometimes were large decisions.  We must put an end to that practice and ensure full transparency in all activities of the board.</p></speech>

We in this State have had a colourful relationship with planning.  On that basis, it is absolutely necessary that we have an impartial and trustworthy planning framework and infrastructure.  I accept that files have been sent to the DPP and I accept that the Garda is investigating, which limits what can be said.  However, given what has happened, it is absolutely necessary to deal with any element of impropriety in regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not think anyone has any major issue with the review of the organisation in regard to board appointments, the decision-making process, compliance, the recruitment process, corporate governance oversight, operations and efficiency.  These are all terms we agree with but we need to see action on them.  There has been much discussion about the Attorney General's review of planning and we all may have different views on what the issues have been over the years.  Most Members who spoke today, particularly on the Opposition side, referred to the difficulties and the absolute mistakes that were made in regard to SHDs.  I will move on from that.</p>  <p>  The Minister said in his speech that the Attorney General's review will be finished during the fourth quarter.  In the document that was circulated to Members, however, the reference is to the end of December.  I assume that is the correct date.  We all know there have been huge issues with planning and huge issues for anybody who is looking at large and necessary infrastructure projects.  We also know there has been an absolute failure to communicate and converse with communities, particularly at the beginning of any of these major projects, and that it should be possible to deal with a considerable number of such difficulties prior to their blowing up into enormous difficulties.  However, we are not always good at doing that preventative piece of work.</p>  <p>  We all accept the absolute need for An Bord Plean&aacute;la but there has been an abject failure to resource it over the years.</p> <p>This is more of what we do.  We may set up reasonable structures and within any set-up in this State, we even may have a sufficient number of positions at times to deliver on particular services, but then we do not have those positions filled and staffed.  In some cases, such as with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we definitely have not done the business regarding resourcing.  </p> <p> Earlier, Deputy O'Rourke spoke about the marine and climate unit in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the major difficulties there.  We all know the issue we are dealing with now concerning energy security and the absolute necessity of transitioning to renewables.  We all know we can be a global superpower in offshore wind energy production, in particular, but we must ensure that we have planning processes that can deliver on this potential.  I suppose this also means that we must deal with all those linked parts in respect of the framework we have in place and ensure they are working.  Therefore, we will all be very happy to see what the outworkings of the Attorney General's review are and what legislative moves will be undertaken.  </p> <p> We must, however, have all those pieces in place to enable us to deliver on what is even more necessary now than it was before, in the sense of the world we now operate in, where we are being held to ransom due to the exorbitant and excessive price of gas and other energy sources.  We understand the geopolitical situation that has caused some of this situation.  Where there are supply chain issues, we also know that the problem is that there are people looking to profit at every link along that line.  Therefore, we must ensure we are doing everything necessary at domestic, European and international levels.  We must also ensure, though, that we have a trustworthy planning infrastructure on which people can rely on and one in which it is not seen that people, or some people, can get favours.  Beyond that, such planning infrastructure must unquestionably be fit for purpose and must not hold up the necessary infrastructural projects that must happen.  This is all before I mention anything regarding housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500038#PP00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.  How do the Irish rich get rich?  The answer is property.  To a substantial extent, it is through property and property development.  What has been one of the major sources of corruption and corruption scandals in this country in recent years?  The answer again is property and property development.  This is what is at stake when we are talking about the integrity of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the entire planning process.  We have a shameful history of corruption in the context of property because people can become very rich very quickly if certain planning decisions are made, or not made.  One of the interesting things about one of these allegations - and I will not, of course, prejudice the investigation of these things - against Mr. Hyde is that he had a stake in development land near a site where he was involved in denying planning permission.  I do not know if that allegation is true or not, but it is interesting, is it not?  It is interesting, of course, because if someone has development land in one place, it could possibly be in his or her interest to not allow a development near it which might undermine that person's ability to make a profit on it.  I think this may well explain the slowness in delivering social and affordable housing.  Why on earth would private, for-profit developers want to see lots of affordable and social housing that would be cheaper than the very expensive housing they want to build and sell?</p>  <p>  To give an example, we have been campaigning for 15 years to get public and affordable housing built on the site at Shanganagh.  Not a sod has been turned but private developers are banging up so-called strategic housing developments all over the place.  They are making lots and lots of money.  They are getting planning permission, and then sometimes not building or building at their own pace when they can maximise their profits.  Of course, we remember from the Celtic tiger days that much of the stuff these private developers built turned out to be rubbish.  As we are now going to discover with the defective buildings scandal, perhaps 70% or 80% of what was built during the Celtic tiger era was defective in respect of fire regulations.  People are now going to carry the can for large amounts of money, while all this building was rubber-stamped through the planning system to create fortunes for those property developers who helped to crash the entire economy.  </p>  <p>  There is a very important warning in this.  The integrity of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la planning system should come into very sharp focus when we talk about the dangers of what was done on land by private property developers and a planning system that did not work properly in the context of what may now be done offshore.  I say this because there is a gold rush under way in respect of the development of offshore sites for renewable energy production, mostly by private, for-profit companies.  One way we could, at least potentially, mitigate the possibility of corrupt and poor planning driven by profit is not to give away our offshore sites for renewable energy production to private, for-profit companies, as we are doing now.  That would at least remove some of the incentives for corruption and bad planning.  Therefore, a lot is at stake in getting this process right.</p>  <p>  I find it interesting, of course, that so many Deputies, particularly on the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael benches, are forever giving out about the fact that ordinary people may object to certain developments and that they might take judicial reviews.  I heard Deputy Lahart make the ridiculous suggestion that ten cake sales could be enough to fund the taking of a judicial review.  He has obviously never been involved in trying to mount a judicial review.  It costs tens of thousands of euro.  Communities mostly do not have the wherewithal to mount judicial reviews against what are often awful planning applications, driven purely by profit.  Another aspect concerns the planners.  One way to ensure the integrity of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is to listen to the planners.  It is shocking that a group of two people, often appointed from organisations that did not even exist, are making planning decisions where they override professional planners and they are not even required to give a planning reason as to why they have done so.  Therefore, we need root-and-branch reform of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

The only reason we know this is because of the work and the serious stories published by <i>The Ditch</i>, especially over a period of about six months, about what has been happening with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will briefly list just some of the many allegations published on that website.  The publication of these allegations started on 6 April, with a report that Paul Hyde had defaulted on loans and had failed to declare his legal ownership of three properties in the 2021 register, as required by law.  Then, on 12 April, the allegation was made that he had signed off on a controversial build-to-rent development on which his brother's company had worked.  On 13 April, another allegation was made that Mr. Hyde had not declared a conflict of interest when refusing planning permission for a development beside land owned by his firm.  On 22 April, it was further alleged that he had not recused himself during 2019 and 2020 from at least a further six housing development applications on which his brother's company had worked.  On 27 April, it was alleged that he had voted against a proposed housing scheme on a site bordering development land owned by his father.  On 6 May, the allegation was made that he had approved the controversial planning application made by his sister-in-law-----</p></speech>

The allegation concerning the application made by his sister-in-law concerned a property she co-owns with Mr. Hyde's brother.  On 11 May, it was alleged that another board member had voted on at least three planning applications in the Dublin 6 suburb where she lived.  One of these was less than 400 m from her home.  On 30 May, another allegation was published that she had approved planning permission for a development application brought by one of her company's clients.  On 31 May, it was then further alleged that the director of planning, a different person, had signed off on three major housing development applications that had been brought by her husband's clients.  One of those was just 500 m from her home.  On 2 June, an allegation was made that she had assigned herself to a planning application in her own neighbourhood.  On 7 June, it was alleged that a board member had not declared her interest in a successful planning appeal when her architecture company had made the appeal on behalf of her next-door neighbour of 15 years.  On 9 June, it was alleged that Mr. Hyde had granted planning permission to a property developer represented by his former board colleague, Mr. Michael Leahy.  On 15 June, an allegation was published that he had not declared a conflict of interest when he refused a hearing to a campaign group concerning a flood defence scheme that is now subject to proceedings in the Supreme Court.</p> <p>On 16 June, it is alleged that another board member voted on a further 15 planning applications in her own Dublin neighbourhood.  On 30 June, it is alleged that just two board members refused a challenge against a controversial Intel expansion in County Kildare despite there being a legal requirement for three board members to make such decisions.  On 7 July, it is alleged that when considering strategic housing developments, board members only disagreed with each other twice out of 400 applications.  On 12 July, it was alleged that two board members were deciding on up to 26 planning cases - a meeting held without a third board member.  On 14 July, it was alleged that two more board members voted on at least three developments in their own neighbourhoods.  On 14 July, it was alleged that despite there being a legal requirement for three members to determine, again, two people were doing so.  On 21 July, it was alleged that Mr. Hyde twice granted planning permission in cases involving his cousin.  On 29 July, it was alleged that An Bord Plean&aacute;la unlawfully ruled on 65% of cases involving alterations to strategic housing developments, SHDs, fast-tracked with two board members acting.  On 5 August, it was alleged that Mr. Hyde granted planning permission to his cousin.  On 8 August, it was that alleged another board member voted on at least six planning applications where they lived.  On 2 September, it was alleged that the senior counsel set to chair the investigation had recently acted in at least three cases before the planning authority.  On 6 September, it was alleged that the chairperson voted to approve a data centre less than a kilometre from his home.  On 15 September, today, it was alleged that a board member twice overruled a planning inspector to block 47 apartments less than half a kilometre from her Dublin 8 home.</p> <p> Our planning system is absolutely broken.  We need a new system that allows affected communities - housing groups, trade unions, environmental groups and others - to have democratic oversight and control of planning and development.</p> <p> The final point I want to make is about the obscene monstrosities of massive electronic billboards being erected outside people's homes, in the case of Rathmines, outside children's bedroom windows, with little or no consultation.  Why are we allowing these monstrosities, which are deliberately distracting for motorists and which use as much energy as three households, which are being restricted in France and Germany for that reason, to happen?  We simply should not, for environmental and for community reasons, be allowing such monstrosities to be erected.</p></speech>

I welcome the speech of the Minister and, indeed, the speeches and the iteration of some of the charges that are being investigated.  It is important that each and every one of those will be fully and properly independently investigated, as I understand it, by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the way it should and must be.</p><p>I pay tribute to former Mr. Justice Feargus Flood, who passed away recently.  He was, in fact, the chair of the tribunal into planning corruption in Dublin city and county some years ago.  The toxic mix of Ministers, developers and politicians was fatal for many of them because of the corruption that was exposed at that time.</p><p>Regardless of where I sit in this House, I will always support transparency and accountability, as, indeed, the vast majority of this House does.</p><p>There were some very important people involved in exposing those issues at that time: Mr. Frank McDonald from <i>The Irish Times</i>; Mr. Charlie Bird from RT&Eacute;; and the famous, or infamous, Mr. Vincent Browne.  They put the spotlight on these issues.  That is proper in the appropriate place.</p><p>Whatever question there is, we have to make sure the ordinary person has confidence in the planning process.  Confidence was shaken in the 1980s and the 1990s.  No doubt it is shaken now and an appropriate and judicious examination of all the issues is terribly important.  Never do we want to hear in any tribunal of inquiry, not that there will be one in the future, what Mr. James Gogarty said to the guy who was with him in the taxi as he went to the Minister's house with two brown envelops with &pound;40,000 in each.  He said, &quot;Will we get a receipt for this?&quot;, referring to the &pound;80,000.  &quot;Will we hell&quot;, or words to that effect, was the response.  That day has to be gone.  It was shocking and appalling.</p><p>For my own part, I have stood in the High Court to vindicate the planning rights of my community.  When developers knocked down a listed building in the middle of the night, my former late colleague, Mr. Eddie O'Doherty, and I took a High Court action because the local authority would not act to vindicate a listed building under a High Court injunction that it could not be demolished without planning permission.  It disappeared overnight on a holiday weekend.  I note the court cases that were fought there.  We fought the civil case and we were witnesses in the criminal case where those who knocked it down were prosecuted and the company, in fact, pleaded guilty.</p><p>The problem is that we do not want history to be repeated.  I thought those fights and those battles that we fought would be ended now but such may not necessarily be the case.</p><p>I welcome what the Minister is doing.  I welcome the commitment to change.  I welcome a strict time limit on membership of the board.  In fact, we probably need a judicial involvement in some respects in the operation of the board.  There could be a case for a judge or a retired judge to review and oversee some of the goings on there to make sure that all of these issues should never arise again and we should look for best practice in other jurisdictions in relation to that.</p><p>There are a couple of points I want to make about the present day.  For instance, in County Meath, there is a proposal by Dawn Meats to have a facility in Beauparc which will impact significantly and, I believe, adversely on the environment of the River Boyne.  Hundreds of people have objected but the facts are that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused to grant those who objected to the facility to An Bord Plean&aacute;la an oral hearing, which, I think, is wrong.  We need to look at that.</p><p>The more time goes on, the more things are the same.  In Drogheda, there is a small estate called Beaulieu View.  There was an open space in it for many years and the person who built the houses has decided to apply for planning permission to put a house on the green open space.  It went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision was that as it was identified as a green space in the original application it could not be built on but, as one might guess, I have had to write an objection this week to Louth County Council because the builder has applied again to build on a green site.  It is a joke.  These things should not be happening and we need greater clarity in these matters.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, I believe the investigations and analysis into An Bord Plean&aacute;la must restore our confidence in the planning process.  The professionalism, as has been remarked on by many people, of the vast majority of people involved in the process hopefully will be vindicated.  If it is not and if people have broken the law or the regulations, they must face the full rigor of the law.  I fully support any actions which the Garda may or may not take into the future after due process.</p><p>This is an important debate.  I welcome the actions of the Minister.  I cannot fault him on any of the points he made in his address to us.</p></speech>

That integrity assures us that while we may disagree with the decision, it was made in good faith, with total objectivity, cognisant of all the arguments by all the stakeholders, and employing expertise and knowledge greater than our own.  In a functioning system we have confidence in the process, we accept the decision and we move on.  That integrity is the basic foundation of the system and without that foundation, we have no system, certainly not a functioning one.</p>  <p>  It is true that the integrity of the Irish planning system has been undermined by these allegations and it is not for the first time.  The system came through a harsh spotlight with the planning tribunal, as Deputies who spoke before me have referenced.  It exposed the corruption within the system.  The Office of the Planning Regulator was set up as a consequence and the general public came to expect it could have confidence in an independent planning system.  That trust is again in tatters.</p>  <p>  As a quasi-judicial body which interprets law and whose interpretations and subsequent decisions have consequences that are social, economic and environmental, we need An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be as above question as it is possible to be - just as we expect of the Judiciary.  If there is room for doubt, that integrity is challenged and all decisions are undermined.</p> <p>That the Minister felt there was a legitimate case to instigate an investigation and that the Director of Public Prosecutions has begun its own investigation is enough in itself to damage severely the board, irrespective of the eventual outcome of those investigations.  Deputies who have spoken before me have outlined what, at a stretch, can be described as a litany of irregular practices at the top of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  They have aired the possibility of sanctions, pending the outcomes of the investigations that are ongoing, and have proposed measures to restore confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The allegations of irregularities are one thing, but we could uncover all incidents of wrongdoing and still not restore confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and in our planning system.  The public needs to know for certain that the right decisions are being taken.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to review the process of nominations to the board.  In my view, he may need to go further.  There is a fundamental question of governance when it comes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is not a regular State board; as Deputy &Oacute; Broin before me said, it is a planning authority.  On regular State boards, some positions are filled by ministerial appointments.  Regular State boards, however, set strategy; they do not make operational decisions.  In An Bord Plean&aacute;la's case the politically appointed board members are, under the legislation, the decision-makers on individual cases.  Operational independence does not exist.  In other words, a small few politically appointed persons are the gatekeepers to major development projects that have impacts and consequences.</p> <p> I can think of a number of decisions upheld by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent years in my home city of Limerick that have raised eyebrows.  We have seen a 13-storey office block in the first and oldest Georgian block in the city.  I do not think that would have been permitted if it were proposed for Merrion Square, despite the similar characteristics of the settings of both.  We have seen the demolition of historically significant buildings such as Daniel O'Connell's regular residence when he practised in the Limerick courts on numerous occasions.  We have seen the demolition of Curragower House, a late-18th-century gem, which was a mainstay of the riverfront in Limerick for more than two centuries.  It is lost forever and is now a gaping hole on the vista of Clancy Strand.  We have seen An Bord Plean&aacute;la permit a road bridge over the Park Canal, through a special area of conservation, with seemingly minimal justification.  Thankfully, it is not constructed yet, and I hope it never will be.</p> <p> In another part of the country is the Galway ring road, which, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will know very well, and which is totally at odds with the principles of sustainable development and proper planning.</p> <p> I disagreed with all these decisions but I accepted the outcomes.  Now, however, following these allegations, I have little confidence that the decisions were made objectively and correctly.</p> <p> We need An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We depend on it to create a better country and, in the context of the existential crisis we face, we need An Bord Plean&aacute;la to enable and to facilitate a huge development of our renewable energy industry in the coming years.  We need it to develop towns and cities that are livable and less car-dependent.  We need to do everything we possibly can to restore confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I welcome the Minister's commitments to do so.</p></speech>

It provides an appeals process for planning issues following the principles of natural justice.  It is clear, following the recent revelations, that the public have lost confidence in the board.  Councils up and down the country are talking about the board, and some councils have passed votes of no confidence in it.  The Government must act swiftly to restore public confidence in this important body.  It should be properly resourced, transparent and accountable and should follow the highest standards of governance.</p><p>The board must be allocated additional staff resources to ensure the planning system can deal with climate-related planning applications such as renewable energy projects.  The previous speaker mentioned that also.</p><p>It is clear the board is under pressure and is taking too long to make decisions.  There are statutory timelines under which local authorities must reach decisions on planning.  We need the same for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We need to see a quicker decision time on key infrastructure such as housing, while ensuring there is adequate public consultation.</p><p>The Government must establish a stand-alone planning and environmental court to ensure that judicial reviews are heard in a timely manner by judges and court staff who specialise in this area of law.  The Government must ensure that our obligations under the Aarhus Convention are followed and that there are no further restrictions on access to the planning system or to the courts.  There must be reform in how members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la are appointed.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in favour a hybrid model which mixes nominations from professional bodies with an open competitive recruitment process.  We need to see repeal of the mandatory ministerial guidelines introduced by Eoghan Murphy and to restore democratic decision-making to the county development plan process.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, must take immediate action to restore public confidence in the work of the board.  All reports must be published and there must be a significant change in membership of the board to ensure a fresh start.</p></speech>

I am sharing time with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.</p><p>I normally begin my contributions by welcoming the opportunity to speak on the topic in question.  I must say, however, that on this occasion I am pretty dissatisfied with the behaviour of the Government in scheduling this debate.  The Government has allocated three and a half hours today for Deputies to make statements on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The reason for my displeasure with this is that earlier this year, in July, the same Government allocated just two and a half hours to debate almost 50 pages of new planning legislation.  In July we had all the legislation rammed through, with little time for debate or scrutiny, and many of the Deputies who spoke during that debate on 7 July expressed similar concerns.  They described the Bill as a very technical one which needed more time to be examined.  Regardless of the contents of the Bill, it is fundamentally very poor governing practice to rush things without debate or adequate time for oversight.  That is how these mistakes are being made.  It is how loopholes are found and how the errors occur, and that in turn is how legal challenges succeed.  We are here as legislators.  The fundamental purpose of our being here is to design, to debate and to enact good legislation.  Ramming through Bills is becoming too much the norm, and the Government appears to be using the summer recess tactically to avoid scrutiny of or debate on certain types of legislation.  It happened in 2021 and it happened again in 2022.</p><p>There are so many problems in our planning system that one would think that scrutiny of even more planning legislation would be high on the agenda to try to tidy up some of the mess the planning system is in.  The housing crisis, for example, is being exacerbated by planning legislation.  Developers have in some cases in the past few years had their developments scuppered by planning regulations that made certain developments in certain areas unfeasible.  The planning regulator's insistence on high densities for developments in rural areas is one such example.  No one would deny that is appropriate for city environments, where the transport infrastructure to accommodate high-density settings is available, but it is not appropriate in rural or regional Ireland, where no such infrastructure exists.  In a number of An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspector's reports the inspector has relied on the proposition that ministerial guidelines impose a minimum density of 35 dwellings per hectare in respect of edge-of-town greenfield sites where no such minimum exists.  This has been described in those reports as higher planning policy that usurps the statutory standing of the local county development plan.  The current regulator continues to act <i>ultra vires</i>in writing to the county councils to insert as mandatory such non-existent minimum densities.</p><p>It has been decided in the courts enough times now that the current regulator is simply wrong on some of the most basic elements of the law.</p> <p>The advice he has given to the Minister and the Department has also been wrong.  This should by now raise alarms bells.  I expected action to be taken after the Department's most recent loss against Cork County Council for the second time, which was a complete waste of taxpayers' money.  The fact this particular regulator is investigating his former colleagues in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, some of whom he may have appointed or advised on their appointments, is a perfect display that all of the millions spent on tribunals and inquiries have taught us nothing.</p></speech>

That is what I am outlining.  It is not appropriate.  The fact we have this investigation ongoing is not appropriate.</p>  <p>  I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to take our exchange into account if I take longer to explain what I am trying to say.  The Minister of State is well aware that we could have a situation arise again as to the transparency of that investigation.  We heard what Deputy Paul Murphy said in the context of all the people he named.  There were 20 at least and there did not appear to be an issue, but when we mention someone who was a colleague of these people, it may give rise to an issue.  It certainly does not instil the trust and confidence of the planning system, of which I believe the Minister of State is quite aware.</p>  <p>  The premise of the regulator, and this is a fact, is that viability is not a planning consideration.  The Government's planning policy leaves developers with two choices: to build to meet the conditions set down by the regulator or not build at all.  This means developers have not been building, which has mainly contributed to the lack of housing supply along with the failure of the Minister and the Department to recognise the problem.  The planning system is a mess.  The system of objections, appeals, and judicial reviews needs to be streamlined so as not to benefit serial objectors or deprive citizens of their say while ensuring the Government operates within the law and delivers the much-needed housing required.  If this is not addressed, our housing supply will not recover to the levels required to solve the problems that exist.</p>  <p>  There are thousands of people now homeless.  There are no places for students to live while going to college.  Yesterday, PhD students said they are sleeping in tents on the grounds of Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.  Neither are there houses for the immigrant workforce we need to take up the jobs we cannot fill with the local workforce.  All of this can be traced back to the planning policy of this Government and those before it.</p>  <p>  The most recent controversy surrounding An Bord Plean&aacute;la has damaged trust in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the entire system.  The deputy chair resigned in August, and due to the ongoing investigation into the possible conflicts of interest that went undeclared, I shall refrain from commenting further on the specifics at this time.  Regardless of the outcome, this should be the catalyst for reflection on the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the state of the planning system as a whole.  I hope we do not have to continue spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money on judicial reviews because the Department was sitting on its hands and ignoring the basics of the problem.</p></speech>

Builders bulldozed the home of the O'Rahilly in September 2020 to prepare the site for a 12-storey apartment and hotel development.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach at the time in this Chamber because of the historic importance of the building.  The Taoiseach agreed that it was absolutely wrong that a building, a site of this value in terms of our heritage, a national monument, was floored in such a manner by a developer.</p><p>The O'Rahilly house was central to the formation of the State, Cumann na mBan, the Gaelic revival, the revolutionary war, and all that went on with that.  Three future Presidents of the State attended meetings at the house, as did each of the signatories of the Proclamation.  Yet, in an act of cultural vandalism, the developers just tore it down.  The O'Rahilly's grandson, Proinsias &Oacute; Rathaille, to whom I spoke, is campaigning for accountability and for the house to be constructed.  However, as of yet, nobody has been held to account for what happened.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted consent to the demolition of this national monument and listed building.  Three of the board members, including the then deputy chair, Mr. Paul Hyde, and Ms Michelle Fagan, who were party to that decision have been named as having failed to declare a conflict of interest in a number of other planning decisions.  It is an incredible issue that a country, a republic such as ours, with the heritage we have, simply floors such buildings and deletes the opportunity of future generations to access, touch and be in the locations where the founders of the State were.</p><p>Another issue relates to a site not too far from here, namely, the Moore Street battlefield site.  I refer to the Hammerson planning application which seeks to destroy not in its totality but elements of the Moore Street battlefield site.  It would radically change the nature of that location.  This is the birthplace of the Republic.  It is a location that was central to the 1916 battles around the GPO.  The planners ignored the views of elected members to have buildings Nos. 10 to 25 Moore Street listed.  The planners have shown complete disrespect for our heritage and the cultural significance of that street.  There has been an ongoing battle since then in respect of that street.  It was a battlefield upon which freedom and independence of this country was fought, and now there seems to be a battle between the defenders of that heritage and large property developers.</p><p>We know there was a framework between Dublin City Council, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Dublin Central GP Limited, of the Hammerson Group, to compensate traders for the impacts of the development on that site.  We also know that officials from the Department responsible for heritage, Dublin City Council, the Moore Street advisory group, and Hammerson Group met with representatives of the traders on the Moore Street site.  Serious allegations were made in <i>Village</i>that offers of compensation were made to traders at these meetings on condition they would support Hammerson's planning applications.</p><p>All I am asking is that the Department and the Garda investigate what happened to the house of O'Rahilly and the Moore Street battlefield site.  Aont&uacute; demands that the Government and the Garda investigate this.</p></speech>

Long before anyone made any allegation of impropriety, I had been complaining about the total inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the board.  I believe that one of the first signs of a problem is when organisations become totally incompetent at doing what they are meant to be doing, there is a pile-up of material and nobody ever seems to be able to get a clear answer to anything.</p> <p>One of the problems is, of course, that we do all of the investigations <i>post factum</i>.  I hope that this time we will get it right and make sure there is a good, open and transparent system.<br/><br/>For years An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been an organisation that has let down ordinary people time and again.  There is a statutory objective whereby it is meant to make decisions within four months.  I was looking at a list of queries in which people were not making representations on decisions but asking when those decisions would be made.  This is a legitimate question.  When an application is made it pops up on the website that there will be a decision four months from the date it is submitted.  I know of a case in Moycullen that was lodged on 12 March 2021.  I do not care what the decision is as long as it is the right decision.  We are now in the ninth month of 2022, a year and a half later, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot make up its mind.  I know of another case lodged on 13 August 2021 in which no decision has been made.<br/><br/>The next case I will mention is fascinating.  It involves seeking leave to apply for substitute consent.  The request is for leave to apply for substitute consent and not substitute consent itself.  It was lodged on 5 October 2021.  In other words, it is almost a year later and there is still a wait to get a decision on whether an application can be made for substitute consent.  It is a type of planning permission where there are issues regarding environmental impact statements and non-compliance.  In this case the person making the application had no connection to the people who were not in compliance with the quarry law.<br/><br/>I want to highlight this next case because it seems extraordinary that it was lodged on 31 December 2021 and there is still no decision.  The application is with regard to previously granted permission to renovate and extend a derelict building in the countryside.  It is a one-off derelict building.  Surely it does not take nine months to decide whether someone can renovate and extend an existing house.  The next case was lodged on 21 January and involves the demolition of a cottage and construction of a house.  It is eight months since it was lodged.  We would think it would not be that complex.<br/><br/>The next case I will mention is the worst case I am aware of, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would agree with me on this.  Galway City Council bought a house in Kiltullagh.  Mysteriously, one night the house got burned down.  Galway City Council applied to demolish and rebuild the house for the family to whom it had been allocated.  I grant that there were any amount of objections but I have to say it seems that those objections were more about who was getting the house.  The family are people of impeccable character but they belong to a minority community.  They are waiting for a house and are living in a caravan.  The application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la was made in April.  More than four months have passed.  We would have thought that if somebody's house burned down and we wanted to rebuild it for them to live in it that it would be a very simple planning decision.  When I add up all of these cases and other cases I find totally ineffective decision making.<br/><br/>I do not know whether any Member has seen the film &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;.  When the titular character was coming out of the court one day somebody tried to bribe him, telling him about their daughter's case in a certain court.  He gave a very quick answer in two parts.  He said he would make the same decision he would make in the case of his own daughter and that it would be a fair decision and a quick decision.  The second part of this is part of justice; justice delayed is justice denied.  It is symptomatic of an organisation being totally incompetent that it cannot make decisions in good time even on the simplest of matters.  When we have a chaotic organisation chaotic things happen.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs reform from top to bottom.  We do not need another agency.  Replacing an agency because it does not perform is codology.  The concept of an appeals board that is independent, fair and effective is perfectly reasonable but it should be fair and effective.<br/><br/>When looking at organisations we get in all types of experts but one thing we never seem to do is get in a process auditor.  Those working in industry focus every day on making sure nothing has to be done twice, getting rid of all the logjams and delays, making sure that something is moved only once and not twice and that people do not tie themselves up in knots answering as to why something has not been done.  Can we imagine all of the calls An Bord Plean&aacute;la is getting?  I mentioned only a few cases.  Imagine the waste of labour.  Imagine the work that staff could be doing if it were done properly.  There is waste in these organisations.  I could say the same about visa applications.<br/><br/>Queues take staff, time, money and resources.  We should eliminate the queues and do things in the time indicated.  If we did this we would not need quite as many staff because people would not be endlessly answering queries as to when a decision would be made.  It is vital that an organisation that does not deliver on time all of the time has a process auditor.  Perhaps if this had happened in An Bord Plean&aacute;la four, five, six, eight or ten years ago, when it started slipping behind its statutory targets, some of the issues, which I do not want to comment on because they could wind up before the courts, would have come to light.  This might have happened if somebody had gone in and looked through the processes to see whether they were good and efficient and delivered to the citizens of the country fair, good and timely decisions.<br/><br/>I have to say the idea of allowing two people on their own to make major planning decisions seems a recipe for disaster.  Most people would have thought the big decisions were not made in such a way.  A one-off house is one thing.  We do not seem to have any graduated decision-making.  We seem to treat the replacement of a house that was burned down, where a family just wants to go back and live in it, the same as a very big office block, apartment block or housing development.  We do not seem to have any proportionality in the system regarding the checks and balances in larger decisions that affect many people and are more likely to be contentious.</p> <p>We need to follow the issues that have been raised right to the very end.  I am glad it has been referred to various agencies.  They should be allowed to do their business through the processes the State has set up to deal with anybody who might or might not have acted in a wrong way.</p> <p> We need to reform the board.  We need to reform its decision-making.  We need to make sure that it is fair and open and that the systems are good.  The other thing we need to do, because justice delayed is justice denied, is to make sure that decisions are made in good time and that files are not lying round waiting to be dealt with interminably, while people have to put their lives on hold.  I hope that out of this morass of a mess we, at last, have brought the An Bord Plean&aacute;la issue to a head and that we will get a much more effective and transparent system out of the changes that will now be brought in.</p></speech>

These go right to the heart of our planning system.  It is the biggest crisis in our planning system since the Mahon tribunal.  It is important to remember the words of Mr. Justice Alan Mahon who said that the presence of conflicts of interest do not necessarily equate to corruption but it creates the conditions under which corruption can flourish.  It is clear from what has been reported that the conflicts of interest were rife in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There has been a litany of allegations of poor processes, procedures and practice, thanks to the work of the investigative site <i>The Ditch</i>, which produced no less than 29 detailed reports on various cases of malpractice and, in some instances, cases of even of greater concern.  As a result of <i>The Ditch</i>, these things have become clear and have come into the public realm.</p><p>We know that it is not reducible to a single individual or instance.  However, the reality of this is that the board's code of conduct is perfectly clear in that those board members are forbidden from voting on decisions in their own neighbourhood and must recuse themselves to ensure conflicts of interest do not arise and, yet, we have a clear pattern of this being breached time and again.  </p><p>How is it that we become reliant on an online news site to make these things clear for us?  Decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la are not irrelevant.  These are decisions which literally impact on communities.  How can we expect communities throughout this State, whose neighbourhoods often rely on the decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to have in those decisions and in their being made in the best interest of the entire community?  How can it be that, years after the Mahon tribunal, questions are still raised on the planning process in this State?</p><p>How can people have faith in the system?  I have only been a Deputy for approximately two and a half years and, time and again, we see issues with ethics.  We see clear breaches of ethics.  How can people have faith in the system?  How can they believe that the system is actually working for them when all they see are cosy relationships, friendships and breaches of ethics?  That is completely and utterly wrong.</p></speech>

I think that if a similar motion was put to this House and there was a free vote, a motion of no confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la would also be passed here.  A Minister, one of the Minister of State's colleagues, recently stated that An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be disbanded and it is hard to disagree with that.  If it is not disbanded, as has been mentioned, that could cause other issues.  It needs to be disbanded or radically reformed from the current organisation it is now.</p>  <p>  This absolute scandal and abuse of the planning process by some board members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la has done considerable damage to the faith residents have in the planning process.  Confidence in the planning process has never been great but this abuse of power and recent resignations from the board has brought confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to an all-time low.  Communities do not believe they are getting a fair hearing.</p>  <p>  Most communities and individuals are already at a disadvantage in the planning process because they are not planning experts.  They do not have the resources or the wherewithal to tackle and take on these big development companies and planners.  Thus, when they see politically-connected individuals appointed to extremely well-paid jobs and then making decisions that benefit their friends and families, it is greatly upsetting.  It makes people angry and undermines democracy and confidence in the planning process, because the list of board members looking after families, friends and neighbours seems to be endless.  How could they have-----</p></speech>

How could they have faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  In 2016, a performance review was carried out and made some recommendations.  Needless to say, these recommendations were not acted upon.  That is another reason the public has no confidence in the board and another reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs to be either dissolved or radically changed and a new functioning structure created to replace what is a discredited institution.</p>  <p>  Salaries of the board members have been mentioned.  They are far beyond what is required.  There are salaries of &euro;240,000 for the chair, &euro;144,000 for the deputy chair and &euro;127,000 for ordinary board members.  They add up to nearly &euro;1 million per year for board members' salaries.  These rates cannot be justified given the jobs they are doing.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs to have a time limit set for it to make decisions.</p></speech>

It is interesting that yesterday, we had the debate on the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, report and today on this report on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The public has lost faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Villages, communities and ordinary people have no faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This has been going on for a long time, where people were making objections.  I am not someone who supports serial objectors and these were genuine objections.  There might have been quite a number of them.  A planning inspector would come down in good faith, do his or her thorough report, go back to the board and recommend that it be refused or the opposite and have the board say "No" or overturn the recommendation.</p>  <p>  It has just been outlined that it is costing &euro;1 million per year to run this board.  It is jobs for the boys.  It has never been better.  Normally, they are Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il boys - to make it even better.  I came from one of those great institutions, as it used to be, fad&oacute; fad&oacute;.  I mentioned Surf, Daz and other stuff and washing the dirty linen here in connection with this already.  There is a lot of it to be washed and there are many alleged irregularities in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Basically, an inspector goes down in good faith, does a report and the board rejects it.  It is two men, mainly.  I believe they are all men on the board.  I do not know but I may stand corrected on that.  They can decide the fate of a community or a development.  There is something badly wrong in the state of Denmark with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I also believe it must be disbanded.  It is so endemic.  The rot in it is so bad that belief and trust in the board is gone.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State can twist or shake his head but I fervently believe and ask that it should be a new, reconstructed board in which people have faith.  We should halve the salaries in this time of austerity.  Why do members need that kind of money to go on it?  What happened to the voluntary boards?  Are there any voluntary boards any more?  I used to be on a number of them when I was allowed to be on them.  We find that all the boards now are on big pay, money and everything else.  It is rotten.  It must be disbanded and people must have confidence in it going forward.</p></speech>

In helping people with planning permissions in areas such as one-off houses and businesses across the board, the biggest thing we must deal with to help people put a roof over their heads is An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have a serious concern that even with the planning process in place, people, no matter where they are in the country, can pay &euro;20 to object to an application, no matter how silly or important it is.</p> <p>Again, these people are serial objectors.  Why they cannot be filtered out at an early stage is beyond me.  For &euro;20 they can hold up a planning application from a young couple who are trying to build their lives or a businessperson who wants to invest in our areas.  People can object to anything down to the colour of a door for &euro;20 and it goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Once they start a sequence at planning stage it gives them the right to take it on to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That system must change.</p> <p> The criteria around the board's investigations must also change.  I heard recently from a man whose agricultural shed had been objected to.  Due to antisocial behaviour in the area he had to lock the agricultural shed.  The board would not tell him when the inspector was coming and when the inspector arrived the shed was locked.  Somebody spotted that the inspector was there and rang the applicant.  The applicant went as fast as he could and was five minutes away.  He got a note from the inspector saying that when he arrived to inspect the premises it was locked, even though the applicant had no prior notice.  The inspector went with the objector and said it was not an agricultural building but an industrial one.  It had to go back to the board again and be applied for again and be overturned because of a lock on a door.  The inspector never told the applicant when he was going to be there.</p> <p> Now we have investigations into the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la for corruption.  This is going back to the old boys' club again.  It is history repeating itself.  Rub my shoulder and I will rub yours.  That is going back to the old politics in this House and all the investigations that went on here for years.  It must stop now.  The Minister is here to respect and represent the people and bring An Bord Plean&aacute;la to account.</p></speech>

It clearly demonstrates the procedures and safeguards that were in place were not only to prevent but also to detect serious conflicts of interest from emerging and it shows us these were far from robust.  Thanks to the work of online reporting platform <i>The Ditch</i>, we are now in a position to be more informed about the nature of the crisis and the length of time such alleged conflicts of interest were being carried on.  I will say no more on that particular aspect but I hope these issues can be resolved fairly and swiftly.</p><p>We need to have trust in the fairness and impartiality of the planning process.  We also need a proper, functioning planning process, which we do not have.  I have first-hand experience of that with Banagher Chilling in my constituency.  It was a saga that went on for two years.  I was informed in January 2021 than an inspector's report was to be ready and made available within the next two weeks.  We did not get a decision until June 2022.  There are serious questions hanging over the delays with Banagher Chilling.  Why are these delays occurring?  There is also the fact it could have jeopardised investment.  If that is the carry-on of An Bord Plean&aacute;la I have no doubt it will jeopardise investment into this country.</p></speech>

Is it just another quango of politically-appointed cronies on excessive salaries acting unlawfully and costing the taxpayer millions in legal costs?  Why would the Minister allow An Bord Plean&aacute;la to carry out an internal review, which in other words means it is investigating itself?  How much did the senior counsel Remy Farrell probe into An Bord Plean&aacute;la's costs?  Cork City Council, Kerry County Council and South Dublin County Council have all passed motions of no confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent months.  Over the last six months, since early April, quite a number of other very serious issues have emerged, including the fact Mr. Hyde overturned the vast majority of the refusal recommendations of his own planning inspectors in approving applications for telecommunications masts over a two-year period.  <i>The Irish Times</i>has since reported that Catherine Pierse, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has advised the Minister that the report should not be published until the criminal investigation is complete and a decision has been made on prosecution.  The Minster should outline to the D&aacute;il whether or not this is the fact in the case.  This D&aacute;il debate into the different ongoing controversies that have shaken An Bord Plean&aacute;la is critical as these controversies have completely undermined public trust in our planning system.  The lack of public trust in Ireland's planning system is a very serious matter and it is now essential that the Minister with political responsibility for the system, namely, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, provides a clear and concise outline of how he is going to deal with all of the issues and equally, restore public confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  How can the Minister stand by and do nothing when An Bord Plean&aacute;la as an institution is riven with dysfunction?</p><p>As we know well, the planning process is a very difficult process for people.  It should have been more clear that something like this was going on in An Bord Plean&aacute;la for quite a period of time.  As previous speakers have said, it is like the old boys' club.  It is jobs for the boys.  Nod-and-wink situations were going on within the planning authority.  Consider the difficulty the young people are in.  They are spending thousands and thousands of euro to get planning permission.  They are putting in applications and then somebody can appeal that application, as Deputy O'Donoghue was saying, for just &euro;20.  That could destroy a young person's whole future.  Then you have got to deal with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is a law unto itself.  It has been aided and abetted by the political system instead of being questioned by it.  What we have is report after report costing millions and millions and nothing out of it, like we had in the report we had yesterday.  The whole process from start to finish must be looked at before we even get to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There are a lot of planning permissions and a lot of difficulties put before people that do not need to be put before them.  These are young people trying to get a start in life.  I have it down in west Cork all the time.  We are constantly dealing with trying to get planning across the line for young people and it is very unfortunate.  People are going to banks and trying to get loans and then they look at this codology going on with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  What does the Minister think they feel out there?  I think many people feel a lot of disgust.  It is something the Government has let slip by and it cannot continue to do that.</p></speech>

It is something both Government and Opposition Members called for before the recess and I am glad we are making the time to have this debate.</p>  <p>  I welcome that the report outlining the practices of An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been referred to the DPP, the Garda and to the Standards in Public Office Commission for them to make their judgments on.  The report should be made public as soon as possible without impinging on any legal investigation.  Transparency in the work of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is of the utmost importance.  Transparency is meant to be at the heart of our planning system and it is simply a matter of public interest.  It is important the information contained in the report be in the public domain sooner rather than later.  Myself and my colleagues on the housing committee will want to discuss this report in public session as soon it is possible to do so.</p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la plays a crucial role in our planning system and any allegations of inappropriate actions or behaviour by its members must be treated with the utmost seriousness.  Our planning system is nothing without impartiality and integrity.  Housing supply is currently the biggest challenge we face and as we implement the measures contained in Housing for All and move to address our housing crisis, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must be to the forefront of facilitating sustainable, appropriate development.  We must aid the momentum needed to build more homes so we can ensure more families and young people can aspire to have a place to call their own.  Housing for All sets ambitious targets for housing development in Ireland as well as vital infrastructure under the national development plan and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has an important role to play.</p>  <p>  I do not doubt for a moment that the staff of An Bord Plean&aacute;la work extremely hard under challenging conditions and in a system that can never operate fast enough, such is the demand we place on our planning decisions.  It is important to stress any outcomes of the report into handling conflicts of interest or the ongoing investigations should not colour the view of the majority of the very hardworking, diligent people working in the offices of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I welcome that the Minister has sanctioned a further 24 posts for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to assist with the growing demand in this sector.  Extra boots on the ground are absolutely needed and these staff will help fulfil the functions An Bord Plean&aacute;la will take on as part of the new marine planning arrangements.</p> <p>I was happy to support the Maritime Area Planning Bill both at committee and when it was before the D&aacute;il earlier this year.  Now more than ever, we need a planning system that supports us to harness our natural resources into energy.  That is absolutely crucial.  This Bill will help us achieve our renewable energy targets for 2030 and bring in a much-needed planning regime for offshore wind.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is going to be crucial to the effective running of that planning regime and so many other planning decisions.  That is another reason addressing the concerns around conflicts of interest within the organisation is now urgently needed.</p> <p> The current appointments process is also due to be overhauled and that is going to be a really positive development.  I understand the Minister is in the process of bringing a plan to Cabinet to outline a new appointments process for members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la underpinned by new legislation.  That is possibly one of the most important steps we can take as legislators when it comes to this.  I also welcome that the two-person decision-making panels are a thing of the past.  That is going to bring a new level of clarity to the planning process.  While we strive to put transparency and trust to the forefront of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's process, it is important that we do not add further delay to decision-making turnaround times.  As we all know, getting a decision on a planning application can be a really lengthy process.  I would hate to see the process becoming even more drawn out at a time when the delivery of houses is so crucial.  We need a system that is transparent, trustworthy, reliable and efficient, a planning system that is fit for purpose and that does not create unwarranted delays when timely action on housing is so badly needed.  As I said, I welcome that this report on An Bord Plean&aacute;la is now with the DPP, the Garda and the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  I have confidence they will take all the necessary steps when carrying out their work.  I call again on the Minister to ensure that this report is made public as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Thankfully, new procedures, obligations and processes were put in place, many overseen by the likes of SIPO.  I know that is up for review based on recent events, notwithstanding many other events also.  The D&aacute;il will take up that challenge in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  Planning is supposedly consistent with national and regional guidelines and associated with relevant construction standards, best engineering practices, environmental considerations, health and safety and other such considerations.  All that is carried out by local authorities under a statutory time period.  If and when those decisions are subsequently challenged, as is the democratic right of an appellant, the onus of responsibility to ensure professional competence falls to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It appears from this report that there are breaches in rules and regulations which guide the decision-making process.  If that is the case or is proven to be the case, we have a big problem.  That is notwithstanding the point made previously which I have made myself in this Chamber when I brought forward proposed legislation and Bills to deal with ensuring An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a statutory time period to make a decision.  That should of course be the case and I look forward to the planning and development legislation, referred to by the previous speaker, that the Government will bring forward for reform in the coming months.  I am sure it will have recommendations in that regard.</p>  <p>  At the time of those tribunals, the probity and competence of planning and the public's trust in it were at crisis point.  That would appear to be the case again, at a time of crisis in the housing sector when we need those systems to stand tall without fear or favour.  Applications have been delayed by deliberations by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and thereafter by a judicial review process which further jeopardises the potential investment that may be forthcoming in order ensure these developments take place.  This is a crisis at a time of emergency in respect of housing.  I urge and beg the Government to insist on bringing forward real, meaningful changes that help ensure the democratic planning process is one we can all stand over.  It is quite obvious that many in this Chamber do not stand over this process at present.  That is a far cry from the commitments we got following those tribunals.  We do not want to enter that period again or a similar one.  I beg the Government not only to entrust the Attorney General to bring forward his proposals, but to direct the Attorney General and prescribe the sort of changes that are necessary to address these issues and others that have been raised by many Members over the course of the last years.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  It is an extraordinary week.  Yesterday we had the report on Siteserv discussed here and we saw what went on between the two angels, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and Mr. O'Brien.  In between we had the villains and we heard how they were just allowed to do exactly what they wanted.  Here we are looking at An Bord Plean&aacute;la a week after the first judge in charge of the planning tribunal was buried.  Let us remember what he said on planning in the final report of the Mahon tribunal, The Final Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments:</p> <blockquote> 	Given the existence of such rampant public corruption, the obvious question is why it was allowed to continue unabated. The short answer to that question is that it continued because nobody was prepared to do enough to stop it.  This is perhaps inevitable when corruption ceases to become an isolated event and becomes so entrenched that it is transformed into an acknowledged way of doing business. </blockquote>  <p>I could quote more but I will not.  I have only four minutes.  We had the Moriarty tribunal.  We had the Office of the Planning Regulator directly arising from that.  Then this week we have seen Siteserv and now we are looking at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will make no comments to prejudice any inquiry.  The most serious questions have to be asked here by a Government that allowed a process to continue without analysis, without the institution being able to analyse itself and come back.</p><p>Suddenly we have an announcement of 24 staff, I think.  It begs the question as to how the board was supposed to function.  I am going to ignore the allegations for the moment and leave them to one side and look at processes and procedures.  How was it supposed to function if suddenly we can give 24 staff?  How was it functioning in terms of conflicts of interest if there was nobody monitoring that?  Did we look at what SIPO has told us over and over again, that each Government has ignored?  In its 2009 annual report, SIPO recommended the Department of Finance should draft new legislation to be based on best practice for dealing with conflicts of interest.  Fast forward every single year.  In 2021 the annual report stated that for a number of years, SIPO has called for a comprehensive review of the existing ethics framework, and so on.  It was absolutely ignored.  Finally the programme for Government 2021 began something but the review has not been seen to date.</p><p>Then we have a myth of judicial reviews being the cause of everything, and nobody bothers to read anything.  If they read the Planning Regulator's report, he tells us that judicial reviews are a minute part of the problem.  Yet we have the myth being perpetuated by many Deputies on all sides that we are in trouble because of judicial reviews.  On many occasions judicial review was the only option taken most reluctantly by people on the ground.  They have done us a favour in an awful lot of places.</p><p>On strategic housing development, which we have abandoned now, thanks be to God, but not really because we have given a number of years to phase it out, I will quote what the chief planner in Galway said.</p> <p>She highlighted the strain put on the department of planning in Galway, stating that the statistical success of the strategic housing development process is benchmarked against An Bord Plean&aacute;la's ability to meet its deadlines, but it hides all the pressure and time required at local level.  She said it was a flawed attempt to deliver social housing.  We brought this problem upon ourselves, government after government, particularly with strategic housing developments that bypass the local authority.</p> <p> I will stop there as I think I am out of time.</p></speech>

The strategic housing development was just the final straw in undermining local authorities, depleting them of staff and allowing staff to be moved all of the time.  When they have acquired skill, suddenly they are moved.  We removed the Waste Management Act.  They have no power at all in relation to waste management.  We have left the local authorities bereft of power and resources.  We have managers in place who have corporatised according to Government policy, as opposed to having people who serve the communities.</p></speech>

I believe the Government will table legislation in the next few months, and I hope it will be made more workable for rural families.</p>  <p>  The first thing I wish to talk about is An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Why is it that nearly all An Bord Plean&aacute;la employees are from or live in Dublin?  If I live in Dublin, I know how Dublin works.  However, I damn sure do not know how Wexford, Galway or Donegal works out in the middle of the countryside.  Why is it that no one was let work?  Some 15 years ago there was supposed to be decentralisation in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Nobody was given decentralisation and nobody from other areas could work from home or do anything like that.  Everyone had to work from the office in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If people drive the M50 every day, they know there a problem with the traffic there.  If they look at a house around Dublin, they know there is a problem somewhere there.  However, I am damn sure they do not know what the problems are in Connemara, Donegal, Kerry or wherever.  Their ideas and what they believe people need are completely different from what people actually need in certain areas.  There is a major problem there to be addressed and it is not being addressed.</p>  <p>  I would disband An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to be quite frank about it.  There was a time when politicians were being called everything and anything anytime they would go about planning.  However, it has gone the other way.  No one knows anything about what is going on anywhere.  There are only refusals for Mickey Mouse things.  There is no engagement or working with applicants.  For a long time - the past two years - you could not even get a pre-planning meeting in most councils because Covid or another excuse was used.  That is a major problem.</p>  <p>  Were there people from the private sector who were not direct employees but were getting work within An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Is there an internal file or document?  Has the Minister of State seen that work was given to people who were not directly employed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that the Department did not even know about?  Is there an internal document done on that that no one has commented on so far?</p>  <p>  There is a young couple in Moylough, for example, who went through Galway County Council and got their planning permission and it was appealed.  To be honest about it, you would be scratching your head to find a fault, because it is within the village, had sewerage and everything.  For a full year this young couple was trying to build a house in a housing crisis.  They are only one example of many throughout this country.  They got a letter from An Bord Plean&aacute;la stating the issue would hopefully be addressed by March.  They then got another letter in June stating it would hope to have it done in the following few months.  Finally, they got a letter stating it would try to get it done sometime.  That is no good and it is not the An Bord Plean&aacute;la that should be.</p>  <p>  I think the Minister of State needs to just rip it apart.  It needs a root-and-branch overhaul from beginning to end.  The problem that is happening in this country is no more than what is happening with the HSE.  A long time ago, politicians were involved in the western, southern and every health board.  People would say those fellows and women were destroying it.  However, have a look at the way it has gone since.  The HSE is like Nanci Griffith&rsquo;s &ldquo;From a Distance&rdquo;.  We write to a Minister and the Minister replies saying, &ldquo;Thanks for your letter.  We will send it off to the HSE.&rdquo;  Whatever it sends back to us is along the lines of &ldquo;Look, tough luck.  Take it up.  Suck it up.  That is it.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Either we are elected to do things or not.  Unless we revamp the legislation on planning or the way planning is done, we are crippling young people throughout this country.  We are actually inflicting more problems on top of the cities such as Dublin and other large cities where youngsters might be able to build at home, near their farms or whatever and they are going through hell on earth for all different types of reasons.  For example, if you had a house in Wexford, you could not build in Roscommon.  That was the rule up until recently.  Such a rule I never heard of in my life.  However, in the next council, it did not matter if you had one down there.  Consistency is not there.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to address this, if it is the last thing he does over the next two years.  Planning has to be sorted out and, by God, An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs sorting out.</p></speech>

The immediate actions that have been taken in response the recent allegations, along with those being undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator and the board itself, are necessary steps to ensure restoration of the high level of public and institutional confidence the board has built up over its lifetime.</p>  <p>  I recognise the vital public interest in the report from Mr. Remy Farrell, senior counsel, into the management of conflicts of interest and relevant disclosures by the deputy chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to certain decisions of that board, and that the public must have trust in the impartiality and integrity of our planning system if it is to function effectively.  I am confident the review being undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator into An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s system - I should point out that Mr. Conleth Bradley is an external worker in relation to this audit - and all the procedures will be significant in progressing the Board forward in terms of accountability, systems procedures and effectiveness.  It is the intention of the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, and my intention that the outcome of this review will help inform other internal changes as required in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and will assist in identifying legislative amendments that may be required.</p>  <p>  The reform of the appointment process for board members to the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is critical to ensure impartiality and transparency in the board and will restore confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the independent planning body that is foundational to the success of the planning system in Ireland.  In addition, we are acutely aware of the need to ensure the board has the skills and resources to carry out these functions.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, indicated earlier that he intends to approve further substantial increase in staffing resources for An Bord Plean&aacute;la shortly, building on additional resources agreed in 2021, to ensure it is fully equipped to meet the demands of our planning system, including new functions it will take on as part of new marine planning arrangements.</p>  <p>  With my own particular responsibility in the area of marine planning, I am acutely aware of the importance of the board having the skills and resources to deliver on this new function, but also of this role as a new modern marine planning regime.  We are working hard to prepare the way forward for this new consenting regime, with an establishment team in place for the new maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, with the roles of chairperson and a number of board members advertised this week.  With coastal local authorities, MARA and the board will play a fundamental role in this new area of planning, which has assumed an even greater priority in light of the energy crisis and the potential of the offshore renewable energy sector.  This will build on and expand the skills within the board and, like the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, I commend the staff of the board who work on many key cases in challenging circumstances.</p> <p>They continue to deal with a caseload of in excess of 3,000 cases annually and there is no doubt that, over time, the complexity of these cases has increased significantly.  Making sure that the board is working as effectively as possible against this background is critical.  Resourcing, learning and development and digitalisation all have a significant role to play, as do the measures that will continue to evolve in the coming months, both specifically in respect of the board, but also the major exercise under way as part of the planning review to streamline and clarify planning legislation.</p> <p> I have been privileged to engage in a number of meetings with stakeholders as part of the planning advisory forum and have been struck by the commitment of stakeholders from many different perspectives to come to common views on the approach and a way forward in planning that increases the plan-led approach and improves public engagement and transparency.  I am confident that this will set a new context for the board to operate and will ensure that the planning system works more effectively for all.  My officials have engaged on several occasions with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in constructive debates on all aspects of the planning system, from plan-making through consenting and enforcement.  We look forward to continued engagement with the Oireachtas as part of the wider programme of planning reform.  </p> <p> As part of this process, maintaining trust and confidence in the planning system is of the utmost importance.  The Government has sought to act openly, quickly and effectively in responding to the immediate problems, addressing underlying issues and maintaining a fully functioning planning system.  The series of measures outlined by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, which will evolve, will ensure fundamental change for the benefit of the entire planning system while maintaining its full and ongoing operation.</p></speech>

that SSE Airtricity has announced that it will increase prices for its customers on the 1st October, with electricity bills rising by over 35 per cent and gas bills increasing by 39 per cent;<br /><br />&mdash; that in the space of 12 months there has been a more than &euro;1,000 increase in both gas and electricity bills;<br /><br />&mdash; that poorer households and families are hardest hit by electricity price increases as they account for a larger share of household expenditure;<br /><br />&mdash; that a big part of these increases is due to wholesale gas price rises;<br /><br />&mdash; the failure by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications to publish an assessment on the use of the old Kinsale Head gas field for the storage of natural gas despite assurances having been provided to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann over the past 18 months; <br /><br />&mdash; that Ireland is the only European Union country without any natural gas storage capacity;<br /><br />&mdash; that despite the Government and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) being aware since last April that the Public Service Obligation levy charged to electricity bills was unnecessary it has continued to charge every electricity customer an extra &euro;26; and<br /><br />&mdash; that the passage of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022 last July will impose a &euro;40 per annum charge for three years to provide emergency backup of 650 megawatts of electricity; acknowledges that:   	&mdash; the cheapest barrel of oil is the one not burned, and energy conservation must be given the utmost priority by the Government and society;<br /><br />&mdash; the Corrib gas field only meets 30 per cent of our natural gas demand; in 2006 the Southwest Kinsale gas field was converted to an offshore storage facility, with a storage capacity of 230 million cubic meters, with the last of the storage gas withdrawn from the reservoir in March 2017;<br /><br />&mdash; the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) has an inbuilt refund to the State where renewable wind turbines or solar farms make excessive profits, however, such a clawback was not incorporated into the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes which support the vast majority of renewable electricity on our grid today; and<br /><br />&mdash; the national grid has come under increasing pressure since the start of this decade, with a spike in the number of amber alerts which has gone from just 13 in the last decade to 17 already this decade; calls on the Government to:  	&mdash; accept the need to implement radical ideas outside the normal political playbook and declare the current energy crisis as a national emergency;<br /><br />&mdash; draft and enact legislation to address the current supply deficit with an Energy Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act with a sunset clause after 36 months to: <blockquote> 	&mdash; ban any threat to turn off the electricity supply to domestic customers and critical social infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes;<br /><br />&mdash; reopen the 250 megawatts Midlands power plants in Lanesboro and Shannonbridge to burn biomass; <br /><br />&mdash; suspend the licensing regime for the thinning and felling of forestry to facilitate the use of brash to fuel the Midlands power plants with biomass;<br /><br />&mdash; direct data centres and other high demand electricity consumers to use their emergency backup generators when there is a shortage of supply;<br /><br />&mdash; temporarily re-power Derrybrien wind farm and ringfence all profits for a local community and environmental benefit fund;<br /><br />&mdash; set a national cap on the unit price of electricity, with the State raising a long-term loan to pay for verifiable surplus costs to power generators which would be repaid through electricity bills over a 15-year period;<br /><br />&mdash; clawback excessive profits by energy companies, particularly in relation to renewable electricity generated under the old REFIT scheme, to help fund the cost of a unit price cap for electricity; and<br /><br />&mdash; exempt planning for rooftop flush mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on domestic, agricultural and commercial buildings; </blockquote>&mdash; establish an energy support scheme for businesses, as some businesses are experiencing a 200-300 per cent increase in utility costs forcing them to decide between staff layoffs or closure;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately commence an independent external review of all CRU and EirGrid actions which lead to increases in standing charges, to eliminate unnecessary spend and ban any increases in standing charges for all electricity customers;<br /><br />&mdash; place a moratorium on the construction of additional data centres which do not have their own power source until such time as there is necessary capacity on the electricity system;<br /><br />&mdash; conduct research on a one-off windfall tax for energy companies who have made supernormal profits because of soaring energy prices;<br /><br />&mdash; allow for extra flexibility in the procurement of new electricity sources outside the RESS;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately decouple the link between gas prices and electricity prices, which are inflating electricity prices, whether generated by natural gas or not;<br /><br />&mdash; acquire through Gas Networks Ireland a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal located in either Cork Harbour or the Shannon Estuary and ban the sourcing of fracked gas;<br /><br />&mdash; prioritise investment in retrofitting fuel-poor households as a matter of urgency to clear the 2.5-year backlog in addition to an increase in the Fuel Allowance and an extension in the number of weeks it is payable each year, from 28 to 32 weeks per year;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately approve applications received under the National Retrofitting Scheme, which are presently delayed by up to six months, if the homeowner has been fortunate enough to secure an assessment;<br /><br />&mdash; address the cost of financing works under the National Retrofitting Scheme by introducing zero per cent long-term loans for retrofitting homes, whereby repayments are paid back through utility companies based on energy savings, including electricity micro-generation;<br /><br />&mdash; expedite the rollout of the National Broadband Plan and the Government's National Remote Work Strategy, thus reducing the need to travel to work;<br /><br />&mdash; increase renewable energy under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme (BOS) to 10 per cent in petrol and 12 per cent in diesel, effectively doubling the usage of biofuels in Irish transport as committed to in the Climate Action Plan; and<br /><br />&mdash; encourage the use of hydrotreated vegetable oils in the transport sector following the model as outlined in the Swedish Renewable Transport Policy; and further calls on the Government to:  	&mdash; take decisive steps to reduce our medium-term dependence on fossil fuels;<br /><br />&mdash; implement in full the Offshore Renewable Energy motion unanimously approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 8th December, 2021, and set out a clear policy strategy for the domestic production and consumption of green hydrogen;<br /><br />&mdash; establish without delay a renewable heat obligation scheme similar to the BOS;<br /><br />&mdash; support the development of indigenous biomethane production for use in heating and transport;<br /><br />&mdash; direct Gas Networks Ireland to design and construct district heating systems in suitable towns and urban districts;<br /><br />&mdash; implement, as a matter of urgency through Bord na M&oacute;na, a bioenergy strategy, including the use of fixed price contracts, to increase the supply of biomass for energy from our agriculture and forestry sectors;<br /><br />&mdash; enact the Wind Energy Development Guidelines signed off by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in June 2017 to replace the outdated 2006 guidelines; and<br /><br />&mdash; deliver its long-promised policy statement on geothermal energy and the requisite supporting legislation.  </blockquote>  <p>On behalf of the Regional Group Members of the House, I move this motion on the present energy crisis.  In the course of the debate on this motion, my colleagues will address pertinent facts regarding the present critical situation.  We will call on the Government to declare the current energy crisis to be a national emergency.  We will further call on the Government to enact legislation to address the current supply deficit with a public interest Act to include energy emergency measures.  Regional Group Members will propose workable and credible solutions to address the current crisis to protect and assist the people.</p><p>We aim to ban any threat to turn off the electricity supply to domestic customers and critical social infrastructure such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes.  We will further suggest setting a national cap on the unit price of electricity, with the State raising a long-term loan to pay for verifiable surplus costs to power generators.  This would be repaid through electricity bills over a 15-year period.  The Regional Group Members will also put forward proposals to claw back excessive profits by energy companies.  We propose to exempt planning for rooftop flush-mounted solar panels on domestic, agricultural and commercial buildings.  We propose the establishment of an energy support scheme for businesses.  Some businesses are experiencing up to a 300% increase in utility costs, which is forcing them to decide between staff layoffs or closure.  Equally, there is a need immediately to decouple the link between gas prices and electricity prices.  Currently, that link is inflating electricity prices, whether it is generated by natural gas or not.</p><p>These are just some of the decisive steps to be taken now to reduce our medium-term dependency on fossil fuels.  However, the options do not end there.  We are calling on the Government to implement in full the offshore renewable energy motion that was unanimously approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 8 December 2021.  This motion set out a clear policy strategy for the domestic production and consumption of green hydrogen and the timely establishment of a renewable heat obligation scheme similar to the biofuels obligation scheme.  We also call for the implementation through Bord na M&oacute;na of a bio-energy strategy, including the use of fixed price contracts, to increase the supply of biomass for energy from our agriculture and forest sector.</p><p>People in every corner of this country are living under a cloud of stress and anxiety.  They are gripped by fear about what this winter holds for them.  Homes, businesses, schools, farmers, nursing homes and healthcare providers are depending on the Government for help.  No one underestimates the challenge that lies ahead for the Government.  While direct financial help to pay bills is essential at this time, in truth it is merely a stopgap effort.  We must take a wider and more long-term approach to solving the problem by exploring and revisiting our options for self-sufficiency.  A recent and much-discussed report cites Ireland as the worst prepared country for the current energy crisis in Europe.  This makes the work we need to do much tougher and more urgent.</p><p>A key setback is that Ireland no longer has gas storage facilities.  Countries such as Germany have the capacity to store up to 100 days' supply during the summer months when demand is reduced.  Austria keeps a full year&rsquo;s supply of gas in storage.  Ireland has no capacity whatsoever to store gas in preparation for the high demands of winter, never mind in an energy crisis.  The gas field in Kinsale is not only empty but it has been dismantled.  This leaves the sole survivor, the Corrib gas field, without a crucial backup.  That diminishes our ability to amass gas supplies in off-peak months.</p><p>A solution we have is the burning of oil distillate as opposed to gas.  However, this would involve the reopening of peat-fired plants in the midlands plus an extension of time for the Moneypoint coal-fired plant which is scheduled to close in 2025.</p> <p>The reopening of the power stations in Lanesboro and Shannonbridge are also options to assist in the generation of power, as is the recommissioning of the Derrybrien wind farm. </p> <p> There has been much negativity about the high demand for electricity from data centres.  There is a proactive way to ease this issue through the implementation of maximum peak demand tariffs.  The proven peak time during the winter months for domestic electricity usage is between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  If data centres and large industrial consumers were incentivised to come off the national grid during those times from November to February, and switch back to fossil-fuel generators, this would remove enormous pressure on demand and ensure that domestic needs can be met. </p> <p>Exceptional circumstances demand extraordinary actions.  Maintaining light and heat in the months ahead must be the paramount concern at this time.  Tough times also demand courage.  Government displayed courage and leadership in the fight against Covid-19.  Difficult decisions had to be taken for the greater ultimate good.  Similar strength and decisiveness are required now.</p></speech>

At the start of this month, I and some of my Oireachtas colleagues from the west of Ireland held meetings with IBEC and representatives of a number of multinational companies which employ tens of thousands of people in the west.  The biggest issue that they have is the rising cost of energy.  The meeting was a very productive one and showed how seriously worried they are about the effects of energy costs and the uncertainty about further increases in the future.</p>  <p>  Also present at that meeting were representatives of small businesses, SMEs, who gave some examples of the extent of the cost rises over the past few months, particularly in supermarkets.  One example was of a business that was paying &euro;125,000 a year but is now facing a bill this year of &euro;300,000, and rising.</p>  <p>  I also listened with interest to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; where the chief executive of a hotel group outlined the challenge that the group faced with its electricity bill last year which was in the region of &euro;5 million and it expected that to be closer to &euro;20 million this year.  All of the groups at that IBEC meeting and the businesses to which I have spoken in recent times are asking for Government help and support for their rising energy costs.  </p>  <p>  This is going to have a negative impact on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  My fear is that many of these multinationals could start looking to the Far East where the crisis is not being felt as much.  It could be a question then of instead of looking at the cost of labour, they will start looking at energy costs in making their decisions on where to invest.  </p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to give a commitment to the D&aacute;il today that there will be major support for businesses, hospitality and the SME sectors in the forthcoming budget because, if not, we could face a widespread shutdown of the businesses and industries over the winter, and a consequent loss of jobs as they will not be able to cope with their energy bills.</p>  <p>  Every part of our society is being affected.  I know of one farming contractor whose harvester was costing &euro;300 a day to run.  It is now costing in excess of &euro;1,000 to run every day.  That is just one machine.  The same applies to all the other machinery involved in agri-contracting.  </p>  <p>  Schools are already feeling the pinch.  I know of one school where the two-monthly bill was approximately &euro;500 and the school expects that bill to be up to &euro;1,600 and more.  The school is simply not in a position to pay.  </p>  <p>  It is time the Government realised that this energy crisis is having, and will continue to have, a very significant knock-on effect on all parts of our society.  Assurances need to be given also to domestic customers, especially the most vulnerable, the older population and those with chronic illnesses and disabilities, that they will not be left without electricity.  Even before the current crisis we have all heard reports of vulnerable people switching off their lights and sparing their electricity usage to avoid running up big bills, even to the extent of taking to their beds during the day just to keep warm during winter months.  If they were doing this before, what kind of winter lies ahead for them now?</p>  <p>  There is a fear among older people that there are going to be electricity blackouts and that they will not be able to afford to heat or light their homes on a fixed income.  It is particularly hard on those who live alone.  The people who are most stressed and worried about these are the most vulnerable in our society.</p>  <p>  I would like to see firm guarantees being given to people using vital medical equipment in their homes such as home dialysis machines, oxygen concentrators and artificial ventilators.  They need to be sure that their supply will be under no threat.</p>  <p>  Every single person in this country is affected by this crisis and is worried as they face into a winter of uncertainty.  The Government has to act now.  It must intervene to give businesses, and particularly the most vulnerable in our society, certainty and security as we approach the colder months of increased energy consumption, so that they will be able to turn on their lights and heat their homes.</p>  <p>  In the context of doing everything we can to create additional electricity output, a related issue which has been raised with me concerns grant assistance for the provision of solar panels in homes.  There is a grant available for the installation of solar panels on domestic dwellings, offering up to &euro;2,400 off the cost.  However, there is no grant assistance offered for the addition of a battery unit which comes into play at night time, providing electricity at a time when the solar panels have no sun to draw power from, or where the excess energy can be sold back into the grid.  One of my constituents has been quoted almost &euro;6,000 to add a battery to the system for a 5 kW storage.</p>  <p>  I compliment those in my Regional Group, including Cait, our party administrator, who put this Private Members&rsquo; motion together.  Our motion calls on the Government to take a series of steps and emergency measures to tackle the current crisis and among them is a ban on cutting off electricity supply to people&rsquo;s homes.  The Government should also press at EU level for the immediate decoupling of the link between the price of gas and the price of electricity which is increasing the cost of energy to electricity suppliers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500049#AAA00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I thank my fellow members of the Regional Group for bringing forward this motion.  The purpose of this motion today is to discuss energy security, including supply and demand, electricity generation capacity, plans to best manage supply and demand and, of course, to protect vulnerable users in the coming months.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I would like to emphasise the impact the war in Ukraine is having on gas market prices and, in turn, on both gas and electricity bills, particularly over the coming winter and beyond.  However thousands of households face choosing between eating or heating this winter.  The current electricity crisis caused by the mismanagement of electricity supplies is causing significant financial hardship to families and businesses throughout the country and County Louth.  Recent estimates from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, indicate that up to 29.4% of households now spend more than 10% of their income on their home energy needs.</p>  <p>  There are existing challenges, additional to the war in Ukraine, to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland.  Concerns over supply risks have arisen largely due to the non-delivery of previously contracted capacity.  Without capacity, with increasing electricity demand, and the increasing unreliability of some existing plants, what are we to do?</p>  <p>  With regard to the security of supply of oil, the short- to medium-term outlook has stabilised somewhat, with petroleum products availability having improved recently. However a big part of these increased costs are due to the wholesale gas increases.  With regard to the security of supply of gas, supplies from Russia to Europe have been severely reduced over the past year and continue to be a cause of concern for European energy security.  This has resulted in natural gas prices that are at least ten times the levels seen just two years ago.  On top of that, Ireland is the only EU country without any natural gas storage capacity.  The Minister with responsibility for energy has not followed through on the publication of an assessment of the Southwest Kinsale Gas Field which was converted to an offshore storage facility with a storage capacity of 230 million cu. m for potential storage of natural gas. </p>  <p>  On top of this, SSE Airtricity announced price increases to take place on 1 October, with electricity bills set to rise by over 35% and gas bills to increase by 39%.  In layman's terms, it is costing the people over &euro;1,000 for both oil and gas, over a 12-month period.  These increases are unsustainable and frankly frightening. </p>  <p>  With regard to prices, vulnerable constituents and energy poverty, my office is acutely aware that the exceptionally high wholesale gas price has led to the unprecedented increases in the electricity and retail gas prices faced by consumers.  This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of people at risk of fuel poverty and will lead to hysteria if not actioned immediately. </p>  <p>  I have had constituents calling me after being placed on the most expensive tariffs for electricity and gas, as more suppliers flee the Irish market.  Panda Power, the latest victim of the energy crunch is understood to be on the verge of exiting the residential supply market, which has already seen three other suppliers pull the plug in this market.  Panda has around 60,000 residential electricity and gas customers.  When energy providers leave, their customers get transferred to other suppliers and are put on the most expensive standard tariffs.  These are up to 30% higher than the best rates that can be obtained from energy providers by locking into an annual discounted contract.</p>  <p>  Electricity prices are inflating, whether generated by natural gas or not.  On those grounds, I, along with my colleagues in the Regional Group, request that the Minister with responsibility for energy, Deputy Eamon Ryan, secure EU-wide agreement at the upcoming European Council meeting of energy ministers for the immediate decoupling of the link between gas prices and electricity prices.</p> <p>We also call on the Government to establish an energy support scheme for businesses.  Emergency legislation needs to be introduced to ensure that electricity supply and prices are affordable for families and businesses this winter.  Alongside the Regional Group Members, I propose that this legislation should incorporate a ban on any threat to turn off electricity supply to domestic customers, as well as any critical social infrastructure such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools.</p> <p> It is more feasible to the everyday Joe Soap to pay a yearly gym membership, sometimes not even to go to the gym but, in fact, to use the washing and electrical facilities such as showers and hair driers to save on costs.  A local gym owner contacted my office recently asking what can be done for small businesses to stay afloat this winter.  Its bills have skyrocketed and it risks losing custom if it puts the membership price up.</p> <p> We welcome the statement of the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, yesterday which announced that the EU wants to introduce a cap on the revenues of companies that produce electricity at a low cost.  It is wrong for them to receive extraordinary record profits and to benefit from war on the back of consumers.  We also welcome the SME relief package proposed for doing business in Europe.</p></speech>

I want to read into the record commentary from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association.  A station owner, Johnny Brady of Coolquay, recently received an electricity bill of &euro;23,000 for August.  He says that paying these bills is unsustainable.  His electricity cost for the overnight rate has increased from 7 cent per kilowatt hour to 37 cent per kilowatt hour.  He says he has nothing against data centres but wind turbines run overnight when the country's usage is at a minimum.  He asks are the data centres also paying 37 cent per kilowatt hour for this overnight usage.  Mr. Brady calls for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to investigate urgently and let the country know that businesses and families are not being penalised unfairly for overnight usage.  He also presented significant detail regarding the rates which are coming back from local authorities.</p><p>There are significant difficulties facing our business community domestically, of which I know the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, is aware.  I question the policy of the Government and whether it is reactive or proactive.  I am thinking specifically in terms of green policy.  I referenced in the debate last night the forestry sector.  We know the green credentials around forestry and that we may want to increase forestry and carbon sequestration.  However, at the moment, if we look at where forestry licences are going, 80% of them are for felling, not for planting, and most of that is going towards the public sector, not the private sector growers.  That is just one significant disconnect.  In the motion, we have called for the reopening of the Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations, to be fuelled by biomass, but that can only be achieved if we seriously look at the legislation we have for thinning forestry.  It is not happening simply because of the amount of bureaucracy around this.</p><p>There was an article in the<i>Irish Examiner</i>today showing that the Government did not make any application to the EU&rsquo;s new REPowerEU programme, a &euro;35 billion programme to try to ensure energy security, despite the fact there was a significant component that Ireland could apply for under biomethane and anaerobic digestion and, in fact, &euro;800 million would probably have been our share.  It is obvious that the Green Party did not support the Government looking for this because it is a supporter of anaerobic digesters.  I believe this is a significant deficit in the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, can tell me I am wrong and I am sure he will do so, but we did not make the application and we left &euro;800 million lying around, or that is what it looks like.</p><p>Solar PV is mentioned in our motion.  Why can we not disregard planning permission for new solar PV?  New barrier membranes are being developed in the Far East that will cover roofs; these are not solar panels but barrier membranes that can generate solar power.  Surely this is something we should become active on.  We gave a commitment to the agricultural sector over two years ago that we were going to provide significant grant-aid to farmers for deploying solar power but, again, we have no way of getting back to the grid for most farmers so they can only use it for their own purposes.  This is no good when they have spare power that they could certainly put back into the grid.</p><p>We need to speak about the supports to households and to businesses.  The Taoiseach has signalled that some of these supports will not be ready by the time the budget is approved in less than two weeks and that we have to wait and see what the EU is going to come up with.  Can we not be more proactive in terms of trying to provide supports?  We must give a signal to our domestic economy and to our SMEs as to how we are going to support them, given what is coming down the road.  Otherwise, people will lose confidence exponentially.  People are looking at their business models.  I met people from a very large publican business in Waterford before the weekend who told me they are considering closing at the end of September or in October because their business is not sustainable.  They think the best thing they can do is stay closed until February or March, with the loss of nearly 25 whole-time jobs.</p></speech>

We are all too aware of the pressing matters of energy security, energy prices and protecting our vulnerable consumers and businesses.  At the outset, I would like to emphasise the impact the war in Ukraine is having on gas market prices and, in turn, the impact on both gas and electricity bills over the coming winter and beyond.  Europe has not faced an energy challenge like this since the 1970s oil crisis.</p>  <p>  The Minster, Deputy Ryan, attended a Council of Energy Ministers meeting on 9 September to address the extraordinary situation of energy prices in the EU and to work on possible emergency measures to mitigate current high prices and support demand reduction for electricity to strengthen the EU's winter preparedness.  These problems are being faced by all EU member states and a united, determined and immediate response is being taken by the European Union, as stated by President von der Leyen in her State of the Union address earlier this week.  At the Council meeting, Ministers agreed that immediate action must be taken to ensure the EU's security of supply and alleviate pressure on customers, while maintaining consistency with the current efforts to reduce gas demand and the objectives of the European Green Deal and REPowerEU.</p>  <p>  The Commission has proposed a number of short-term exceptional emergency measures in recent days.  These include a proposal incentivising co-ordinated electricity demand reduction across the EU.  Other proposals include capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers with low costs of production and introducing a solidarity contribution from fossil fuel companies to be used to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on customers.</p>  <p>  The Commission's proposed legislation is already under urgent negotiation by member states in order to have agreement by the end of the month.  Ireland believes a well-functioning EU electricity market remains crucial for the integration of our internal energy market and for providing the necessary investment signals for the integration of new renewables, which are essential ultimately to break our dependence on fossil fuels.  We support the overall threefold approach being taken in the regulation to first, remove excess rents being earned by non-gas electricity production; second, to reduce electricity demand; and, third, to apply a solidarity payment from the producers of oil and gas.  Nationally, the national energy security framework, NESF, which was approved by Government and published in April 2022, sets out Ireland's response to our energy security needs in the context of the invasion of Ukraine and our specific national circumstances.</p>  <p>  The short to medium-term oil supply outlook has stabilised, with petroleum product availability having improved recently, and we have seen a slow softening of the international oil price.  The National Oil Reserves Agency currently holds approximately 85 days of oil stocks, the overwhelming majority of which is in the form of physical product, with approximately 85% stored on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Gas supplies from Russia to Europe have been severely reduced over the last year and continue to be a cause for concern for Europe's energy security.  This has resulted in natural gas prices that are approximately ten times the levels seen just two years ago.  The continued supply of natural gas to Ireland has not to date been reduced or interrupted as a result of the war in Ukraine.  The UK, from where 75% of our gas comes, is at a strategic advantage compared to other European countries as it has a diverse source of gas supplies.  The European Council recently agreed a regulation on reducing gas demand by 15% this winter.  This regulation requires all member states to put in place a demand reduction plan.  As Ireland is not directly interconnected to another member state, it is not required to meet the mandatory reduction target in this regulation.  However, preparations are under way to put the voluntary demand reduction plan in place in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Separate to the war in Ukraine, there are challenges to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland.</p> <p>Concerns over such risks had arisen largely due to the non-delivery of previously contracted capacity, increasing electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of some existing plants.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is managing a programme of work initiated in April 2021 and finalised in September 2021 to address this challenge, with the support of EirGrid and my Department.</p> <p> There are challenges to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland.  The system outlook for this winter is similar to last winter, when we fully met all demand, although this winter, imports from the UK may not be as readily available as it, too, faces tighter margins.  Specifically for this winter, a range of measures are being taken.  A large amount of maintenance has taken place over the summer to ensure our generation fleet is adequately prepared for the winter ahead.  We have been working with the large-scale energy users, which have significant quantities of backup generation, to enable us to access that backup supply at times of system stress.  The optimisation of grid batteries, the number of which is growing, will provide greater service during times of stress.  We are also enhancing demand-side responses through a number of measures at domestic and industrial scale.  Furthermore, I welcome that the CRU is reviewing the capacity remuneration mechanism to make sure it is fit for purpose.  In carrying out this review, it is vital that we support the projects that have been rewarded contracts under the existing mechanism and that planned capacity auctions continue to deliver.  In respect of the longer-term outlook for energy security, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the energy security of Ireland's gas and electricity systems for the period to 2030.  I expect a consultation to launch in the coming days.</p> <p> Members will be acutely aware that the exceptionally high wholesale gas prices seen since Russia invaded Ukraine have led to increases in electricity and retail gas prices faced by consumers.  This, in turn, has resulted in a very significant increase in the number of people at risk of energy poverty.  Recent estimates from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, indicate that up to 29.4% of households are now spending more than 10% of their income on their home energy needs.  The Government is keenly aware of the pressure on households facing these bills and has already implemented a &euro;2.4 billion package of policies and measures to support energy customers.  These supports included an electricity costs credit, which was applied to more than 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts, a reduction in VAT on electricity and gas bills from 13.5% to 9%, and increases to the fuel allowance.</p> <p> The Government also greatly enhanced the home retrofit supports available to households.  For example, the number of free energy upgrades for households at risk of energy poverty delivered each month is more than double what it was last year.  In addition, a new 80% grant support for cavity wall and attic insulation was introduced as a response to the exceptionally high energy prices.  These supports will help to protect homeowners from energy price increases in both the short and long term.</p> <p> However, the Government recognises that more needs to be done as prices continue to increase.  Therefore, additional measures to support households and businesses are being examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.  I very much welcome the recent announcement by the CRU of a range of additional consumer protections under the national energy security framework.  The Department also recently published a review of the strategy to combat energy poverty, alongside a public consultation that will help to inform the development of a new action plan to combat energy poverty.  The new action plan will set out a range of measures to be implemented ahead of the coming winter, as well as key longer-term measures to ensure those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected the most.  It is intended that the new plan will be published shortly after the budget.  The development and implementation of the plan is being overseen by a cross-departmental steering group, chaired by my Department.</p> <p> In response to questions about anaerobic digestion and the planning exemption conditions on solar panels, without wishing to pass the ball, I will leave it to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to address that in his later statement.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak about the very worrying energy situation.  I thank my colleagues and, C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, our co-ordinator, for organising this debate.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were signs of this energy crisis emerging before any blame could be given to Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.  We must look closer to home, at some of the failings of the Government, which have left us ever more exposed to the impact of the international energy disruption.  In October 2007, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who was then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, warned us that 85% of Ireland's gas and oil was imported.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	This reliance on imported fuels from areas of the world that are geopolitically volatile contributes to price instability and vulnerability in Ireland.  New domestic sources of oil and gas would ease the pressure. </blockquote>  <p>He also said:</p> <blockquote> 	Ireland's oil and gas is a resource of the people.  I want to ensure that our waters are fully explored and that we get a proper return to the State. </blockquote>  <p>Even in 2007, there were reports of Russia threatening to cut off supplies to Ukraine.  Fourteen years ago, the Minister was aware there was a need for domestic energy security and exploration, yet, in recent weeks, he has said he was taken by surprise by what has happened.</p><p>What action did he take in response?  Aided and abetted by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, he introduced legislation to ban gas storage infrastructure from being built and he banned the issuing of new exploration licences.  The Government is continuing on a path that makes our energy security even more perilous.  It has created two types of problems.  One is the short-term cost of energy, which is going to decimate businesses and put many households under serious pressure to pay their bills.  The other problem is energy security in the long term.  Reliable supply and as much homemade generation as possible should help to keep prices stable, but where is it?  We had 14 years to prepare.</p><p>The short-term problems must be addressed now.  In this motion, we call for energy support schemes for businesses and a ban on any threat to turn off the electricity supply to domestic customers and critical social infrastructure such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes.  While those protections are in place, we need to start addressing the long-term supply issues.  The current crisis surely necessitates a review of the path we are on with regard to energy.  The Government must admit these problems have been caused in part by pursuing foolhardy policies that promoted moves away from fossil fuels before alternative supplies were secured.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act sets the target of a climate-neutral economy by no later than the end of 2050.  Unless this is revised, we will spend the next 28 years implementing damaging policy after damaging policy in an attempt to meet this unattainable target and paying massive fines to the EU for the privilege.  We are simply not ready to move away from the traditional energy sources just yet.  Surely the alternative should be fully ready and available before we try to abandon the sources on which we rely.</p><p>As stated in the motion, the national grid has come under increasing pressure since the start of this decade, with a spike in the number of amber alerts, which has gone from 13 in the past decade to 17 already in the two years of this decade.  I received correspondence recently from a constituent who runs a successful retail business.  That correspondence displays clearly how unprepared and disorganised we are when it comes to moving towards renewables.  He states in his email:</p> <blockquote> 	We have looked to try and install solar panels to reduce costs but the system in place is making this very difficult because of the following.  We would need to install a 150 kW system for the site.  Currently, you need planning above an 11 kW system.  The system would create an overall supply at certain times of the day and then this would spill back onto the grid - a positive for the grid but not for us as currently a system under 50 kW will get paid for anything passed to the grid but, over 50 kW, the grid takes it for free.  The cost of installing the system is &euro;170,000 and would cut my dependency on the grid in half but the upfront cost is difficult to raise.  The grants for these systems are very low.  The above system for our premises would get no grant.  The other option is solar and a battery system but the cost of these is not affordable to my business. </blockquote>  <p>Here we have a business owner who is willing to move to renewables and cut his reliance on the grid in half.  He would even be in a position to sell back power to the grid.  However, he and many like him are being put off moving to renewables by this cumbersome and prohibitive system.  We have these great plans to achieve net zero by 2050 but we do not even have the basics right.</p> <p>Not having the basics right and refusing to look at them in planning is how we have ended up with a housing crisis, while not addressing employment issues in the health profession is how we have ended up with a health crisis.  Now, we have an energy crisis.  At what point will we learn from experience?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500052#DDD00200"><p>Following on from my colleague's contribution, one of the biggest problems existing in the administration of this State is our glacial bureaucratic system.  Anybody outside this Chamber will tell us that any time constituents try to do something right by their families, communities and the State, they find that they run into a bureaucratic wall when they deal with the State.  The State is slow and cumbersome in dealing with issues.</p>  <p>  I will give some examples.  Some 70,000 people applied to the Be on Call for Ireland campaign to help during the Covid-19 crisis.  Of those, only 400 were ever employed by the HSE.  Equally, thousands of families have provided homes for Ukrainian refugees to stay in, but 85% of those homes have still not been activated today.  When a job is given to this Government or to the upper echelons of the public service to deliver upon, the outcome is that it does not get delivered upon, it takes forever to do or it is completely rolled up in red tape and bureaucracy.  The rest of Ireland gets on with executing its work efficiently because it has no choice but to do so.  If that does not happen, the costs will come from the pockets of those involved.  This State, however, takes forever to do anything because it can afford to do so as it is the taxpayers who are paying.</p>  <p>  For me, the frustration around this issue stems from the fact that the Government has been aware of many of these problems for a long time, but it has failed to act on them.  The issue that really jumps out at me is the microgeneration of electricity.  The North of Ireland started a process 15 years ago of allowing people to put solar panels on their roofs, erect small-scale wind turbines and undertake biodigestion projects.  Here we are this week, and correct me if I am wrong, and householders are just getting a tariff for the microgeneration of electricity.  We are the last country in Europe to do it.  Another example of how slow we are to do any reasonable job is that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met with other European energy ministers last week concerning the issue of offshore energy.  He spoke about the seriousness of this issue.  In 20 years, this State has seen seven wind turbines built offshore.  Consider all the greenwashing photographs produced and all the glossy prospectuses and reports written, and this has been the output in 20 years.  The endeavour has been disastrously, dangerously and expensively slow for the people of this country.</p>  <p>  Then there is the issue of ideology.  The first aspect in this regard concerns elements of the green ideology.  I am an environmentalist and I believe strongly that we must protect society, but we must also take a common-sense approach to doing it.  Being the only country without a gas reserve is dangerous and this is the direct result of this Government's policy.  It leaves us as the country which is the most exposed in Europe to changes in the supply and prices of energy now, and this is the fault of the Government.  The other aspect of this is the Government's instinct to blame the EU or at least to bow to it regarding fixing these issues.  Therefore, while we have been pushing for VAT to be reduced on fuel, literally since Christmas, the Government has kept saying that the EU would not allow that to be done.  Yet we have now seen that Spain and Portugal have secured a VAT reduction in the cost of their fuels.  When I raised the idea in recent months that we should decouple the price of electricity generated by non-gas means from that which is gas-generated, the response from the Government was to say we should wait for the EU to do it.  Was that the response in Iberia?  No.  Spain and Portugal have got a derogation and have been allowed to decouple their prices.  I hear politicians talk about how rotten it is for energy companies to be charging gas prices for non-gas generated electricity at a time of such crisis, and yet it is the Government's system that allows that to be done.  The Government is sitting on its hands and waiting for someone else to do it again.</p>  <p>  Turning to carbon tax, it is absolutely a sin for the Government to be raising carbon tax year-on-year at a time when nearly 50% of the population is living in fuel poverty.  It does not make sense, it is unfair and punitive and it must stop.</p></speech>

It allows us an opportunity to talk about the crucial issue of energy security.  It is important to get into the weeds on this issue and to pick apart the details.  I say this because, in many respects, the Government has tried as much as possible to confuse the situation and to wrap it up in the context of events in Ukraine, internationally or in the EU.  I refer to the truth of all this, though, particularly concerning energy security and the risk of blackouts.  We heard the regulator speaking on the radio this morning and again confirming that it cannot be guaranteed there will not be blackouts this winter.  This is a direct result of policy failure by successive Governments.  It is entirely in the gift of the Government and it is also an essential responsibility to ensure that we have energy security.</p>  <p>  There was a complete mismanagement of supply and demand.  The red carpet was rolled out for data centres even as electricity demand increased year-on-year.  There was a 12% increase over five years.  My county and others saw an enormous roll-out of these data centres.  This was one aspect of the situation.  Another aspect, however, is that to have done this at a time when the Government was also failing to deliver capacity on the supply side was reckless and dangerous.  It puts lives and livelihoods at risk.  This is an incredible failure of policy and of the business of Government.</p>  <p>  At the request of Sinn F&eacute;in, representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and EirGrid appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action in recent weeks to discuss this subject.  That was because over the summer recess people were reading on the front pages of their newspapers about leaked reports and details in reports of disaster planning scenarios that put the fear of God in them, to be honest.  It was confirmed by the representatives of EirGrid that we are at a heightened risk of experiencing blackouts this winter.  The Minister outlined some of the emergency measures being put in place to try to address this potentiality.  There is a question mark over every one of those measures in respect of the existing back-up capacity and the ability of those batteries, optimised or otherwise.  Therefore, there is risk and it is significant in this regard.  This is something that can be laid entirely at the door of the Minister.</p>  <p>  Something else that did not get much attention because it was technical legislation was the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022 that was rushed through in an emergency manner just before the D&aacute;il rose for the summer recess.  In real terms, that was a rewriting of the rule book in respect of the procurement of back-up generation.  It was a damning indictment of the CRU, EirGrid, the Department and the Minister and the capacity to deliver essential electricity supply.  It came years after red flags had been raised and alarm bells sounded in this regard.  We failed to deliver capacity for the winters of 2021 and 2022.  As far as I can see, the regulator and the transmission operator were standing looking at each other, bickering and pointing the finger at each other.  It is the responsibility of the Government and the Minister of the day to ensure that these systems operate and that these agencies and regulators are operating to a standard.  All this falls back on a failure of Government policy.</p>  <p>  We also see this in the context of the delivery of supply and the planning system, which is completely unfit for purpose.  We have targets for 2030, and they have been increased.  Every time the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has to launch a document, I believe he wants to be able to say we are increasing our ambition in the area of renewables.</p> <p>They fail to meet any one of those targets.  That is what will continue to happen unless the Government invests in the planning and regulatory system.  If one looks at An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and I spoke about it earlier, the applications that go in have a target timeline of 18 weeks but it is turning around decisions on planning appeals in 60 weeks.  On strategic infrastructure development, SID, applications, the target time is 18 weeks but it is turning around decisions in 69 weeks.  The system is completely broken.  Those decisions that are delayed today will have an impact in winter 2027, winter 2028 and winter 2029.  Will we still be wondering about blackouts in those years as well because of a failure of Government to deliver on its obligations?</p> <p> It has been mentioned repeatedly in relation to microgeneration of solar.  It is incredible.  There are communities, whether it be the GAA, community centres or businesses, putting their hands up in the middle of an energy crisis to install solar photovoltaic, PV, and they have hurdle after hurdle put in front of them.  I want to bring to the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth's attention a particular problem at this point in time, among all the other ones, with the better energy community scheme, and ask that he take a note of it.  I have been on to the Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the Minister about it.  There are a number of applications in to be assessed and as far as I can gather from listening to applicants, the goalposts are being shifted and the promise of updated regulations and updated exemptions in terms of planning puts a number of really important applications in jeopardy.  It is something that needs to be reviewed.</p> <p> Central to this debate in terms of energy security is the approach that successive Governments have taken in relation to the energy system.  I look back to the 1916 Proclamation and at the ownership of our natural resources and the use of them for the people of Ireland.  Successive Governments, largely Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments, have sold them off, often not even to the highest bidder.  We look at the profits of the owner of the Corrib Gas Field.  I stood at Corrib gas, with others and with the local community at that time.  If one looks at the profits of Vermilion, it reported 267% increased profits last year.  This year, it is reporting a 28% increase in profits.  These are spectacular numbers.  Those who will get the benefit of that are the company's shareholders, not, as it should be, the people of Ireland.  That is all on the shoulders of successive Governments.</p></speech>

I have been talking to small business owners.  I spoke to a lady on Thursday last who is absolutely terrified of what is coming down the road here when it comes to energy supply and energy costs.  I also spoke to one business owner and he gave me a breakdown of his costs for a shop in the year to June 2022 and for the same period in 2021.  There was a 94% increase on costs alone.  His ESB bill went from &euro;28,454 in 2021 to &euro;55,239 for the same period up to June in 2022.  There is no way he will compete.  He will have to start letting people go.  It is very worrying.</p>  <p>  I heard a number of Deputies here a while ago speaking about microgeneration.  In the previous term, we in Sinn F&eacute;in proposed microgeneration and it was dismissed as fantasy.  We have businesses that have invested heavily in solar panels and are lucky enough to be producing enough power to run their own businesses, but yet they are still prohibited from selling the excess power to one of the providers.  There seems to be no joined-up thinking whatsoever.</p>  <p>  I am also worried about families, who were spoken about here, and businesses and schools.  Then there are the more vulnerable, that is, those who would probably need oxygen supply on a regular or a 24/7 basis.  I have seen them rationing oxygen previously but now we will be rationing power to pump that oxygen as well.  That must be a terrifying scenario for these people.  I hope the Government is ready.  It should be ready to start addressing this immediately.</p>  <p>  Another issue today is that an energy provider is leaving the market.  I do not know what is happening there.  If that is the case, we are starting to lose our grip on everything here.</p>  <p>  We need to be moving faster towards renewables, green hydrogen, etc.  I have spoken with people and had a briefing on hydrogen, and the by-product of oxygen.  These people are willing to give the oxygen to the hospitals in this country for free and at the same time have enough capability to produce our own energy and export it.</p>  <p>  I commend the Regional Group on bringing the motion before the House.  I hope the Government takes everything that has been said here on board.  It has to be addressed, not tomorrow but immediately.</p></speech>

I am talking about micro-businesses that are employing people in my area.  They have all been saying that their electricity bills have increased by thousands of euro.  This is not something new for this Chamber.  We are all acutely aware of those difficulties that households and businesses are facing.  Of the thousands of euro these businesses have seen in increases, many of them are saying that they have no certainty in relation to what is to happen over the coming months.</p>  <p>  To be honest, I have asked people directly because it is important for us to hear exactly what people are thinking and exactly what people feel would help them.  One of those micro-businesses suggested to me that we make it easier for those micro-businesses, which do not have much money to spare, to get their own solar panels.  There is two examples.  One of them is the ceann ar an oile&aacute;n a bhfuil s&eacute; acu cheana f&eacute;in agus an ceann nach bhfuil s&eacute; acu go f&oacute;ill.</p>  <p>  I have been contacted by a pensioner in Galway city who has just got a letter through her door from her landlord and who has been advised that her bills for heating and electricity will increase by 25%.  She said that it is completely and utterly outrageous, and that there is no extra money for her at this moment in time.  Therefore, we need to see that in the budget.  What is extremely heartbreaking is a pensioner contacting me and asking what charities can she contact to get help.  We need to see action from this Government.  We need to see action to help those people, such as that pensioner, and make sure they can get through this winter.</p></speech>

The response of the Government to the crisis being inflicted on families and businesses across the country has been dreadful.  Earlier this year, the Government was pushed to introduce measures to assist families and businesses but as the crisis increased, the Government refused to have an emergency budget, opting instead to take the summer off from making any decisions.  This was a dereliction of duty.  Families of people who have to use oxygen concentrators, for example, or dialysis machines, were left to bear the brunt all summer.  Businesses and farms had to keep operating, and we have all heard the staggering bills they are faced with.</p>  <p>  In June, the additional needs payment was announced, but 95% of current applications are taking five to eight weeks to be finalised.</p> <p>That is no emergency response.<br/><br/>In October of last year the Government opposed proposals at EU level to decouple electricity prices from the gas market.  Now we see a dramatic U-turn from the Government on the issue of decoupling gas from electricity prices.  That is the problem with this Government: it has no vision and wastes time.<br/><br/>A study by the <i>Financial Times</i>found that Ireland is second-last among European governments in acting on the energy crisis.  Yet the Government dismisses Sinn F&eacute;in calls to cap electricity prices at &euro;1,000, inclusive of VAT and standing charges.  Instead, people must wait up to two months for the emergency assistance the Government talks about.<br/><br/>We in Sinn F&eacute;in have also raised with the Government for months the need for a windfall tax on excess profits made by electricity suppliers.  It is immoral to profit off the back of a war in Ukraine and the misery of struggling households.<br/><br/>That struggle is everywhere.  Only today I received an email from a Tipperary constituent who had received a letter from a school asking that pupils bring in their own small towels because blue tissue has now become so expensive for the school.  That is where we are: struggling schools looking for support from struggling parents.  It is just not right.<br/><br/>This motion mentions the use of fixed-price contracts to increase the supply of biomass for energy from our agriculture and forestry sectors.  The Government, however, is making it difficult when trees, dead due to ash dieback, are left to rot in the ground because of licensing delays.<br/><br/>The motion also calls for an external review of all CRU and EirGrid actions which led to increases in standing charges.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called on the regulator to outline what it is doing to monitor standing charge increases by some companies.<br/><br/>When it comes to the threat to electricity supply, the figures speak for themselves.  In 2017 the number of amber electricity alerts was one.  In 2020 the number increased to three.  This year, up to August, it was eight.  It is not as though the Government has not had any warning of this.  It just lacks the vision to deal with it.<br/><br/>The Government has mismanaged this crisis.  That is why we are discussing this motion and why, yesterday, Sinn F&eacute;in outlined a package of measures to act in the interest of people in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.</p></speech>

It comes on the back of Sinn F&eacute;in's motion last night, in which we proposed a number of solutions.  They included a reduction in household electricity prices, capping them at 2021 levels, and cost-of-living cash payments targeted at low- and middle-income households to support them with their rising energy bills.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are also calling for a double child benefit payment in recognition of the higher energy bills associated with larger families.  The Government must also introduce a windfall tax in order that excess profits are not made during this crisis.  It is immoral that companies should make excess profit from the suffering of the people of Ukraine and the misery of households struggling to heat their homes.  It is time for the price-gouging to stop for good.  Not only has this Government refused to act; it has actively worked against the interests of ordinary workers and small business owners and their families.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that is nothing new.  Last October the Government opposed proposals at EU level to decouple electricity prices from the gas market, which would have helped bring down the costs.  The price of gas is dictating the price of all electricity, which is pushing bills to an extortionate level, even for renewable electricity.  While we can produce electricity from wind and solar power at a relatively low price, the current system means that that energy is sold at the same rate as gas-generated electricity.  As recently as June of this year, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, expressed his opposition to fixing this flawed system.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the Government is prioritising the profits of energy companies ahead of the interests of citizens and their ability to afford to heat their homes during the winter.  I now have small business owners in south Kildare telling me that their businesses will not survive this winter if something is not done soon.  Some of these businesses have been on the go for over 100 years.  They have survived recession, war and Covid, only to be killed off by an indifferent or, worse, malevolent Government.  It is a Government that prioritises the properties and profits of energy companies over schools that are struggling to pay bills.  It is a Government that prioritises data centres over the electricity need of the ordinary worker and family.  Data centres now use as much electricity as all homes in rural Ireland combined.  Last month, a new data centre in Ennis was approved.  That centre will use the equivalent power of 200,000 homes.  This is putting huge pressure on the grid.</p>  <p>  Winter is coming and it is time to pull the plug.  It is time to pull the plug on the Government now because it is an absolute shambles.</p></speech>

Clearly, this is a hugely pressing issue and very topical as we face into what can only be described as a bleak winter ahead, a winter which we know many households and many struggling families and individuals, are already in fear of.  All of us are meeting people around the country, in our constituencies, who are really fearful about the winter ahead, the cost of energy and the consistency of energy supply.  We therefore face a twofold energy crisis this winter.  It is about not only security and consistency of supply but also the cost and the affordability of energy.  That is very clear.</p>  <p>  In the Minister of State's opening remarks he pointed out that, even separate from the war in Ukraine, there were challenges to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland already.  That is absolutely true.  My colleagues in Labour and I have previously been highly critical of the failure of this Government to ensure delivery of previously contracted capacity.  I recently sat in on a climate committee meeting at which we heard representatives of EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities speak about that unfortunate failure to deliver previously contracted capacity and the effect it has had in creating a greater risk to the security of our energy supply.  I therefore agree absolutely with the Minister of State that there are challenges to the security of energy and, in particular, of electricity supplies in Ireland this winter.  Some of those challenges, however, were already clearly evident in the failure to deliver the contracted capacity.  I think we all acknowledge that those challenges have been massively exacerbated, the concerns have been exacerbated and the costs have increased hugely due to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's weaponising of gas supplies across Europe.  There is no doubt about that, and we are feeling the impact here.</p>  <p>  Having said that, we are all also very much aware that it is clear we are not as exposed to Russian weaponising of gas supplies as other European countries are.  The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have previously pointed out that 75% of our gas is imported through the UK.  Of course, we also have our own indigenous supply of gas in the Corrib gas field.  I will speak about that in a moment.</p>  <p>  I will speak first about a position that has been put forward by some.  I know that the Minister of State did not refer to it in his opening remarks, but I am talking about the issue of storage and, in particular, suggestions in some quarters that we need floating LNG storage.  I will say this on behalf of Labour.  While we await the energy review report, to which the Minister of State has referred, we do not believe we need to see floating LNG terminals.  I think any storage facilities could be contemplated only on the basis that they would be future-proofed.  I think the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made that same point.  In other words, such storage facilities would have to be capable of being repurposed for green hydrogen or renewables.  Otherwise, the introduction of such facilities would be a highly regressive measure.</p>  <p>  I think we are also conscious that the countries that need floating LNG most are those, such as Finland and Germany, that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and that have had to diversify rapidly and that we are not quite in that position.  Clearly, however, what we really need for energy security is a rapid and urgent deployment of increased renewable capacity, in particular offshore wind.  We have supported the Government's attempts and Government measures to introduce the necessary planning framework to ensure we can develop offshore wind rapidly, but we need to see a much speedier roll-out.  I am conscious there will be a conference next week, I think, or in the coming weeks for those involved in offshore wind.  What I hear from stakeholders and wind energy companies is a real readiness to get these offshore wind terminals built and a frustration at the slow pace of roll-out.  That is a key issue with energy security.</p>  <p>  The other energy security issue I wish to raise - I raised it yesterday in the D&aacute;il also - is the Corrib gas field.  I ask both Ministers present to consider seriously how we can address questions and concerns about security of supply through taking a new approach to Corrib and Corrib gas.  It makes no sense that Corrib gas should be priced as if it were internationally traded.  It is produced here, off this island, and nothing has happened to increase the cost of production or supply of Corrib gas.  I have called on the Government to use existing powers under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982.  Those powers were first invoked during the oil shortages in the 1970s.  The legislation was amended in the 1970s by Fine Gael, in fact, to extend its coverage so as to include natural gas.</p> <p>The Acts give the Government the power that if the exigencies of the common good necessitate the regulation or control by the State of the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of fuels, the Minister may then make all the necessary orders.  The test is the exigencies of the common good.  What we hear from people around the country is that the common good now demands the sort of emergency measures that would, for example, involve the taking over by the State, temporarily, of Corrib gas output so that it could be sold to the State on a cost-plus basis.  This would reduce the cost to consumers and would in no small way go towards addressing the hardship and fear of so many families and businesses as they face into a winter with uncertainty around supply and cost.</p> <p> In the House yesterday we spoke on the cost issue but it is worth repeating.  Small business owners whom I have met say that the cost of their energy bills is now equating to or greater than the cost of their rent.  As we all know, rent is a significant cost for any small business owner.  It is usually the greatest cost that has to be factored in, but now energy bills are reaching that level.  We heard about the shocking figure of &euro;21,000 for an energy bill for a business in Roscommon.  Households face projected costs of energy bills of up to &euro;6,000 per year, three times what was the expected average energy bill for households.  This is at a time when other costs are also increasing.</p> <p> The cost-of-living crisis is biting so many households and family in terms of food prices, childcare, and rents.  Here in Dublin Bay South, in this constituency, people contact me because they have been told their rents are going up, or they have been given a notice to quit.  They simply cannot find affordable accommodation.  People have told me that they have made and sent literally hundreds of phone calls and emails to landlords advertising properties.  People who are renting apartments have told me that they are inundated and flooded with requests to rent, if they put a property up for rent just because there is such a shortage and costs are so high.  This is the cost-of-living crisis that is really hurting and affecting so many people, families, households, and businesses.  Energy costs and uncertainty around energy costs are a huge part of that.</p> <p> The Labour Party has called on the Government to introduce a windfall tax in order to curb excessive profits of energy companies.  We have called for a cap on energy prices as well as an expansion of the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance.  Some &euro;15 million would mean 16,000 more families would be within the fuel allowance criteria.  That would be one way of addressing hardship for those most affected and most in fear as we face into this bleak winter.</p></speech>

It is a far-ranging motion that touches on every element of the energy issues we are seeing, be it security of supply or price.  We must be clear that they are two separate issues with two drivers behind them.  The exorbitant prices being applied to people's bills are as a result of the problem in Ukraine, which could not have been foreseen.  There is also the security of supply issue, which the motion also relates to.</p>  <p>  On the security of supply issue, there is no one else to lay the blame with other than this and previous Governments due to their lack of planning.  I found it laughable when the Taoiseach said that he was surprised when there were discussions and warnings about blackouts and brownouts this coming winter and how he would have appreciated more warning in that regard.  The reality is that this and previous Governments were warned annually about the security of supply issues we are facing now.  They were warned about the pressures on and the lack of investment in the grid.  EirGrid's generation capacity statements, published every year since 2018, made it clear that we would face significant problems with energy security.  Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir, of the MaREI centre, tweeted at the time that the centre's academics had issued ten warnings over the previous four-year period.  Clearly, it was not an issue of a lack of warning; it was an issue of a lack of listening.</p>  <p>  Last year, I brought forward a Social Democrats motion in respect of data centres and the need for a moratorium on their development, because of the pressure they put on the grid.  During the debate on that motion, I raised the issues about security of supply, how this uncontrolled and unregulated growth of data centres was putting such pressure on the grid that we would face blackouts and that it would raise the cost of electricity prices for ordinary homeowners, which we have seen happen.  It would also undermine the environmental message from the Government and those of us in the Opposition who want to see progress on climate change and environmental measures.  It is difficult to tell an individual, who has their own bills and costs to deal with, that they need to retrofit their home or buy an electric vehicle.  Regardless of the grants available, it is still a costly exercise.  It is difficult to say that to individual homeowner while explaining it is for climate and emissions reasons, and for our energy security, when at the same time large corporations are allowed to use what power they want and build as many data centres as they want.  In fact, this was encouraged and facilitated by the Government, that data centres were a key industry for us and there would be a free-for-all when it came to data centres.  We are all paying the price now.  This is not an anti-data centre discussion.  This is a management of our grid discussion.  It will do no one any good if we cannot put the lights on in homes or businesses across the country in the winter.  That goes for the people who work in and build the data centres, as well as the corporations, and their employees, that own the data centres.  The issues were are having with security come down to a lack of planning by the Government, and that is unacceptable because it is a government's primary function.</p>  <p>  I refer to the price issue.  I said earlier there are two issues and two drivers.  I believe governments across Europe are scrambling to address that issue.  Two approaches must be taken.  There are the immediate needs.  How do we help people now?  How do we help people and businesses get through the winter?  How do we make sure they can afford to pay their energy costs?  How do we make sure they can afford to feed their children?  How do we get them safely through this winter?  I hope the Government will put a significant emphasis in the budget on those immediate needs.  The Social Democrats party is calling for an energy assistance scheme that will put money into people's pockets and that it will be targeted.  A fundamental principle for us is that we must make sure any financial supports or measures are targeted toward those who need it most, which is something we have repeated frequently.  As a Deputy, I do not need &euro;600 in support to pay my bills.  My family and I will manage and there are many families who will manage.  It will be uncomfortable but they will manage.  There are hundreds of thousands of families for whom this could mean life or death or could become a serious situation for them.</p>  <p>  I have spoken previously about a man in my constituency who ended up in hospital because he had an electricity bill to pay.  He is diabetic and he could not buy the correct food for himself and ended up having an attack and going to hospital because he paid his bill instead.  That is the situation some people are facing.  We in the Social Democrats believe the focus of the Government should be on making sure targeted measures are introduced that are sufficient to help people through the winter.</p> <p>Once people get through the winter we need to look at how we make people in businesses more robust against these types of price shocks in future.  We cannot allow ourselves to continue to be as susceptible to what is happening in Europe.  This comes down to making sure there are sufficient retrofitting schemes and grants in place.  It is not only about the money.  It is also about making sure that workers and the capacity are there to get it done.  There is a two and a half year wait for those applying for the warmer homes scheme, which is not acceptable.  These are our most vulnerable people.  The solar scheme for vulnerable customers has not yet been put in place.  It was meant to be put in place in the second quarter of the year.  It was part of the national energy review.  These simple measures are not being taken and they need to be taken.</p> <p> One of the risks in this is the undermining of the environmental message.  When people are focused on feeding their families and their very survival, it is very difficult for us to speak about emissions, carbon and addressing environmental issues.  The Minister needs to make sure individuals and homes are helped enough so that we can also communicate the importance of these messages.</p></speech>

The heart of it is wrong.  It is incorrect.  More motions such as this will be tabled and so they should.  Almost one year ago People Before Profit tabled a motion on the cost-of-energy crisis that was emerging.  Nothing has changed.  Unfortunately motions and Bills in the D&aacute;il do not deliver, certainly not those coming from the Opposition.  Whether we agree or disagree with it, how we really get change is through getting masses of people onto the streets to send a very strong message to the Government, as has been proved in the past.  I want to give a shout-out to the public to get on the street on Saturday, 24 September, to unite together to force the Government to act in a meaningful way.</p>  <p>  The motion starts correctly by highlighting the huge hikes in the price of wholesale electricity and gas.  It correctly illustrates that what is happening is that poorer households and families are affected as they spend a larger amount of their income on this area.  The motion immediately moves on to conflate gas price hikes with issues around our gas supply.  This is a mistake.  We do not have a gas supply problem.  Other countries in Europe have gas storage and they also have a gas price hike problem.  The problem here is profiteering.  The problem is the fact that, just like Corrib, our wind energy is privatised and we pay the market headline price.  The market is profiteering.  The problem is not storage and neither is it the war in Ukraine.  It is deeper and it lies in the liberalisation and deregulation that happened here and in Europe in the energy sector.  We think back to how the ESB made massive breakthroughs in building a global state-of-the-art energy set-up with Ardnacrusha and later with Turlough Hill and exported it throughout the world to show how hydropower could be done.  If we had been relying then on the competitive tendering, deregulated and privatised model that we have in energy now we would still be in the dark in this country.</p>  <p>  We agree with the motion that we need windfall taxes and the decoupling of gas from renewable energy and oil.  Behind the energy crisis we still have the climate crisis.  To deal with both, quite frankly, we have to move away from the Thatcher and Regan neo-liberalisation that thinks the market will deliver the change.  This is why we are pushing for the renationalisation of the energy market.</p>  <p>  I am glad the motion mentions data centres.  As has been said, they have been much debated in the House.  The real problem is that new data centres being connected to the national grid this year and next year will gobble up a huge amount of the energy we need.  The surge in demand from data centres is wholly unacceptable.  We cannot continue to connect new data centres to the grid.</p>  <p>  LNG goes to the heart of why we should start by saying we do not have a gas supply problem.  The Brits will not cut off Moffat tomorrow.  If a lightning storm struck Moffat then we might get cut off.  Where is the scaremongering coming from?  I believe the hysteria is coming from the fossil fuel energy sector itself which, since the war in Ukraine, has engaged in its own war.  This is a war of disinformation for profits to ensure we lock the planet and this country into new fossil fuel infrastructure for decades.  It is a war against the people because of the price hikes and profiteering.  We do not need LNG, private or public.  What we need is to remember we are witnessing record climate catastrophe at historic levels.  If these are radical ideas then God help Ireland.</p></speech>

We are also facing a climate catastrophe and experiencing the sixth mass extinction event brought about by the unsustainable use of land, water and energy.  These two crises are not unrelated.  In fact, they are two sides of the same coin.  The root cause of both is the capitalist system.  In other words, it is the organisation of our economy and society around profit and maximising profit for the fossil fuel companies in particular, without any regard to people's needs, including people's need to live on a habitable planet.  In dealing with the cost-of-living crisis we need to take measures that simultaneously tackle the climate crisis and avoid the catastrophe that is otherwise coming towards us.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, while there is much in the motion with which we would agree, a big part of its response is to go for a deeper entrenchment and reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure, tying us into more and more years of environmental damage and increasing carbon emissions.  This is not the answer.  Some of the solutions put forward in the motion include acquiring an LNG terminal in either Cork harbour or the Shannon Estuary, repowering the controversial Derrybrien wind farm, and reopening power plants in the midlands to burn biomass, with this biomass sourced from brash through suspending the licensing regime for the thinning and selling of forestry.  It is utter green-washing to suggest that scraping out every last piece of organic material left from felling, which is environmentally damaging in its own right, will somehow represent green energy.  It is destroying material that otherwise would be populated by fauna, filling in some of the destruction left by deforestation.  Using brash to create biomass indicates a desire to leave a completely barren wasteland that would only make it easier for industrial machinery to come back to replant the next forest being grown to cut down.</p>  <p>  The Derrybrien wind farm was built in 2003 without an environmental impact assessment.  Excavation resulted in a landslide that caused extensive environmental damage, severe water pollution, changing the course of a river and killing approximately 50,000 fish, not to mention the impact it had on the everyday lives of locals since.  Calling for an LNG terminal when we have just learned this week that global emission reductions would need to be at least seven times higher to have any hope of staying under 1.5&deg; C warming seems to be the height of contradiction to some sort of environmental benefit.  Instead, the sort of demands we need to see are eco-socialist demands that would reduce energy usage while improving people's lives.  Such measures include free and frequent green public transport that is massively expanded to get cars off the road and bring down our reliance on fossil fuels as a matter of urgency and investment in full retrofitting for all homes in the country.  Let us prioritise the roll-out of attic insulation at zero cost to people, giving them warmer homes and reducing energy use.  Other measures include, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, taking the energy sector out of private ownership and bringing it into public ownership and running it on a not-for-profit basis to provide energy for people and to drive a rapid and just transition.  We should not simply take the relatively minimal measures proposed in terms of data centres.  We should say there will be no more data centres while we are in this crisis.  A total of 14% of our electricity goes to data centres.  We cannot go any further on this.  We need to have a full stop on data centres now.  The way to achieve all of these things is to get out, mobilise and put feet on the streets at 2.30 p.m. on Saturday, 24 September, in Parnell Square.</p></speech>

I was a bit surprised to see the Government has not opposed it.  What is going on here?  Parts of this motion, which I agree 100% with, is all for things the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is totally opposed to.  He is just accepting the motion and he will have it raced and passed through here and do nothing about it.  This is the greatest lazy and <i>laissez-faire</i>way of dealing with this parliamentary system.  This is probably the tenth time in the past year the Government has done this.  The Government's policies are the opposite to what is in the motion, but it accepts it because it does not have the gumption, guts or sense, or the trust in the backbenchers that it will vote with the Government in a vote.  It is afraid of another humiliation and another few people overboard.</p><p>This is the greatest con job that ever hit this country because the Minister said in 2005 that we would have to use all of our natural resources of oil and gas because we were not sure of supplies from Russia and elsewhere.  How did the Minister change so much over the years to follow what I call quite an evil strategy?  He will have people without power in cold and dark in their houses.  Small businesses cannot survive, on top of what happened during Covid  The Government closed all the small businesses and let the big multinationals get bigger.</p><p>What master is the Government serving?  Who is its master?  The Minister could not have changed that much in 14 years.  He recently said he was shocked by this energy crisis.  He knew about it 14 years ago.  I ask the Minister to come clean with us.  I respect his integrity.  What masters are he, An Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, and An T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, serving?  The global interests.  </p><p>There is another big conference coming up on the 21 September and more drastic and draconian decisions will be made with regard to human life and this planet.  It is not anything to do with climate change.  It is to do with control and greed and making big businesses bigger and big chequebooks for bigger people.  That is what it is.  The Minister should come clean with the people.  Has it taken him 14 years to find out that we will have an energy crisis?  His deliberate policies to penalise, perish and humiliate the Irish people are disgraceful.</p></speech>

It is an absolute disgrace.  Indeed the sense that people are getting is that our entire population has been taken hostage by a green hysteria and a demented level of ideological ruthlessness that is not grounded in any sense of proportion or rationality.  It is wonderful to hear that many of those who were jumping up and down saying that green policies were not going far enough have now changed their tunes.  It is grea.</p>  <p>  It is also wonderful to see that people are copping on to this nonsense and that many of our turf cutters are back on the bogs where they should have been left all along.  We are not listening to any more of the nonsense any longer in rural Ireland.  If the lights go out this winter, the Minister should seriously think of resigning because businesses, households and working families cannot cope, nor should they have to, with these struggles because of the Minister's inadequacy and lack of ability to intervene with the electricity companies which are charging too much for bills.  We know that and we see it.</p>  <p>  I have met publicans who have seen their unit rate trebling.  I have met farmers who have seen their bills go from &euro;400 to almost &euro;1,600.  That is not sustainable.  The Minister is responsible for this.  He must intervene.  I call on him to do so.  If he cannot do so, then maybe he should resign.  We would all breath a sigh of relief in rural Ireland because we are fed up.  We have had enough of the nonsense.  The so-called assurances provided by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and this hapless and hopeless Government are dating so badly that they are beyond worthless.  Nobody believes a word and there will be no comfort in the Minister's promises when bills of several thousand of euro drop through the inbox or on to the mat of many homes that are struggling to survive.</p>  <p>  Instead of adopting even an interim approach with respect to fossil fuels and liquefied natural gas, LNG, this Government has decided to push ahead with unworkable, unsustainable and unforgivable policies that are damning our people to a perilous few years and for what?  To reach some ludicrous international targets that have more in common with the sacrifices that a cult would demand, rather than taking any rational and proportional propose or using common sense.  Where has common sense gone?  Obviously it is not too common.  People and rural Ireland have had enough of this nonsense.</p></speech>

I see the Minister's party colleagues are on radio saying that they believe the peat plants should be opened up again to provide power for the people who put them here to protect them.  We all want to protect the environment and the universe but we put our people first and we work for the future.  What the Minister has done to the people of Ireland is nothing but criminal.  What his party has done to people of Ireland and the hardship it will put them through is nothing but criminal.  Who pays the most?  It is the people without infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The reason the Minister cannot understand this is that he is coming from the place he lives that has infrastructure.  Now people in the outer parts of Dublin are saying that they do not have the infrastructure either.  He has caused inflation by all the different things he has done such as the insulation grants which are based on fossil fuels.  He brought out a grant and it was eaten up by rising costs at a time when we needed to make sure that people were looked after.</p>  <p>  The Government closed down Bord na M&oacute;na and peat.  What has it done now?  It is burning coal to keep the lights on.  That is the reality because there is no infrastructure here.  What it has been telling the people is that it will help them, it will reduce the VAT here and it will give them reductions.  I have bills here going back to 2020.  The unit costs and standard charges have gone up.  What the Government forgot to mention to the people when it said it was giving money off and would help them was that as standard charges and PSO levies went up, it would charge the VAT on top of that.  The Government's reduction is on the increase.  It has actually given no reduction.  The standard charges have gone up.  Its VAT intake is still higher with what it is giving back from 2020 to 2021 to 2021.  I have it all here.  The Government has actually given nothing back.  Its intake is the same.</p>  <p>  I brought up Fossett's Circus previously and I must compliment it.  Due to the publicity it got from that, it contacted me during the week.  Would the Minister believe that it has given a couple of hundred tickets for a charity night in Limerick because of its name being put out there?  The one thing people said to me was that the Minister was not fit to be in that circus and he was not fit to be here.</p></speech>

I thank the Regional Group for bringing this motion forward which I support.  A few corrections need to be made to what was said by speakers earlier who would not have done much homework.  In 1997, Derrybrien, under planning number 973470, did a full environmental impact survey, EIS.  It was because Ireland did not transpose the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive that it was brought to court later on.  We must get the facts right.  When planning was being sought, the people looking for the planning did everything by the book.</p>  <p>  When the slippage happened, it was nothing to do with the planning, for anyone who understands construction.  It was where stuff was piled on top of stuff, and which never should have been.  That was a mistake.  No one will deny that, but the record needs to be clarified and put right.  If the Minister has liathr&oacute;id&iacute;, he will turn around and get Derrybrien opened regardless of European courts or any other court.  I hear everybody on about renewable energy.  This is an opportunity for that, and straight away.</p> <p>In the current energy crisis we have seen EU policy has failed, to be quite frank.  A state needs to look after health, energy and water.  Those are three things and to be honest, given the madness going on in Europe with this climate agenda that is being pushed, within five years we could be without energy and without food.  That is a big worry with the madness that is happening at the moment.</p> <p> Let us look at what we can do.  The first thing we must do, which the Minister has not looked at yet, is hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO.  There is HVO coming across from England right now and being used in homes.  It is cutting the emissions by 90%.  You change only a small part of the boiler.  There are machines that are working on HVO.  What has the EU done?  It has banned HVO coming from America, for whatever reason.  If the Minister wants a quick win on his so-called climate agenda, HVO is a win for him.  On top of that, the ESB is playing every side of this fence at the moment.  There is Lanesborough and there is Shannonbridge.  I have talked to people in the ESB who have reliably informed me there are boilers that are needed and a few other bits required but the main infrastructure is there.  Within six to eight weeks they could be up and running, according to people in the ESB who would know.  We are exporting biomass at the moment, just in case people do not know, and we could have used it there.  I am not saying we should use it forever but we need to take ourselves out of the storm we are in at the moment.  There is obviously a quick win in LNG.  We should do as the rest of Europe is and have a store for that as well.  We should decide now that we are not going to listen to the civil servants who have brought us down these roads for years, that we are going to crack the whip and that above all that we are not going to listen to this agenda that has come out of Europe, which Europe now admits has failed and failed miserably.</p> <p> Out there at the moment and in the budget the Government is bringing in, the Government talks about how it is going to look after the most vulnerable; and rightly so.  There is the fuel allowance and all that, which we welcome.  However, let us be very clear on this.  There is a cohort of people in what I call middle Ireland who are above all these thresholds.  You could say they are the people on between &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 and their tongues are out.  They are paying mortgages, they have kids going to school and they have to drive to work in rural Ireland, in case the Minister did not know.  These people are struggling and struggling badly.  The Government needs to ensure those people are looked after.  On top of that, we will have mass unemployment if the Government does not bring in a package for businesses so they can get solar panels and the like and puts money in their pockets to pay the cost of energy at the moment.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily agree with the Minister on many points but I am willing to accept he sincerely holds those viewpoints and thank him for coming into the D&aacute;il to debate this and other issues, because many Ministers do not.  They all should do but they do not.  It is important we debate.  I have debated some of these issues with the Minister before.</p>  <p>  There are obviously many good ideas in this motion for how we can increase energy supply in the short term.  The Government's response, and indeed Sinn F&eacute;in's response, to the humongous rise in energy costs is a very short-term approach, whether it is a price cap to run until the spring of next year or universal credits that will end after the same period.  However, I have not heard anybody address how we are going to meet the energy demands of this State in the medium to long term.  I greatly look forward, as I am sure the Minister does, to the offshore wind energy of the Atlantic being harnessed but that technology is not there yet.  Nobody is suggesting we are going to do that in the short term.  We can have offshore wind farms off the east coast of Ireland but nobody is suggesting we will be turning wind energy into hydrogen in the short term anywhere in Ireland.  How then are we going to meet those demands?</p>  <p>  One of the first acts of this State was to guarantee energy security.  I am sure the Minister is keenly aware of the project that was Ardnacrusha.  In the 1980s, the State boldly moved forward and built a coal power plant.  Of course, we now know nobody wants to continue with that into the long term but it was an attempt to meet the demands of this State.  I have heard nobody explain how we are going to meet the demands now.  I have heard people ruling out stuff.  The Minister has ruled out an LNG base.  Like him, I do not want to see fracked gas coming to Ireland but we must have gas storage, especially if our only source of energy when the wind is not blowing is going to be gas power.  The gas we are not getting on boats is going to have to come through the United Kingdom, which has no requirement to treat us equally in the event of a shortage since it left the EU.  I have heard the Minister rule out nuclear.  The last time he was in government, he brought nuclear.  I accept nuclear is not cheap but there is no cheap energy source available to us now.  It is true that wind energy is cheap but it is only available to us when the wind is blowing.  How are we going to fuel our industries, hospitals and schools?  Indeed, how are we going to fuel this Parliament, for what it is worth to fuel it or keeping the lights on in?  It is not worth keeping the lights on here if we cannot tell the Irish people how we are going to provide energy.  If the first men and women who sat in this D&aacute;il after Irish independence could clearly tell people how they were going to power the State and we cannot then we do not deserve to keep the lights on in here.  I am asking the Minister to tell us how we will in the medium to long term.  I congratulate the Regional Group on its proposals but they are a stopgap, by their nature.  In the longer term, how will we fuel this State?  Some of the Minister's colleagues are happy to import nuclear energy but not happy at all to discuss that we would generate our own and have a degree of self-sufficiency and energy security.  I am not a proponent of nuclear energy but we must be realistic and examine all the options available to us.</p></speech>

The consenting of those will come, subject to the consent being approved, this month.  They will go to auction this year, they will go to planning next year and into construction once out of that planning process.  This is what every country in north-west Europe is investing in.  This is the reality.  This is where all the money is going.  We had a meeting on Monday of north-west European energy ministers.  We did a joint declaration, which included Germany, France, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.  The UK is actually ahead of all the others, but this is the future.  We are a country whose sea area is seven times our land area and it is the windiest part of the world.  It is absolutely achievable.  It will take huge effort and organisation but it is equivalent to Ardnacrusha; it is the Ardnacrusha of our day.  It is a similar moment where we rely on our resources and our capability, and there is real capability.  We heard from various people at the conference on Monday.  An Irish company called Mainstream is one of the biggest developers in UK waters.  That company is actually doing it.  The ESB is doing it too at scale, so we have real ability.</p></speech>

The advantage of this power supply is that we can convert it through electrolysis, a working mechanism, into hydrogen and ammonia which gives us the storage and transport and other fuels that can power our country.

To answer some of the Deputies who asked earlier if we will see the development of photovoltaics, PV, absolutely, yes, and the changes to the planning system which make it easier for Irish households, farmers, schools and businesses to apply PV.  That is happening right across the country.</p>  <p>  To answer a direct question from Deputy Bacik or Deputy Whitmore, this month we will start the process of introducing that scheme for the most vulnerable households to give them power in this difficult and vulnerable time.  Also to answer one of the Deputies who asked, on the commitment made this July in respect of anaerobic digestion, we will introduce the mechanisms where that becomes a new income for farmers and for us a new source of security.  That too is part of the mix.  It can provide some 15% of our gas needs by 2030.  We will deliver that as every other European country has done.  It is not rocket science.  We just need the political commitment here to make it happen.  My experience is that the Irish farming community knows that is where future income is coming from.  That is something where they can be part of this energy future.</p>  <p>  On secure power, yes, we have a tight situation in our electricity markets primarily because the auction in 2019 did not deliver some of the backup generation we need.  We are resolving that by procuring and purchasing the capacity that did not come through in that 2019 auction.  Yes, we will need storage as part of a balancing system.  We will publish the CEPA report on Monday which outlines the options and I think it will show, and I certainly have the view, that this should be State-led and not led by corporate interests.  We can do that in a way that gives us security but does not blow our carbon budgets and is future-proofed and able to take and use that hydrogen power which is coming this decade.  That is why the Dutch Minister was in Cork on Tuesday signing an agreement with the Port of Cork.  They believe this is deliverable and can happen.  That is why the German Government is similarly signing memorandums of understanding with us that it is the future and they want to be part of it with Ireland.</p>  <p>  On affordability, this challenge at the moment is more significant than the other two immediately for our people by a factor of ten.  We are exposed because energy is being used as a weapon of war by Putin.  Every Deputy in this House has the interests of the Irish people at heart when we address that challenge.  We are under attack and this Government will defend our country and our people to the best of our ability.</p></speech>

One of the advantages of being in the EU is that we get to benchmark ourselves against the other countries on the Continent.  Sometimes we are ahead, sometimes we are behind.  One glaring anomaly that stands out is that this country of all the 27 has no strategic gas reserve storage facility and no strategic gas reserve.  It is a major red flag and we should have alarm bells ringing in all our ears.  A second advantage of being in the EU is that from time to time we get good Directives that make a lot of sense.  They are binding.  We got a good Directive about 25 years ago when Ireland like all the member states was told to set up a National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, and keep a minimum of 90 days' oil reserves in the country for a crisis.  It was set up 25 years ago and we now have hundreds of millions of euro worth of oil in reserve.  The moral of the story for me is that if we are compelled and obliged to do something, we will.  That is what happened from an oil perspective.  However, if we are not obliged, as we are not in respect of gas, we do not do it.  That is a major concern.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister is Minister for Transport, officially.  He is also Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I do not envy his portfolio.  I think it is too large and too broad.  Correct me if I am wrong but I do not think we have a dedicated Minister for energy.  There is no Cabinet Minister or junior Minister with energy in his or her title.  We have no Department of energy, for instance.  It is no wonder we are in this blind spot.  It is no wonder we are now reaping a bitter harvest.  The motion is not about complaining or being negative, it is actually quite the opposite.  We are trying to encourage the country to be ambitious, bold and daring.</p> <p>Deputy McNamara quite rightly pointed out Ardnacrusha.  I know we have had the conversation before that this country needs a second Ardnacrusha moment.  However, we do not even need to go back to 1928.  We can go as far as 1940, when our grandparents, in my own constituency, built Pollaphuca.  They evacuated, rehoused and compensated an entire village.  They flooded 5,500 acres of land.  They built a brand new artificial lake and a mighty hydroelectric dam in Pollaphuca that is still giving off renewable energy.  I am not for a minute suggesting that we should repeat and do exactly what our grandparents did.  However, I am suggesting and, indeed, we are all recommending, that we match the scale of their ambition, because that is what is required.  </p> <p> I will focus on three specific recommendations.  First, we need a gas reserve facility.  I spent many days and nights on the Kinsale Head gas field when there were gas platforms over the alpha and bravo caverns.  The caverns work.  Up to 2017, they were buying gas in the summer when it was cheap, pumping it into the caverns and extracting it and selling it on the market in winter when the gas was expensive.  The concept is sound and makes sense.  </p> <p> Second, I refer to liquified natural gas, LNG.  I appreciate the Minister and his party have concerns about LNG but I think those concerns are surmountable.  We can put in check and quality control mechanisms to ensure that it is not shale or fracked gas.  I do not care, and I do not think any of my colleagues care, whether the gas comes in by ship or by pipeline.  It is still gas.  It is about the quality of the gas; not how it arrives on the shore.</p> <p> Third, our big concern is related to offshore wind.  I was fortunate to get a ferry across the Irish Sea this summer and I saw with my own eyes that we only have seven offshore wind turbines, and they were built 20 years ago.  When they were built, it was ambitious.  It was one of the biggest wind farms offshore in the world.  However, Ireland has not added a single offshore wind turbine in the past 20 years.  That reflects very poorly on successive Governments.  </p> <p> In summary, we are calling for Ireland to be ambitious.  We rightly admire our grandparents, who built Pollaphuca, and our great-grandparents, who built Ardnacrusha.  We believe that the best way to honour their memory is to seek to emulate them.  We think it is possible and we should do it.  We should match their scale and ambition.  I am glad that the Government is accepting this motion.  However, we certainly insist, recommend and focus on the fact that we need immediate and urgent implementation.  A very good statement of intent would be to dedicate an energy minister at Cabinet.  It has to be done immediately &ndash; as soon as possible &ndash; but certainly before 15 December when the reshuffle takes place.</p></speech>

I also want to thank all my colleagues in the Regional Group for the work that went into this.  In addition, want to acknowledge the work that Deputy Naughten, who is not here today, put into it, as well as Ms C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh in our office.</p>  <p>  Some people get passionate about things we believe in.  I believe that we put much effort into tabling a Private Members&rsquo; motion that sets out things that can be done in the short, medium and long term.  We all have ambition but it has to be turned into reality.  We can and need to do that as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  The fact that the Government is accepting our motion and is not tabling any amendment to it reflects the fact that the motion is reasonable, practical and that things can be done.  As for what needs to happen, a mindset change is required.  It is relation to, for instance, Derrybrien.  It is what we can do there, as opposed to how we cannot do something.  As legislators, it is incumbent on us to make sure that we do something there to make sure that in the interim, as an emergency measure, that resource, which is green energy, is brought back into production in the short term.  We have capacity and potential in the two power stations to convert them to biomass.  There are practical things but they will not get done as quickly as Derrybrien.  My understanding is that Derrybrien has to be switched on again but it needs a legal footing to do that.  This is where we should do that.  We did many things during Covid, so I think we should be able to do this.  </p>  <p>  For our future and the future of foreign direct investment, FDI, in this country, we need to demonstrate that we have the capability of having an energy security that matches any place else in the world.  Heretofore, FDI companies were looking at our education, workforce and reliability.  However, because of what is happening at the moment, I think there is a new element in the equation of where people are deciding to locate, namely, energy supply.  It is important for us to make sure that we remain as best in the world in terms of attractiveness for foreign direct investment.</p>  <p>  A shop in Roscommon had an ESB bill of more than &euro;6,000.  It was reported in the news yesterday.  It is not fake news; it is real.  Basically, it has now gone up.  Over the year, it will cost an additional &euro;148,000 to retain a small retail shop employing 35 people, some on part-time and some on full-time.  That is in a rural area.  That is the life and blood of rural Ireland.  We cannot let that type of situation just be followed by policies and things we are talking about into the future.  We need to make sure that we actually account for ourselves.</p>  <p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue raised the issue of standing charges with the ESB and PSO levy charges.  In fact, what is happening is there is more tax taken out of the ESB, even though we gave a little rebate back that cost &euro;2.5 million.  We cannot be taking a step forward and one or two steps back.  The country needs to see confidence coming back into what we are doing.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister mentioned offshore energy and how that will develop and he spoke about the medium term.  I agree with him.  Coming from a construction background, I would love to see the programme by which that will work, whether a monthly or even a quarterly basis.  We will say what day we are turning on the switch so that we can look out from Galway Bay and see the turbines twisting.  </p>  <p>  That is the future.  However, right now we have a problem.  I would offer this Private Members&rsquo; motion as a framework by which we get resolutions to what is out there.  We cannot keep saying, &ldquo;No, we cannot do this or that.&rdquo;  We have to make sure that we take immediate measures in order that people will see that we are on a course and trajectory where we will get to the day when we will have energy security and green energy.  We will be producing it ourselves from our own resources, as the Minister said.  I commend him on that vision.  However, in order to get that vision enacted and make it a reality, we need to work together.  The debate is finished this evening, but that is it.  I hope that this document is on the Minister&rsquo;s officials desks in order that they can get working on what is needed to be done on it.  That is the spirit in which we have offered it and I hope that is the spirit in which the Minister has accepted it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500061#NNN00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I am happy to have the opportunity to outline the Bill before the D&aacute;il.  The purpose of the Bill is to separate Irish Water, also known as Uisce &Eacute;ireann, from its parent company, Ervia, and establish it as a stand-alone national authority for water services.  The Bill delivers on the programme for Government commitment to retain Irish Water in public ownership as a national stand-alone regulated utility.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the majority shareholding Minister for Ervia, which delivers strategic national infrastructure in the areas of gas and water through its subsidiaries Gas Networks Ireland and Irish Water.  The establishment of two separate State companies to operate the gas network and develop our water services provides the optimal solution to meet the future challenges of decarbonising our energy supply and modernising our water services.  The decision to separate Irish Water from the Ervia group is in the best strategic interest of the water services and gas networks businesses.</p>  <p>  Following legal separation, the remaining Ervia-Gas Networks Ireland business will predominantly, both in terms of activities and revenue, be the operation, maintenance and development of the gas networks and the interconnectors that are in its ownership.  Separately, my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is developing legislation to provide for the integration of Ervia with its subsidiary, Gas Networks Ireland, so as to become a single entity, namely, Gas Networks Ireland.  That legislation will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</p>  <p>  The Bill is about separating Irish Water, the subsidiary, from its parent, Ervia.  It does not deal with the transformation process and the movement of local authority services staff to Irish Water.  That is a separate and distinct policy process being progressed in parallel.  The 2021 policy paper on water sector transformation charts the course for completing the institutional reform programme by fully integrating water operations within the organisational structure of Irish Water.  The transformation of Irish Water into the publicly owned national water services authority has the potential to create new jobs and training programmes.  The framework for future delivery of water services identified through the engagement at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which concluded on 24 June 2022 will now enable Irish Water to work in conjunction with local authorities and current water services staff to complete the integration of public water services into its own organisational structure by 2026.</p>  <p>  The matter of a referendum on water will continue to be considered in conjunction with any anticipated referendum on housing arising from the deliberations of the Commission on Housing.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides that Irish Water will be known only as Uisce &Eacute;ireann and it outlines the character of Uisce &Eacute;ireann - the national authority for water services.  The Bill provides for a change in the share ownership arrangements such that the shares in Uisce &Eacute;ireann are held by both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, similar to the approach for other State-owned bodies.  A new non-executive board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and its chief executive are now being prescribed in primary legislation rather than in the constitution of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The Bill provides for enhanced accountability and auditing arrangements such that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be subject to a dual audit both by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its commercial statutory auditor under the Companies Acts.  It also provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Bill removes Ervia's functions relating to water services.  Provisions for the transfer from Ervia to Uisce &Eacute;ireann of those staff, rights and liabilities, contracts and records which relate to functions of Uisce &Eacute;ireann are also included.</p>  <p>  I will now elaborate on the provisions of the Bill.  It is a relatively short Bill comprising three Parts, 30 sections and one Schedule.  It is largely a technical Bill.</p>  <p>  Part 1, covering sections 1 to 4, inclusive, addresses preliminary and general matters.  These include the Title of the Bill, arrangements for bringing the Bill into operation and standard provisions.  It also includes, in section 4, specific provisions of existing legislation that are being repealed so as to facilitate the separation of Irish Water from Ervia.  The primary legislation governing the establishment of Irish Water are the Water Services Act 2013 and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, with other water services Acts being also relevant.</p>  <p>  Part 2, which takes in sections 5 to 26, inclusive, will provide for the reorganisation of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  This is the most substantive part of the Bill and it provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will no longer be a subsidiary of Ervia.  Section 5 provides for Irish Water's name change to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Section 6 provides that Irish Water will cease to be a subsidiary of Ervia and that the existing shares will be cancelled.  When Irish Water was established in 2013 as a subsidiary of Ervia, shares were vested in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Minister for Finance and Ervia, and it is these shares that are now being cancelled.</p>  <p>  Section 9 provides that the new shareholding arrangements, such as the new shares in Uisce &Eacute;ireann, are issued to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There will be no change to the Water Services Act 2014, which prevents a current or future Government from initiating any legislative proposals that would seek to transfer Irish Water from public ownership unless such proposals are first approved by a majority vote of the Irish people in a national plebiscite.  Section 9 also outlines the character of Uisce &Eacute;ireann as the national authority for water services, with responsibility for the functions assigned to it by or under the Water Services Acts 2007-22.</p>  <p>  Sections 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 contain technical amendments relating to the functions of Ervia which are being removed.</p>  <p>  Section 11 provides for the appointment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann's non-executive board and its chief executive.  These provisions are now prescribed in primary legislation rather than in Uisce &Eacute;ireann's constitution, so as to enhance transparency and accountability and to reflect the approach in other State-owned bodies.  The chairperson and other Uisce &Eacute;ireann board members will be appointed by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  One director will be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Uisce &Eacute;ireann board will have no more than ten directors, including its chairperson and chief executive officer, serving for a period of five years, with a possibility of reappointment for one more term.  Each director may serve a maximum of two terms.  Since 1 January 2022, Irish Water has largely been operating as a separate stand-alone utility while remaining subject to overall governance by the Ervia board.  The Ervia board will continue to remain the ultimate governing authority for Irish Water until the enactment and commencement of the Bill, which we hope to achieve by 1 January 2023.  At that time, the Uisce &Eacute;ireann board will be the governing authority.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, intends to appoint Mr. Tony Keohane as the chairperson designate of the board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Keohane is currently the chairperson of the Ervia board, a role that he has held since he was appointed in July 2016 following the independent competitive process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service at the time.  On separation, Mr. Keohane will cease to be the chairperson of Ervia and he will be appointed as chairperson of the enduring Uisce &Eacute;ireann board for the remainder of his current term of appointment, that is, until 21 June 2024.  This appointment is critical as the new Uisce &Eacute;ireann board transitions from being governed by its parent, the Ervia board, to being a fully independent board.  Mr. Keohane has gained significant experience of being chairperson of the Ervia board and involved in governing the outgoing executive Irish Water board.  His experience will be essential in ensuring continuity at a time when Uisce &Eacute;ireann is undergoing significant changes, including the separation and the transformation process.  He is best placed to steer the Uisce &Eacute;ireann board on its new course.  In accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, Mr. Keohane will make himself available to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to discuss the approach that he will take to his role as chairperson and his views about the future contribution of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Arrangements are currently under way to appoint a new Ervia chairperson through an independent competitive process being undertaken by the Public Appointments Service.</p>  <p>  Similar to the chairperson, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, also intends appointing some other existing Ervia board members to the enduring Uisce &Eacute;ireann board on separation.  A public appointment process is already under way to identify candidates to fill vacancies on both the Uisce &Eacute;ireann and Ervia boards.  It is intended that both boards will include members with the appropriate skills and competencies necessary, as well as overall compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and its annexe on gender balance, diversity and inclusion.  This will ensure a smooth transition for the new board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The appointment of the current chief executive officer of Irish Water is prescribed in Irish Water's constitution, whereas section 11 of the Bill provides for such an appointment in the future.</p> <p>Since 1 January 2022 Niall Gleeson has been the CEO of Irish Water.  He will continue as CEO and <i>ex officio </i>director of Uisce &Eacute;ireann for the duration of his appointment.  The Bill provides that future CEO appointments will be made by the board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann with the consent of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Terms and conditions of such appointments will be determined by the board with the approval of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br/><br/>Sections 14 to 16 provide for enhanced accountability and auditing arrangements for Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Section 14 deals with the final accounts and annual report of Uisce &Eacute;ireann as a subsidiary of Ervia in circumstances where the appointed day is not 1 January 2023.  Section 15 inserts provisions on Uisce &Eacute;ireann's accounts and annual report after the appointed day when Uisce &Eacute;ireann will no longer be a subsidiary of Ervia.  Section 16 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann's CEO and chairperson will be nominated persons to give evidence to the committee.<br/><br/>The effects of these sections are that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will in the future be subject to a dual audit by both the Comptroller and Auditor General and its commercial statutory auditor under the Companies Acts and that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  This dual role arises due to the provisions of the company's legislation, Irish Water's governing legislation and the Comptroller and Auditor General's legislation.  The heightened levels of accountability and transparency applying to Uisce &Eacute;ireann are commensurate with the level of Exchequer funding of the company.  In view of the introduction of complex accountability and auditing arrangements for Irish Water the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is anxious to ensure that the legal separation takes effect on 1 January 2023.<br/><br/>Sections 17 to 22 are further technical amendments removing Ervia's functions under the Water Services Act.  In order to establish Uisce &Eacute;ireann as a stand-alone company certain staff, records, rights and liabilities must transfer from Ervia to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Since 1 January 2022 Irish Water has largely been operating as a separate stand-alone utility while remaining subject to overall governance by the Ervia board.  This operational separation included the transfer and assignment of employees from Ervia to Irish Water with the full transfer to be completed on legal separation as well as the separation of the existing IT applications, integrations, data, infrastructure and networks as well as contracts and licensing arrangements.  These steps effectively achieve the incorporation of all staff and all business support services together with the financial accounting obligations related hitherto to the Irish Water business directly thus enabling it to become operationally independent of Ervia to facilitate a smooth transition to Uisce &Eacute;ireann becoming a stand-alone entity.  Separation and novation of framework agreements and contracts are expected to be completed by the end of 2022.<br/><br/>The Bill makes the necessary provisions for a smooth transfer through the provisions in sections 23 through to 26.  Section 23 provides for the transfer of certain Ervia staff designated by the chief executive to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It protects the terms and conditions of service of the staff transferred.  Section 24 provides for the transfer of rights and liabilities from Ervia to Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the preservation of contracts.  Section 25 transfers liability from Ervia to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Once Ervia and Uisce &Eacute;ireann are legally separated, Ervia will no longer be liable for legal proceedings relating to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Section 26 provides for the transfer of relevant records from Ervia to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  In the case of joint records that relate to both Ervia and Uisce &Eacute;ireann, Ervia will be required at Uisce &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s request to transfer a copy of that record.  To provide for surety for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, the Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations in relation to the transfer of records.  Ervia and Uisce &Eacute;ireann are in the process of drafting appropriate data sharing agreements that meet GDPR requirements.<br/><br/>Part 3 which takes in sections 27 to 30 and the Schedule, inclusive, is the final part of the Bill.  This part deals with consequential amendments to other legislation.  Sections 27, 28 and 29 contain technical amendments to the Water Services Acts so as to reflect the end of Ervia&rsquo;s role relating to water services and the change in ministerial shareholding of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Section 30 and the Schedule provide amendments to 11 enactments in order to reference Uisce &Eacute;ireann by its own name rather than being referenced as a subsidiary of Ervia.<br/><br/>I am thankful to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny that was afforded to the general scheme of the Bill in September 2021.  I am glad to say the majority of the recommendations set out in the committee's report are reflected in this Bill.  Since 2013 Irish Water has carried out its water services functions under the umbrella of its parent company, Ervia.  This Bill allows Irish Water &ndash; Uisce &Eacute;ireann &ndash; to function as a stand-alone national authority for water services.<br/><br/>I look forward to Deputies' contributions and the progress of the Bill through the Houses.</p></speech>

When the Right to Water movement was campaigning against the then Fine Gael-Labour Government's attempts to privatise our water services one of the many concerns we had at that time was the decision of that Government to locate the water utility in Ervia.  In fact the view at the time was Ervia being the most commercialised of the then Government's State companies it would be the ideal place to frame the development of the emerging water utility in a way that would make it most conducive to privatisation.  It is with some degree of satisfaction for many of us, when we heard former Deputy Eoghan Murphy a number of years ago announce the eventual separation of the utility from Ervia.  It caused significant consternation in Ervia and indeed among some of the trade unions because they had not been consulted.  However, as many of us have long argued if there is to be a stand-alone public utility managing the essential resource of public water, a stand-alone non-commercial publicly-owned entity is the best possible model.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is right, we did conduct pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is probably not accurate to say the majority of our recommendations are in the Bill because we only made three recommendations.  One of those three recommendations is in the Bill.  I will go through them in a moment.  While I have a wider set of concerns that I am going to raise during my shared time, Sinn F&eacute;in will not be opposing this legislation.</p>  <p>  One of the recommendations from our committee was that members of the board would be appointed through the public appointments service.  That is not explicitly required in the Bill.  It has been the practice of the current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to use the Public Appointments Service for most board appointments to date.  The difficulty is of course that if it is not in the legislation it is not legally required.  Therefore, either this Minister or a future Minister could choose otherwise and that is a mistake which the Government should reconsider on Report Stage.  I welcome the fact that the chief executive and chairperson of the utility will be held as accountable persons for the purpose of attending the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is welcome.</p>  <p>  The third recommendation we made was that in parallel with the publication of the Bill the Minister would publish an updated statement on the outcome or the negotiations between workers and their unions, the County and City Management Association, CCMA, the Department and Ervia on the Workplace Relations Commission talks.  While some of that documentation has been published particularly the industrial relations component of it, Document No. 2 which deals with the wider public policy issues which many of us are concerned about has not been published.  Of course it is in wide circulation.  I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, to ask his officials to put it up on the website because then it would be available to everybody.  In fact the absence of the publication of that document in an updated statement from the Minister of State is in my view disappointing.</p>  <p>  In regard to those wider issues, while the separation of the utility from Ervia in itself is not a problem, it is clearly part of what the Government calls the transition to a single water utility.  It is required under the current plan and it was motivated and provoked by that.  Therefore it is proper that this House has a discussion on the outcome of those Workplace Relations Commission negotiations and in particular how that could impact on public policy concerns in regard to delivery of domestic drinking water and wastewater and related matters.  We have been following that process very closely in the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We have held a number of hearings both in the last D&aacute;il and this, listening to what the trade unions, Ervia, Irish Water and the CCMA may have had to say about the matter.  During all of that time and to the present, our position has been as follows.  It is not our business as a political party to interfere in the industrial relations negotiations between workers and their trade union representatives and the employer.</p> <p>Those are therefore matters for the participants to those talks and they can make their views known on that very clearly.  We welcome the fact there are no involuntary transfers required under that agreement and that there are no compulsory redundancies.  That is a commitment that was given by the previous Minister and this Minister, and they have been true to their word.  We are conscious that there has been a very significant criticism of those aspects of the deal which deal with workers' terms and conditions, some of which we have seen in the media recently.</p> <p> One of the particular concerns of those workers is a genuinely held belief that for those workers who opt to remain in the local authorities that their full terms and conditions as they are currently experiencing them will not necessarily translate if they remain or are redeployed elsewhere.  If that is not the case, it would be very helpful for the Minister to clarify that today or at a later stage, because that is obviously a very important piece of information for anybody considering the option of transfer or of remaining.</p> <p> The biggest concern of those workers who have been raising their voices in recent weeks has been a lack of clarity around the referendum.  The Minister confirmed once again that no Government decision has been made.  We do not even know if the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage intends to bring forward a memo to Cabinet on the holding of a referendum this year and that is one of the fundamental flaws in document No. 2, the unpublished document that has come out of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view is very clear.  We are completely convinced of the merits of holding a referendum as soon as possible to enshrine public ownership of our water system, its ownership, management and investment, in public hands.</p> <p> If the Government proposes such a referendum and works with us, either on the wording proposed by Deputy Joan Collins and endorsed by a majority this House as far back as 2016, or on an improved wording, we will be happy to campaign alongside it on that.  However, I am a sceptic as to whether or not this Government will agree to hold a referendum on the right to housing in the Constitution, where such a thing was recommended by the Housing Commission, or indeed on public ownership of water but we will wait to see what happens.</p> <p> We also have a strong concern with the lack of clarity in document No. 2 on the legal status of the entity.  It does appear that it will be public but it is not sure if is commercial or non-commercial, or of what the standing of future employees of that utility will be, and whether they will have the same rights, entitlements and terms and conditions of existing Irish Water workers, or workers who may transfer from local authorities to the new single utility at a later stage.  Again, clarity on that from the Minister would be helpful.</p> <p> There is also the enormous concern once again of the hollowing out of services provided by our local authorities.  There were eminently sensible proposals by SIPTU during the course of the WRC negotiations to have what it called a National Transport Authority-type arrangement where big strategic cross-local authority boundaries of water infrastructure issues would be dealt with by the utility, but there would be a continued responsibility for some levels of local water services provision remaining within the local authority.  That is obviously not the outcome of the WRC talks but there is still the question of whether the staff employed by the new utility will have a continued footprint in the offices and the depots of the local authorities.  That would be eminently valuable.  People have an affinity and a local connection with the local authority.  They know who to ring and who to talk to.  Particularly, where things go wrong, water services employees while under a service-line agreement with Irish Water are employed by the local authorities and know the lay of the land.  They have the local, historical and institutional memory which is absolutely vital.  Therefore, while there are again some ambiguous commitments in document No. 2, the future relationship between the single utility and the local authorities is not yet clear and the sooner that we have clarity from the Minister on that, the better it is for all of us.</p> <p> I say the following to the Minister.  There is nothing offensive in this legislation and there is certainly nothing that I would object to in the text as is proposed.  Those wider issues, however, are completely crucial and the sooner the Minister can publish that document and perhaps even clarify aspects of that document for water services workers and local authorities, but also for citizens and residents of the State who depend on water services as provided, the better for all of us.</p> <p> To conclude, Sinn F&eacute;in remains as committed today as we were in 2013 and 2014 to the core principles of the Right2Water movement.  We believe that the fact that that movement won the core elements of that campaign were very important.  We do not have domestic meter water charges and that is a good thing.  Water should be free at the point of access and funded through general taxation and low interest Government borrowing.  That is the best route to ensuring that we have and continue to have zero water poverty, something which is the envy of most European countries.</p> <p> We are also completely convinced of the need to ensure that any utility is publicly owned, publicly controlled and accountable, not just to the Minister and the Government, but to Members of this House and to the Oireachtas committee.  So long as those principles are enshrined, along with the referendum and a non-commercial semi-State company with full protection for all current and future workers, with a continued footprint of water services personnel in a local authorities in local government, then I believe we can have a significant improvement in services.</p> <p> I look forward to any future clarification from the Minister.  We will deal with some technical elements of the Bill, which need further teasing out on Committee Stage, but at this point we are happy to support the proposition as tabled today.</p></speech>

I support the comments made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I will focus my comments, from my perspective as environment spokesperson and someone living in County Meath, on the importance of Uisce &Eacute;ireann having a programme of work and seeking to deliver on that programme of work for communities and for our environment because we know that we have very particular challenges in infrastructure deficit in water and wastewater.  That has an impact on planning and there is a great need to ensure there is alignment between county development plans and critical infrastructure priority programmes for water and wastewater, among other things.  We are not there and it is a problem.  </p>  <p>  We see where the deficit or lag in delivery of water and wastewater infrastructure has an impact on development.  I am someone who supports compact growth and transport-led development but where it does not happen or happens poorly, it is very problematic for people who have to live with it.</p>  <p>  I will mention a number of projects in my own county that are at various stages of development and progress.  In Ratoath, with a population that has seen very significant growth over recent years, the Windmill Hill reservoir and the replacement of the existing water mains needs to be a major priority.  I would encourage the Minister, Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the Department to ensure that it is delivered as a priority.  It is working its way through the system.  We have had very many water outages in recent times because the infrastructure is literally creaking at the seams and needs to be replaced and upgraded.  I welcome that there is a commitment in regard to investment but we need to fast-track these projects and have them delivered.</p>  <p>  This is similarly the case with Stamullen wastewater treatment plant and Kells wastewater treatment plant.  That is an area I know and I commend the local angling community, the custodians of the water network, who do such great work as they are the first people who contact you if there are leakages, contamination or environmental harm or damage.  They will spot it straightaway.  I find so often that they are not adequately supported in that role.  Kells wastewater treatment plant is on a long list of projects due a network upgrade but it needs to be advanced.  We have seen from various Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports over the years that this is a project that was a priority but was pushed back and various intermediate or interim measures were taken to push it back even further.  We need to see that work done. </p>  <p>  Finally, I again commend the work of angling and community groups in my constituency and in the neighbouring constituencies of Louth and Meath East.</p> <p>The Save the Boyne group has emerged in response to what I believe is an offensive planning proposal for a meat processing plant that will discharge wastewater into the Boyne.  The group has sought an oral hearing from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and has been denied that.  I believe that is the wrong decision and I will continue to make that case.  I commend that group for its activism in opposition to this planning application but, far broader than that, for its work to support and protect the Boyne.  It is very encouraging to see that type of environmental activism.  I commend it for that work and will continue to support it and the call for an oral hearing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.566" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500064#QQQ00200"><p>As Deputy &Oacute; Broin has outlined, my party will not be opposing the separation of Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann from Ervia.  As we are addressing the issue of water services, which are essential to sustaining human life, at a time when there is so much public uncertainty and distress in the matter of other vital services, namely, heat and light, and whether people will have them at all or be able to afford them, this debate gives an urgency and impetus to our work here and gives us a chance to put water and its provisions high in the public mind.  Given the circumstances we find ourselves in, with war and soaring energy costs, we can be in no doubt it is critical that our water utility remains in public ownership.  It is critical that we have the necessary referendum so the people can have their say and that Irish Water remains a non-commercial, not-for-profit, semi-State company.  We will be asking the Government to publish the wording for the referendum and to set a date, as was promised.</p>  <p>  In the world we have and the world we are facing, I would be very fearful for our people were water to be privatised and profitised solely as a market commodity, as opposed to being seen and protected as an element essential to human life.  It is for this reason that we believe water services should continue to have that connection with local authorities.  Something as essential to existence as water should not be out of the reach of the public.  I am often contacted by people who have bought houses and are waiting for the keys, and there is that delay because when they contact the council about Irish Water, often because it is a strategic housing development, the delay is a nightmare.  We need to see more investment into Irish Water.</p>  <p>  We are at a critical time and I do not need to tell the Minister that.  The heatwaves of the summer have given us a taste of what we are facing.  All across Europe, we saw reservoirs getting lower.  We saw the stone emerging in the Shannon and all across Europe, rivers were drying up.  We are living in a world where all of us are vulnerable to drought and the food and economic effects that will have.  This will make people look more closely at water and the management and provision of that vital service.</p>  <p>  As a member of the climate committee, I hear the scientists who have come to talk to us.  It is vital that we heed them.  We face a world forced to face up to temperature rises, many of which are baked in at this stage.  We are going from floods in one country to droughts in another.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will have to do big and important work within the provisions of this Bill.  The accountability provided for by the Bill will be critical because Uisce &Eacute;ireann will operate in a radically different world to that suggested by those who believe climate change might benefit Ireland because of milder winters and lower heating bills, as the T&aacute;naiste himself said at a climate action plan, if I remember correctly.  He is in trouble again now for comparing something to the Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto.  I do not know why because I think the Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto is excellent.</p>  <p>  On the other specifics of the Bill, we welcome the Committee of Public Accounts accountability, although we are mystified as to why Uisce &Eacute;ireann would not have an Accounting Officer reporting straight to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I hope the Minister will have another think about that.  Equally, we are disappointed that the Minister has chosen not to publish a detailed statement on the conclusion of the Workplace Relations Commission negotiations and the issue of the all-important referendum.</p>  <p>  The fact the Minister has to remove &ldquo;Irish Water&rdquo; as a title shows how toxic the phrase and the brand &ldquo;Irish Water&rdquo; was, how it was rejected across the State and the distress and anger caused in local communities.  Considering the dire financial situation so many families are in now, I am glad I was one of those who fought back against Irish Water charges.  The rallying of those communities in solidarity and in opposition to Irish Water has not gone away.  We are hoping we will have good numbers out on the streets on 24 September because the shadow that cast was long and uncomfortable.  It will take more than changing the name from Irish Water to Uisce &Eacute;ireann to erase that from the Irish memory.  The Government will do well to remember that.  I am out of time.  To conclude, we will be supporting the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500064#QQQ00300"><p>I am pleased to speak on this important legislation, which the Labour Party will not be opposing, although there may be amendments that we will propose on Committee Stage and later stages.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister and everybody in this Chamber will agree that water is a public good.  We have had many debates across our society in the past few months about what constitutes a public good and what should be left to the markets to decide who pays for a product or a service.  We have had those discussions in the context of the energy crisis we face at the moment and the impact that is having on households, businesses and jobs across the country.  However, we can affirm today again that water is a public good and it should always be considered as such - it should always be considered as a public good.</p>  <p>  It is crucial that Irish Water is retained in public ownership in perpetuity, until the day this Oireachtas or a subsequent Oireachtas decides otherwise or, crucially, until such time that the Irish people decide otherwise.  It is not a new proposition, this idea that the Irish people should decide on the fate of this particular publicly owned water utility.  The Minister will be aware of the provision for a plebiscite in the 2014 legislation, which sought to reassure concerned citizens across this country about the future of what is publicly owned by the Irish people, lock, stock and barrel.</p>  <p>  It should remain the case that Irish Water is a public utility in perpetuity for a number of different reasons.  One of the reasons is because I see and I have always seen Irish Water and the idea of a single publicly owned, standalone State water utility as one of what we can describe as the new generation of State enterprises, that is, State enterprises that will work with citizens, businesses and investors to try to improve and develop our economy and provide the water services that a decent society requires.  Crucially, it should also remain as a publicly owned utility because that is in the best interests of the Irish people.</p>  <p>  We have been subjected already this evening to history lessons on the establishment of Irish Water and what the intention on the establishment of Irish Water was actually all about.  I do not think any public utility on its formation has had so many myths and fallacies ascribed to it.  There is no doubt that when the idea of a single water utility was first mooted, the Fine Gael Party would have privatised that particular utility with gusto.  For example, we only have to look at its 2011 election manifesto.  It was because of the presence of the Labour Party in the 2011 to 2016 Government that that utility was not privatised, and neither were many other important commercial State enterprises or other State bodies.  That is a fact, and it is an uncomfortable fact for some people who have made their careers out of, bizarrely, opposing the establishment of a publicly owned State utility.</p>  <p>  I completely understand and acknowledge the concerns of people who had been loaded with additional costs at a very difficult time for our society during the great recession, and the understandable opposition to the introduction of water charges.</p> <p>However, the idea of a publicly owned, national State water utility is, in itself, a good one.  Unfortunately, some people will never be persuaded of that because it does not suit their political narrative and a lot of D&aacute;il seats are owed to the opposition to the establishment of a State water utility.  That is a fact and no rewriting of history to suit a particular political narrative will change it.  The 2014 legislation to which I referred copper-fastened the status of Irish Water as a State utility.  My party and I, and the trade union movement, want it to remain so.  It is important that we have a clear indication soon from the Government of the timeline for the referendum that was promised in the programme for Government.</p> <p> I turn to some of the details of the Bill before us.  The provisions regarding the appointment of board members are interesting.  I am pleased provision has been made for the appointment of a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, to the board of this State utility.  It is a good way to do business and a positive thing to do.  The ICTU represents more than just workers; it represents, in my view, the public interest.  It is an important signal to send and an important acknowledgment of the position of the trade union movement in our society.  That can only help to make Irish Water, or Uisce &Eacute;ireann, a more successful State utility.</p> <p> I am pleased as well that provision is being made for a limit on the term of office of directors of the board.  It is important that there be a replenishment of skills and experience on boards.  We have seen to our cost over the years that people can hang on to board positions, with the result that organisations become stale and a herd mentality tends to dominate.  New thinking should always be encouraged and this provision is a very positive move.  I am disappointed, however, that the Public Appointments Service, PAS, will not be utilised for the appointment of board directors, with an alternative means of appointment being adopted.  The use of the PAS is the gold standard with which there should always be alignment and compliance.</p> <p> Regarding accountability to public bodies, Uisce &Eacute;ireann, as a stand-alone State utility, will be receiving significant amounts of investment from citizens, that is, taxpayers, through the Government.  It is important, given this is the case, that it will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is as it should be.</p> <p> I refer to the rather protracted process in which the trade unions involved in Irish Water and the local authorities engaged in order to get to a point where the new framework for future delivery of water services agreement was hammered out.  It is important to put on the record and reassure those who may be transferring from local authorities and Ervia into the stand-alone utility that many positive things were secured by their trade unions at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  There will be no compulsory transfers of staff to Irish Water from local authorities and no compulsory redundances.  Local authority workers will have the option of transferring to Irish Water on a voluntary basis.  Existing pay is protected and there is a chance to earn more through individual or collective Irish Water performance rewards.  Existing pension benefits are legally protected, which was an important issue that had to be addressed in the process.  It is important that existing pay, terms, conditions and all other entitlements will transfer if local authority workers decide to transfer to Irish Water in the fullness of time.  It is important as well that local authority staff have the option to remain within the local authority system.  In my view and that of the trade union movement and the workers themselves, they should do so from a position in which the pay, terms and conditions they enjoy will be no less favourable than those they enjoy in their current role.  Great credit is owed to people like Liam Berney of ICTU, Brendan O'Brien and John King of SIPTU and others in Connect, F&oacute;rsa and Unite for reaching this point.  I am aware, for example, that the SIPTU water committee has approved the agreed approach.  Great credit is owed to the unions, the Department and Ervia for facilitating this progress.</p> <p> When this utility is formally re-established, if I may put it like that, and is moved away from Ervia, it will have great potential to help our economy grow as one of the new generation of stand-alone, dare I say commercial, semi-State enterprises.  I say "commercial" because it will still be raising commercial revenue from business charges and so on.  There is, of course, a commitment across this House not to introduce direct domestic water charges.  That is as it should be.  There was always a challenge to make sure responsible public representatives and political parties would ensure we have a sustainable taxation base to fund the development of our water services into the future.  In that regard, the report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, published yesterday, makes for very interesting reading and I look forward to engaging with the Government on it.  There are big challenges ahead of us but Uisce &Eacute;ireann can play a significant part in developing our economy and society and protecting and sustaining our environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500065#RRR00200"><p>I welcome the Bill, which provides for the separation of Irish Water from Ervia and the establishment of a stand-alone national authority for water services.  It is important to acknowledge, too, that the Bill offers a significant milestone in that it gives effect to the programme for Government commitment to retain Irish Water in public ownership as a national, stand-alone regulatory utility.</p>  <p>  The separation of Irish Water from the Ervia Group is in the best strategic interest of water services and gas network businesses.  That separation will be achieved by 1 January next year.  The reality is that the past nine years have been nothing short of a disaster as we saw autonomy over water services taken from local authorities and officials given every conceivable hiding place when it came to accountability.  Thus we have the disaster that is Irish Water and Ervia.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann must ultimately stands accountable as, otherwise, it will be no more than a stranglehold on an already struggling rural Ireland.  Many Deputies here this evening will speak about their own issues with the current incarnation of Irish Water and Ervia.  I will give way to those misgivings and concerns.</p>  <p>  I have spoken many times about our efforts to kick-start commercial house-building in County Longford once again.  An obvious place to start this would be in Ballymahon, which is the county's second-largest town, thanks to the arrival of Center Parcs, in which it seemed half the Members of the House holidayed this summer.  Ballymahon is now one of the fastest-growing mid-sized towns in the country.  It is thanks to the efforts of the local authority and our far-sighted towns team that it is one of the most progressive and innovative mid-sized towns in the midlands.  Earlier this year, the Government approved the town team's plan and provided almost &euro;6 million in funding for a new family resource centre and community hub.  Over the past 12 months, the Department of Education has approved in excess of &euro;20 million for the development and further development of the three schools in the town.  In addition, Center Parcs has a massive, multi-hundred million euro expansion plan for its facility.</p>  <p>  Arguably, the biggest deterrent to the further growth of the town is the local sewage system, which is now at capacity and urgently needs to be upgraded.  It is a similar story in many small provincial towns across the country.  Local councillors in the Ballymahon area and the local authority have flagged this issue with Irish Water, as have I, on numerous occasions.  We are now at the stage where the issue needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>When Irish Water is considering a new infrastructure project, it seems that it runs the proposal through a series of eight workshops before it can be advanced.  It has taken four years for us to get to the second workshop for something that is critical infrastructure for a provincial town.  Part of the Center Parcs' model is that it maintains a strong community forum which meets with members of the local community twice monthly.  It was interesting to hear in one of these recent community forums that a major challenge for Center Parcs lies in trying to get staff to come to Ballymahon because of the lack of available housing.  Local auctioneers and the county council have estimated that approximately 50 to 70 new-build houses are required in the area over the next two years to make up for the ever-depleting and dwindling housing stock.  Many of the people who should be coming to work in any of the industries in Ballymahon and to live in the town are now, unfortunately, living in adjoining counties while working in the town.  This has a huge knock-on effect on the local economy.</p> <p> We only have to go across the road then to Edgeworthstown, which is no more than eight miles from Ballymahon.  It is a similar story there.  We can see the ineffectualness of Irish Water during the last nine years.  Already this year, the local authority has been forced to turn down a planning application for a much-needed housing development.  Critically, plans for a new primary healthcare centre have also had to be refused on the basis that the local sewage treatment facility was ineffective and had reached capacity.  The developer must be commended on having had the wisdom to seek to get around this situation by installing a developer-provided water services infrastructure, DPI, on site, which is a solution that has been accepted in other counties.  Unfortunately, and perhaps correctly, Longford County Council was suspicious and fearful that allowing such a solution would stand in the way of Irish Water ultimately following through on its responsibility to provide an enhanced sewerage system for the town.</p> <p> Indeed, when it comes to the DPI and the failure to address these issues, we will see that Irish Water has form in this regard in County Longford.  We only have to go from Edgeworthstown to the nearby village of Cullyfad, where we have two small housing estates.  Between them, they number no more than about 30 houses.  By looking at these two small housing estates we can really paint a picture of what have been the abject failings of Irish Water over the last nine years.  The Woodland estate is a local authority development which was taken in charge by Irish Water, but the network is simply unable to operate at the required capacity.  Twice weekly, Irish Water, or, as is the case, we must pay for tankers to come to clear the network.  Meanwhile, a few hundred yards up the road we have the beleaguered residents of Radharc na Coille, which is a small development of just six houses.  All of them were purchased after 2013.  The local authority took the estate in charge in respect of roads and lights.  As Irish Water was coming into being, the local authority obviously did not take charge of water and wastewater services.  Consequently, these six households are now struggling to manage and finance a DPI system as operational and energy costs are soaring.</p> <p> We will head into Longford town as we continue our whistle-stop tour of the county.  Two of the oldest housing estates there, namely, Annaly Park and Teffia Park, were built 50 and 60 odd years ago.  Almost monthly or, indeed, weekly, we hear stories of the creaking network of water and sewerage pipes across those two estates.  Also almost weekly and monthly, I or someone in the office will squabble with Irish Water over whether these are backyard issues.  After toing and froing on the subject and going over and back with multiple emails, Irish Water will, ultimately, accept that the situation is its responsibility as the utility provider.</p> <p> I could go on, because there are many similar instances.  There is the Lisbrack housing estate in Longford town, where every couple of months a family is besieged by overflowing sewage.  In February 2021, Irish Water assured us that a consultant had been appointed to oversee the project which would see the installation of a new pumping station.  At this stage, it would surely be expected that we would have at least seen the outline of the plans for this project, but as of this weekend, when we had another outflow of sewage, we are no nearer to knowing what Irish Water's plans are for this beleaguered part of the town.  Therefore, I welcome this legislation, which is very positive, but we really need to see accountability from Uisce &Eacute;ireann, when it comes into being.</p></speech>

There is no denying this.  Before I continue, I note my unshakeable belief that water should be provided based on need, free at the point of access and funded through general taxation.  This Bill separates Uisce &Eacute;ireann from its parent company Ervia.  It was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in committee, yet some recommendations have been omitted.  One of these was that the chair of the new entity would be appointed via the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  There is no explicit reference regarding the appointment of the chair in this way.  The issue here, and this was reflected in the committee's report, is that putting in place an appointments system that is accessible, rigorous and transparent would enhance the prospect that applications would be forthcoming from experienced and qualified people with a commitment to public service.</p>  <p>  There is also the issue of the impact on workers.  While I do not wish to be drawn into commenting on the industrial relations negotiations, I am conscious that the deal, as agreed, has come in for criticism from county council workers in respect of the retention of their full terms and conditions if they remain in the county council.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could clarify this aspect.  Further clarity is also required concerning the lack of a ballot for the unions on this matter.  I welcome that the final agreement is voluntary and does not include any compulsory transfers or redundancies.</p>  <p>  While I am referring to local authorities, I record the need for water services to have a footprint in these local authorities.  If Irish Water had as much knowledge of the finer details of the water system in our localities, then there would be much less of a headache for households compared with the experience in this regard in recent times.  This is especially the case for County Tipperary, where thousands of people are now subject to boil water notices.  There are 25 areas and surrounding districts thus affected.  Some have had boil water notices for the last two weeks.  Carrick-on-Suir is a perfect example of this, and there are similar situations elsewhere in County Tipperary.    Equally, there is no mention of a referendum, or of holding a referendum, in this Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether he intends to do this.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports investment in reducing leakage, improving water quality and enhancing wastewater treatment, but this should all be funded through general taxation, commercial charges and low-cost Government borrowing.  To legislate for water charges as the way forward in this regard, as was proposed some years ago, is a false argument and it has been proven to be so.  </p>  <p>  Before concluding, I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the ongoing issues with taking in charge housing estates.  I refer to how the memorandums of understanding between the agencies involved are obviously not working effectively enough.  This is the case with estates such as Rock Springs in Kilross and others across County Tipperary.  The Minister of State told me that a study is being carried out by Irish Water to develop optimum solutions for estates with DPIs.  Where are we at with this endeavour and can the Minister of State convey any sense of urgency in dealing with the matter and in taking many such estates out of this type of limbo?  </p></speech>

One is relatively minor and it concerns saying that the majority of the joint committee's recommendations are reflected in this Bill.  We only made three recommendations, which I think was quite modest of us.  Out of those three recommendations, one has been adopted.  Therefore, that is by no means a majority.  It is welcome that the legislation includes our recommendation that the chief executive and chair of Uisce &Eacute;ireann would be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  This provision is in the Bill and I very much welcome that.  It was something I supported and sought.</p>  <p>  Our other two recommendations are not, however, reflected in this Bill or in process.  The first of these was for the chair to be appointed through the PAS to ensure that the process would be open, accessible, rigorous and transparent and that this be stipulated in the legislation.  This is the practice operating currently, but it has not been included in the legislation as we sought.  Our third and final recommendation was that a comprehensive statement would be delivered by the Minister of State alongside this Bill providing an update on the process involving the trade unions and workers representatives.  Crucially, it would also have included information on legislation to enshrine the right to access to water in the Constitution and a timeline for the holding of such a referendum.  That has also not been incorporated in this process.  The joint committee made only these few small requests.</p>  <p>  My major disappointment at this stage is the comment that continued consideration will be given to a referendum to ensure that water and access to water services would be kept in public ownership.  I refer to the context of everything we have gone through here since Irish Water was established and everything we have gone through globally in recent years.  </p> <p>Nobody can be in any doubt about the necessity to hold and retain in public ownership key utilities, especially water.  I need not tell the Acting Chairman, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, or anyone else this.  Nothing is more important to our survival, apart from the air that we breathe, than water.  Water is key to everything we do.  It is key to our ability to live.  It is key to businesses' ability to function, schools' ability to operate, to hospitals and to farms.  We absolutely need water.</p> <p> The process of privatising water in other countries has been a disaster.  Let us not be in any doubt whatsoever about that.  Let us not be in any doubt that when Irish Water was set up it was part of a process and plan to privatise water and that has been stopped by a huge campaign that was put in by communities across Ireland.</p> <p> If one looks at the privatisation of water in other countries and what has happened, in Berlin, for example, where water was privatised, it was nothing short of an absolute disaster.  It led to significant deficits in investment in the water infrastructure and at the same time led to significant profits for the new shareholders of the company.  It was so bad a popular vote was organised by campaigners in Berlin demanding that their water services be brought back into public ownership and that forced the re-municipalisation of water services in Berlin.  Of course, it was an expensive process.  Those shares had to be bought back.  Similarly, in Paris water privatisation led to price hikes for individual households which simply were not justified by the very low levels of investments in infrastructure that the privatised company was making.  After 24 years of privatised water supply in Paris, the price of water had increased by 174% while the profits of the owners had soared.  That was the trajectory that we were on as a county if it had not been stopped.</p> <p> Interestingly, in Paris, when water was brought back into public ownership, efficiency savings of 35% were found.  Therefore, this nonsense we hear that the private sector is more efficient at running key utilities has been proven to be nonsense from the experience in Paris.  In fact, after Paris, we have seen re-municipalisation and public water utilities across France which are being brought back into public control.  In fact, we now have 235 places around the world where water supplies have been brought back into public ownership.  That trend is growing.  That shows the disaster that water privatisation is, how it should never be allowed, and when it happens that people must then fight campaigns to get it back into public ownership.  That is at huge cost and means that there has been a lack of investment while profits have been extracted in the meantime.</p> <p> For absolute clarity, we need to put this to bed, once and for all.  I welcome this legislation but we need a referendum to enshrine the right to and public ownership of our water resources in the Constitution.  When will the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Government provide a concrete timeline on this?  The Minister of State has been in government for over two years.  The least we and the public deserve is a concrete timeline on this.  That is essential.</p> <p> In terms of the role of the work force in water services, many of us will have seen the considerable knowledge of the local water systems among staff in water services.  It is important in terms of any changes that are made that the localised element of the staff, which is second to none and in which the knowledge held is far more than that held in any maps or system, is fully retained.  It is important, in terms of the negotiations being agreed, that any transfers would be voluntary.  No doubt many water services staff will be wary of any transfers knowing what happened to An Post workers when they were transferred and what happened to their pensions despite all the promises and commitments that were given that there would be no effect on their pensions and no effect on their terms and conditions.  Workers, who had given a life of service to An Post and its predecessor, when they were transferred saw significant cuts in their retirement income that they were promised would never happen to them.  Because that has never been rectified, that will, of course, be to the forefront of the minds of water services workers in terms of any possible transfers.</p></speech>

I thank the Social Democrats for facilitating me.</p><p>I will start by thanking the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for its digest, as usual, produced under pressure.</p><p>I stand here as someone who proudly campaigned against water charges and to keep water services within the local authority.  It appalled me what we were doing - I watched it as I was an active member - to underfund, underresource and undermine the local authority.  We did it on every level.  We did it on waste management.  The unions stood by and watched it happening at the time.  Galway, for example, was the second last local authority to succumb.  There is always room for improvement and questions as to where our refuse was actually going, but we had theoretically the best system in the country, in 2000, led by the people on the ground.  There was a book published on waste, <i>The burning issue</i>.  They led us in relation to zero waste and led a campaign where there were monster meetings in a hotel that at one stage was proudly owned by the State, the Corrib Great Southern Hotel - that is a story in itself.  What happened?  A fantastic service, with three bins and education liaison officers going out, was taken away and legislation was passed to remove the power for local authorities to pass their own waste management plan.</p><p>Parallel with that, we had the water debacle.  I was led by the people on the ground, and proudly so.  It was a very bad decision to take the water services from the local authority.  They were the experts on the ground.  I had no difficulty with a national body but trust was missing.  We were proven right in relation to it.  I refer to the institutional memory and experience on the ground from those people who knew where pipes and leaks were.</p><p>We knew at a very early stage that approximately 40% of the water was wasted on the ground.  That was not the workers' fault.  That was not the fault of the people out there doing their job who responded as to the click of our fingers when we phoned them about leaks and difficulties, and they were out.  The problem was that the Government, with the help of the managers in the counties and the cities, successfully undermined completely and set the scene for the privatisation of the water system.</p><p>If this legislation is a step to undo that, I very much welcome it.  However, I have grown very cynical.  I wish I was not.  I wish I had more optimism.  It is my duty to have optimism and to lead, but it is difficult.  In that limited sense, I welcome that we are going somewhere to confirm that this will be a publicly-owned utility.  However, I have a problem with the word &quot;company&quot; and shares.  I am not quite sure why that is necessary.  There is a danger that it could still be sold off in the future.  We clearly need a referendum.  It is a matter of disappointment to me that we are now discussing this in a vacuum.  I would hope, before the Bill goes any further on Committee Stage, that we would have a firm commitment from the Government about when we will have the referendum and the wording of that referendum because we do not want weasel words.  We have had enough of weasel words.  We want a firm commitment.  I could read out the words that the unions have suggested.  I will not, but there is any amount of examples that we clearly enshrine that this service is owned by the people for the people.  It is the most vital service that we will talk about, along with housing and health.  However, water is top of the list.</p><p>We have seen what happened in other countries.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan referred to various examples.  I saw that in Toronto, Canada, where everything was privatised.  The refuse was privatised.  Gradually, they had to change that because the private system simply does not work.  It is based on profit and greed.  We have seen that earlier on in the week.  We have seen it regarding the allegations about An Bord Plean&aacute;la and we have seen it in the 1,500-page Siteserv report, which I am making my way through and which is horrific.</p> <p>The private system is there for profit.  There is a role for the markets and the private system, but it must be matched by a state that recognises what is fundamental to a civilised society: water, publicly owned, which should never be even up for discussion, public housing across the board to balance the market, public health, public education and public childcare.  If the Bill is a step in that direction, and I am really not sure it is, I welcome it.<br/><br/>I welcome the proposed accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, I would like the Minister of State to explain the following.  I should understand it myself, having spent a good few years on the committee.  I am not sure why the Government proposes to distinguish between Accounting Officer and accounting person.  Is that with a view to ensuring more accountability?  Even with my experience, I cannot make that one out.  As has been said, there were only three recommendations from the housing committee.  I do not sit on that committee.  I thank it for its work.  It made very specific recommendations, only one of which was taken on board, and that related to the Committee of Public Accounts.  From my reading of the report, it was the committee that asked for the distinction between accounting person and Accounting Officer, but I am not quite sure why that was.<br/><br/>Then a regulatory impact analysis was carried out and it came up with three options.  I never understand when such analyses are carried out why one of the options is to do nothing.  The options should be looked at.  One of the options is always no intervention, as if that is an option.  The two other options in this analysis are, No. 2, to separate Irish Water from Ervia with additional regulatory requirements and, No. 3, to separate them with no additional regulatory requirements.  The committee went for No. 2, and the additional regulatory requirements presumably involve the Committee of Public Accounts.  Do they involve the regulator as well?  Again, I am a little worried about that because such a provision is for commercial companies.  I am not sure what status this company will have.  Perhaps that could be clarified either tonight or in the process.<br/><br/>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe gurb &eacute; Uisce &Eacute;ireann an t-ainm a bheidh ar an eagra&iacute;ocht seo, ach t&aacute; m&eacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n buartha.  I gc&oacute;na&iacute; b&iacute;onn an teideal Gaeilge mar rud di&uacute;ltach.  T&aacute; eagla orm gur rud di&uacute;ltach &eacute; Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag cur lochta ar bith ar na hoibrithe.  I am worried that Irish is often used in a negative sense.  I am delighted that the name of the body is to be Uisce &Eacute;ireann, but very often Irish is associated with negativity, and that is a little difficulty for me.  I think of L&aacute; Nua, which is a mental health centre in Galway and is anything but a l&aacute; nua in terms of the way the Government has treated it.  I think of Tusla.  T&uacute;s means beginning and l&aacute; means day, so the beginning of a new day.  The grammar is wrong and the s&iacute;nt&iacute; fada are gone and it is nonsense.  Of course, Tusla itself has had its own problems, and perhaps that has come from the word.  The beginning of a new day, which would be t&uacute;s lae or t&uacute;s an lae nua, becomes Tusla.  I do not know even how to pronounce it.  Again, this is no reflection on the staff, but there is an absence of vision here.  We stick in the Irish language rather than the Irish language being part of the solution.  I have repeatedly pointed to a book called <i>Irish and Ecology</i>by Michael Cronin.  It is a wonderful little book.  It is in Irish and English and it talks about Irish being part of the solution to climate change because of the history of the Irish language and the Irish people being with nature and working with nature.  That is just an aside while I have the time, courtesy of the Social Democrats.  I have decided to use that time.  I despair of the negativity of the Irish word when used that way.<br/><br/>I hope Uisce &Eacute;ireann works out.  I have a little difficulty with the way it has been allowed to develop unaccountably.  It is pushed on all sides from every side.  It makes sense to have it in the local authority under the new thing the Government is now doing but with the footprint, as has been said, in the local authority.  That is where it should be, along with its colleagues in the other services.  Moving it out does not make sense to me.<br/><br/>I will turn to practical matters in Galway city.  I have mentioned this previously to the Minister of State.  The problem is partly mine in that I have not come back to him on Carrowroe.  Raw sewage is pumping out from Carrowroe into the sea as we speak.  There has been a long campaign, before I became a Deputy and even, I think, before I became a councillor, to erect the suitable infrastructure.  Irish Water has a plan to build there.  My belief, and that of many other people, is that it is totally the wrong site.  To complicate matters even more, the people who own the site have planning permission for a heritage centre and, as I understand it, are proceeding to erect it in C&eacute;ibh an tSruth&aacute;in, just outside Carrowroe.  I have mentioned this previously.  I raised it as a Topical Issue matter for Irish Water to see sense.  There are other sites.  I am in trouble for mentioning Ros a' Mh&iacute;l but I will mention it again.  It is an industrial site, and t&aacute; talamh ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ansin.  To me, it is a perfect site, but I am no expert.  The site they are putting it on, however, is just not going anywhere.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann is pursuing that.  That is tunnel vision.  It is clearly under pressure to perform but it is not performing.<br/><br/>Then we had the latest stories from Inishbofin.  People are not allowed to drink the water there.  Irish Water, again, was three weeks late telling them, so people were drinking water that was not fit for consumption.  Earlier this morning we had a discussion on a policy for the islands during Oral Questions.  Here is another example of problems with drinking water, and all the other Deputies have similar examples from all over the country.  It is inexcusable not to tell the people that there is something wrong with their water until three weeks later.  I have been through that with cryptosporidium in Galway, where there was a risk assessment way back in 2005 or 2007.  We were never told about cryptosporidium, but the officials at management level knew about it.  I thought we had left that day behind.  We have two problems here: the fact that they cannot drink their water and the fact that they have not been told about it.<br/><br/>As for the Aran Islands, to show the House how we go around in circles, there were two problems.  One involved the county council and a toilet and the sewage going into a field, and there was a separate problem with a number of cottages.  I cannot tell the Minister of State how many contacts myself and other Deputies have had with the EPA, the county council and Irish Water, going around in circles trying to identify who would take charge and who would do something.  I am talking about years and a file a foot high.  That is the difficulty with no clear roles, no clear vision and no clear targets.<br/><br/>Galway is one of the five cities identified to grow in population.  We have the Mutton Island treatment plant, which should never have gone there.  It should have gone to the docks, but it went there.  Although management tell us, to be fair to them, that it is fit for purpose and able to cope, I believe it is not because on many occasions we have raw sewage going into the bay from the outfalls because of &quot;rain events&quot;, which are supposed to be rare but which happen every day in Galway.  Finally, in the east of Galway city we do not have the infrastructure for the development that is planned.</p></speech>

It also includes new provisions to require Uisce &Eacute;ireann to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, which is welcome.  The general scheme of the Bill was published in 2019 and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny.  The committee recommended that the chair be appointed through the Public Appointments Service and that the Minister publish a written statement on the negotiations relating to the single utility, along with an update on holding a referendum to enshrine the right to water in the Constitution.  It is disappointing that these issues have not been adequately addressed.  Previous speakers have mentioned all that.</p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are not opposed to the separation of Irish Water from Ervia, but we support the recommendations of the Oireachtas housing committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.  The key issues for us are that the water utility remains in public ownership and that a referendum be held urgently to enshrine this in the Constitution.  The Government must publish wording for a referendum and must set a date.  At the moment we have no referendum Bill and no date for the holding of a referendum.  The Minister has made a vague commitment to bring a proposal to the Government but we have no detail.  This is extremely important and must be dealt with.  We are, and will continue to be, opposed to domestic metered water charges and domestic meters.</p> <p>The final legal status of the utility is unclear.  Our preference would be for it to be a non-commercial semi-State company.  We are concerned with the loss of yet another service to local authorities.  We should be strengthening our local government, not weakening it.</p> <p> Clarity must be provided on what footprint water services will have in councils in the future.  Adequate assurances must be provided for local authority staff who choose to transfer to the new utility.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe water should be provided on the basis of need, free at the point of access and funded through general taxation and commercial charges.  It is clear from recent county development plan discussions in Kildare that urgent investment is needed to deliver the water and wastewater services that are necessary to ensure we have balanced development.</p> <p> There are almost 7,000 people on the housing waiting list in Kildare and many thousands more who are not on that list are living in substandard or inadequate housing situations.  We are doing them a disservice if we do not address this urgently.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Taoiseach was asked when this referendum would be held and when a date for it would be announced.  He replied that the Minister " is working on it" and that  "We will get a timeline when we are ready for it."  Water workers across the country insist that this referendum must be announced before 1 January.  The reason for this is because 1 January is the date when water services are to be transferred from local authorities to Irish Water, Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  They warn of a real danger that in the context of an international recession and pressure on Government finances, the Government may be prepared to privatise Uisce &Eacute;ireann and that would in turn lay the basis for the return of water charges through the backdoor, that is, "Water charges 2.0".  They believe it is in the vital interest of the people of this country that they are aware of that situation given the hatred across the country towards water charges and the complete opposition to any hint of their return.</p>  <p>  I suggest that the demands of the country's 3,000 water workers on the naming of a date for a referendum before the end of the year should be taken seriously by the Minister.  From the contact I have had with water workers in my own Cork city and county area and the feedback they receive around the county, water workers are deadly serious about this issue.  They are not messing about.  They are prepared to fight to achieve a referendum.  A smooth transfer of water services from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January will be ruled out unless those assurances are given.</p>  <p>  The water workers are right to warn of the dangers of outright privatisation.  There is also the real possibility and the threat of a slow privatisation process taking place.  Let us call it creeping privatisation.  Even with a successful referendum outcome, a State-owned utility can contract multiple private operators for work.  We have seen that with the situation in the ESB.  Therefore, it is important that the water workers defend and build their industrial strength in Ireland in order to guard against a contracting-out situation.  Nor is it ruled out that a semi-State company could go against the interest of the people in this country and reintroduce water charges.  We have seen how the ESB went against the interest of ordinary people by massively hiking up the price of gas and electricity, despite the fact it made &euro;679 million in profit last year.  We have seen how Allied Irish Banks, a majority State-ownership bank, went against the interest of ordinary people by attempting a mass closure of their branches at the start of summer.  This points to a couple of points.  First, whatever entity controls water services in this country should be run by a board that is made up of elected representatives, of the people who use the service, and the workers themselves.  In other words, there is democratic control and the board genuinely represents the interest of ordinary people.  Second, people remember that the Fine Gael Party, along with the Labour Party, introduced water charges.  That Government also had the backing of Fianna F&aacute;il on the broad issues.  People would do well to remember that and put those parties outside the door next time around.  People would also do well to remember that it was a mass movement of people power on the streets and mass non-payment that defeated the water chargers.  We did it once and if we have to do it again, we will do that too.</p>  <p>  I refer to the framework document that was issued on 25 June, which provides for local authority workers to be transferred from local authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann on 1 January.  The document was put in place in spite of a service level agreement between the local authorities and Irish Water that is due to run to 2026.  Despite this, the group of unions signed up to the framework document.  It is a major understatement to say there is discontent among water workers nationwide that their unions took this position.  The decision was made by the unions without referring to the workers themselves.  Workers are advancing the demand that they must have the right to ballot on this.  No change of this scale and importance should be rammed through and it cannot happen without the workers' consent.  I agree 100% with their position on this and I will watch with great interest as to whether democracy will be served at the end of the day and whether the ballot is put in place by the respective unions on this crucial and vital issue for water workers and society.

I definitely support use of the Irish language in terms of naming State bodies and so on.  It is an important way of popularising and bringing the language into normal use but I cannot help but be a little bit cynical when it comes to this naming.  I wonder if the name is being changed from "Irish Water" to "Uisce &Eacute;ireann" because of the deep unpopularity of Irish Water, the dislike that many ordinary people hold for it as an institution and its connection to the project of the commodification of water and potential privatisation of water.</p>  <p>  The context of this debate is the mass social movement that happened in 2014, 2015, and 2016.</p> <p>It prevented the agenda of the political establishment in this country and the capitalist elite in the European Union, which was to drive through commodification and privatisation of our water.  The mass movement of hundreds of thousands of people protesting, the 73% of people refusing to pay and the community organisation at an incredible scale, including blocking water meters, defeated a serious Government agenda of commodification leading to privatisation.<br/><br/>At the time, those of us who opposed the water charges were ridiculed for suggesting that such a process of water charges may lead to privatisation.  It is very clear to anyone who analyses the various troika programmes that were imposed that where there were no charges they were imposed, such as in Ireland with the agreement of the then Government, and where there were charges privatisation was imposed as, for example, in Greece.  It was the clear agenda and it remains a clear agenda.  The political establishment in this country cannot go out and speak about its support for water charges.  Do we really think the wholehearted support it previously had for water charges has gone away and that it really changed its mind because of the mass movement?  No.  It was defeated and forced back.<br/><br/>We, together in the mass movement, stopped the process of commodification and privatisation through the front door for now.  We have to remain vigilant about the process happening through the back door.  Officially we are meant to be getting bills for excess usage of water charges next year.  They were originally meant to start in 2019.  As a result of the mass opposition and the absence of water meters in half of the homes in the State, the Government has put it off again and again.  I presume, because of pressure, particularly in the context of the cost-of-living crisis, the Government will be forced to put it off again.  This is meant to be coming and it is a back door towards commodification and full charges.<br/><br/>The other most likely route to effective privatisation is by the back door.  This is already happening in terms of how Irish Water operates.  There is a lot of outsourcing to private companies.  There is not only outsourcing whereby a company is paid to do particular work but also outsourcing in the form of various design, build and operate contracts.  This effectively means that large parts of our water infrastructure are run on a for-profit basis.  They are handed over to private companies from their very inception.  They design, build and operate them and effectively they are run on a for-profit basis.  We may well see this extended more and more this until very little of our water is held in effective public ownership.  If not, there may be a threat of a future economic crisis when the Government will state it will sell off Irish Water directly.<br/><br/>One of the things that, in a sense, the water movement won was a promise that we would have a referendum to enshrine the public ownership of water in the Constitution.  This is important for everybody in the country who drinks and uses water, which is literally everybody.  It is particularly important for the 3,000 workers who are expected, from 1 January next year, to transfer from working for local authorities and the State to working for Irish Water.  They are extremely concerned that they are being transferred to a semi-State company which, at a future point in time, directly or indirectly, could become a private company and that they would lose all of their rights.  It is not a small matter.<br/><br/>The Minister of State is nodding.  I presume he personally agrees with the idea of a referendum to ensure water is in public ownership.  It is a matter of very clear public record that the Government has dragged its feet on this.  That is the case with this Government and the previous Government.  I sat in multiple committee meetings dealing with the Bill tabled by Deputy Joan Collins.  Six years ago, she introduced a Bill that stated we should have a referendum to put public ownership of water into our Constitution.  We were treated to all sorts of arcane legal arguments that were trotted out just to avoid a referendum.  There was no meaningful proposal of wording.  We were just told this or that was a problem.<br/><br/>Six months ago, we had a promise from the Minister with responsibility for housing that there would be a referendum this year or early next year.  As Deputy Barry pointed out, I asked the Taoiseach about this yesterday.  The answer I got was far from reassuring.  The Taoiseach told me there is no reason for workers to be concerned but he did not give any reassurance whatsoever on the content of the referendum or the timeline for it.  When I pushed for an answer on when it would happen I was told we would get a timeline when the Government was ready for it.  The Taoiseach said we could not have had a referendum, or even prepare for one, over recent years because of Covid.  He said:</p><blockquote>	Deputy Paul Murphy should acknowledge that significant progress has been made in recent years in cementing the public ownership dimension of Irish Water in terms of the State structure that has been introduced.  There is no question about that. </blockquote> <p>I do not agree there is no question about it when we do not have a referendum.  We did not get any indication of a timeline.  This is an essential, core issue for the 3,000 workers as well as everybody in the country who is concerned about water.<br/><br/>What the Taoiseach indicated about the wording of the referendum was concerning.  The programme for Government is also concerning.  There is a general reference to water and our natural resources.  The Taoiseach stated:</p><blockquote>	The fundamental issue around the referendum on water is control of a natural resource, besides the mechanisms by which it is managed.  Be it an agency or local authorities, that is a matter for ongoing debate.  It is State-owned and the State is the shareholder...  The Minister has committed to a referendum on it.  It is a referendum that will deal with the broader issue of ownership of water. </blockquote> <p>I have an idea of what he is getting at, which is that we will not put in the Constitution that we will not privatise Irish Water.  What we will put in the Constitution is some type of general idea that the ownership of water in general is held in the context of the State but not that we cannot sell the water coming through our taps for profit and not that it cannot be privatised.  The referendum the Government will deliver, based on what was said yesterday, will not meet expectations and hopes and what is necessary to satisfy the demands of the water workers.<br/><br/>I commend the local authority workers for fighting for their rights and the rights of every person in this country who wants to see publicly owned and properly provided water.  They have organised a series of protests throughout the State.  We do not have any Fine Gael Deputies present but they got a rude awakening at their think-in where the issue of water was present.  People were marching outside demanding a referendum.  It is absolutely reasonable for the workers to say they want a ballot.  Effectively, they will be transferred.  They do not feel they have much choice.  They are being faced with not much of a choice given what will happen to them in 2026 if they stay in the local authorities.  They state they need to have a ballot on this and a democratic decision within the union as to whether they will accept it.  This is a very reasonable position for them to adopt.  Previously they were informed that no such agreement would happen without their democratic consent to it.  They are absolutely right to be campaigning, pushing and demanding ballots in their unions on whether they accept the deal.<br/><br/>If the situation does not change and we do not have a guarantee of a timeline for a meaningful referendum about public ownership of water in a real sense, and if the workers are not satisfied on the various issues they are raising about conditions and pensions, then on 1 January there is likely to be a significant problem.  The workers will be absolutely justified in engaging in industrial action to state they will not be transferred to Irish Water.  It is very easy for the Government to solve this.  I am putting it on notice, and the workers have put it on notice through their actions, that the Government can avoid all of these things by going for a meaningful referendum and engaging with the workers and listening to them.  If it does not, it will be faced with the active opposition of these local authority workers who will have very broad public support.  The public gets this.  It is deeply in the public sentiment that water must not be commodified or privatised and that we must enshrine that in our Constitution.  We want a guarantee that what happened with bin services will not happen.</p> <p>Commodification led to privatisation, to massive attacks on workers' rights and a decline in services for people.  That must not happen to something as essential as water.  I hope that we will get meaningful responses on the referendum and engagement with the workers.</p></speech>

It has been quite an interesting debate up to this point.  I will use this opportunity to raise two local issues.  They have been going on for quite some time and are very serious.  It is unfortunate that it has to come to the point where they have to be raised in the D&aacute;il.  The people of Inishbofin were advised of a boil water notice on 25 August due to the level of manganese in the water.  This was then changed to a do not drink notice on 3 September.  Even more concerning is that it has now been revealed that as early as 11 August, the level of manganese in the water was not safe.  Locals are worried because they feel there might have been an issue for some time with the water.  Some have said that for some months there was a strange taste but now the water is completely brown.  This water was being used by locals, even for washing bottles for a small baby, at a time when they had not been told that it was not safe to use if it had not been boiled.</p>  <p>  All of that is horrendous but the lack of communication from Irish Water is simply not good enough.  Islanders have told me that they have found it impossible to get any information from the company.  We know that our island communities are very-well organised to get this kind of information.  I contacted Irish Water about this and was sent a press release that I could easily have gotten if I googled it.  When it comes to the point of us trying to get some information, it simply is not good enough when we are talking about peoples' health.</p>  <p>  The boil water notice came in on 25 August but equipment and replacement filtration only arrived on the island almost three weeks later on 13 September.  Islanders want to know why it took so long.  They also need clarity from Irish Water on the exact level of manganese, when it started and an explanation of how much exposure islanders had to it before this was raised with them.  Did this happen all of a sudden?  Had it been building for some time?  What exactly had been the problem with this system?  All of these questions are still being asked by the islands.  I understand that the Minister of State will not have all the answers to this issue now but I would be delighted if he could furnish me with a response at a later date.</p>  <p>  I will raise another Irish Water issue on Inisheer, which has been ongoing since last summer.  There are nightly restrictions of water over summer months from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.  I was on Inisheer at the weekend.  What happens is that a cargo boat has to bring 10,000 l of water twice per day to the island.  Usually there are 300 people living on the island.  However, there are thousands there during the summer.  That is not good enough.  That boat should not be going.  We need to make sure that there is a functioning reservoir for the island.  We should think of all the rain that falls that could be collected.  That is the kind of vision we need.  Those are two urgent actions.</p></speech>

I accept the fact that it needs to be put into a single entity and that it be separated out in order that it can have full responsibility for what it does and that we, as elected Members, have an opportunity to question its performance, its spending and the value for money it gets out of that.  There will be an obligation on Irish Water to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees from time to time, which is welcome.</p>  <p>  We need to make sure that Irish Water is protected from privatisation.  It is a commitment of Government that this will be done and it needs to be done in a meaningful way.  Having said that, I would like to move on to some of the problems I encounter with Irish Water.  If the company is to be effective in delivering what it will supposed to deliver, which is safe water and wastewater treatment to our towns, villages and cities, the first thing we need to make sure is that it is resourced properly. </p>  <p>  I look at issues that arise.  I have concerns if I go back prior to Irish Water.  Galway County Council had a schedule of wastewater treatment plants to come on stream over time.  One of them would have been a major wastewater treatment plant for the east of the city to serve the Ardaun corridor, which is the next development phase out of the city towards the east of the county and Athenry.  A site selection process was in place.  Feasibility studies have been done and it has not moved one inch since then.</p>  <p>  We talked about the possibility of getting the likes of Intel in to Galway to set up a microchip processing plant.  I understand that other major chip manufacturing companies are looking at the same site now.  We should have the infrastructure in place to take on a project for which we have the land - a project that would be as the same size and calibre of what is going on in Leixlip.  It is important that we front load our infrastructure investment to make sure that particular area is serviced by wastewater and water.</p>  <p>  We have an Industrial Development Authority, IDA, Ireland site in Athenry, which is at the crossroads of the railways and the motorways in the county that go north to south and east to west.  Approximately four years ago, under the previous Government, we succeeded in getting Irish Water to upgrade the treatment plant.  That was phase 1 of the project for Athenry.  Phase 2 was to put in a pipe network, which was to happen within two years.  That pipe network was to connect all of the existing housing estates in the town to this new upgraded treatment plant.  That has not happened.  It has not even gone out to tender.  It is still in some design process and has not happened.  It is probably two years overdue at this stage.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile new schools are being built, including a Gaelscoil campus.  We have other projects to do in Athenry and we do not have the infrastructure.  We have the plant but we do not have the pipes to feed from the private treatment plants that Irish Water will refuse to take in charge.  We have a solution, which is to pipe from them all the way to the new treatment plant.  That has not been done.  That is stifling growth in Athenry, which is a growth centre with train connectivity to Athlone, Limerick and Galway city.  We have to think about what we are doing.</p>  <p>  I have other issues with regard to smaller towns such as Craughwell, which is another growth centre outside of Galway, where the treatment plant site was selected by Galway County Council.  That has not moved.  We have six private wastewater treatment plants in Corrofin, a village, all built on the edge of the River Clare.  These treatment plants are not working to proper standards.  They are not being maintained because the people living in the houses cannot afford it.  We are living in an era when we are fast approaching an environmental time bomb there.</p>  <p>  There is a considerable tract of land in Corrofin village that is primed for development, but nothing can be built on it because An Bord Plean&aacute;la has decided that an application to build housing there was premature until a municipal wastewater treatment plant was built.  That decision was probably made in 2007 or 2008.  We have had nothing since that with regard to even putting it on an agenda to get it done.  It is the same in Abbeyknockmoy, Laban and Ardrahan, where we cannot build the houses people want to build in our villages because we do not have the wastewater treatment plants.</p>  <p>  Irish Water will say it does not have the funding to do it.  It is prioritising places where there are centres of population that it needs to service such as Dublin.  I understand that the money that was supposed to go into Athenry was diverted to a project in Dublin.  That is fine.  I do not begrudge anybody getting their infrastructure but I need to see that the infrastructure that was planned by Galway County Council and deemed to be feasible to carry out is done as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>We were talking about energy earlier during my group's Private Members' motion and we had a good debate on it.  If we do not have electricity, water or wastewater where are we going in terms of trying to build houses to solve the crisis we have?  I do not blame Irish Water.  I blame the fact the Government is not providing enough funding for it to be able to carry out the job it is charged with carrying out.</p> <p> Another issue that concerns me is at the moment if you are looking for a letter of consent to apply for planning permission for a house and you are on a public scheme owned by Irish Water it takes up to 12 weeks to get a letter to confirm the utility will give you consent to apply for planning permission and that it will give you water.  That is not right.  If you are successful you go to the next stage where you connect the water to your house.  You again have to apply for a connection.  If it is along the public road Irish Water will have to carry out the work itself and use its own set of contractors.  The rate they will charge is very high and can be very serious.  In one case lately, a young woman who is building a house with her husband found the cost of providing the water to the meter outside her door was &euro;60,000.  It was never envisaged it would cost that but because it was coming along a public road it cost so much per metre.  The 250 m at &euro;300 per metre was &euro;75,000, less certain discounts etc.  That kind of thing has got to be taken by the scruff of the neck and just thrown out the door.  We need to ensure people get reasonable costs for utilities that are being provided.  I assume the reason so much is being charged is the local authorities have put long-term damage charges onto the digging-up of public roads and as well as that, Irish Water must try to make a few pounds someplace when it is not getting enough to resource itself.</p> <p> The other area that is of concern to me is that in County Galway, as well as in Clare, Mayo and Donegal, there is a huge amount of private housing schemes that have private wastewater treatment plants and the responsibility for managing these is being left to the residents.  They are not qualified to do it and they have not got the resources to do it.  Again, we are seeing that people cannot sell a house in these estates because they cannot get confirmation the wastewater treatment plant is in public ownership.  It is creating huge problems in trying to get people to take an interest in their estate because they are deflated by the fact they bought these houses, got mortgages for them and now find they are spending much more money every year and at the same time paying the local property tax.</p> <p> I have raised a lot of issues.  There are many things we need to get right.  This is an opportunity for the Government and all of us here to say let us get behind Irish Water.  The best way to do that is to give it the resources it needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.588" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500072#YYY00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  I have plenty of time so I want to focus on an area he will be familiar with, namely, Duncannon and the water and sewage treatment issues there.</p>  <p>  There are two villages in the running to be chosen for a new treatment plant in County Wexford.  One of them is my home village of Ramsgrange.  On all available evidence it appears to be a no-brainer that the plant be located there.  Ramsgrange is an unusually large village with a secondary school of over 500 pupils, a primary school of up to 100 pupils, a supermarket, a church, a pub in the centre of the village, a day centre and South West Wexford, which is a local business hub.  The installation of the treatment plant in the local area of Ballyhack and Arthurstown would allow access, if Ramsgrange was allowed to join it, to new and existing dwellings for planning permission.  Equally, if we join the dots here we can save money because the secondary school has planning permission for an extension, in which case the Department of Education will have to fund upwards of &euro;150,000 to provide sewage treatment for the extension.  A survey has gone on with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and EU funding gave in excess of &euro;500,000 to bring the farmers in the area into a scheme that would restore the blue flag for Duncannon beach.  That has been very successful but at the same time it has reduced the percentage of effluent going into the open sea down to probably 13%.  The problem is that 13% is still there to go back into the sea if Ramsgrange is not joined.</p>  <p>  We have not regained our blue flag in Duncannon.  It is a coastal village.  The Minister of State has been there.  There are huge plans for it from a tourism perspective but this is also an area where the infrastructure was in absolute chaos this summer.  For almost a month in August people had limited water.  Some days there was none, on other days there was some and it was always at reduced pressure, meaning people could not use their showers, washing machines or dishwashers.  They could hardly wash up, never mind wash themselves, and this went on for a month.  While the sewage treatment plant work was being carried out the contractor, against the advice of Wexford County Council and when we were all on reduced water pressure, decided to fill the treatment plant's tanks with water.  They took every drop of water out of the reservoir.  When it was discovered by the council and Irish Water combined, we were left with a series of air locks through the whole system that lasted for a couple of weeks in different areas.  It was a nightmare.  We had businesses that supply food that had to close.  The supermarket had to close its deli.  The response from our local Wexford County Council water engineers was phenomenal.  They did everything they could.  With Irish Water, the contact was there, there is not doubt about it, but there was nothing we could do; there was no water.  Irish Water delivered tanks to certain areas but it means so much to join the dots.</p>  <p>  We talk about resourcing Irish Water but we must look at how it spends its money.  It makes the most sense in the world from everybody's perspective to join Ramsgrange into that wastewater treatment plant.  It is the next village from the three that are in it and it is the biggest village of the three.  It would give us access to housing, which is so badly needed.  On top of that I must say I have had a lot of interaction with people in this area who are very disgruntled about Irish Water because they feel they are currently paying for water.  If you have planning permission and you just want the utility to come and connect you it is &euro;4,000.  All Irish Water is doing is turning on a tap and it is &euro;4,000.  You are paying the contribution to Wexford County Council for roads and water.  People feel they are paying for it.  They hear &euro;10 million of Irish Water's budget is being paid out in performance bonuses - I am assuming they are performance bonuses because I do not know what else they would be for.  My interaction as a public servant is mostly with the local Wexford County Council engineers, who are phenomenal.  Dan McCartan in New Ross spent his whole summer engaging with the community who have had no water 24-7.  It is as simple as that.  There are many more like him, such as Billy Harris.  People have given up their weekends to deal with the water shortage.  I do not know why that &euro;10 million was paid out but we really cannot afford bonuses when we have an infrastructure that is failing all over the country.  It is something I will be happy to tackle when Uisce &Eacute;ireann appears in front of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not want to see moneys expended in a way that is not deserved.  I want to see us joining the dots between the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>  <p>  Virtually all of the septic tanks in Ramsgrange need upgrading, which would be at a cost of maybe &euro;15,000 to &euro;16,000.  If we get the wastewater treatment plant they can probably join.  We do not know what the cost is but it would be significantly less to aging people who built their houses some years ago.  That is what I mean by joining the dots.  We have people who cannot afford &euro;15,000 no matter what the Department with responsibility for the environment says.  It does not matter what fine the Department institutes or whether it brings people to court, because they cannot afford it.</p> <p>On the &euro;5,000 the council will give for the septic tank grant, the outlay has to be spent before people can recoup the grant.  That is just not practical.  At local level the engineers have done everything to make sure the dots are joined and the wastewater treatment plant goes ahead in this area, simply because it makes more sense and it is the practical, value-for-money thing to do.  It will go in front of a board and the decision will be made.  I am not aware exactly of what is located in the other village but I do know it only costs &euro;2.5 million.  When I say &quot;only&quot;, I am benchmarking that against the &euro;10 million in performance bonuses.  We will have a lot of angry people if it is not granted, for the simple reason that it makes no sense to pay bonuses when we have poor infrastructure and people are paying for it one way or the other by having to actually buy water for the whole month of August.<br/><br/>I am glad to see that we have the initiative now to separate and bring in water as an entity on its own.  The constitutional referendum was promised and I assume it will come in time.  I believe we are paying currently.  We have an infrastructure that is 60 or 70 years old, particularly in rural Ireland.  There has been no effort to replace it.  All we keep doing is putting a sticking plaster on it.  It is not working from the point of view of value for money.  Three weeks ago, I saw a story about leaks on the front page of my local newspaper, <i>Wexford People</i>.  We have a man in Wexford, John Hayes, with a leak in his garden that expends 3 l of water per minute.  In the 56 years he has lived there, he estimates that 88 million l have been lost.  It is treated water.  The council has tested it but it cannot find the source.  He says that at that rate he has piped it in a way that his garden does not flood.  How much is it costing us to lose 88 million l of water for which we cannot find the source?<br/><br/>I know the Minister is passionate about the environment and believes this has to happen in respect of the whole country but &euro;1.2 billion into the budget of Uisce &Eacute;ireann will go nowhere unless we start to join dots, take practical measures and listen to our local engineers.  We have spent &euro;500,000 of EU money cleaning up farms in the area and still we cannot make a straightforward decision.  It is nonsensical that there has to be a competition as to who gets what first.  I appeal for a more practical approach.  We could save the Department of Education &euro;150,000 to and we could probably use the balance of the money left from the EU fund to start to do the same thing with farmers in Kilmore in respect of effluent treatment.  Lots of things could be done.  We can save the county councils the &euro;5,000 grants provided to upgrade septic tanks.  These are all the things we could do to save money if we connected Ramsgrange to the wastewater treatment plant.</p></speech>

The funding for these two projects was ring-fenced for the duration of Irish Water's third revenue control period, RC3, although the company could not access the fund for diversion of projects.  Irish Water is now proposing that the ring-fenced funding be used broadly across the portfolio to absorb the impact of inflationary pressure, given that the money will not be utilised for the drainage or water supply project within the revenue control period as originally intended.</p>  <p>  I refer to rural areas.  There was &euro;410 million for the greater Dublin area and &euro;294 million for the water supply project which is to bring water from the Shannon Estuary to Dublin.  How many sewerage systems in the counties could be upgraded with this money?  People in Askeaton have been waiting for 36 years now for an upgrade and there is water going into the Shannon.  There is water going from Drumcolliher to the Deel and reports show that the State is the biggest polluter in the country through the local authorities.  It is not the farmers or anyone else.  The local authorities are the biggest polluters.</p>  <p>  In my own investigations in Limerick, I found out that no major investment will be made in the county's sewerage plants to allow for extra capacity.  Only the upgrade of the existing capacity of sewerage systems is provided for.  I just mentioned Drumcolliher and Askeaton.  Oola is another case.  I will take the Minister of State around the county and show him where the local authority is polluting.  That means I cannot build houses in these areas for people to return home because there is no infrastructure.  The money the Government is allocating for the likes of the Dublin area could be redeployed into all the counties.  I have heard other speakers saying this.  Infrastructure in all these towns and villages could be upgraded but the Government is making an allocation of &euro;704 million for Dublin.  If we had the proper infrastructure, we would have the proper houses being built and our schools, businesses and everything else would be sustainable.</p>  <p>  All I am hearing tonight is stories about the shortfall of water and sewerage capacity around the country and Deputies looking for funding to fix sewerage and water systems to provide an adequate water supply.  All the Minister of State is telling us is that existing systems will be upgraded with no additional capacity and there is no money to do anything else.  We are waiting for a water supply to build 100 houses in Croom.  Eight months ago, we had Irish Water before a committee at which its representatives guaranteed me we would have letters for the contractors to get those houses built.  That letter is only coming this week.  We waited eight months to get a letter to say we would have water in Croom to build 100 houses, a nursing home and a cr&egrave;che.  These projects were held up for 12 months as waited for a letter to say there would be adequate water in Croom.  Croom Medical is expanding and adding 80 jobs.  Its biggest concern is how it will get people into these jobs because of the lack of housing in the area.  We have 100 houses that would help that business be sustainable because people could move to the likes of Croom, which is a 15-minute commute from Limerick city.  That is how important it is to get funds into local areas so we can build our businesses.</p>  <p>  People in rural areas pay the highest transport costs because there is no industry in their areas due to a lack of infrastructure.  If Covid has taught us anything, it is that the farming sector in these areas are the people who kept food on our tables.  Some of these farmers could not get adequate water even for the cattle they were trying to feed because of the lack of infrastructure, yet it was okay for the Government to try to allocate &euro;704 million to bring water to Dublin from the Shannon.  Is there any other county in Ireland bar Dublin?</p> <p>Are the people in every other county in this country as important as the people in Dublin?  The problem is the Government overpopulated Dublin to the point where it is now bursting at the seams.  The grandparents and the parents have no hope of any of their children returning because it is at capacity.  It is common sense to put in infrastructure in the other areas and deploy people back out into the country where they belong.  We can create employment there ourselves, if we have the basic infrastructure of water and sewerage.  A basic need is not a lot to ask for.</p> <p> I came to Dublin last Monday morning.  I came in by Kildare at about 5.30 a.m.  The traffic on the road trying to get into Dublin was absolutely unbelievable.  I could not believe it.  It was 5.30 a.m. on a Monday and I was going to a medical appointment with my son.  I asked where all the cars were going at 5.30 a.m.  The factories and so on have changed their hours and have asked the staff to come in at 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. instead of 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. because of the congestion in Dublin.  If any of us leave here after 4 p.m. to try to head home, we might as well sit here until 7.30 p.m. given the time it takes us to get out of here.  There is the same problem when trying to get in.  That speaks for itself.</p> <p> Dublin is at bursting point.  The infrastructure in Dublin is also at bursting point.  There are areas around this country where if the Government spent money on proper infrastructure, we would get industry.  We would have houses, people would want to move there and we would have industry.  If we had people in these areas, the Government could then put something together for a proper transport sector.  That is why the infrastructure is in Dublin.  The Government shoved everyone into Dublin to try to get infrastructure, but it starved the rest of the country.  If the Government believes in the rest of the country and builds infrastructure there, the country will supply it with what it needs.  That is common sense.  That is representation and looking outside the fold.  That is looking at everything we see.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was here while we were talking about ESB and transport costs.  They do not apply to Dublin because it does not have them.  It has the ESB costs, but does not have all of the other associated costs that we have to deal with.  When or if the lights go out this year, it will be the fault of forward planning.  First, you put infrastructure in, like I said to the Minister tonight, and then you can build for the future.  If the Government invests money now in rural areas, there will be infrastructure.  However, we have to make sure that Irish Water spends the money in the areas where we want to rebuild and deploy people and not give it a free hand to get involved in massive projects that will not represent this country as a whole.  </p> <p> Every representative here represents different counties.  It is the duty of every Deputy or Minister to get funding for their county.  Now the pressure is coming on the Government to deliver.  Like the Ministers in my county of Limerick, the Ministers of State, Deputies Collins and O&rsquo;Donovan, Ministers in every county are now bringing down Ministers to open everything and start spending a few euro.  What were they doing for the past ten or 15 years when our county sent them here to bring the money home to put in infrastructure?  What did they do?  Now there is social media and they can be found out for what they are not doing for their county and now they are running.  My job is to make them spend the money in Limerick and I will make sure that they deliver for Limerick.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.592" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500074#AAAA00200"><p>I am delighted to speak on this issue.  I have huge concerns about Irish Water.  I have fond respect for county council management from the time I was on the council.  I salute some of them who have gone on to their eternal reward and some who are still working in it, including engineers, ordinary water caretakers and council outdoor staff and, indeed, indoor staff who did, and who do, a tremendous job.  They were and are accountable.  Now, the Government is trying to force many of them into Irish Water with no certainty or future.  It is totally unfair.  I originally opposed the setting up of Irish Water.  It is a white elephant and a monstrosity.  First, it is lacking in basic knowledge.  I met water caretakers who had intimate knowledge of every stopcock, air valve and sluice valve in the systems in the areas.  One such person, PJ Cullinan, who is very sick at the moment was a wonderful caretaker as was Joe Carrigan.  There are many more.  Tommy Hartigan looked after Clonmel as if it was his own fiefdom.</p>  <p>  For the umpteenth time this year, Clonmel, the second biggest inland town in the country, is on a boil water notice this week.  In addition, there are water outages.  Areas of Tipperary are totally neglected, including the Commons, Ballingarry, Lismalin, Moyglass, Fethard, Ballinure and Dualla.  We have outages but nobody to report them to.  Lay people who are concerned about water tell me that if they call Irish Water on Friday night, they will not get anyone to call them back until Sunday.  It is shocking.</p>  <p>  While I love the c&uacute;pla focal Gaeilge agus is maith liom an t-ainm "Uisce &Eacute;ireann", this new company being set up will be another failure.  First, it is not accountable to anybody.  It is not responsible to the elected representatives or anybody else.  I am not saying responsible in the wrong way, but it will not come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Who does this Government think it is fooling?  Did it not learn from its mistakes when the former Minister, Phil Hogan, wryly smiled and said he would turn down the water to a trickle?  The Government will do the same now with the power.  It will not be a trickle; it will be an outage.  You cannot turn down the power because it will destroy every motor, every dishwasher and everything else.  The Government will just turn it off.  It thinks it can do this and get away with it.  That is what it was inadvertently planning for by closing peat-fired power stations and everything else but I will not go into that debate.</p>  <p>  I refer to the whole situation of water in Dublin.  I have nothing against the people of Dublin.  Many people from my county came to Dublin to live.  However, the whole charade of pipeline from the Shannon through Tipperary and several other counties into Dublin is an white elephant.  Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned the money ringfenced for Dublin, the water pipe and other Dublin sewerage and water schemes, which will cost &euro;700 million.  What would that do for all the villages?  I could name 30 of them in Tipperary.</p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Connolly talking earlier about very wonderful areas in Galway that I know.  They are famous places where there is raw sewage is spilling into the sea.  If farmer has an accidental spillage, he is prosecuted and persecuted.  It is a charade.  The genie is out of bottle.  The Government will not stop.  The biggest polluters are local authority housing estates but Irish Water does not have the money to deal with them.  Many treatment plants are at a very advanced stage of planning, design and everything else but they are all buried because of Irish Water.  It could find &euro;10 million to pay in bonuses.  What are the bonuses for?  They are for being the worst, most inefficient company that ever entered the public realm.  Yet it paid out &euro;10 million in bonuses because that is the structure.  That is the twisted, pernicious make up of the structure and set up of the company.  I know good people who left the county councils when this happened because they were so hurt.  They loved their jobs and looking after the people.  They were excellent public servants and they just bailed out because of this nonsense, and it is nonsense. </p>  <p>  I know one caretaker who is about to retire in two months.  He told Irish Water officials he would give them all of the information about the area, which had been handed down from other workers who had retired, but they just laughed at him.  However, now they cannot find the valve, the sluice valve and the turn-off point.  They are doing more damage with their outages because they are digging and poking around in the dark.  Is rud uaf&aacute;sach &eacute; sin and it is just not acceptable.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State is from the Green Party, which has its ideas.  I tabled a Topical Issue matter about the Shannon pipeline.  I want to salute Councillor Seamie Morris, Ms Emma Fitzpatrick, who did a report, and others in Tipperary who are opposed to this mad, bonkers plan to pipe water to Dublin from the Shannon and to have up to 47% of it leak into leaky pipes in Dublin.  One must remember how the water leaks out.  If there are outages and stoppages, all the stuff leaks back in and no one is even thinking about the contaminants coming back into the system.  That is a bonkers plan and I raised it here with one of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues.</p> <p>He read out the typical reply from the Minister, Deputy Ryan, today, but then he met me afterwards when we were leaving the Chamber and told me that he 100% agrees with me.  The Green Party is all about saving the economy, not building motorways and stopping big projects but this massive project is going to go through the Golden Vale and all the other counties to pump water to Dublin, whereas if the leaks had been fixed, there would be no need for it.  The Government had the ideal opportunity to fix the leaks during Covid when there was no traffic in Dublin.  Did it do so?  Not at all.  There is no forward thinking; not an ounce of it.</p> <p> There is a water treatment plant planned for Clonmel.  It has been planned for nearly a decade now.  There is a landowner who is willing to give a site.  I mentioned him previously.  Jimmy Harney pursued that project and got it to a certain stage.  There is still not a sign of it, though.  It was going to take water onto the farm of Donal Lyons, who has agreed to sell the site and has seemingly signed contracts but there is no sign of it happening. That would provide for the town of Clonmel, where there is industry and households that have to put up with boil water notices and outages every week.  I could go on to mention most of the towns in the area.  The situation is the same in Carrick-on-Suir.  Those towns have treatment plants, but what about all the villages, including my own village of Newcastle?  We cannot build a henhouse because the treatment centre is not a treatment centre; it is a big septic tank.  I can keep going.  Burncourt, Lisvernane, Bansha, Monard, Solohead - anywhere you want to go; they are all there.  Some of them do not even have tanks.  It is disgraceful.  The Government brought out a mockery of a septic tank grant which could not be assessed.  One had to do the work first.  It was only seven or eight or ten sites in south Tipperary and maybe ten more in north Tipperary that were even tested.  It was all a big PR message.  In Golden village, there is raw sewage spewing into the River Suir.  It is one of the best river salmon and trout fisheries that we have, yet raw sewage is spewing into it every hour of every day.  The Minister of State knows the consequences of that but we hear the talk from the Government about a green and clean environment and making people freeze and be without light and making industry be without energy this winter.  All this patent nonsense is going on as well.  </p> <p> I want to salute recent retirees from Tipperary County Council who did tremendous work.  Two former directors of services, Pat Slattery and Clare Curley, were fine public officials.  A number of engineers, including Willie Corby and Eoin Powell and others are retiring now after many years of service.  I thank them and wish them well.  They will be a huge loss to the system but the system does not care any more.  Irish Water does not want to know the county councils.  I ring it regularly.  I also want to thank the plumbers and the supervisors, such as Pat Fitzgerald and many others whom I have to contact because you might as well write to Santa Claus as try to phone Irish Water.  There is no information.  It is like an answering service.  They do not know what county you are in, not to mind what parish you are in.  It is a shocking situation.  I know of people who will ring Irish Water about a major burst pipe that will do huge damage to the road as well as being a waste of water but they cannot get through to anyone.  They ring the Garda and it tells them to ring their public representative or to ring me.  That is the way it has gone.  It is patent nonsense.</p> <p> The Government is now going ahead with this without proper legislation or proper scrutiny mechanisms to make sure the company will be accountable to somebody, there will be audits and it will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the waste and the way they waste money.  I am appealing to the Minster of State, as a green Minister, to stop this mad and devastating project that is going to destroy the flora and fauna and the landscape for all that distance just to pump water up here for it leak it into the ground.  It is patent nonsense.</p> <p> As I said in a debate last night, it is the men in white coats who should be coming to take ye away.  The Government needs to fix the leaks in Dublin.  I have nothing against Dublin people.  They are entitled to clean water.   During the drought this year, we did not have enough water at Ardnacrusha to keep our plants going but the Government is going to pump that much water up to Dublin for it to leak.  It is nonsense.  It is bonkers and a failed decision by previous Governments.  I do not know why the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and their colleagues now acquiesce with this project and keep it going, but it is not going to be a reliable source because the water is not there.  Dublin has heaps of water at Poulaphouca.  There are plenty of bore wells that can be sunk in Dublin to supply the city and its people and give them plenty of water.  It is just not acceptable that the Government has kept this project going.</p> <p> As I said, Emma Fitzpatrick has done a tremendous report on the situation.  That report is there to be debated and examined and is available for independent scrutiny.  It lays bare the fallacy and the nature of the concept of the project the Government is doing, as well as the figures.  The figures will triple.  It will be like the children's hospital - another runaway money train with no accountability.</p></speech>

I may as well say that before I came into this House I worked as a water services caretaker for Donegal County Council for 16 years.  Unfortunately, in spite of the positive words that have been said about caretakers in the debate tonight, that is going to be lost under the Bill because that system is gone and will be gone through Irish Water as well.   I do not believe that anybody can tell me that will not be the case.  Sadly, that is the reality of the situation.  There is no doubt that local staff knew the situation on the ground and worked their best and hardest to make a bad system that existed under the local authorities work.  They could contribute more and have an easier time of it if the system was run properly but that will not happen now.  I will get to it later on, but what Irish Water staff will be doing in the future is managing private contractors and that is probably all they will be doing.</p>  <p>  I wish to explicitly state that in the context of the effort to update outdated systems, I am completely against the Government's numerous attempts to take power away from local authorities and its continuous moves towards outsourcing and privatisation of our water supply.  In terms of resources, there is absolutely no difference between what is needed now and what was needed before Irish Water was created, except that Irish Water packaged it differently and presented it on a national basis.  There probably was a commitment to publish and fund more by the Government to make it look like Irish Water was some sort of dynamic company that was solving all of our water problems that were never highlighted before, which it actually was not doing.</p>  <p>  The Bill before the House states that the aim of the legislation is to supposedly create a national publicly owned regulated water services utility under Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  I am aware that this legislation provides for the separation of Irish Water from the Ervia group but does not contain provisions in respect of the parallel Irish Water transformation process involving the transfer of local authority staff to Irish Water.  The ongoing disputes between Irish Water and council staff have significant relevance in this context, however.  We know that workers from the 31 local authorities do not want to work directly for Irish Water and were against the phasing out of the current system of service level agreements.  This move to rename and make Uisce &Eacute;ireann is a way to get the workers to accept the change and buy into it but Uisce &Eacute;ireann will continue to use contractors to supply and run our water infrastructure.  When the workers all agree to move to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, we will see the phasing out of direct employment other than managers managing the contracts of private water workers.  That is the reality of what will happen, sadly, because the days of local people who actually know their local areas being involved in water services and responsible for them are gone.  In a huge number of cases they went the extra mile to ensure the water services would survive and be able to manage and work in the area.  The day I started on Donegal County Council, the local engineer came down to meet me.  He told me that although I might think the job should not be a vocation, it would become a vocation.  I laughed at him and told him I was not looking for a vocation; I was looking for a job that would pay me a wage at the end of the week.  What actually happens, however, is that because you are left with sole responsibility for this network and looking after water - providing water for all your neighbours.  You go the extra mile to make sure you can do it.  You end up working night and day and Sundays and everything like that to make sure it actually works for your neighbours and friends and community.  That will be lost in the system.</p>  <p>  I understand the staff in the council water services have not been given an opportunity to have their say on this legislation.  That should be done first, before even bringing the legislation to this House.  It seems that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is to nominate one director but it will have to allow the Minister to choose between at least two candidates.  Why should the Minister get to pick who will be the representative of the workers?  As citizens of Ireland, this is our water and we are all invested in it, yet the Minister gets to pick those whom he wants for the board.  Surely there should be a public interest representation on the board as well.  We can add to the above that we saw how out of touch previous Ministers were on this.  That was obvious in 2014, 2015 and 2016 when Phil Hogan, Alan Kelly and Simon Coveney all did the exact opposite of what the public wanted.  Experience has shown us that the Irish people cannot trust politicians to act in their interests.</p>  <p>  There is always the possibility of something that should be inextricably linked to this legislation, that is, a referendum on the future of water.  I have been speaking to water activists from all over the country, including those involved in the right to water protests, and we are all aware that water is still among the most profitable non-financial assets on the planet.  The Government and major multinationals are also aware of that - probably more so than the community.  That is why there was a rush to privatise water.  Whether it is admitted or not, there is an appetite to privatise our water system.</p> <p>There is talk about why we want to have it in the Constitution and why it should be in the Constitution.  A very interesting aside is that when Portugal went into a bailout the Troika could not touch the housing system in Portugal because in the Portuguese constitution housing was a protected right of citizens.  What did the Troika do here?  With the active participation of Fine Gael and everybody else they destroyed the housing system and look at the mess we are in today.  That is why it is vitally important that Irish Water is properly protected in the Irish Constitution to ensure that it will not be privatised by the Government or anybody else in the future.  </p> <p> The water activists and the water workers have two major concerns in regard to the referendum.  First, what is the wording of the referendum?  It has been six years since the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) Bill 2016 was put forward by Deputy Joan Collins and unanimously passed in this House.  We still do not have sight of a wording for a constitutional amendment.  Talk about undermining the democratic wishes of the nation and the democratic structures of the State.  We do not want simply to enshrine Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann in the Constitution.  We need to ensure that the following wording is used: "The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.  The Government shall ensure in the public interests that this resource remains in public ownership and management."  Anything less will allow privatisation through the back door.  Second, we will need to make sure that the amendment is placed in Article 28, section 4(2)(i) rather than, if we even have an amendment, the Government will intend it to be in the section of the Constitution which means that the courts will have to decide.  We want to place it in the right section of the Constitution where our human right to water is in conflict with the ownership of our water system by some Irish oligarch or international vulture fund and some Supreme Court judge decides whose right is sacrosanct.  We need the amendment placed in the governance section of the Constitution.  </p> <p> Now water workers and water activists across the country are watching to make sure that this is not a symbolic or tokenistic measure.  Only a meaningful referendum to protect our water system will be satisfactory.  That is vitally important.  I know for a fact that the Government will not come up with this meaningful referendum, if it comes up with a referendum at all.  Yesterday the Taoiseach was answering questions on this during Leaders' Questions.  He actually said that we did not need a referendum, that the Government was doing everything to protect water.  If that is the case we are in big trouble because sadly this Government will not protect water.  That is why it has to be in their founding document, in the Constitution, and in the right section of the Constitution.  I have no doubt that the intention of this Government and previous Governments will be not to have it in that section because that will restrict them in what they actually do.  It will restrict them privatising and selling it off.  Have we not learned from what happened with Eircom?  We should learn from those mistakes.  This is vital public infrastructure and it has to stay in public ownership; that is the reality of the situation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500076#CCCC00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this.  I will first say I am the chairman of a group water scheme.  We run it ourselves voluntarily.  We do not need Irish Water or anyone else, thankfully; we do it ourselves.  There is a great community in our area.  I want to make that clear.  I probably have an advantage over most people where I would have dug and laid it, filled it in and scoured it and done everything with water down through the years.</p>  <p>  I listened to the speakers and the debate earlier on the motion from the Regional Group Members.  As I said before, EU law over the years has broken things up and it is heading this way with Bord Gais.  It was heading this way with many things but it has failed.  Water, energy, light, fuel coming into a country, and health, need to be held and we need to ensure those basic necessities are in State control.  If not, communities can do their own thing as we are doing, but in general it is necessary for a country to have that security of supply.  There is a big problem with water.  We had a few fine days, damn all to be frank about it, and then I saw on the television there were hosepipe bans and the need to conserve water.  We are on life support if that is how our water system is.  The first thing this Government should do is to show faith to workers because there is a debate going on that everyone is aware of.  I understand that is not on this Bill tonight but the first thing the Government should do is say it is prepared to put that to the people in a referendum to keep it in State ownership.  That is paramount for anybody and needs to be part of any negotiations for workers&rsquo; security.  </p>  <p>  There is a current debate about whether water should be brought to Dublin.  In my opinion there should be four spurs coming out of the pipe that is talked about for Lough Derg.  For balanced regional development there should be one to the west, one to the south, one towards the north and one towards the east, for the simple reason that at the moment there are 66 plants in Leinster on life support in the line of water.  Forget about Dublin.  They are in serious trouble because the sources they have are not good enough.  That is the bottom line.  Put Dublin in on top of that.  </p>  <p>  Leaks need fixing.  Someone said earlier that meters should not be installed.  Forget the debate about paying or not paying.  The reason for putting in a meter for anyone who ever worked in water is so that you can look at the little red wheel going around and it tells you if there is a leak in the area.  On a half-inch pipe this enables about 3,000 gallons of water a day to be saved if it is bad leak.  There is no point in wasting water.  </p>  <p>  Something else needs to be done on which the Government should be proactive.  At the moment another EU piece of legislation &ndash; God bless them &ndash; on water abstraction relates to water coming from rivers and lakes, which will be controlled by the State.  The water will come along the river and into the lake and on further again to be taken out somewhere to be treated.  We are taking it up and putting it through the full treatment system, which costs millions of euro throughout the country.  We are going to UV it, chlorinate it, and then send it back around again.  That is sound, people need that done for themselves, but the cattle will also get chlorinated water.  If Johnny Farmer decides to put a pump on the river or the lake he will be a criminal.  That is not what we should be doing.  We should actually give a grant to Johnny Farmer to bring water out from the river, to put in the rings and make sure that he pumps it without having to UV it, treat or chlorinate it.  That would be common sense especially in an energy crisis when we are pumping it that way to come back this way to go down there and drink it again.  </p>  <p>  EU legislation comes in here and is not being thought through.  What we are doing is madness at times.  Cattle do not need chlorinated water yet around the country most of them are drinking it.  In fairness to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there are some grants under targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, for rainwater harvesting and that is a good thing.  I am in favour of that and we need to do it.  </p>  <p>  The Bill that is coming in on splitting Uisce &Eacute;ireann from Ervia is a good thing because I have worked in water over the years.  When we were putting in a local scheme the rates were tight and basically it was a transport box, a tractor, a JCB and a few people.  That was the phrase we used.  I know it was more technical than that but the phrase was that the job was tight.  Once Irish Water came in and Ervia had influence on it, the Lord God there were so many people in offices that you had to have a bit of paper for this and a programme going ahead and every type of stuff was dreamt out of the sky on how to do a job.  The taxpayer is paying for it, and that is the problem.  We have now probably raised the price of the same meter by five to six times what it costs.  </p> <p>It even came down to saying that if you had a white van, you could put Irish Water across it.  That all comes, in my opinion, from the Ervia side of it.  I remember when Irish Water was set up and I pay tribute to people such as Jerry Grant who started, as they say, at the bottom and who worked his way up.  He was a practical person in Irish Water, as was Michael O'Leary, in fairness to them.  There are good people within Irish Water.</p> <p> There is one problem for us, however, as politicians at the moment.  If you have a leak, with no disrespect intended you might have someone who might not know a lot about water and you may have no idea what that person is saying to you.  You are trying to solve a leak and to get a leak allowance.  I even saw in the past few days where someone told my office that where a leak was within the house or building, a leak allowance cannot be given.  The leak has to be from the meter on the pipe on the way into the house.  If it is in the floor underneath, where you did not see it, lo and behold that is your tough luck.  Anyone who says that has not got a bull&rsquo;s clue about water in their life.  </p> <p> Another thing they have said is that if you have not reported the leak within three months, the company will not deal with it.  That is not the way to treat people.  If someone comes and fixes a leak, people will be more proactive.  There should be an education in this country about encouraging people once a fortnight or every three weeks to look at their meter or the company should make it easier to do so.  This is because with the new gear that is out there, you can go along the road and read the meter from the computer and you are putting a little block over it.  You would need a magnifying glass now to look down to find where it is working.  The company should make it easy for people and work with them.  People will conserve water if there is any way they can do that.  </p> <p> In addition to that, Irish Water needs a very significant budget for many years to come.  If you look at the ratios of money spent in Dublin as against the countryside, it is significantly different.  As has been said earlier by many Deputies, a great number of towns have no wastewater treatment or sewage plant or anything like that and of course the farmer gets kicked about it.  Sooner or later, whatever is in the town will straggle its way down to the river but as the farmer is the other side of the river, he or she will be blamed for this.  I welcome what I see in Ahascragh at the moment, where the company is finishing a job.  That is great.  I also know that an upgrade is coming in Ballymoe, County Galway.  I will tell Members the reason.  It is because of a river called the Island river.  The media will talk about all of these farmers, what they are doing and not doing, and they are wrong no matter which way they turn.  The facts are that this river is one of the most pristine in Ireland.  When it comes along and meanders through all the agricultural land, it is tested every way.  There is a meeting next Monday night where the results will be given.  It is one of the most pristine rivers but when it comes into Ballymoe, because the upgrade had not been done on the sewage treatment plant there, the river is damaged there.  That is what is happening in Wexford, Kildare, Connemara, Kerry, Donegal and wherever.  It is "not in my back door" stuff.  That aspect needs to be looked at.</p> <p> On the water abstraction issue, we should be looking at it in a totally different way than basically saying to a farmer that we want to know how much water he or she is taking out and all of that.  No one goes pumping water for the crack up and down the road.</p> <p> The other thing that is required is that companies such as Irish Water need to tighten up on the rigmarole it is involved in and this Bill might help it in that regard, because Ervia was obsessed with paperwork, procedures and all such things.  </p> <p> The one thing that Irish Water needs to do in the talks that are going on at the moment is to ensure, as has been pointed out earlier, it recognises there is a wealth of knowledge.  I know the caretakers, for example, around our country.  You can ring them at any time and in fairness, they are mighty people.  We need to ensure that those people are happy at their work, whether it is with the council or is with Irish Water.  If you talk to them, they are all reasonable people.  Many of them are afraid that there is not a future.  The first step for the future is to give reassurance about something by ensuring that a referendum is done on water and that such an opportunity is there.</p></speech>

I feel like I have been managing the Irish Water hotline for the past three hours but I will try to respond to some of the issues.</p>  <p>  I will say specifically on operational issues and issues that have been raised by Deputies here this evening that those are matters for Irish Water.  Members will be pleased to know that Irish Water has been invited to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee on housing on 4 October to discuss issues around water quality and supply and I am sure that will be of interest to Members also.</p>  <p>  I will speak specifically also on the issues raised by Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Connolly on Inishbofin and Inisheer where that issue of communication is critically important.  The fact that it took that length of time to communicate the issues around the manganese highlight that it is very important that as soon as an issue arises, that it is communicated effectively to local communities.  The islands are particularly vulnerable and it is very important that Irish Water communicate and work swiftly to try to address those particular issues.  We will ask Irish Water to respond on behalf of those two particular issues, without singling out all of the issues that have been raised by Members tonight, which are of great importance to their own communities and which is something in itself.  It is important to also note the good work that is being done by Irish Water around the country.  Deputy Fitzmaurice has alluded to how there have been some very good successes.  </p>  <p>  This Bill, however, which we are discussing here this evening is a technical Bill on the separation of Irish Water from Ervia and it is those issues which we want to discuss at this point.  There has been quite a bit of revisionism and rewriting of history where we are treading over old, well-worn ground but this Bill is about looking forward, about the provision of safe, secure water for people and communities and protecting and improving our water resources, rivers, lakes and estuaries for the future.  In particular, I want to refer to the comments by Deputies Barry and Paul Murphy in what I see as scaremongering references to &ldquo;Water charges 2.0&rdquo;, water charges by the back door and privatisation.  That is not the case and we all want the same thing.  We all want to ensure that we have a public utility that is effective and delivers for the people.  They talk about outsourcing and design, build and operate contracts, DBOs.  As far as I recall, when I was on the local authority from 2004, DBOs were used routinely by local authorities to deliver water infrastructure.  I want to refute any of those comments that this is what is being attempted here.  It is quite clearly not the case.  </p>  <p>  The main issue that Members have raised here this evening has been on the referendum and the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee and I will just go through those matters quickly, if that is okay.  On the referendum, I will note that and mention it to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  In the context of Deputy Joan Collins's Private Member's Bill that was spoken about, extensive work has been undertaken by the Department and by the Attorney General's office to consider possible approaches to advancing the referendum proposal.  This will be an approach based on protecting the public ownership of the entity established under law to provide public water services, that is Irish Water, which has been identified as the most appropriate and straightforward approach.  Having consulted with colleagues in government, the Minister has signalled his willingness to support a referendum on public ownership along these lines and it is something to which we are giving consideration.  A number of referendums have been proposed in the programme for Government but it is important when considering this that there is adequate public engagement, and noting that the Housing Commission has been specifically tasked with advising the Government on a referendum to place the right of housing in the Constitution, it would make sense that the constitutional issues around the right to housing and the protection of the public supply of water would be considered, possibly, at the same time.  I cannot give a definitive time or date as to when the referendum would take place but I will say that it is being advanced as a matter of urgency by Government.  </p>  <p>  Other points were raised specifically by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in particular in respect of the recommendations of the committee.</p> <p>On the issue of transformation and the availability of documents and clarity on staff, we note the Deputy&rsquo;s comments and, hopefully, we will seek to deal with those during Committee Stage.  I will not go into the issues around the operational and legal status of workers.  However, we did take on board the recommendation to provide for the attendance of the chief executive and the chairperson of Irish Water at the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p> I will try to deal with the other issues raised by Members in the time I have remaining.  Many comments were raised about local authority staff, the fantastic work they do and the dedication they bring to their work, which I acknowledge.  That dedication, along with their service and their skills and knowledge, is also something they bring to their continuing work with Irish Water.  Most of the issues raised largely related to operational matters and I am not going to dwell on them because these are matters for Irish Water.  It is important that Irish Water will take up that opportunity on 4 October to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee to discuss issues relating to water supply and water quality.</p> <p> At the beginning, I outlined the provisions of this Bill, which is focused on separating Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann from Ervia and its establishment as a stand-alone authority for water services.  The Bill provides that Irish Water will be known only in its Irish name, Uisce &Eacute;ireann, and that it will cease to be a subsidiary of Ervia.  Again, issues were raised by Members about the renaming of Irish Water but I believe that is something they should welcome in terms of the Irish language.  The Bill acknowledges the character of Uisce &Eacute;ireann as the national authority for water services, with responsibility for the functions assigned to it under the Water Services Acts, 2007 to 2022.  The Bill amends the current shareholding arrangements and enhances its governance arrangements.  Significantly, the Bill provides for Uisce &Eacute;ireann's accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p> I reiterate that this Bill is solely concerned with the legal separation of a parent company and its subsidiary, and setting up that subsidiary as a stand-alone company in its own right.  The Bill does not in any way deal with the transformation process and the movement to Irish Water of local authority staff who are currently carrying out water services under service level agreements with Irish Water, which is a separate matter.</p> <p> As mentioned earlier, due to the introduction of the new and complex accountability and auditing arrangements, it is in the best interests of both Irish Water and the Oireachtas that a legal separation takes effect on 1 January 2023.  It is simpler and more straightforward from an accounting perspective that the Comptroller and Auditor General is allowed to start its financial auditing of Irish Water from the start of next year.  The Committee of Public Accounts will then be in a position to examine such accounts following the audit of a full year's accounts.</p> <p> I hope that when we vote on the Bill, it will continue to receive the support of the House, and I welcome the support of the parties this evening.  The Bill delivers on the programme for Government commitment to retain Irish Water in public ownership as a national stand-alone regulated utility.  I thank all Deputies for their valuable input to the debate.  Again, we welcome continuing engagement on the next Stages of the Bill.  It is hugely important that we move forward in a spirit of positivity for the people of Ireland, for the communities all over the country that Members have spoken about and for our water quality and water services provision.  This Bill is important as a significant step forward in addressing that.  I look forward to continuing engagement on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500078#EEEE00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister for Health, I am pleased to address the House on the Bill, which is fundamentally about health practitioners, the individuals who work tirelessly to deliver the health and social care services on which we, as patients, rely.  It is about ensuring we have a safe workforce, that patients are protected and that if a complaint is made, it can be investigated as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, our regulated health professionals are governed by six regulatory bodies, two of which, the Medical Council and CORU - Regulating Health &amp;amp; Social Care Professionals, are the subject of the measures in this Bill.  When it comes to setting the standards for education, training experience and practice for the respective professions, the regulators are the experts.  They also have responsibility for taking action if a complaint is made.  The measures proposed in the Bill are very much guided by the advice given to the Department of Health by the regulators.</p>  <p>  I will provide a brief overview of the most important measures the Bill addresses before discussing them in more detail.  As Deputies will be aware, social care work is one of the professions that CORU is in the process of regulating.  Measures in this Bill will ensure that when the social care workers registration board opens, those applying for registration during the transition period will have to meet the same standards that applied to CORU's other professions.  The Bill also addresses a number of issues relating to medical practitioners.  First, it will enable holders of UK medical degrees to once again apply for intern registration with the Medical Council.  This, in turn, will allow these graduates to take up an offer by the HSE of an intern training post in an Irish hospital were such an offer to be made.  It also addresses several of the technical issues related to the registration of doctors.</p>  <p>  The Bill will also support the complaints investigation function of the Medical Council by allowing the CEO to appoint external experts to provide advice and assistance.  To address these issues, it is necessary to amend three separate Acts: the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005; Medical Practitioners Act 2007; and Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act 2020.  Before explaining the Bill&rsquo;s provisions in more detail, I will provide the House with some background regarding each of the Acts being amended.</p>  <p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act currently provides for the statutory regulation of 12 professions, with a further six professions, including social care workers, to be regulated.  Regulation under the Act is mainly achieved by protection of professional titles.  This means that only someone who is on the register for a profession may call themselves by that title.  For example, if someone calls himself or herself a physiotherapist and he or she is not on the register, he or she has committed an offence and may be prosecuted.  The Act established registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Medical Practitioners Act provides for the regulation of doctors in the State.  One of the council's main responsibilities is the registration of medical practitioners.  It holds the register, determines the divisions and sets the terms and conditions that doctors must meet to secure and retain registration.  The council is also responsible for the investigation of complaints against registered doctors.  While the council performs other functions, these two primary functions are central to its overall patient safety objective.</p> <p> The Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act is long and technical legislation which was enacted in October 2020.  It amends the five Acts that regulate health professionals working in the State.  These amendments are mainly in the areas of registration and fitness to practise.  The Act introduced important new patient safety measures that create more robust obligations on health professionals.  It also provides greater protections for those professionals working within our hospitals and communities.</p> <p> As the 2020 Act is bringing about significant changes to administrative processes, its sections are being commenced on a phased business.  This is to ensure each of the regulators is in a position to begin operating under the changed systems.  Of the five Acts amended by the 2020 Act, the Medical Practitioners Act saw the most significant changes to its provisions on registration and investigation of complaints systems.  Prior to commencing the sections of the 2020 Act, my officials carried out a final, thorough review to ensure the complex amendments being activated were correct.  Unfortunately, during the checking process, some technical problems were found in provisions relating to the Medical Practitioners Act.  If commenced, these would have prevented certain groups of doctors who had trained in two or more countries from joining the general division of the register.  This Bill will amend those sections to ensure they operate correctly and those difficulties are avoided.</p> <p> I will outline some main provisions of the Bill in more detail.  It has four Parts and contains 14 sections.  Part 1 provides for standard provisions, including the Short Title, commencement and definitions.</p> <p> Parts 2 to 4, inclusive, provide for the amendments to the three Acts to which I referred.  As I mentioned, CORU currently regulates 12 professionals and a further six are soon to be regulated.  Each of the professions has its own registration board, which is responsible for the registration of members of the profession.  The initial two years after a register is opened are known as the transition period.  During this period, existing practitioners can apply for registration if they satisfy a registration board that they meet certain criteria.  These criteria include either a requirement to hold an approved qualification or completing what is known as an assessment of professional competence set by a registration board.  In addition, applicants must provide evidence of two years of professional practice as a member of the profession.</p> <p> Social care workers are designated in the 2005 Act as a profession to be regulated by CORU and work is ongoing by its social care workers registration board to open the register for the profession in November 2023.  When the 2005 Act was drafted, it provided certain unique provisions for social care workers applying for registration during the transitional period.  For example, the Act provides that the registration board must register any applicant who has been practising the profession of social care work anywhere in the world for a continuous period of two years and whose employer states that he or she meets the standards for that profession.  CORU has significant concerns that this is simply not safe for patients.  Protection of vulnerable patients must always be our focus and it is clear that the measures sought by CORU, which bring social care workers into line with other professions, are necessary and proportionate.  This amendment will align the registration route requirements during the transitional period across all the CORU professions.  It will require social care workers applying through this route to complete successfully an assessment of professional competence set by their registration board.  The change will mean the registration board can stand over those applying to be placed on the register on the basis of their training and experience.</p> <p> It will also require that the necessary two-year minimum period of practice must be obtained within the State, as is required for other CORU professions.  Currently, other CORU professions can accumulate their work experience in a non-continuous way.  Periods can be added together to reach the minimum threshold of two years.  This work experience must be gained in the five-year period before the register is established.  Uniquely for social care workers, the Act requires that their two years' work experience be continuous.  This Bill will remove that requirement and non-continuous experience will now be allowed.  This harmonises social care workers with other CORU professionals.  However, in order to assist social care workers, it has been decided to retain a provision in the 2005 Act that gives them an additional two years to gain the minimum practical experience to be registered.  Instead of needing two years' professional experience prior to the date the register is established, they will have the option of gaining this experience in the two years afterwards.  This amendment will, in effect, allow those who wish to register as social care workers until the end of the transition period, which is expected to be in November 2025, to gain two years of professional practice.</p> <p> This is an important support that will give social care workers every opportunity to meet the requirements for registration.  It will also better achieve the objective of the transitional period, which is to ensure patient safety, balancing that with the rights of practitioners.  Following the opening of a register, there is, as I said, a two-year transitional period to allow existing practitioners time to apply for registration and satisfy the registration board they meet the requirements.  Practitioners can do this by way of attesting to professional experience or by holding a qualification that is acceptable for registration for existing practitioners during the transitional period.  Schedule 3 to the 2005 Act lists these qualifications.  However, Schedule 3 was drafted 17 years ago and, as Deputies will appreciate, some of its content is now out of date for professions that have not yet opened a register.  It is important that the Schedule can be kept up to date.  Therefore, the Bill includes a provision that will allow the Minister for Health to add to or amend the qualifications list in Schedule 3.  This provision will help to future-proof the Act and will ensure the necessary powers are in place to prescribe or vary the qualifications that are acceptable for practitioners.</p> <p> The remainder of the Bill addresses issues relating to medical practitioners and the operation of the Medical Practitioners Act, the first of which relates to the investigation of complaints.  The 2020 Act revised and updated the procedures to be used in the investigation of complaints against doctors.  Those investigations have typically taken quite a long time, which can cause distress for both complainants and doctors.  The changes are intended to make investigations more efficient and speedier, which will be welcomed by both doctors and complainants.  One of the most significant changes is that complaints will now be made to the CEO rather than to the preliminary proceedings committee.  Investigations will be carried out by authorised officers appointed by the CEO.  The preliminary proceedings committee will continue to be the deciding body when an investigation report is produced.  However, the changes mean that a significant amount of progress can be made by authorised officers before a committee meets.</p> <p> The Irish Medical Council is confident this will be a more efficient system and a better use of resources.  However, the Department of Health has been advised by the council that the triage of early stages of investigations of complaints is often complex and requires specialist expertise.  It is important that the CEO and the authorised officers have access to the medical and other expertise necessary to discharge their functions properly at the right stage in the complaints process.  The Bill, therefore, provides a power for the CEO to appoint certain experts and specialists to support the council, as well as making some minor amendments to the powers of authorised officers.  These amendments will ensure the investigation function is properly supported with the resources and expertise it needs, all of which goes towards the overarching objective of promoting public protection.</p> <p> The appointment of external support requires a consequential amendment to the 2007 Act, which provides immunity from liability in civil proceedings for members of the Irish Medical Council, the CEO, members of staff and certain persons appointed to assist with the investigation of complaints against doctors.  I understand this is a common protection provided for those working in this area.  The 2020 Act and the other provisions of the Bill I have described expand the cohort of people who can be appointed to assist the council in the performance of its functions.  As Deputies will appreciate, some of the work carried out by regulators is highly contested and often results in legal proceedings.  This amendment is necessary to ensure all of those who are properly appointed under the Act can carry out their work without fear of liability in civil litigation.</p> <p> I turn to an amendment relating to the eligibility of holders of UK medical degrees to apply for internship registration and internship posts in Ireland.  The Medical Practitioners Act currently restricts internship registration to graduates who have completed a course of study in the State or a member state.  Prior to Brexit, holders of UK medical degrees, by virtue of the UK being a member state, were able to apply for internships in Ireland.  For the past two years, the Act has prevented those graduates from applying.  We have a long history in Ireland of our heath and social care workers travelling back and forth to the UK to study and work.  This has been mutually beneficial to both countries and it is important that those strong ties continue.</p> <p>While I understand the number of UK graduates who take up an intern placement here is typically low, it is nevertheless important that this option remains available.  Deputies will be aware that under the common travel area agreement, Irish and British citizens have the right to access all levels of education and training, and associated student support, in each other's state on terms no less favourable than those for the citizen of that state.  While the number of graduates currently affected might be small, it is important that the letter and spirit of that agreement be fully respected.</p> <p> Deputies will be aware there are new opportunities for medical education in Northern Ireland with the opening of Ulster University's Magee campus school of medicine.  It is imperative, therefore, that graduates from Northern Ireland be eligible to apply for intern placements here.  The restoration of eligibility is something the Minister very much supports, as does the HSE and the Irish Medical Council.  I understand the application window for next year's group of interns will close before the end of this year, so the support of colleagues to progress the Bill as quickly as possible through the Houses will be greatly appreciated.</p> <p> The final element of the Bill relates to the registration of doctors on the Irish Medical Council's general division.  The 2020 Act significantly revised the registration system for doctors by separating qualification recognition from registration.  This was to enable the Medical Council to introduce important safeguards between qualification recognition and registration, such as language and fit-and-proper-person tests.  The Act also sets out the requirement to be met for recognition of qualifications and registration on all divisions of the register.  These provisions are highly technical, cross-cutting and complex and it was only during the checking process to ensure the Act's safe commencement that Department of Health officials identified difficulties for a small cohort of internationally trained doctors who were inadvertently excluded.  Were the 2020 Act to be commenced without revision, these doctors would have no route to qualification recognition and registration on the general division.  In some instances, they would be unnecessarily required to sit an additional exam.  The Minister for Health is acutely aware that the Irish health service is supported by highly skilled and caring doctors from across the world.  It is therefore important to ensure the Medical Practitioners Act continues to support the registration of doctors who meet the appropriate standards.  The Bill will change the 2020 Act to ensure no doctors will be unintentionally affected.  It is important to say no doctors have been affected by this anomaly, as it was detected prior to the sections of the 2020 Act being commenced.  </p> <p> This Bill includes some consequential and other technical amendments but the provisions I have outlined are the principal issues.  On behalf of my colleagues and the Minister for Health, I look forward to hearing Deputies' views and discussing it further</p></speech>

Last Wednesday, I attended a safety forum in Darndale.  Safety forums across the northside are meetings that take place to discuss issues of concern in the local area, attended by local city council officials and garda&iacute;.  They are an effective way for local communities to raise their concerns with local representatives, city council officials, the Garda etc.</p>  <p>  The issue of this illegal commercial dump that has been in the general Darndale area for a number of years has come to a head.  It has gone completely out of control.  I visited the dump during the week with my colleague, Councillor Alison Gilliland, and was stunned by what I saw.  There has always been a commercial dump, which has been an issue raised constantly with the city council, but now, possibly because of Covid but definitely in recent months, it is the number one issue in the area.  It is out of control and dangerous.  There are huge mounds of commercial waste and of earth.  It is being overseen in an illegal fashion as a commercial entity.</p>  <p>  I visited it again today and rats were clearly visible running around this illegal commercial dump, which is in close proximity to people's homes.  They are citing issues of ill health in the local community and are demanding that the council and other agencies of the State work to remove the dump and utilise the ground for more productive purposes.  It could be used for housing, leisure facilities or commercial entities.  There are any amount of possibilities for that spot of land, but currently it is a disgusting, unhealthy, illegal mound of commercial waste.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Councillor Gilliland, and other local councillors have called for a high-level task force to be set up.  In other areas of my constituency such a task force has been successful.  It has never been tasked with dealing with this size of a dump but that solution is being put forward as the way forward.  On Monday, there will be a meeting of the local area committee on the north-central area of Dublin City Council.  I believe the chief executive of the council has an interest in attending or, certainly, in being proactive about moving this material but it will need support from the Department and the Government because the council will not have the resources to do what needs to be done.  Is the Department familiar with the problem?  Is it liaising with Dublin City Council?  If a task force is established and a way forward decided upon, will the Department be in a position to help the council to fund such a move for the benefit of the local community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="21:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500080#GGGG00500"><p>I am taking this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Tackling illegal dumping and other waste crime is a priority for the Minister and his Department, which continues to provide substantial support to local authorities dealing with challenging waste enforcement cases.</p><p>Illegal dumping is first and foremost a matter of individual responsibility and compliance with the law.  In accordance with the provisions of the Waste Management Act 1996, each local authority is responsible for the supervision and enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area.  It is necessary to advise the House that under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it.  Under the legislation, individual local authorities are responsible for dealing with cases involving the illegal disposal of waste in their functional areas and it is a matter for them to take the appropriate enforcement and clean-up actions.  However, the national waste enforcement steering committee, NWESC, which is co-chaired by the Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has provided assistance to Dublin City Council, DCC, in relation to this site, in bringing together relevant NWESC member agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue and the Department of Social Protection to assist DCC in its efforts.  </p> <p>The operation has resulted in the impounding of vehicles used for alleged unauthorised waste activities and the initiation of prosecutions.  There are also investigations under way by DCC, with the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, into ongoing breaches of the Waste Management Act 1996.  Patrols, together with regular clean-up and maintenance operations by DCC, are continuing.</p> <p> The ultimate objective is to clean up and secure the site as part of an overall and sustainable solution, which will include the development of the site and surrounding area by DCC.  Specialist environmental consultants have been engaged by DCC to undertake environmental assessments to gauge the scale and types of waste involved and the subsequent means and level of clean-up that might be required.  The clean-up of this site will be carried out in conjunction with the overall development of the area by DCC.  Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications officials will receive further reports from DCC, via the NWESC, as this progresses.  In the interim, DCC is actively engaged at a senior level with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ongoing efforts to eliminate illegal dumping in this area.  Both the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I are fully aware of the challenges that illegal dumping poses to our regulatory authorities and the impact it has on communities.  I will be raising this directly with the Minister.</p></speech>

It is true that this is fundamentally a responsibility for the local authority but what I get from her answer is that the Department is aware of the issue, that it is engaging with the local authority, DCC, and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue.  It comes to the stage now where it requires a multi-agency approach.  It will require intervention and proactive action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure the site and it will require action by the local authority to clear the site and to ensure the future of the site is much more amenable.  The Minister of State mentioned that in her response, so I am also encouraged by that level of vision within the answer.</p>  <p>  What the residents require, however, is to be told in good faith that their representations are going somewhere.  What the Minister of State said is quite positive but they need to see action.  They need to see moves by DCC to begin to move this material.  It will need to see physical boundaries put around the compound and actions being taken.  It will need to see a Garda presence and some kind of action plan on what the future vision is for this location.  I would make the point that it has been said to me that this would not happen anywhere else and that this would not be allowed to happen anywhere else.  There is a sense of a lack of faith in the agencies of the State and a lack of faith that they care enough.  We do not want to go back to another one of these forums that is populated by public representatives, city council officials and garda&iacute; to talk to the residents if nothing has been done within that time frame.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the Minister of State's answer, I cannot but implore how important it is to the local community that it sees that the agencies of the State will work to remove something that is illegal, prosecute those who need to be prosecuted and allow this entire area to be used for the benefit of the local community, not for the destruction of that area so close to people's homes.</p></speech>

While enforcement action in this area is a matter for the local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications encourages a multifaceted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education.  In that context, the Department provides significant funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and the network of local authority waste enforcement officers.  In addition, the Department has developed the anti-dumping initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high-risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.  I will raise this directly with the Minister and come back to the Deputy on progress on this.</p></speech>

Obviously he is not here and I thank the Minister of State for coming even though it is not in her Department.  I appreciate that there are probably a lot of places she would rather be than fulfilling duties outside of her departmental remit.  Derrybrien is not directly in the Minister of State's constituency and I know the boundary between Galway East and Galway West changes occasionally but Derrybrien is pretty firmly in the Galway East constituency.  However, everybody in the country is aware of Derrybrien and what it is.  It is at the northern end of the Slieve Aughty mountain range, which comprises about 65,000 ha.  The Derrybrien wind farm is about 345 ha of that, and some 70 wind turbines were granted planning permission there.  There was quite a huge landslide in October 2003, which had a detrimental effect on the environment.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la described it as having "significant... residual effects" that cannot be fully mitigated, with "significant effects on the environment".  Ireland was taken to task by the European Commission for its failure to respect the habitats directive.  That case against Ireland was successful and there was an environmental impact assessment carried out but it was found to be inadequate as a result of that court case, rendering the planning permission effectively invalid.</p>  <p>  I do not think the wind farm should have been built and I do not think anybody would grant planning permission for it now but that is not necessarily the issue.  The issue is that it is there, the damage has been incurred and we have taken all of the downsides of it.  That includes the local community, the communities around Slieve Aughty and the environment.  The issue now is if we can obtain a benefit from it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, notwithstanding the inspector's recommendation this summer, recommended that substitute permission not be granted.  It found that there were no exceptional circumstances.  The requirement for exceptional circumstances was the subject of Supreme Court litigation where the State's planning regime was again found to be inadequate, although this time not by the European courts but by the Irish Supreme Court.  The court found that there were no exceptional circumstances and I understand and accept that we cannot reward persons for flouting planning legislation, inadvertently or advertently, which is what happened in this instance.</p>  <p>  The issue is whether a new application could and should be made.  It is not right or proper that the ESB would benefit from this, or Coillte, which is the landowner for at least part of the wind farm.  Perhaps this should be transferred to a local authority to make a new application with the explicit undertaking that any and all profits that are made from this development go back into protecting the environment of Slieve Aughty.  This would include both remediating the damage and furthermore, protecting the environment of that mountain range, which is badly damaged by that wind farm.</p> <p>That two wrongs do not make a right is, in effect, what I am suggesting.</p></speech>

To comply with the judgment, the intention was for the operator of the wind farm, an ESB subsidiary, to apply under amendments to the Planning and Development Act for "substitute consent", that is, planning permission for development requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment, following a request to make the application from the local authority, Galway County Council.  ESB lodged its application for substitute consent with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the Derrybrien wind farm on 21 August 2020.  On 4 February 2022, An Bord Plean&aacute;la decided to refuse to grant substitute consent for the wind farm development at Derrybrien.  On 15 February 2022, ESB paused the operation of the wind farm at Derrybrien following the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse to grant substitute consent.</p>  <p>  On 16 March 2022, ESB confirmed that it has decided to close the Derrybrien wind farm on a permanent basis.  The statutory timeframe for other potential objectors to bring judicial review proceedings in this matter has now expired.  On foot of the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant substitute consent for the wind farm, the environmental impact assessment, EIA, regularisation process for the Derrybrien wind farm has ended and the development is now deemed by primary legislation to be an unauthorised development.  Section 177O(5) of the Planning Act is very explicit insofar as Derrybrien is now classed as an unauthorised development and the cessation of the activity is required.  Any attempt to keep the wind farm operational would, therefore, be unlawful.  It is, therefore, subject to mandatory planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority, Galway County Council, which will carry out this function in accordance with its statutory responsibilities.</p>  <p>  There is no legal basis for Derrybrien's continued operation.  It is very important in the context of compliance with EU law that immediate steps are taken to ensure the plant is decommissioned as quickly as possible, and discontinuation of the unauthorised wind farm should be a key factor in seeking to end Ireland&rsquo;s liability to pay significant daily fines to the European Commission.  Government officials are engaging with the Commission in this regard.  It is the Government's view that the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision and the acceptance of the ESB of this decision and its stated intention to decommission Derrybrien brings the State into compliance with the original judgment.</p>  <p>  The full impacts of the closure of Derrybrien wind farm have been considered.  There are limited global and European energy policy arguments to be made for the continued operation of Derrybrien.  There are no substantive arguments to be made from a domestic security of supply perspective.  Any attempts to retain the wind farm in operation would face planning and legal obstacles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.619" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="22:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500082#JJJJ00300"><p>I find slightly surprising the conclusion that there are no substantive arguments to be made with regard to the security of domestic supply, given Derrybrien provides, on a good day at least, 1% of the energy needs of the State at a time of energy crisis.  I am not suggesting that Ireland should flout EU law; it is very disappointing that it has done so and that it is has dragged its heels for so long.  What I am suggesting is that another attempt be made to bring Derrybrien into compliance with European Union law.  Maybe a better application should be made to mitigate the very negative effects of what has happened.  Maybe an application should be made by a developer that is not the original developer, which has been in violation of the requirement for so long, albeit it may have been inadvertent at the time, and it may have been a failure by this House and the Department to properly transpose European legislation that gave rise to much of this problem.  However, so too is the manner in which ESB, or its wholly owned subsidiary, Gort Windfarms Limited, went about building this.</p>  <p>  Nobody is suggesting that those who flouted environmental norms be rewarded, but rather that the State would not be penalised.  We have taken all of the disadvantages, as I have said.  There is a real risk and a worry in the community that in seeking to decommission, we are going to cause further damage along the lines of the damage that was already caused.</p>  <p>  The worst of it all is this.  I do not know if the Minister of State knows the topography of the area well but Slieve Aughty is on the northern side of Lough Derg and Slieve Bernagh is on the southern side.  Coillte is proposing to do exactly the same thing on top of Slieve Bernagh - this is a blanket bog on top of a mountain and it wants to put up turbines.  It is going to endanger Slieve Bernagh and decommission a wind farm that can be seen across Scariff Bay and that has created environmental havoc in the past.  Nobody is sympathising with that.  What I am saying is that it may be time to cut our losses and to make a new application, and the State should consider the good that perhaps could come out of it.</p></speech>

It has accepted the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is in the process of preparing for the decommissioning and removal of the wind farm.  As previously stated, the Government has explored all avenues and impacts in this regard and is satisfied that there is no legal basis for its continued operation.  The Government is committed to pursuing the transition to a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich and climate-neutral economy by no later than the end of the year 2050, as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.</p>  <p>  Under the climate action plan 2021, CAP21, and the sectoral emissions ceilings, Ireland has a target of up to 80% of electricity demand to come from renewable energy sources by 2030.  This will be comprised of up to 8 GW of onshore wind, up to 5.5 GW of solar and at least 7 GW of offshore, with 2 GW earmarked for the supply of green hydrogen.  Under the EU clean energy package, Ireland has to maintain a baseline 16% renewable energy level in each year and meet trajectory points in 2022, 2025, 2027 and 2030, as set out in the national energy and climate plan.  Under CAP21, at least a further 4 GW of additional onshore wind energy is required without taking into account the potential decommissioning of existing sites over the coming years.  According to industry sources, there is an estimated 10 GW of onshore wind projects in the development pipeline.  A supportive spatial planning framework for further onshore renewable development at national, regional and local level, as set out in the climate action plan, is essential to deliver on the onshore and solar generation targets.</p></speech>

The managing director, Brian Lynch, reached out to local Oireachtas Members and media outlets to let us know that Suirway Bus and Coach Services will be ceasing to operate its public transport services after 31 October and that it has informed the NTA that it will not be renewing its route licences.</p>  <p>  I will discuss the implications for the community of Dunmore and Portlaw shortly but I would like first to acknowledge how difficult a decision this must have been for Brian and his family.  Suirway has been a family business for three generations.  It is hard to believe but Suirway has been in the public transport business since 1899, when it first offered public transport services consisting of high quality tyred traps.  Its first bus did not arrive until 1928 and it is one of the earliest public transport services to operate in Ireland, predating the Road Transport Act 1932, which established the national public transport system.</p> <p>The company has survived two world wars, the energy crisis of the 1970s and all the boom and lean times of the last 123 years.  The impact of Covid-19, however, followed by the spike in energy prices precipitated by Russia's illegal war in Ukraine and the future challenges of decarbonising our transport fleet, have left Mr. Lynch in a position where he does not see a future for his business.  Suirway is rightly proud of its history and this decision has been taken with a heavy heart.  I acknowledge the role the company has played in Waterford for a century and more.</p> <p> The loss of Suirway means we have six weeks to solve a transport problem that will impact the almost 2,000 people who live in Portlaw and the nearly 2,000 people who live in Dunmore East, not to mention the people living in the hinterland of those towns and along those bus routes.  Dunmore East is to the east of Waterford city and the existing bus service accesses the city via the Dunmore Road corridor, which I have discussed with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on many occasions.  There is no secondary school in Dunmore East, so children have to travel to the Gaelchol&aacute;iste, Waterpark College, the Ursuline secondary school, the Newtown School and the De La Salle College, all of which are on or close to this route.  The bus also passes University Hospital Waterford, UHW, and the likes of Ardkeen Stores, Lidl and Tesco, where people from Dunmore East pick up their grocery shopping.  Most people living in Dunmore East work in Waterford city and significant traffic also moves in the other direction, with people from Waterford city travelling out to Dunmore East for a swim, a bite to eat, etc.</p> <p> Portlaw is on the other side of Waterford city, to its west.  The services there bring children into St. Paul's College, my former secondary school, and the Presentation secondary school.  The bus route also passes through Kilmeaden and Butlerstown, the UPMC Whitfield Hospital, the industrial estate and the main campus of South East Technological University, SETU, on the Cork Road.  Portlaw has a high proportion of households experiencing transport deprivation, that is, they do not have a car or struggle with the cost of running a car.</p> <p> This matter is a litmus test for our commitment to the Connecting Ireland strategy that seeks to improve public transport services in rural Ireland.  We know the challenge we have ahead of us in respect of decarbonising our transport systems and ensuring that people living in small towns, such as Portlaw, Passage East and Dunmore East, have access to the services they need to reach our larger towns and cities.  The people of Portlaw, Passage East and Dunmore East are worried, and rightly so.  Has the Minister engaged with the National Transport Authority, NTA, on this issue?  Will we be able to provide continuity of service on this route from 31 October onwards?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, while the majority of public transport in Ireland is provided by the publicly-subvented bus and rail services funded through NTA's public service obligation, PSO, programme, the public transport system also includes non-subvented bus services provided on a commercial basis by bus and coach businesses of varying size.  I understand the Deputy's question concerns the impact on the people of Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East in County Waterford of the recent decision by one such commercial bus operator, Suirway, to cease operating its services in the area.</p>  <p>  I advise the Deputy that the decision taken by Suirway to withdraw its commuter services in east Waterford, including in Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East, at the end of October, is a commercial decision for the company.  The Deputy will appreciate that Suirway, like all other commercial businesses, is responsible for managing its own resources in respect of its commercial services.  It is my understanding that Suirway has taken the decision to withdraw these services following a prolonged period of difficult trading.  The Deputy eloquently outlined the history of the company in the area and the difficulties it has been facing.  He will also be aware that the Covid-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the public transport sector.  This impact has been mitigated by several Government decisions over the last two years.  In particular, these include the decision to substantially increase the 2020, 2021 and 2022 budgets for the existing PSO system and to introduce new, temporary financial support for non-PSO licensed services provided by commercial bus operators in June 2020.  In acknowledgment of the difficulties facing the sector, these supports for the commercial sector were extended several times over the past two years, most recently up to 30 June 2022.</p>  <p>  Despite these and other wider Governmental supports, trading conditions remain challenging, with passenger numbers remaining below pre-pandemic levels in many areas and the associated fare revenue having yet to rebound fully.  An unfortunate consequence of these challenging conditions is that some commercial operators, such as Suirway, are deciding to leave the market.  I advise the Deputy that the NTA, which has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators, will assess whether Suirway's decision to withdraw its services in Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East at the end of next month will give rise to any loss of connectivity in the area.  The NTA will also consider whether there is a need to provide additional PSO services in the affected areas.</p>  <p>  I reassure the Deputy that the NTA has advised that this matter is a high priority for it and that it will advise the Department of its findings as soon as its review process is complete.  I also assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring essential transport services are protected and supported.  Services providing vital regional and rural connections will continue to operate if a loss of connectivity is identified, and a replacement service will be put in place.  A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-15a.625" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091500083#KKKK00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her response, but I could nearly short-circuit the NTA process of assessing whether this impending situation will give rise to any loss of connectivity in the area.  It will, because no other operator provides services from Dunmore East and Portlaw into Waterford city centre.  I received word previously that this matter is a high priority for the NTA, but I would like a timeline in this regard.  The clock is ticking.  Six weeks remain in which to decide that a PSO route must be put in place or to see if Local Link operators in the area - and we have an exceptional such operator providing services from the west of the county - will be asked to take on this route or to determine how this problem is going to be solved.  In any event, we have six weeks in which to provide continuity of service for all people in Dunmore East, Passage East and Portlaw who rely on it.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that there certainly are instances of transport deprivation in these towns, especially Portlaw.  There are people who rely on this service and without it, they will not, for example, be able to get their children to school, get to the doctor or be able to access groceries.  There are no supermarkets in these towns and people rely on Waterford city for these types of services.  There is, therefore, a need to accelerate this process.</p>  <p>  We also need joined-up thinking in this regard.  Portlaw is 5 km from Fiddown, which used to have a train station.  Perhaps we should be considering reopening a station along that line and having more commuter trains, perhaps battery operated, running from Clonmel into Waterford.  We need the different organs of the State's transport system to talk to each other.  Can we get an idea of the timeline on the process the Minister of State referred to because, as I said, the clock is ticking?  People rely on this bus service as their mode of transport and they need certainty that there will be continuity of provision.</p></speech>

Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, especially in areas not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.  While it is regrettable that a family-owned bus operator like Suirway, which has been providing services in the east Waterford area for more than 100 years, is ceasing its operations, I reiterate that any decision concerning the continuation or cessation of specific routes or services by a commercial operator is, ultimately, a decision for the company itself.  I again assure the Deputy that the NTA has prioritised carrying out a detailed assessment of whether Suirway's decision to withdraw its services in Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East at the end of October will result in any loss of connectivity in the area.  As part of this assessment process, the NTA will consider whether there is a need to provide additional or replacement PSO services in the area.</p> <p>Regarding alternative transport options in the region, the NTA has also advised that passengers travelling from Kilmeaden to Waterford city will still be able to access Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway route 40, which runs six times daily each way along this route.  I trust this clarifies the position regarding the impact of the closure of Suirway's bus services on the people of Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East.  I will raise the issue of the timeline in this regard directly with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p></speech>
