They are aware of the serious problem we have with parents who get a diagnosis, wait a long period for an assessment of needs, AON, wait further for a statement of service and for the appointment of key workers, and then face a substantial wait for any therapeutic care.</p>  <p>  A constituent who is one example among many was diagnosed at the age of four in 2019.  A service statement was received four months later.  A key worker was appointed over two years later and there is still no clear line of sight on when the needed therapeutic service, psychology, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy will be provided.  In my area in north Dublin, over 3,000 children are in therapy and another 3,000 are waiting for it.  The prospect for those in therapy of moving quickly through the system is not great.</p>  <p>  I call for a root-and-branch review by the Department of Education, the Department of Health and the HSE of whether the system in place is broken.  I was encouraged by the establishment of a pilot in the west of Dublin, where 75 schools and 75 preschools were to be supported by, as I recall, 19 therapists with different skills.  This was to be the new approach.  Although the pilot has reported positive support and success, the HSE withdrew the speech and language therapist and occupational therapist deployed for Covid work and the scheme has run into difficulties since.  It has not taken on the expansion.</p>  <p>  In a recent court case, the approach taken to try to move children forward has been deemed not to meet the needs of the legislation.  We need to look at everything, including the legislation, to see if we can do better for these children.  If we are having assessments of needs, the conduct of which absorbs many therapeutic resources, but then have a wait of three years before services are provided, one would question the value of the resources that go into such assessments.  Three years on, the situation may be quite different.  One wonders whether the education approach could deploy more effectively.</p>  <p>  Some people will argue, rightly, that some children need one-to-one care that cannot be provided in a school context, but the HSE has now moved to provide group care support to parents.  Why not provide supports to SNAs and resource teachers?  There are 19,000 SNAs and, if I am not wrong, 13,000 resource teachers.  That is a vast resource compared to, in my area, 230 therapists, where the vacancy rate is almost one third.  We have a resource supporting children with special needs.  We need a deep reassessment of how we deploy the resource, which includes therapists, SNAs and resource teachers.  Can we find a better way to support children, rather than having these long waits?  At seven years of age a child is struggling and one wonders if it has been left too late, even if they get that intervention.  I call for Ministers to get together, form a working group and have a serious review of this approach.</p></speech>

It is an important topic.  As a previous Minister for Education and Skills, the Deputy did a lot of work.  I think he introduced the school inclusion model, which I will talk about momentarily.</p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility in this area relates to the provision of education for children with disabilities, whether in mainstream settings, special classes or special schools.  The provision of therapy supports for children with disabilities, as the Deputy pointed out, is a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE.  </p>  <p>  Having said that, I note what the Deputy said about a root-and-branch review and making sure that involves interdepartmental work.  We have to take a cross-departmental approach to supporting our children and young people with disabilities.  I assure the Deputy that a lot of work is happening in this space across the education and disability sectors.  At ministerial level, I work closely with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to progress a range of issues and new initiatives.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised two important topics: reinstating therapy supports in our special schools and the school inclusion model.</p> <p>It is important for the House to understand that expanding the school inclusion model instead of providing therapists into special schools is not in the best interests of children with special educational needs.  The comprehensive on-site health and social supports to special schools that are provided by the HSE are entirely separate to the Department's school inclusion model.  The school inclusion model was never intended to replace therapy services being provided by children's disability network teams in the HSE.  Children need access to both community and school-based services. </p> <p> The Deputy mentioned the reinstatement of therapists in special schools and the AON.  My Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, have been working on this.  My Department has been advised that the HSE has developed a programme for the reinstatement of 136 posts, which is in addition to the 85 reinstated posts for special schools announced in 2021.  The intention of the HSE, as we understand it, is to implement the programme in three phases.  The first phase will involve reassigning existing HSE staff to fill one third of the posts over September 2022 and the second phase will fill a further one third of the posts via existing panels, supported with further reassignment throughout autumn.  In parallel with the first two phases, a number of initiatives will also be commenced, including a high-profile international recruitment campaigns to fill vacant occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy posts.</p> <p> My Department meets regularly with the Department of Health, the HSE and other Departments to monitor the progress being made on the reinstatement of these posts in our special schools.  The latest update from the HSE indicates that 55 of the 85 posts allocated to support special schools in 2021 have been filled.  My Department has been advised that the trade union representing personnel involved in this work issued an instruction of non co-operation to its members regarding the reinstatement process.  However, I understand that intensive discussions between the HSE and the trade union are ongoing to address the concerns of its members with regard to this initiative.  The HSE remains committed to the programme and continues to engage proactively with the union to facilitate a resolution to this matter. </p></speech>

The root of the problem is that the demarcation between education and health is far too rigid.  I question whether that is the reality of the experience of parents.  As the HSE is not able to provide the one-to-one therapy, it is moving to group therapy and is encouraging and supporting parents to do drills, supports and activities.  We have 19,000 SNAs and we increase that number by 1,000 each year.  We have been successful in developing that service.  There is not a high exit rate and there is not a problem with filling the posts we are assigning.  If the problem is that we cannot fill the therapeutic posts for the foreseeable future, we need to look at whether we can develop a way in which therapists would work with SNAs and resource teachers to provide parents with a better context within which they can support their children.  I do not see a prospect of the three-year wait being suddenly reduced.  The effort was found to be faulty by the courts.  Maybe the existing law is out of touch with the reality of trying to develop services in this area.  I would go back to my original request.  There needs to be a root-and-branch look at this, rather than the current approach where the two Departments stick to their demarcation lines with one recruiting speech and language therapists and the other recruiting SNAs and never the twain will meet.  The pilot was a very good and optimistic route.  I admit that it will not solve the problem for every child.  However, it would allow us to reach more children and reserve precious therapeutic time for the children who need it most.  I strongly advocate looking again at this whole context and framework.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900004#B00300"><p>I note what the Deputy said about the court ruling.  He spoke about the demarcation between the different Departments.  The Department of Education will be assisting the HSE in relation to the AON process, which will hopefully speed up the time within which children will get therapists and the therapy they require.  The HSE is responsible for therapists being provided to special schools.  I appreciate the point the Deputy is making about collaboration between Departments.  Rather than having Departments in their silos, they can work together.  I assure the Deputy that I am working very closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in this regard to try to sort out these issues, as well as working with CORU on workforce planning for therapists.  That is a big issue and is the primary reason the school inclusion model the Deputy referred to has not been expanded.  That has recommenced within the pilot, which was run in Kildare, west Wicklow and south-west Dublin.  There were 75 participating schools.  It was a multidisciplinary approach with occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and behavioural practitioners.  We want to be able to expend that throughout Ireland because it would be a gold-star service for our children who so badly need it.  That is a separate type of multidisciplinary approach to the therapists that are being provided to the HSE.  I agree that we need to keep this under constant review and make sure we are doing everything we can to provide these services to children with additional needs.  That might mean changing practices or looking at things differently and I concur with the Deputy in that regard, particularly given the experience he has had as Minister for Education and Skills.</p></speech>

This is not news to the Minister of State.  It has been raised in this House many times over many years.  The question is why.  It is because it is not getting its fair share of funding from central government.  The facts speak for themselves.  Galway is the second largest county in Ireland and it has the third highest population across the State, only behind Dublin and Cork.  The funding allocation it receives makes no sense.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would tell us that funding is determined by size, population, population distribution and demands for public services.  Looking at funding <i>per capita</i>, there are serious and very obvious discrepancies with other counties smaller than Galway.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and I have raised those discrepancies before.  Kerry, Donegal and Tipperary are all smaller than County Galway and they received funding of more than &euro;900 per capita.  Mayo received more than &euro;1,000 per capita while Galway received &euro;670 per capita.  In 2018, there were increases across the board of between &euro;82 and &euro;121 per capita.  Galway's increase was &euro;22.  The level of funding is totally inadequate for Galway County Council.  It impacts on every single person living in County Galway.  It means roads cannot be maintained and housing maintenance cannot be carried out.  It impacts on the delivery of every single service right across the board and it impacts on the development of amenities in County Galway.  The representatives for County Galway are totally on the same page about funding when it comes to Galway County Council.  This issue goes far beyond politics.  Given that the budget has now been framed, will the Minister of State look at funding for Galway County Council?</p></speech>

I think there is political consensus in this regard.  Everyone is aware of the difficulties surrounding the funding that has been allocated over the years to Galway County Council.  It is my understanding from a variety of meetings that the Government is looking to act on it at this point.</p> <p> We know Galway County Council is looking at its budget at the moment.  It is really crucial that it gets certainty on that now.  If we take a look at the roads and bridges across Connemara, we see the very severe issues caused by lack of funding.  Two new funding streams have been allocated as a result of the increase in energy costs as well as pay deals, which is absolutely welcome.  However, it is important to have certainty going forward into this budget process that there will be increased funding for Galway County Council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900005#C00200"><p>I thank both Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline funding and Government support for local authorities, with particular reference to Galway County Council.</p>  <p>  Across all schemes and funding sources, my Department provided &euro;82.9 million in 2020, &euro;84.4 million in 2021 and &euro;24 million to the end of September 2022 to Galway County Council.  Included in this is the unprecedented level of support provided by central government during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  In 2020, Galway County Council applied a 100% commercial rates waiver to just over 3,500 businesses and recouped &euro;10.2 million in that regard.  In addition, in recognition of Covid-related income losses and additional expenditure incurred, my Department provided funding of &euro;2.5 million to Galway County Council in 2020.  This support continued in 2021 when the Government introduced a nine-month commercial rates waiver applying to businesses most seriously affected by the restrictions, and a more targeted waiver for the final quarter of the year.  Galway County Council received &euro;7.3 million for this waiver and an additional &euro;1 million for Covid-related income losses and expenditure for 2021.</p>  <p>  The total cost of the waiver for the local government sector for 2020 and 2021 was &euro;1.2 billion, and &euro;191 million was paid out in additional support towards lost income and expenditure for the same period.  In addition, the limited quarter 4 rates waiver has been extended to the first quarter of this year at an estimated cost of &euro;61 million.  Galway County Council will receive a recoupment of &euro;950,000 in respect of this waiver.</p>  <p>  For 2023, the Government is making a significant contribution of &euro;421 million to support local authorities.  A large portion of this figure, &euro;287.2 million, will go towards assisting local authorities with the cumulative effect on pay costs arising from the national pay agreements and the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  This allocation will ensure that local authorities will have the necessary resources in terms of people to perform their functions and provide essential public services to our citizens; in excess of 1,000 services, in fact.  The pay allocation for Galway County Council for 2022 is &euro;5.8 million.  This will rise to &euro;8.1 million in 2023 to take account of the most recently ratified pay agreements.</p>  <p>  As committed to in Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, the move to 100% retention of local property tax, LPT, will take place in 2023.  All equalisation funding will now be met by the Exchequer to ensure all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their baseline.  Local authorities may also vary their local property tax rates by up to 15%.  Authorities that increase the rate retain 100% of the additional income.  Galway County Council will receive &euro;155,561 in local property tax equalisation funding for 2023 in addition to the expected &euro;14.3 million LPT yield to achieve a baseline funding level of &euro;14.5 million.</p>  <p>  We secured an additional one-off allocation of &euro;2.75 million for Galway County Council for 2023 in recognition of the current financial challenges facing the authority, plus the additional &euro;1.75 million in supplementary support in recognition of the increasing costs of service provision.  This brings the total additional support for Galway County Council to &euro;12.8 million for 2023, which is a considerable contribution from central government that should assist the authority in the challenging year ahead.</p>  <p>  As I said, I had a number of meetings with Galway County Council and with my colleagues, Deputy Cannon and Senators Kyne and Dolan, regarding to the additional funding.  The &euro;12.8 million is a very strong contribution to the local authority in additional funding for 2023.  My door is always open to further engagement with the local authority.</p></speech>

Of course, it is just a one-off.  When we look at the discrepancies that exist with regard to funding, there is a clear issue.  I do not hear the Government or Ministers acknowledging the issue regarding the level of funding Galway is receiving.  There is a very obvious issue and I do not feel the Government recognises that.</p>  <p>  The last time we raised this issue, the fact that Galway County Council opted out of increasing the local property tax was also raised.  The nub of the issue is funding from central government, however.  It would be very hard for Galway County Council to raise local property tax when we look at the amenities, the state of the roads and the level or lack of maintenance.  People cannot be expected to pay higher local property tax and receive nothing in return.  I see it in my office in Ballinasloe all the time.  People come in with issues and we cannot move them forward, especially with regard to staffing.  Another really major issue is the lack of outdoor staff in Galway.</p></speech>

I will be interested to hear his response to my colleague's question whether that is related to the additional one-off payment that I mentioned in my initial opening remarks and which I welcomed in this Chamber.  The point is that it does not come to the crux of the issue and the serious lack of funding.  The whole point is that everybody from Galway has absolutely been in agreement that there has been a lack of funding for Galway County Council.  It is really important at this point to ensure there is engagement with the council when it is putting together its budget.  Specifically, councillors have been raising directly with us how worried they are about framing this budget in this context.</p></speech>

That is a recognition of the total allocation of &euro;12.8 million for 2023.  That is a significant allocation by the Government at a time when moneys are, as we know, difficult to raise in the current circumstances.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge Galway County Council is doing work in terms of its commercial rate space and also in terms of the &euro;60 million supplementary support fund, of which it will be a key beneficiary.  That will hopefully help it with the escalating costs of the inflationary crisis.  However, I will note that one of the resolutions to this complex process and the funding of local authorities is the comprehensive review of current LPT baselines, which is happening in the coming months.  That is starting to commence and will hopefully be concluded early next year.  It is hoped that will give a very clear insight into the mechanisms in terms of allocating funding to local authorities.  As I have always pointed out, my door is open to engagement with Galway County Council, as it has been since my appointment as Minister of State.  I met with its representatives a number of times.  I absolutely understand the acute nature of its financial position and the circumstances it is in.  That is why the Government has made such significant support available to it this year and, I would add, in previous years.</p></speech>

This would have far-reaching consequences for families in rural areas who would be denied access to these maternity services.  Home birthing will be prohibited in large areas of counties Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Monaghan and Wicklow.  This will impact thousands of families.  The proposal was greeted with shock from midwives and women.  The Midwives Association of Ireland and the Community Midwives Association have come out strongly against this plan.</p>  <p>  On Sunday, there was a large protest outside Cork University Maternity Hospital.  Families, parents, grandparents and children all turned out to oppose this attempt to remove people&rsquo;s choices.  Those who are directly impacted by this proposal do not want this.  The healthcare professionals who run the service do not want this.  Why is it being proposed?  Who is pushing this agenda, and why?</p> <p>This must be a political or a managerial decision, because it is not evidence based.  Home births are safe.  The current systems function well.  They should be improved on and developed and not shut down.  Community midwives provide an incredible service and this plan is doing them a considerable disservice.  From experiences with friends and family, I cannot speak highly enough of the care and caution provided by community midwives.  It is disgraceful that the HSE and the Government do not appreciate this.</p> <p> The report on this proposal has no evidence base.  It refers to an evidence review from 2015 and it states that at that time, "No studies were found that focused on transfers from stand-alone midwifery-led units, or home births and any adverse outcomes&rdquo;.  The report itself admits that it has no medical basis for this massive policy change, so why is it being proposed?  I have to repeat the question.  Who is pushing this and why?  Can the Minister of State clarify if this is a political decision?  The HSE is perpetuating a misconception that home births are not safe.  They are safe.  If it is so adamant expectant families need to be within 30 minutes of maternity hospitals, perhaps they need to look at providing maternity services in west Cork and other rural areas.  The utterly ridiculous basis of the plan is that if home births can only occur within 30 minutes of maternity hospitals, then all pregnant women should never be more than 30 minutes from a maternity hospital, as they can go into labour at any stage.</p> <p> We should have birthing clinics and midwife-led services across rural and urban areas, supported by well-resourced ambulance services.  Why instead is the HSE being permitted by the Government to ban home births in rural Ireland?  Rather than addressing the actual problems with the maternity services, time and energy is being wasted on this plan which has excluded midwives and has left thousands of families deeply worried about their reproductive choices.</p> <p> Can the Minister of State outline what plans are in place to address the more than 100 unfilled posts in maternity services in hospitals in Munster?  The staff shortages in our maternity services have been described as critical this week.  Midwives in Tipperary University Hospital have warned that staff shortages are causing risks to the safety of women and babies.  What is the HSE&rsquo;s response?  It is to force more families into already over-stretched hospitals.  In this context, the plan is not only not evidence based, but it is also irresponsible and dangerous.  The Minister of State has to stop it now.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, the HSE's national home birth service moved from community operations to acute operations within the HSE earlier this year.  The home birth service is now being integrated into the maternity networks in line with the national maternity strategy.  The core aim of that strategy is to provide safe, high quality maternity care to the women of this country.  As part of this transition, the HSE's national women and infant health programme, NWIHP, was asked to provide more specific guidance at national level regarding the appropriate distance a woman should live from a maternity hospital while accessing home birth services and to make a recommendation on this issue.</p>  <p>  Using both obstetric and midwifery expertise, the NWIHP issued national guidance on home births on 14 July recommending, from a clinical perspective, that it would be safest that all women accessing the HSE's home birth services would reside 30 minutes or less blue-light distance from their nearest maternity service.</p>  <p>  When making this recommendation, the NWIHP took into account a range of factors, including the historic transfer rate into maternity units of mothers who laboured at home in the national home birth service, the primary reasons why women were transferred, the method of transfer, the need to factor in ambulance response times, the time needed to transfer the woman into the ambulance and the time until assessed upon arrival at the hospital.</p>  <p>  The HSE's recommendation addresses the balance of risk that needs to be considered for home birth services.  For example, if a woman has an emergency in a maternity hospital, and if a category 1 caesarean section is required, the woman must get to theatre within 30 minutes.  In the event of a serious risk to a mother or baby in the HSE's home birth service being identified by the self-employed community midwife, this recommendation is designed both to ensure the best possible chance of getting to a maternity hospital in a timely manner to ensure the best outcome for mother and baby and to ensure that the clinical determination of the self-employed community midwife is acted upon in a safe and timely manner.</p>  <p>  While I understand that the HSE's recommendation has caused concern for some, it is important to note that a geospatial analysis carried out by the HSE indicates that coverage will remain for 83% of the female population of childbearing age.  While the home birth service represents only 0.7% of overall births, the HSE and NWIHP recognise that it is an extremely important pathway for women.</p>  <p>  I would like to note that while choice for women is an integral part of our maternity services and of the national maternity strategy, the need to ensure safety must always be paramount.  The objective of this measure is to enable the continuity of the home birth services whilst ensuring the best outcomes for mothers and babies in line with the objectives of the national maternity strategy.</p></speech>

It refers to an evidence review from 2015 and I am going to quote it again.  It says that at that time, "No studies were found that focused on transfers from stand alone midwifery led units, or home births, and any adverse outcomes&rdquo;.  When the Minister of State speaks about a balance of risk, I think he needs to specify what he is talking about because he too is perpetuating that misconception that home births are not safe.  He says things like &ldquo;best outcome&rdquo;, &ldquo;timely&rdquo; and "safe&rdquo;, but what is he basing that on, because there is no evidence to say that home births are not safe?  I have to presume that the Minister of State does not actually realise the reality of them, which is that women are seen so often throughout their pregnancies and are very often referred to the hospital.  This is only allowed to go ahead if the pregnancy is suitable for it.  It is not what the Minister of State is making it out to be.  That is something that he needs to look into.</p>  <p>  I am still unclear about the motivation for this plan.  Who is pushing for it?  None of the relevant stakeholders wants it.  Midwives are opposed to it.  Families are protesting against it.  Again, there is no evidence to support it.  This is about quality maternity services and reproductive choices.  Home births are safe.  They are the preferred options for many families.  The Government and HSE should be supporting people, not restricting their healthcare options.  I really encourage the Minister of State genuinely to look into this instead of reading off that script, because it is misinformation.</p>  <p>  A ban on water births is another limitation on reproductive choice.  The Midwives Association of Ireland has called this ban "non-evidenced based, unethical and inequitable".  The Minister of State must also be aware that the ban will put some women and infants at increased risk.  There are people who for personal reasons and convictions will have a homebirth regardless and they will be intentionally left without healthcare professionals now if this goes ahead.  This is about reproductive choices and maternity healthcare that is genuinely centred on women and families.  Unless the Minister of State intervenes, it will in essence be his Government&rsquo;s policy to ban home births in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

There is the nonsensical situation where access to a swimming pool in a town that locals have used since the establishment of the Garda depot in Templemore in 1965 is now being denied to them.  This is nonsensical and makes no sense.  Leaving the pool idle for the next few months, as we are told might happen, could result in serious infrastructural work having to be done to it to get it back into use, which would cost hundreds of thousands of euro.  The Taoiseach visited my constituency last Friday and met Deirdre Ryan, one of the protagonists seeking to get this decision reversed.  He could see no logic in the decision that had been taken.</p>  <p>  For generations, locals have used the swimming pool on Friday nights for swimming lessons and instruction in water safety, and it has worked exceptionally well.  This is not the first time the depot in Templemore has made a nonsensical decision.  A number of years ago, it decided to stop taking supplies from local suppliers, such as meat, milk and vegetables, but that decision is, thankfully, starting to be reversed because it was costing the college money and it was not getting as good a service as it had been getting from the local suppliers.  In this case, again, faceless civil servants are making a disastrous decision.</p>  <p>  This is seriously damaging the relationship between the local community and the college.  There has been a tremendous relationship between the people of Templemore and the surrounding areas with the authorities in the college.  At times when the college was oversubscribed and it had too many recruits for the accommodation it had available, locals would take in recruits without hesitation.  While there was a financial reward for doing it, it was a great inconvenience for the households that did it, yet they always took in students.</p>  <p>  Last Saturday and yesterday in Templemore, public demonstrations were held.  On Saturday, there was a large crowd, with many children who cannot understand why this pool, which their brothers and sisters once used to learn the art of swimming, is not being opened to them.  We are told it is because of energy costs, but no one made any representation to get additional funding to cover the increased costs of energy.  No one went looking for it from the Department.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach gave us a commitment on Friday that this nonsensical decision would be reversed.   I call on the Minister of State to get the OPW and the authorities at the college to knock their heads together and give access to the college to the local area in the way that has always been the case since 1965.  I cannot overstress the annoyance of people in the area in regard to this.  I am often in the House on my feet looking for millions of euro for this or that in Tipperary.  This time around, all I am asking is that the access that has been allowed to this pool since 1965 be allowed to continue.  Surely that is not too much to ask.  The local community in Templemore have always done everything they can to help the college prosper.  The decision makes no sense.</p>  <p>  I might highlight another issue that arose recently in the college.  If senior Garda representatives come to the college on business, they now have to park in a car park a couple of hundred yards away from the depot.  They are not allowed access to park their cars - again completely illogical.  Someone who is in charge at the depot in Templemore has no common sense, and I want the relevant Minister to drive that point home.</p></speech>

As he will appreciate, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the OPW have responsibility for the Garda estate and the Minister has no role in management decisions related to the pool at Templemore Garda college.  It is my understanding the pool is used primarily for Garda training but has been made to available to the general public for use on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis.  I am advised that in 2017, a number of governance measures were put in place at the Garda college following an audit of the facility.  One of these measures involved the awarding of pool licences by the OPW to any group external to the Garda college who wished to use the facilities.  I am advised that between 2017 and 2020, a number of pool licences were awarded to local schools.  These schools used the pool for one hour a week during the academic year.  I am informed that while Garda management is consulted, the licences are issued by the OPW for the benefit of the local community on a not-for-profit and non-commercial basis.</p><p>As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the pool closed between March 2020 and March 2022 in line with public health restrictions.  When the pool reopened in March this year, local schools were again granted licences, which ran until the end of the school year in June.  It was anticipated licences would again be granted with the beginning of the new school year.  I am informed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made the decision to close the pool for a period as an energy-saving measure in line with Government policy to reduce energy use at this time.  I understand the OPW was consulted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the building owner and the body responsible for issuing the licences.  Of course, I appreciate the disappointment expressed by the schools and families affected by this decision.  I am assured this situation will be reviewed by the Garda college in the coming months, and I hope the matter can be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties involved.</p></speech>

As for energy saving, surely swimming lessons for the children of Templemore is an activity that warrants public expenditure.  This notion it is for energy saving just does not wash and is not acceptable.  I want the OPW and the authorities at the college to revisit this decision immediately.</p>  <p>  They have also said they will not allow licences to be issued on a commercial basis.  When an instructor is hired to give lessons, he or she has to be paid, yet they are saying that is a commercial activity.  Again, that is not acceptable.  No one is making a fortune out of giving swimming lessons to the children of the locality.  They get a few euro to cover their expenses, as they have done for many years.  I do not accept the idea this is an energy-saving measure in line with Government policy and, as I said, the Head of Government has stated he does not accept it.</p>  <p>  I want the Minister for Justice, the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW and the Garda authorities to get this matter sorted out as soon as possible.   Thankfully, in the programme for Government and this year's budget, it was announced that a significant number of recruits will start in the depot early in the new year, and the pool will be open for them at that stage.  We want this decision to be reversed immediately.  There are children in the locality whose siblings had swimming lessons there.  To tell us this is an energy-saving measure is piling insult on top of insult.  The swimming pool at the college has been used since 1965 with no problems.  Granted, in 2017, there were issues with licences and so on, but they were smoothed out.  Some civil servant is taking the view that this will look good on the bottom line.  We are not accepting that and we want the decision to be reversed.</p></speech>

while there are some 200 conditions associated with long Covid, common symptoms include profound fatigue, shortness of breath, post exertional malaise, dysautonomia, neurological and cognitive dysfunction, as well as others that have an impact on everyday functioning, with symptoms appearing following initial recovery from an acute Covid-19 episode, or persisting from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection;<br /><br />&mdash; research highlights the real burden long Covid represents to the Irish population and an already overwhelmed health service, highlighting the importance of finding scientific solutions which can tackle the underlying mechanisms that are causing such diverse and debilitating symptoms;<br /><br />&mdash; while there is a lack of knowledge associated with the management and treatment of long Covid conditions, this is not the first infection-associated chronic illness triggered by a viral infection, with many long Covid patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome;<br /><br />&mdash; the duration of illness can be variable, with some patients who developed long Covid after contracting Covid-19 in the first wave in March-April 2020 having made little or no recovery to date;<br /><br />&mdash; due to the heterogenous nature of long Covid there is currently no one universal diagnosis or treatment, however, medical evidence indicates that symptom management can improve quality of life;<br /><br />&mdash; research published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on Irish blood donors indicates that 69 per cent of adults in Ireland have been infected by the virus;<br /><br />&mdash; there are likely to be 336,451 adults nationally who are suffering from or have suffered from medical conditions associated with long Covid, based on an extrapolation of Netherlands-based research published in The Lancet<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in August 2022 which attributed long Covid symptoms to 12.7 per cent of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus;<br /><br />&mdash; patients with long Covid, many of whom are young with no underlying conditions, have presented with prolonged multisystem symptoms which can impact quality of life, affect ability to work and cause significant disability for some;<br /><br />&mdash; long Covid is having a significant impact on our labour force, and an Australian study on long Covid indicates that even low rates of Covid-related permanent illness or disability could still lead to a significant future societal burden from the disease;<br /><br />&mdash; some 0.81 per cent of Enhanced Illness Benefit claimants were certified unfit to return to work at least 12 weeks after their initial infection, meeting the emerging scientific criteria for long Covid;<br /><br />&mdash; on a population basis over 21,000 people may be unfit to work due to long Covid, which excludes those who have relapsed after initial recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection or the tens of thousands more experiencing less severe forms of long Covid who have reduced participation while in employment;<br /><br />&mdash; just 22.5 whole-time equivalents of the 70 health service staff to be appointed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to work with long and post Covid patients were recruited up to last month, with patients waiting up to 10 months for initial assessment before joining record waiting lists to see other specialists;<br /><br />&mdash; long Covid services do not exist for children;<br /><br />&mdash; the clinic in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital Dublin treating neurological conditions,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>such as brain fog associated with long Covid, has been forced to reduce its service due to a lack of funding;<br /><br />&mdash; many Irish patients have been forced to seek costly treatment overseas due to a lack of clear referral and treatment pathways being developed in Ireland; and<br /><br />&mdash; the primary mechanism to prevent long Covid is to minimise the incidence of Covid-19 infection, by ensuring that all practical measures to reduce the transmission of the virus are introduced and maintained in a time appropriate manner, including the provision of Evusheld to those who are immunocompromised or where vaccination is not recommended; and<br /><br />calls on the Government to: <br /><br />&mdash; address chronic workforce issues within our GP practices, primary care, and acute hospital services;<br /><br />&mdash; fully staff long and post Covid clinics as committed to on foot of the HSE plan of September 2021, which must be updated to reflect the changing skill set required to support the emerging evidence on the treatment of conditions associated with long Covid, such as direct access to neurological clinicians;<br /><br />&mdash;

This is the first major parliamentary debate on the impact of long Covid.  I am delighted the Regional Group has seen fit to table the motion.  It simply seeks the roll-out of specialist services to support those who have failed to make a full recovery after being affected with the SARS-COV2 virus.</p><p>While most people will make a full and quick recovery from Covid some adults and children continue to experience ongoing symptoms or can have a relapse after the initial recovery.  These symptoms can persist for several months or even years.  Long Covid is an umbrella name given to a broad range of some 200 post-Covid symptoms which can include conditions such as chronic fatigue and brain fog which are experienced at least three months after the initial infection and for significant periods of time and in some cases for over two years.  According to analysis based on research conducted in Ireland and the Netherlands, some 336,451 adults nationally are likely to be or have suffered some form of long Covid and an estimated 21,000 people are so unwell that they are unfit for work.  Even with a small portion of these long Covid patients presenting to our health service with complex health conditions in an already overcrowded emergency department and GP surgeries, they will overwhelm our health service as we face into a serious winter of overcrowding.</p><p>The Regional Group believes that unless we address this challenge of long Covid in a comprehensive way and in tandem with measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19 we will just sleepwalk our health service into a crisis of chronic illness.  This would put people waiting on treatments since before the pandemic further down the already horrendous waiting lists.  We also want to see long Covid recognised as an occupational illness and comprehensive special leave with a pay scheme for front-line healthcare workers as well as the expansion of services for other similar illnesses such as ME and chronic fatigue syndrome.</p><p>I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group for putting forward this very important motion.  In particular I acknowledge the work of Deputy Denis Naughten for his great work in drafting this motion together with our administrator, C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh.  It is important that we take this very seriously.  The motion calls on the Government to address the chronic workforce issue in our GP, primary care and acute hospital services and to fully staff post-Covid and long Covid clinics, which I think is the most important thing.  This has been committed to on foot of the HSE plan of September 2021.  It must be updated to reflect the changing skillset required to support the emerging evidence on the treatment of conditions associated with long Covid such as direct access to neurological clinicians.  We also need to establish a multidisciplinary public health team incorporating patient advice to review and manage long Covid within the population.  We need to establish a dedicated and specialist-led long Covid clinic for children who are currently without a dedicated centre.  That is a vital cog in ensuring that children are treated for this illness and that it is recognised that children have this illness.</p><p>It is important that we deliver in tandem with, instead of consequential on, the establishment of post-Covid and long Covid clinics fully resourced, long Covid services across GP and community services to ensure a national service is in place for all those who need it.  I understand the Government is not opposing this motion which I welcome but it is important not just that it does not oppose it.  We need to take action now to ensure that long Covid is treated in the way that it has been promised to be treated, as a very serious issue for the people who are not able to work and are suffering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="10:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900008#F00400"><p>Before I get into long Covid, I call on the Government to launch a full independent review into the handling of Covid.  We need answers to things like what happened in our nursing homes in 2020; how our ICUs across the country were under resourced and what improvements we have seen as a result; why the HSE lacked capacity despite all of the billions pumped into it; how the Government, the State broadcaster and many other national media outfits performed and what lessons have been learned; and finally can the Government introduce a restrictive covenant period in employment contracts to ensure that former high-ranking HSE officials are unable to take up employment with companies that have been subject to or awarded contracts during their tenure in the HSE.  I hope that the Government will consider this as part of restoring confidence and ensuring transparency for the people of Ireland in its health service.</p>  <p>  The Covid response has raised a lot of questions and there is no denying that Covid-19 has had a more significant and ongoing impact on some people more than others.  I am sure we have all heard of cases from friends, family or constituents where Covid-19 has emerged as a major ongoing problem, sometimes for weeks and months after the initial infection.  Long Covid is presenting itself in a variety of forms with a variety of symptoms.  The ability of some people to return to work has been compromised or limited by a continuation of Covid symptoms, most commonly fatigue and ongoing breathing difficulties.  Using the figures available to us, the inability to return to work or fully return to work may be affecting as many as 21,000 people.  Obviously we hope that it will not be as high as that but we do need to have dedicated resources in our health system to help as many of those people back to their vibrant selves as possible.</p>  <p>  The motion calls for the Government to do many things.  One is to get to grips with staffing levels.  Pay and terms and conditions in the health service where recruitment is an ongoing problem must be improved.  We have heard promises of waiting lists being abolished and services being improved but this can only be done if we have the people to do it.  There are no specific services for children with long Covid.  As we know and recognise in other areas, children often need differentiated care for a variety of illnesses than adults.  Children are obviously in a very important developmental stage physically, emotionally and socially.  That is why long Covid may have more devastating and lasting effect on those who get it at an early age.  The motion calls upon the Government to establish a dedicated and specialist-led long Covid clinic for children who are now without a dedicated centre.  A dedicated team working solely on long Covid in children may be able to bring about better recovery and better outcomes, in particular the prevention of lasting mental health problems or stigma in later life.</p>  <p>  For those of all ages currently suffering with long Covid this motion is also calling on the Government to develop an innovative and rehabilitative of recovery programme designed to meet the needs of those experiencing long Covid conditions and other post viral chronic conditions to ensure that they can make a full return to as full an active life as possible.</p>  <p>  I remind the Government that in December 2020, it published a report reviewing the law of torts and current systems for the management of clinical negligence claims, led by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan.</p> <p>In its report, the expert group states that it "accepts that there is a strong moral argument that the State, which actively encourages vaccination, should accept responsibility for those who suffer harm as a result".  The report recommended that a vaccination compensation scheme be established as a matter of urgency.  I hope the Government will acknowledge the findings of this report and introduce the scheme without further delay.</p> <p> If those experiencing long Covid can get the help and support they need as soon as possible, outcomes will be better.  This is the same for any illness.  The earlier it is treated, the better the patient's chances are.  Better personal, social and economic outlooks will be the result.  I conclude that the Government is not opposing the motion and is evidently accepting it.  Our hope is that the entire House will do likewise.  I thank my colleagues, particularly Deputy Naughten and C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, for putting the motion together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1609" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900009#G00200"><p>Since this motion was first mooted in the media by Deputy Naughten and taken up by the Regional Group, I have been inundated with emails and calls.  Each person who contacted me told his or her own harrowing story.  Many have been suffering since the first wave of the virus back in 2020 and none of them know how long their suffering will last.  In Tipperary alone, 670 people are certified as unable to work due to long Covid.  It is estimated that 330,000 adults have been impacted by long Covid nationally.  Many of these people are gravely ill with debilitating symptoms, yet only 22.5 whole-time equivalent staff have been appointed by the HSE to work with long Covid patients.  Long Covid will be the straw that breaks the health service if urgent action is not taken.</p>  <p>  It is not just adults who have been affected.  Thousands of our young people are afflicted.  Emily will be 16 on 16 November.  Her parents, who live in County Tipperary, have given permission for me to share her story.  For those who may not know what long Covid is all about, this young girl's story sums it up.  Emily is a typical teenager.  Prior to July of this year, she was full of the joys of life.  She had a large circle of friends, was a member of her local GAA club and was pleading to go to parties with her older sister.  Her phone was constantly beeping with messages from her friends.  In July, both Emily and her sister contracted Covid.  They had similar symptoms.  They isolated and followed all of the instructions and eventually the virus passed.  However, months later, Emily is still not back to her bubbly self.  It hurts her to breathe, with sharp pains shooting from her chest through to her back.  She has also developed serious digestive issues, something she had never known previously.  Her digestive system ceased to function normally.  Her symptoms are debilitating and confine her to home.  Chronic fatigue means she does not have the energy to leave home, even if she could.  By means of elimination and having tried treatments for each problem as it emerged, her local GP eventually diagnosed her with long Covid.  </p>  <p>  This young girl has become a shell of her former self.  She is unable to get out of bed in the morning until she has taken two strong painkillers.  As a popular teenager who loved school, who was bright and who showed great promise as a student, Emily now misses at least three days per week.  She struggles through pain with pain relief on the days she can attend.  Her schoolwork is suffering badly.  Emily is a junior certificate pupil and is distraught at the thought of failing her exams.  This young girl and her family are battling alone.  They have met with nothing but obstacles.  Her doctor has said that she must wait until she turns 16 to join the ever-growing waiting list for an adult long Covid clinic.  Incredibly, and to our shame, there is no such service in Ireland for young people.  In the meantime, Emily will continue to miss at least three days a week.  Her parents feel that the school will be obligated to report her poor attendance to Tusla and worry that Tusla will not accept long Covid as a valid reason for school absence.  Emily's life has changed.  Her phone no longer beeps constantly with messages from her friends.  She is out of the loop in school and cannot participate in sport anymore.  She does not have the energy to meet up with friends.  She is worried about her exams.  As a girl who is not yet 16, she feels depressed, isolated and helpless.  This is the reality of long Covid for young people.  </p>  <p>  Emily is not alone.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of young people in similar situations across the country.  They need help.  There is only so much their families can do to get them through this.  Love alone does not help with long Covid.  They need to be seen at a dedicated long Covid clinic for young people to help them manage and cope with their physical symptoms.  They also urgently need mental health support.  Emily has received zero support from the Department of Education.  It has failed to give a directive to school on a protocol for dealing with students with long Covid.  Our motion calls for a targeted campaign of advice and information on the management of conditions and situations associated with long Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900009#G00300"><p>I am going to read from an email I received from a constituent of mine whose sister has long Covid:</p> <blockquote> 	I am writing in relation to a motion being debated by the D&aacute;il on Wednesday of this week.  The motion calls on the Government to take immediate steps to provide the supports needed by those suffering from Long Covid, to establish professional Long Covid hubs and to acknowledge the fact that Long Covid is an occupational injury/disease affecting frontline workers, including those who contracted Covid in a work environment outside the healthcare environment. <br /><br />My sister, Liz, is a 56-year-old primary school Special Education teacher who contracted Covid-19 in a school in December 2021.  She is now suffering from severe Long Covid symptoms and has been off work since.  Her life is seriously impacted with ongoing long term chronic health issues and serious financial concerns.  Because she is unable to work, she is seriously stressed about her future, her pension and the fact that her illness is not recognised as an occupational injury, which impacts her entitlement to financial cover for periods off-work. <br /><br />Because of Long Covid, the cost to her of medical appointments, scans and medicines since December last is in excess of &euro;3,000 and climbing, at a time when her financial future is increasingly unclear.  More importantly, and more distressing for those of us who care about Liz, is the life-limiting effects of this horrible disease.  An active, life-loving person in her mid-50s is reduced to a life of exhaustion, brain fog, breathlessness, memory issues, pain and distress, with no end in sight.  This is compounded by months of being referred from one organisation or service to another as each absolves themselves from responsibility by referring her on.  The response from others is to send endless paperwork and forms to a person with a seriously-reduced ability to absorb detail and to action any of these processes.  <br /><br />Liz was a brilliant schoolteacher.  She attended at school when required to do so at a time when Covid was rife.  She did so at a time when the Minister for Education, Norma Foley, declared - without any qualification - that schools were safe.  They were not.  Liz caught Covid in her Special Ed classroom in the primary school in Dromiskin, Co Louth.  She was required to attend at work in what transpired to be a dangerous environment.  She does not blame her school or Board of Management, as they operated as required by the Department of Education.  But she does, quite correctly, want to be supported when she suffers in such an horrific way from simply doing her job.  She deserves to be treated with respect and for restrictive and ill-informed processes and supports to be adjusted with the clarity of hindsight.<br /><br />Health care workers who contracted Covid at their workplace have received an exemption from the ending of the Long Covid sick pay scheme, at least until mid-2023.  This exemption applies to all those who worked in a healthcare setting, whether nurses, porters, catering staff, receptionists.  Liz and her family have no problem with that.  Everyone who contracted Covid in a public sector work setting when they were required by their employer to attend at their workplace should be minded financially and emotionally until they are fit to return to work.  If Liz had suffered bone injuries at work or other occupational injuries, she would be minded.  Because she has Long Covid, she is approaching a situation where she will no longer receive full sick pay and her pension entitlements could also be adversely affected.  This is not fair or moral under any code.<br /><br />In terms of the motion before the Dail on Wednesday, Liz and her family and friends support every aspect of it but, in particular, we support the proposal that Long Covid caught in the workplace be designated as an occupational injury and that all and any financial supports, including pensions, are not detrimentally affected by virtue of time lost through illness arising from Long Covid.<br /><br />Please support the motion in the Dail on Wednesday and please urge your party colleagues to do likewise.  For those affected by Long Covid, it is the health equivalent of the Mica scandal.  Long Covid sufferers are cursed with the appalling effects of an illness that they have contracted through no fault of their own but that goes to the core of their ability to function and to live as people should.<br /><br />This is a plea to the better instincts of all right-thinking people.  Distinctions should not be made between those who have contracted this awful illness and comprehensive supports should be provided to all.  And the drawing of distinctions between categories of public servants, in terms of their rights and financial supports, is insidious and arbitrary and unworthy.  My sister contracted this awful disease in a schoolroom in Co Louth.  She should not be treated differently to a healthcare worker who contracted the same disease in the hospital 15 miles away in Drogheda.  They were both frontline workers doing their job during the worst of times.  She deserves more than that.  Her family and friends will continue to fight on her behalf. </blockquote> <p>Long Covid is an occupational injury.  I have only referenced one example, but I am sure the Members in each group can provide others.  I know the Minister of State is going to support us, but action must be taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900010#H00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss long Covid health services and I thank the Deputies for tabling this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I am responding to the motion on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Government.  I am aware that long Covid is having a devastating effect on people.  The Minister for Health, the Government and myself are committed to ensuring that care is in place for those who need it.  Some &euro;2.2 million was allocated for 2022 to put in place a service to support those with long Covid.  Budget 2023 will facilitate an overall investment of an additional &euro;6.6 million next year for the further development of long Covid services to ensure a full national service is in place.</p><p>As Deputies will be aware, Covid-19 is still a new disease and, therefore, information on it, its features and its course are still emerging.  The natural history, clinical course and consequences of Covid-19 are still not completely understood, although a lot of work is under way nationally and international to improve our understanding.  Fortunately, most people with Covid-19 recover well, but a proportion of people report ongoing health issues.  Long Covid includes a wide range of persistent or new symptoms that develop after infection with Covid-19.  To aid recognition and management of those affected, the WHO, through a global consensus process, proposed a working clinical case definition.  The WHO defines long Covid as occurring within three months of the onset of Covid-19, with symptoms that last for at least two months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.The common symptoms identified include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction and others that generally have an impact on everyday functioning.  Symptoms may be new-onset, following initial recovery from an acute Covid-19 episode, or persist from the initial illness.  Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.  The WHO notes that this definition may change as new evidence emerges and our understanding of the consequences of Covid-19 continues to evolve.  </p><p>The Deputies can see that addressing long Covid is complex.  The symptoms and duration and severity of symptoms are varied as are the needs for care.  Two people&rsquo;s experiences of long Covid can be quite different.  There is also a lot of uncertainty in the international literature about how many people experience these prolonged symptoms.  According to the WHO, it is estimated that 10% to 20% of those with Covid-19 develop a variety of medium- and long-term effects such as fatigue, breathlessness, and cognitive dysfunction.  A recent publication in <i>The Lancet</i>medical journal indicates that at present at least 17 million people are estimated to have long Covid in Europe.People who have had Covid-19 are being given follow-up care by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate.  Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms.  Those in the community who are concerned about persistent Covid-19 symptoms should contact their GP in the first instance.</p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, building on the services in place to support patients with post-acute and long Covid symptoms, an interim model of care for long Covid has been developed and is currently being implemented by the HSE to support those in need of care.  The model of care involves the expansion of some existing services and the establishment of new services across a number of settings, including GPs, community services and acute hospitals.  The first priority is to ensure there are long Covid and post-acute Covid clinics operating within each hospital group to ensure a national service.  To date, five new post-acute Covid clinics have been established, including clinics in University Hospital Galway, the Mater University Hospital and Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  These post-acute clinics are managing patients between four and 12 weeks after the initial onset of infection.  Long Covid clinics are managing patients 12 weeks post onset of infection, and five new long Covid clinics have also been established.  These include clinics in St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and University Hospital Galway.Both Tallaght University Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital are operating combined post-acute and long Covid clinics.  A dedicated long Covid clinic and a post-acute Covid clinic are due to be opened shortly in Cork University Hospital.  The HSE is continuing to work with Letterkenny University Hospital and Limerick University Hospital to progress the opening of clinics at both sites.  Some other hospitals are operating clinics on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis outside the model of care, in addition to the clinics mentioned above.  These include the long Covid clinic in the Mater University Hospital and the post-acute clinic in St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  However, the HSE is continuing to work towards aligning all HSE clinics towards a national service.  To support these services, there is a tertiary neurocognitive clinic in St. James's Hospital, led by a consultant neurologist with background in neurocognitive disorders that is accepting referrals from long Covid and post-acute clinics around the country. </p><p>Concerns have been raised by some colleagues around the fact that all clinics may not fully staffed.  However, I reassure them that this does not mean these clinics are not operational and actually seeing patients.  It is true that recruitment is ongoing at some clinics, but I assure the Deputies that they are operational, albeit not fully staffed as per the interim model of care recommendations.  Where no staff have yet been recruited, patients are being seen by existing staffing and resources.  The assignment of additional staffing and resources will support and enhance the work of existing clinics operational under the model of care.  As Deputies may know, to care for those experiencing long Covid, clinical input is provided as needed, depending on symptoms, by a range of healthcare professionals and, therefore, clinical leads representing respiratory medicine, infectious diseases, neurology mental health, allied health professionals, community services and general practice have been appointed.  The recruitment of additional posts, including consultants in the areas of infectious disease, respiratory medicine, psychiatry and neurology, allied health professionals, and clinical psychologists and administration will continue in 2023 to staff the full service. </p><p>These interdisciplinary teams guide and support patients through all aspects of recovery, supporting care for a range of primary symptoms.  The development of effective therapeutic options for patients suffering from long Covid poses significant challenges.  There is no proven drug therapy or evidence-based treatment option for long Covid <i>per se</i>.  Current treatment consists of diagnosis, advice and support and onward referral to additional services as required.  This includes ruling out and managing, if identified, other underlying medical conditions such as anaemia, asthma, sleep disorders, heart failure, and supportive care and rehabilitation if indicated through our allied health professions such as physiotherapy, occupational health and psychological medicine.</p> <p>I assure the Deputies that the Minister and I will continue to develop an understanding of the implications of long Covid and to prioritise supports for those affected by it to optimise health outcomes for those impacted.</p> <p> Deputy Canney raised the fact that children are being impacted by this and that there is a need for more dedicated specialist-led teams.  I agree with him.  Deputy Verona Murphy called for an independent review, as well as a restrictive covenant on those working for the HSE.  I will bring that back to the Department.  She also raised the fact that fatigue is affecting 21,000 people and the need to consider staffing levels.  When one considers that so many people in Europe are affected, those figures are correct.  Deputy Lowry referred to Emily, a teenager, and the challenges she is facing.  Deputy Fitzpatrick talked about Liz and long Covid.  I hear similar stories and testimony in my clinics and around the country.  I thank Deputies Canney and Naughten, along with the other Deputies in the Regional Group, for raising this issue.  The Government will not be opposing the motion.</p></speech>

Without doubt, long Covid is here to stay.  It is a medical syndrome; there is no doubt about that.  As the Minister of State observed, it is very difficult to see where the treatment regimes are going but we have to build a comprehensive service and put it in place to look after people who have been affected.  Just as important is the need to prevent people contracting Covid and mitigate the effects of long Covid.</p>  <p>  There has been a lot of anecdotal information in the healthcare space and the education sector, both of which have been heavily impacted.  We know well that people were working in compromised environments at the start of Covid.  In spite of the fact that all the evidence was there from the start, it took many months to recognise that Covid is an airborne disease.  Deputy Verona Murphy has asked for a review.  We need to go back and look at some of the actions that were taken in the context of Covid at the very early stage.  An awful lot of tricks were missed.  We were very late to bring in mitigating therapies.  Antigen testing, which could have significantly helped to reduce the levels of Covid infection, was not brought in until nearly 18 months into the disease.  These points were never handled.</p>  <p>  There is now a cohort who are affected by long Covid.  We do not know the exact number but it could be anywhere between 3% and 5% of those who contract Covid.  That appears to be a figure that will keep recurring.  A person can get Covid and recover, but then get it again subsequently and develop long Covid as a result.  We need to look at this syndrome.  I applaud the work of Dr. Lambert.  He gave a briefing in the audiovisual room a number of weeks ago.  What stood out prominently was the lack of support he is getting from the Department in trying to push the initiatives he has highlighted.  The Government's position in that regard is very disappointing.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that long Covid is now largely centred around neurological syndromes and immune responses.  That being the case, it falls into the same area as myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, fibromyalgia and other illnesses from which many people suffer.  Not enough has been done for those patient cohorts either.  I can think of a couple of patients with long Covid.  A 52-year-old health worker in Waterford who was a marathon runner prior to getting Covid contracted the disease as a result of her work in the hospital.  She was subsequently off work for nearly five months.  She tried to go back to work but could barely climb the stairs.  She has now taken early retirement.  It is unfortunate that this has happened to her by dint of doing her job.  On that point, as part of the motion we are asking the Government to recognise long Covid as an occupational illness requiring a comprehensive special leave with pay scheme for front-line healthcare workers as well as the expansion of services for other similar illnesses such as ME and chronic fatigue syndrome.  This has already been recognised by the EU but it is up to each member state to ratify it.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to his colleagues on this matter.  This is a small cohort of patients and they need to be given supports by the State and to know that if they have long-term illness, they can claim long-term disability for Covid syndrome.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State outlined, long Covid is difficult to diagnose.  It is based on symptoms.  One cannot do a blood test for long Covid but one can certainly see the symptoms that result from it.  The Government needs to develop a far greater strategic action plan.  There are a number of Covid clinics in development across the country.  The Minister of State highlighted that they are not fully staffed although we are trying to get there.  We need to understand that every hospital in the country will need to have expertise in this area because there will be varying degrees of symptoms.  Some people will require significant interaction with consultants while others will need less such interaction.  There is a significant amount of work going on.</p>  <p>  I highlight to the Minister of State a matter relating to vitamin D.  Anecdotal research was carried out in Connolly hospital for the past two years - it was actually brought in to the health committee more than a year ago - showing the potential mitigating benefits of supplementing with vitamin D.  A lot of work has been done and significant statistical research has shown that having a high level of vitamin D gives a person greater protection from the worst symptoms of Covid-19.  That research was brought to the health committee.  A report was generated.  A public health piece in respect of supplementation with vitamin D could have been done and people could have been given access to vitamin D through financial supports but neither of those measures were taken and that is a great shame.</p>  <p>  I join my colleagues in supporting the motion.  We need to recognise the occupational injury that is being caused.  More needs to be done to support patients and especially the caregivers who are trying to develop the multidisciplinary teams to deliver this.</p></speech>

Many individuals are contacting Deputies to express deep concern at an incredibly debilitating illness they have, one that is affecting all elements of their lives.  Many people have indicated to me that it is similar to having a brain injury in terms of loss of cognition, chronic fatigue, heart palpitations and other cardiac issues.  People are unable to work and go about their daily lives.  Memory is severely affected.  It also leads to depression as people try to deal with the illness.  As the Minister of State is aware, it is estimated that up to 21,000 people in the State are currently unable to work as a result of this condition.  It is having a serious effect on people's ability to survive, especially in a cost-of-living crisis.</p>  <p>  It is important that we do two things.  First, we need to investigate the level of impact this is having and how many people are experiencing this illness.  We also need to immediately start to treat the people who have these conditions.  That is not happening yet.  Although the Government announced previously that investment would be made in certain clinics to deal with long Covid, that simply has not happened to the level required and people are not getting the treatment they need.</p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the significant mortality rates this year.  August had the highest mortality rate of any month since the start of 2020.  The mortality rate this year is higher than it was pre-Covid.  There has been very little investigation into why that is happening.</p>  <p>  There is a broader issue in respect of the Government's understanding of how it dealt with Covid and the outcomes of Covid on society at the moment.  We in Aont&uacute; have brought forward a Bill that seeks an investigation into how the Government handled Covid.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has refused to agree to that investigation.  We know that more than half the people who died of Covid in this State did so in a nursing home or hospital setting.  The Government is in charge of how those two sectors operate.  That is an incredible situation.  We saw people being moved from hospitals into the nursing home sector without being tested for Covid.</p> <p>This affected people who were most exposed and vulnerable to this illness.  We also know there are many costs to the way the Government handled Covid over this period.  Indeed, this country had the longest and most severe restrictions of any country in Europe.  We were the only country to close down the building industry for a full quarter, even though the State has the worst housing crisis of any country in Europe at present.  Many of the contributions to the inflation rates we are experiencing now are due to some of the restrictions the Government imposed in the recent past.</p> <p> As we look at all the different impacts of Covid, the Government needs to do this in a structured fashion rather than the haphazard fashion it is doing now.  For example, I brought to the attention of the House just last week the fact that we have seen increases of 56% in the number of people who are being referred to rapid access cancer clinics in this State.  The Taoiseach announced at a parliamentary party meeting that he was very concerned about the level of new and advanced cancer cases that are now hitting the health service.  Yet, during the Covid crisis when I raised the need for cancer services to be reopened, the Taoiseach laughed at me and told me to get real.  It is an incredible situation.</p> <p> We need proper investigation into the level of long Covid, investment in delivering services for those suffering from it and an investigation into how the Government has handled the past two and a half years.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in will support this motion on long Covid.  I thank its authors, the Regional Group, and its proposer, Deputy Naughten, for the work he has done in this area over the past number of months.</p>  <p>  This is an area that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health has dealt with on a number of occasions.  A number of very important witnesses have appeared before that committee, including Dr. John Lambert, who was mentioned.  Many of the people who have come before the committee have been quite critical, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n indicated, of the haphazard approach we are seeing in this area.  There is no joined-up approach from primary care to acute services, no full roll-out of all the Covid clinics, and patients who are immunocompromised still do not have access to medications that people in other countries do.  Many of these patients say to me that their nightmare continues.  They are still where many of us were in March and April 2020, that is, a situation of permanent lockdown, and fearful of leaving their homes because of the danger of contracting Covid due to the profound health difficulties they have.  That is very difficult for them.</p>  <p>  Long Covid is something we are still learning about all the time and a lot of research is still being done.  We need to continue to learn but also to act very quickly as new data and new research emerges.  Long Covid is a complex set of conditions, with symptoms ranging from fatigue and breathing difficulties to involuntary movement and cognitive dysfunction with ranging severity.  It affects people of all ages.  It is troubling that we still do not have a paediatric model of care for long Covid.  I have been calling for that for some time.  We need to make sure we have a particular focus on children and the impact long Covid has on them.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, needs to expedite that as quickly as possible.  It is estimated that between 100,000 and 300,000 people are affected by long Covid.  The fact that we cannot determine that number is in part due to the lack of supports for general practice and GPs.  The fact that many of these long Covid clinics are not operational means we are not getting the real data on how many people are suffering from or have contracted long Covid and are managing and dealing with it in very difficult circumstances.  The more we do, and the more health supports and wraparound supports we give, the more evidence will emerge on precisely how many people are suffering from long Covid.  If we do not understand the scale of the problem, we will not be able to commit the level of resources that need to be invested.</p>  <p>  There is also a concern that there is excessive focus and concentration on hospital supports.  That is important because there is obviously a need for such supports but many of the services people with long Covid need are rehabilitative and must be provided in the community.  I mentioned primary care.  Much greater understanding and more education for GPs are needed.  We have overcrowding in our hospitals at present, which is almost unheard of.  The number of people visiting emergency departments and waiting for long periods is phenomenal.  It is a disaster in many of our acute hospitals.  We are then asking people with long Covid to go into these healthcare settings, where they are part of that experience of having to wait too long.  They say to me that they are fearful of going into hospitals, in some instances, because of the symptoms they have.  Community settings are and would be better in such cases.</p>  <p>  There was a call from the Mater hospital for a specialised Covid clinic to be put in place and for proper resourcing of research.  I raised this with HSE officials at the health committee. Even though Dr. Lambert had made recommendations and submitted business cases, senior people in the HSE were unaware of it a number of weeks ago.  I found that phenomenal.  He got very frustrated and took to social media to ask what in God's name is happening that the decision makers cannot make decisions quickly enough.  That is symptomatic of what happens generally in the healthcare system.</p>  <p>  We need to get serious about this illness.  Covid is still affecting many people.  Long Covid is a very serious illness.  Everything that we can do needs to be done.  We are talking about health supports but there are also other supports, for example, if people are out sick, they need to be supported through welfare supports.  A holistic package of supports is necessary.</p></speech>

It is being widely ignored by the Government and across the board.  I welcome the report published on Monday by APC Microbiome Ireland - a research centre based at University College Cork - in conjunction with UCC and the long Covid advocacy group.  The report shows that almost 90% of those living with long Covid in Ireland have not returned to pre-Covid levels of health and many people's lives are, essentially, being put on hold as they wait for the State and the HSE to put proper procedures in place to help them.</p><p>I am one of those people who has a diagnosis of long Covid.  I contracted Covid for the first time in October 2020.  Following that, I still have a very severe cough.  I went to GPs who gave me a diagnosis of asthma, put me on inhalers and sent me for chest X-rays, but there was no clearing of the cough whatsoever.  After 18 months, they essentially put their hands in the air and said that I had long Covid but there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.  I have been referred to the long Covid clinic in St. Vincent's hospital.  That was in June, some five and a half months ago.  I am still waiting to hear back from the clinic.  It is very concerning that the clinic's website it states:</p> <blockquote> 	Please be aware that due to a large number of affected patients and limited available resources, we may not be able to see everyone referred to the St. Vincent's Long-COVID Clinic.  However, your GP can also refer you to the appropriate local specialist... </blockquote>  <p>The clinic is essentially saying that its hands are tied and it does not have the resources to see everyone.  That means there is no hope for the many thousands of people who are living their lives on hold, living with a diagnosis of long Covid, and waiting to see whether they may be seen or might not be seen.  That is certainly no way to live their lives.</p><p>The Government needs to get real.  The resources need to be put in to help people like me, and the many thousands of people out there living with long Covid, to get on with their lives.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.  The first time that long Covid was highlighted to me was approximately two years ago.  When I heard about it, it really knocked me for six when the woman in question detailed how much it had impacted on her life.  Ever since then, I have raised the issue in this Chamber and through parliamentary questions because the people who have been suffering from long Covid have raised it with me.  I commend all those people and the campaign groups who have continued to keep this on the agenda.</p> <p>We know, of course, that Covid-19 caused a global pandemic.  People everywhere recognise the severity of the virus.  Now we see that some of those people who, when we were told we could stay at home, had to go out to work, whether it was in healthcare settings, stocking shelves in our supermarkets or in our factories, providing vital services on which we relied in order that we could stay at home and stay safe, are suffering from long Covid as a result of that work.  They feel totally forgotten about now.<br/><br/>We all know people who have been affected and impacted by long Covid.  I wish to read out something one woman told me about her experiences with long Covid.  She said:</p><blockquote>	The worst thing about having Long covid is that nobody can tell you when you will recover.<br /><br />If you have a broken limb you know it can take 6 weeks to heal, a chest infection can take a week with antibiotics but with long covid there is no magic pill and no time frame for recovery.<br /><br />You cut back on expenses as much as you can but still can barely manage.<br /><br />And it gets you down as you can't plan anything as you don't know when you'll be well again and able to return to work and have your normal income back.<br /><br />And worrying about bills etc causes more stress which exacerbates your already debilitating symptoms. </blockquote> <p>We know how difficult people with long Covid are having it and we need to listen to what they are asking for.  It is really good we are having this discussion but, really, we needed to have it two years ago.  It is far too late to be having it.  We need to act on this now because so many people are not able to get the help and supports they need and they are really struggling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="10:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900013#L00200"><p>I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this motion.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will support it.</p>  <p>  The various issues which accompany long Covid have yet to be properly researched and identified.  There is no doubt but that many have caught the disease, many of whom I know, and continue to suffer.  Some 90%, I think, who have it continue to suffer.  Their lives are on hold and many of the up to 200,000 people suffering from it are suffering in silence.</p>  <p>  The Regional Group is right to highlight the waiting list figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the 79,000 people on those lists and the further 625,000 or more awaiting an outpatient appointment, and the difficulties the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation have outlined.  I also draw attention to the acute hospital in Kerry, University Hospital Kerry, which is at breaking point.  If we do not have confidence in the Government to deal with issues of health, housing and even direct provision, how can we have any confidence that it will deal with this issue properly?  As for the hospital in Kerry, more damning information emerged recently.  In July, August and September of this year, admission through University Hospital Kerry's accident and emergency department was far above the State average 12-hour waiting time.  The most alarming statistic was probably that for over-75s.  In July, there was a 22-hour waiting time.  Although things improved somewhat in August and September, for all patients there was a waiting time of 15 hours in those months.  In that same period, 28% of all patients in the hospital in Kerry had to wait over 24 hours to be admitted.  Performance, once patients are admitted, is poor also, with wait times exceeding three days both for those aged over 75 and under 75 years for all three months of that quarter.  The winter plan is no more than a smokescreen as the real work, the planning, should have been done over a multi-year period.  This motion goes some way towards addressing those issues, and I hope the Deputies in the House, in particular Deputies from Kerry, will support it.</p>  <p>  There is also a difficulty and a crisis in home care, which has been brewing for many's the year.  In my region there are 651 people waiting for home care, a gap that is often filled by relatives and friends.  We need a proactive, strategic approach to workforce planning across all healthcare.</p></speech>

I also thank the advocacy groups which have stood up for people with long Covid and made the world listen when many people were being told to cheer up and get over it.  Those groups have organised an email campaign.  I am sure many of the Teachta&iacute; here have heard the harrowing stories of their local constituents.</p>  <p>  I wish to share the story of Louise O'Reilly, a nursing manager from Kilcullen, County Kildare, who was diagnosed with long Covid in July 2021.  She has had pneumonia twice in the past year.  Her breathing was badly affected.  She had tachycardia and chest palpitations.  Each week brought something new.  The most debilitating part was the decrease in energy levels.  When climbing stairs her legs felt like two lead blocks.  Louise has two children and, as we Irish mammies know, there is nobody so full of false hope as the mother who puts items on the bottom of the stairs in the hope her kids will carry them upstairs.  Last year, Louise had 16 GP visits.  She now lives with poor concentration and brain fog, symptoms which were slower to develop but now seem to be the most lingering.  She also experiences episodes of breathlessness and dizziness.  In June 2021, Louise tried to go back to work.  She struggled on and lasted a week.  She went from being very active to struggling to get out of bed.  Thankfully, she has a background in mental health and was very mindful of looking after hers.  In recent weeks, she has returned to work part-time but the worst thing is the uncertainty about the future.</p>  <p>  Covid needs to be recognised as an occupational injury.  Not everyone is lucky enough to be facilitated with a phased return to work and not everybody can afford it.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in support an accessible, community-based model of care for long Covid.  Anyone suffering with long Covid or post-acute Covid syndrome should be able to get help and advice from a local GP, a public health nurse or other local health and social care professionals.  An informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential.  Sinn F&eacute;in also supports measures to determine the true effect of long Covid and its impact on society and the health service.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a Bill which would have ensured that Covid-19 was treated as an occupational illness.  Unfortunately, the Government refused to support that legislation, and people with long Covid are now suffering the consequences.  The Government needs to support those living with long Covid.  It is time to make up for lost time.</p></speech>

From the few people I have known, both through my office and in the community generally, who have suffered from long Covid, that is precisely the word.  It has laid them completely low.  It is quite a serious illness.  Previously very energetic, active people who were very involved in the community struggle to get out of bed or maybe spend an hour or two out of bed and then return.  That is the experience of complete exhaustion, flatness, mental fog, inability to concentrate and incredibly low energy and high fatigue.  Obviously, that has huge implications for people's lives.  Some employers are understanding but others are not.  It has implications for parents trying to look after their children.  It has implications for carers trying to look after the vulnerable and people who previously had responsibility not only in their work lives but also in their private lives.  Long Covid has made that challenging.  It lasts for a long time.  Since we know so little about it, it is very difficult for people to be given answers and timelines from doctors that are so unclear.  Where is the light at the end of the tunnel for these people?  Some make a gradual recovery but some still suffer from long Covid quite some time later.</p>  <p>  I also wish to flag the issues faced by those who almost certainly and realistically had Covid in the very early months of the pandemic but who could not get a PCR test because the system was completely overloaded.  Some of those who are suffering from long Covid have found it very difficult to navigate the system because they did not have a positive PCR test, even though everything else pointed to their having long Covid.  They have had difficulties.</p>  <p>  I commend the work done by Deputy Naughten on this issue and on the motion, which Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  A lot more is needed in respect of post-Covid and long Covid clinics.  There are not enough of them.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise another issue, one which Dr. John Lambert flagged to the health committee, namely, that long Covid is being viewed primarily as a respiratory issue.  Obviously, there is a respiratory issue but there seems to be a clear neurological issue as well.  The health system and the Government are not taking that sufficiently seriously.</p>  <p>  Whether in respect of supports in work or in healthcare, an awful lot more needs to be done for those who are still suffering with long Covid.</p></speech>

We need supports for those who are suffering from long Covid.  Some of them got Covid doing work society deemed necessary.</p><p>I received a letter from Mary on behalf of her sister, Liz.  It was also sent to me by other people, including friends of Liz.</p> <p>I will read out some of it:</p><blockquote>	My sister, Liz, is a 56-year-old primary school Special Education teacher who contracted Covid-19 in a school in December 2021.  She is now suffering from severe Long Covid symptoms and has been off work since.  Her life is seriously impacted with ongoing long term chronic health issues and serious financial concerns.  Because she is unable to work, she is seriously stressed about her future, her pension and the fact that her illness is not recognised as an occupational injury, which impacts her entitlement to financial cover for periods off-work.  Because of Long Covid, the cost to her of medical appointments, scans and medicines since December last is in excess of &euro;3,000 and climbing, at a time when her financial future is increasingly unclear.  More importantly, and more distressing for those of us who care about Liz, is the life-limiting effects of this horrible disease.  An active, life-loving person in her mid-50s is reduced to a life of exhaustion, brain fog, breathlessness, memory issues, pain and distress, with no end in sight.  This is compounded by months of being referred from one organisation or service to another as each absolves themselves from responsibility by referring her on.  The response from others is to send endless paperwork and forms to a person with a seriously-reduced ability to absorb detail and to action any of these processes. </blockquote> <p>This is not good enough.  I could continue.  We can all imagine.  We are failing Liz and we need to do something about it.</p></speech>

No more than the Labour Party and others, the Regional Group does not have Private Members' business very often so an awful lot of thought and care go into choosing the issues deemed to be of importance.  A thorough debate in the D&aacute;il on this issue is long overdue.</p>  <p>  People suffering from long Covid are fast becoming one of a number of forgotten elements of the Covid pandemic.  The pandemic is still with us in many ways.  We hope we will not see the days of 2020 and 2021 again but the sufferers of long Covid are living with the condition and its ramifications every day.  I asked a few people over the past couple of days whether they knew anyone with long Covid or had any experience of it.  Those who did not thought long Covid was people suffering from fatigue.  Anyone who has met someone with long Covid or has been contacted by constituents, as I and others have, will know that it is far more complex and life-altering than that.  One person who contacted me contracted Covid in September 2020.  This person was unable to work for almost a year.  This person works as a photographer but literally could not hold the camera steady for ten months due to muscle fatigue.  Even though the person is back at work, they need an assistant with them if they are on an all-day job so they can complete a full day.  The assistant is needed to carry bags, such is the level of fatigue.  The person in question considers themselves one of the lucky ones who has largely recovered from long Covid but states that the health supports that are needed are not widely available.</p>  <p>  Another primary school teacher who contracted Covid in January 2022 returned to work at the end of August in advance of this school year.  They have crashed many times being unable to complete their school day and have not received the support within the workplace they need and deserve.  This person has reluctantly handed in their resignation.  This is a teacher leaving our education service because of the impact of long Covid at a time when we need teachers.  This is not a person at the end of their career.  This person said they have a mortgage, kids and all the bills and cost-of-living pressures but they just cannot continue to work.</p>  <p>  Someone else with long Covid symptoms since March 2020 said they know only too well that the health supports needed to deal with this are not widely available and the person has had to travel abroad to get the services they need.  Another woman wrote on behalf of her daughter, who was a young healthy 37-year-old at the time of contracting Covid and was working on the front line.  She was infected in March 2020, has not been able to work since then and has again been forced to travel.  This is person who has spent two and a half years suffering, first with Covid and now with long Covid, and has had to travel abroad for treatment.  This is a healthcare worker who has worked on the front line.</p>  <p>  The final example I will share today involves someone who again contracted Covid in March 2020 and has since developed long Covid.  This person has not worked since then.  This person was being treated in the Blanchardstown clinic before it was closed.  They were supposed to be transferred to the clinic at Beaumont Hospital.  The person's GP keeps referring them for tests and most of the time, the tests come back not showing anything.  There are no further tests and the suffering goes on.  This person is being moved from Billy to Jack in the health service and is getting nowhere.  This is a very serious case.</p>  <p>  The number of people suffering from long Covid is growing because people are still contracting the disease.  Yet, as this motion speaks to, what underpins this lack of service is the failure to recruit and retain healthcare professionals throughout our health service.  As we move towards the end of 2022 and into 2023, the people who are suffering long Covid are increasingly feeling forgotten by our health service and political class.  That is why it is important we are discussing this issue.   </p>  <p>  A related issue, which I have raised with the Minister previously, is counselling for people who have lost someone to Covid.  There is a unique experience if someone was lost a loved one to Covid and did not have the ability to say goodbye in person, to grieve or to have a funeral with family members present.  Those wounds are still open in families all over the country.  Again, we need to pay attention so that those people are not forgotten.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, Deputy Nash and I spoke to workers - contract cleaners, caterers and security staff - along with their trade union, SIPTU.  These workers have not received their pandemic recognition payment.  This is another forgotten element of the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  This motion is very clear in what it is asking for.  Regarding its acknowledgement at the start of the delays in the NTPF, difficulties in recruiting in GP and primary care services and acute hospitals and patient waiting lists in emergency departments, we see this repeated and continued near collapse and permacrisis that exists in our health service just to keep acute services and emergency services running, which means that further down the line, people with long Covid and post-viral respiratory or non-respiratory conditions are not being given the services they need.</p>  <p>  I commend the motion.  I know it is not being opposed by Government, which is its trick, but it has our full support.  What we would like to see after this is a real long-term plan - not a winter plan or an emergency plan - to ensure the people who are suffering with long Covid get the symptomatic treatment they need in the hope that they can recover or at least manage their symptoms to such an extent that they will be able to lead a fuller life than the life they are leading now.  Thousands of people are suffering and not enough is being done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="11:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900014#M00300"><p>I thank the Regional Group for tabling this important motion and acknowledge Deputy Naughten's work in this area over some time.  He certainly stuck with it for a long time, as indeed have other Members.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Health has not responded to this.  It seems as though the Government is hell-bent on sidelining long Covid.  As such, any opportunity to highlight issues related to long Covid care and support is very welcome.  There are so many people suffering from the condition, yet the Government seems to just turn a blind eye.</p>  <p>  We can all appreciate that many people do not want to hear about Covid and want to move on but that is a luxury long Covid patients simply do not have.  Symptoms such as chronic fatigue, depression, breathlessness, blurred vision, migraine and brain fog act as a constant reminder of their condition.  It is estimated that over 300,000 adults in Ireland have suffered or are suffering from these symptoms of long Covid but you would not think it from the Government's response.  </p>  <p>The Government's healthcare plan ignores the science.  It has completely left children with long Covid behind and the social welfare response has made us an outlier in Europe, in the worst possible way.</p> <p> I am particularly concerned about the model of care for long Covid, which has failed to keep pace with the science.  In fact, it was out of date before it was even published.  The plan is primarily focused on the lungs and heart and not on the brain.  The neurological and psychological impacts of long Covid have been known for quite some time, having first been identified in the medical literature in December 2020, nine months before this Government's plan was finalised.  Yet only one neurologist is funded under the Government's plan, and this is for the entire country.  You really could not make this up.</p> <p> Alongside ignoring the science, this Government has ignored patients.  Last July, I asked the Minister for Health if long Covid patients were consulted during the drafting of the model of care.  I was told "No", because it was a new disease.  This is no reason to exclude patients.  If anything, it is all the more reason to include them.  Equally, what about children?  The new long Covid clinics do not accept patients under the age of 16.  Instead, children are directed to their GPs.  It beggars belief that in the third year of the pandemic the Minister still has not managed to put together a plan for children.</p> <p> Another glaring omission from the plan is the Mater hospital's long Covid clinic.  I have repeatedly questioned this Government's decision not to fund this clinic.  It is the longest-running clinic in the country.  Instead, the Minister has dithered, thereby forcing the Mater hospital's clinicians to cut back services in the north inner city.  How much longer will the business case for a multidisciplinary long Covid clinic in the Mater hospital sit on the Minister's desk?  He has done nothing about it and this is the centre that has treated most people in the country for long Covid.  The particular expertise exists in the long Covid clinic in the Mater hospital under Dr. Jack Lambert, and yet the Government and the HSE will not engage with him.  I honestly cannot understand what the reluctance has been to fund this service.  Clearly, what the Minister was trying to do was to run down the clock in this regard.</p> <p> I was disappointed to hear this morning about what has happened with this clinic.  Dr. Jack Lambert has been in touch to say there has been an instruction to phase out the long Covid clinic in the Mater hospital due to the fact that the HSE has refused to engage with the clinic in respect of its business plan, which was submitted to the HSE in July 2022.  There has been no response from the HSE.  An instruction has now been given by management in the Mater hospital that due to the fact that the HSE has refused to fund the long Covid clinic in the hospital, the clinic will have to close by the end of this year.  This is the clinic where there is the most expertise and the one which has treated hundreds of patients, and it is going to close at the end of the year because of the failure of the HSE to engage with it and to provide adequate funding.  The management and the Mater hospital have made it clear that if funding were provided, the hospital would be more than happy to continue operating the clinic.</p> <p> I am, therefore, putting it to the Minister of State that he and the senior Minister owe it to the many hundreds of people who have been helped by this clinic, and to those who would dearly love to be taken on by the clinic to receive the necessary treatment, to ensure that the HSE engages, however late in the day, with the Mater hospital concerning the maintenance of this clinic.  I ask the Minister of State to raise this issue with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, as a matter of urgency today.</p> <p> There have also been serious staffing concerns right across long Covid and post-acute clinics.  It seems that only 22.5 out of 70 posts funded under the plan have been recruited for.  I repeat that is only 22.5 out of 70 posts.  It has been more than a year since this plan was published.  Was no workforce planning done in this area?  We know precious little workforce planning has been done right across the health service and this is the biggest challenge now to the provision of health services.  It seems, however, that no workforce planning at all has been done in respect of Covid clinics.  During last month's hearings in the Joint Committee on Health, we learned that the waiting list for some long Covid clinics can be up to five months, and even longer.  Reports are coming in from many patients that they have been told the wait is closer to ten months at this point.  This must feel like a lifetime when people are dealing with symptoms such as overwhelming anxiety, depression, breathlessness, brain fog and fatigue.  These patients need much quicker access to clinical psychology, neurology, physiotherapy and occupational therapy services.  For some, while they languish on waiting lists their problems are compounded by financial pressures.</p> <p> Let us take Emma from Kildare.  She is a nurse who just returned to work after contracting Covid-19 on the wards in April.  Her life has been turned upside down by long Covid.  She has been unable to care for her children and everyday activities have become exhausting for her.  She was refused sick pay in August and September and has had to go back to work.  She can, however, only work greatly reduced hours, which leaves her at least &euro;400 short monthly.  This is the reality of long Covid and the Government has failed to acknowledge how life-changing a diagnosis it can really be.  All healthcare and front-line workers who are unfit to work due to long Covid should be entitled to special leave as an absolute minimum.  Arbitrary deadlines should be scrapped.</p> <p> There are, of course, other issues regarding the Government's failure to adequately address the Covid-19 issue.  One of these is the whole question of the Department of Social Protection's failure to revise the position regarding occupational illnesses.  Why is Evusheld still not available to immunocompromised people in Ireland, despite its approval by the European Medical Agency, EMA, last March?  I could go on and on, but I have run out of time.  The Minister of State knows long Covid patients are suffering.  They can no longer be given the cold shoulder.  I want the Minister of State to take this issue up with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in a serious way.  It is time to change course and the Minister for Health has to act.</p></speech>

We are three years into this pandemic.  The world did not know the term "Covid-19" until three years ago.  Since then, this virus has claimed millions of lives, affected hundreds of millions of people and caused economic chaos across the world.  Many of us who got Covid-19 have recovered fully, thankfully.  A vaccine has been developed which has been hugely helpful in the fight against the pandemic.  A whole cohort of people who got Covid-19 in the last three years, however, have not recovered fully.</p>  <p>  As a member of the Joint Committee on Health, Professor Jack Lambert's critique of long Covid was a revelation to me and many others on the committee.  In my naivety, I thought the symptoms of Covid-19 were mostly respiratory.  As Professor Lambert said, cognitive and neurological symptoms can also be devastating to those who have long Covid and continue to suffer these symptoms.</p>  <p>  The most important aspect of this debate is that people in this situation must be listened to and supported.  This is the main thing in this debate.  For too long those with illnesses such as fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, or Lyme disease have been largely dismissed as having something that is largely in their own heads and been told they should just get on with things.  Obviously, this is not the case by any means.  In his critique, Professor Lambert laid out in bare terms that people are suffering physically and mentally in this regard.  I got Covid-19 about four months ago.</p> <p>Physically it takes its toll, but I cannot imagine dealing with those symptoms continuously for months on end.  It must be most distressing on those who are in that situation.</p> <p> For those who have long Covid, the main issue is support.  There is hope.  People who have long Covid do get better.  However, there is a cohort of people for whom it lingers.  That can be detrimental, not only to their physical health but also financially.  They cannot go back to work and that is a significant impediment on their financial circumstances.</p> <p> Not classifying Covid-19 as an occupational injury was a huge mistake by the Government.  This should be an occupational injury.  If one works in a medical setting - for example, if one is a nurse or doctor - one can get time off, etc., but if one is in a different setting, such as an educational setting, it can be much more problematic.</p> <p> If there is something to come out of this debate - the Government has put these specialist clinics forward - it must be that there is quite a lengthy waiting period to see a specialist.  The average waiting time is ten months.  Given the situation, it is not good enough.  If we listen to and support these people, the situation will be much better for those who are experiencing long Covid.</p></speech>

This is a huge issue.  It is not discussed enough and it will become an even bigger issue.  As the motion notes, there are likely to be well over 300,000 adults in the State who are suffering or have suffered from medical conditions associated with long Covid, based on an extrapolation of research done in the Netherlands.</p>  <p>  I have seen at first hand people I know who have been affected by long Covid and continue to be, and the debilitating effects of it are immense.  There is obviously a spectrum here in terms of how people are affected but at the high end of the spectrum, it is completely debilitating for people.</p>  <p>  A report compiled by APC Microbiome Ireland, which is based in UCC, surveyed 1,000 people with long Covid.  It found that nearly 70% of them were severely limited in their ability to work while 60% had missed work days due to their long Covid symptoms.  Sixteen per cent of participants said they were unable to work at the time of the survey.  Some were sick for up to 20 months while the median period of illness was over a year.</p>  <p>  Within this general topic of long Covid, the question of long Covid for children is not discussed enough.  I am sure many Deputies have received a message from Ms Hayley O'Connell, who is 11, turning 12 this January, and has long Covid and ME.  Ms O'Connell states that she has had long Covid for about a year and a half and it is not easy.  Hayley adds that you miss out on a lot of activities like going out with friends or going to the playground because you purely do not have the energy, and that it is not just about being tired - it is so much more.  She adds that it also involves leg cramps, muscle pain, being weak and headaches, and that there is so much more.  This was avoidable.  We must ensure that all children and everybody are protected from this in the future.</p>  <p>  In a way, there are two aspects to this.  The first is to do the research on long Covid and provide the funding and the resources in terms of treatment of long Covid now.  The HSE needs to establish a multidisciplinary public health team to review and manage long Covid.  It is vital that this team includes patient advocates so that the voice of patients experiencing it is incorporated.  It is a real problem that we still do not have long Covid services for children.  The rundown that is happening in terms of the Mater is scandalous, to be blunt.  It is probably a year or more since I was involved in a campaign, which was thankfully successful, to defend the long Covid clinic in Tallaght.  We still do not have enough of them and the Government is not taking it seriously and is not providing the resources.</p>  <p>  The other side of this question is that the best cure is prevention.  We are still not doing enough to stop people getting Covid.  Every time someone gets Covid, there is a risk - it is a small risk but it is present and one aggregates it over everybody - that 10% of people end up with long Covid.  Therefore, we need to do now what we should have done two years ago, which is to focus on the central question of ventilation and filtration.  It is almost a year since we introduced and had passed on Second Stage the Workplace Ventilation (Covid-19) Bill 2021 to give workers the right to clean air at work, which would include, obviously, schools and all indoor public spaces.  We now, finally, from Thursday last, have the HSE opening up a consultation process on its code of practice for indoor air quality.  I welcome this but it comes too late for the hundreds of thousands of people who are already suffering or have suffered from long Covid and the tens of thousands who will contract Covid and long Covid in the coming winter months.  We need action in terms of ventilation and in terms of filtration such as high-efficiency particulate absorbing, HEPA, filters, now.</p></speech>

This is one of many stories.  He was diagnosed with long Covid three weeks ago.  His symptoms have been present all this time and have made it impossible for him to carry out the simplest of tasks, such as driving, going to the local shops and even walking short distances.  He has had to give up sports such as hurling, football, soccer and golf.  His life is no longer the same because of this.  He was due to fly to Australia in August 2021 but had to cancel all his plans because his symptoms have not improved.  He would consider himself a young, healthy and fit individual who was involved in everything but can no longer live his life appropriately the way he used to before Covid.  He has also been unable to work for months now and fears he will never be capable to return with his current condition.  Due to this, he had applied for illness benefit and was turned down, which is ridiculous.  Through sheer determination, he was eventually able to receive a community welfare payment.  He has spent quite a substantial amount of money over the past six months on hospital bills and medication without any support from the Government.  It is a disgrace that he was turned down illness benefit payment in the beginning and that he had to go about obtaining his own long Covid clinic appointment in Dublin.  There are very few support networks out there.  I would suggest that this be urgently rectified for all of those throughout the country who have been tragically affected so that individuals such as this man can begin the journey of hopefully getting their lives back on track in the near future.  Surely the Government, which paid so much attention to locking down the country for months on end during the pandemic, should not now turn its back on people who are suffering from the lingering impacts of Covid.  This is the situation of one of my constituents.  It is the unfortunate situation of quite a lot of people.</p>  <p>  We are calling it long Covid, but others might say it is the effects of the vaccination.  We do not know.  What I am saying is that this is a very serious situation and it should be looked at.</p></speech>

I want to talk about a girl who has serious intellectual and physical disabilities.  She has been in and out of St. Mary of the Angels for many years as a respite patient but since her father died over a year ago, she has been full-time in St. Mary of the Angels because her mother cannot care for her.  This big, strong girl is nearly 40 years of age but it takes an awful lot of work to handle and mind her.

They say they are doing it for this decongregation model.  They want to move her to County Meath.  That is not acceptable.  I am appealing to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in the strongest terms not to let the HSE take this mother to court to make her daughter a ward of court.</p></speech>

Research highlights the real burden that long Covid represents to the Irish population.  We have an already overburdened health service, highlighting the importance of finding scientific solutions that can tackle the underlying mechanisms that are causing such diverse and debilitating symptoms.  More than 27,000 people left Ireland's emergency departments before being seen by a doctor during the three-month period from July to September.  I am not trying to say this is all down to long Covid problems but long Covid is adding to the problems we are having.  According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. some 10,679 patients who were admitted to hospital in October spent time on a trolley before securing a bed.  This is an increase of more than 25% on the figures for October last year.</p>  <p>  The situation with our GPs throughout the country is that they are overwhelmed.  There are not enough of them.  If we are to provide a proper healthcare service, we have to start from the ground up.  We have to have the doctors on the ground in our parishes and communities.  We have to have centres of excellence, of course, but we have to have more healthcare centres that can deal with people, whether those suffering from long Covid or other issues, and direct them away from accident and emergency departments because, quite simply, they cannot manage.  As I did yesterday, I again want to pay tribute to those working in Kerry University Hospital.  They are many criticisms of the management and various issues in the hospital but I thank those in that hospital and in all our community hospitals, whether in Kenmare or Cahersiveen, and in the nursing homes in County Kerry.</p></speech>

Many people are suffering from long Covid and they have a diagnosis after great cost to themselves and great energy spent, even though they have very little energy to try to get a diagnosis.  It seems a blanket has been put over Covid and we cannot discuss it or debate it.  One narrative has had to apply all of the time.  People are very ill.  More them are like young Roy Butler in Waterford who lost his life after the vaccine.  Will the Minister of State meet his family?  They were in touch with me quite recently.  They are desperately trying to get information from the vaccine companies.  I remember one day the Taoiseach came in here with all guns blazing and gave <i>carte blanche</i>indemnity to the vaccine companies.  Now we cannot find the wherewithal to support people who have long Covid.  Many of them are nurses, doctors and front-line workers in many areas.  They battled and we stood up here and clapped for them.  Some of them are still waiting for the &euro;1,000.  It is shocking that they are still waiting for the &euro;1,000 payment they were supposed to get.  This has all been a very sly game.  We saw that one of the heads of Pfizer recently admitted the vaccine was not tested on how effective it would be against the spread of Covid.  There are a lot of answers needed.  We need to look after people who have long Covid and who are vaccine injured.  This will go on for a long time.  Meanwhile big pharma is riding off into the sunset with billions of profits and the Irish taxpayers are patsies once more thanks to the new globalists and the Taoiseach.  He came in here and everybody supported him.  Why should we indemnify those companies if they are so safe?  They had no trials done.  They fobbed us off all the way.  Now people are ill and injured and suffering long Covid.  They must be looked after.  Why are 100,000 people on trolleys on a weekly basis?  Why are twice as many children in Crumlin today as this time last year?  Ask the questions.  The answers are quite obvious if we open the eyes and see.</p></speech>

The effects of long Covid are extremely concerning.  Many people in my constituency of Donegal are experiencing long Covid and the effects are devastating.  The health supports needed are not widely available and many of my constituents are suffering chronic ill-health without access to essential medical care.  It is a very serious issue but it appears the Government and the HSE would prefer to turn a blind eye to it.  One constituent who reached out to me is a young 11-year-old girl who has ME.  After getting long Covid she is struggling to attend even three days of school.  She says that some of her closest friends still do not understand that she does not like missing school and not doing homework.  She says she hates it.  She says that missing school and falling behind makes people want to do anything to be normal again.  This is heartbreaking.</p>  <p>  The symptoms are not the only issue that sufferers must endure.  Long Covid is now seen as an ordinary illness and sufferers are getting only reduced rates of pay.  I have also been contacted by a constituent who is a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a young family of six children aged between five and 17.  That person is receiving only half pay due to being absent with long Covid and is considering resigning.  This is completely unacceptable, especially given the current cost-of-living crisis.  The rate of sick pay in general needs addressing.  We cannot punish people for being sick.  Dealing with illness is extremely stressful and can have a detrimental effect on mental health and family finances.  We should not be adding to people's stress during a difficult time.  People cannot afford to take a pay cut when sick.  If anything, they need further financial support to help with medical costs.  I support the motion.  We need to start taking long Covid seriously.  I would go further and say the rate of sick pay should be greatly increased for all those who require it.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate because I have been contacted by many people who are unwell.  Their lives have been turned upside down.  They have gone from being fit and healthy to being sick and exhausted.  People are searching for answers.  They want their lives and their health back.  Those people deserve to be represented.  They deserve to be heard.  The motion from the Regional Group provides an opportunity for this and I thank them.</p><p>The motion calls for action on many fronts, including fully staffing long Covid and post-Covid clinics, as already committed to by the HSE in September 2021.  I think only one third of promised whole-time equivalents were in place by last month.  This is not acceptable.  The motion also calls for the establishment of a multidisciplinary public health team incorporating patient advocates who will review and manage long Covid care in the entire population.  It is crucial that the patient voice is heard.  There are too many silos and too much compartmentalised thinking when it comes to treating and supporting people with long Covid.  We need to prise open some closed minds when it comes to dealing with the totality of what long Covid includes.  The motion also calls for the establishment of a dedicated long Covid clinic for children and, crucially, for the recognition of long Covid as an occupational illness for all healthcare and front-line workers.</p><p>I want to read a few lines from one of the many people who have contacted me on this issue.</p> <blockquote> 	I'm a 41 year old nurse wife and mother of five from north county Leitrim.  I contracted Covid at work in January 2021 pre vaccines with inadequate PPE.  Fast forward over 18 months later I've still not returned to work and remain unwell.  Covid has massively impacted my health.  I've now got ongoing shortness of breath, muscular pain, nerve pain, joint pain, fatigue and brain fog.  Pre covid I worked full-time, now I need to lie down after a trip to Lidl.... Covid has stolen my health, career and my life as I knew it from me.  It is so disheartening that Government have still not acknowledged Covid as Occupational Illness.  I got this illness because of work and I feel like HSE and Government are leaving me to rot.  Its soul destroying and a awful way to treat the very ones who had no choice but to go to work with no vaccine and inadequate PPE. </blockquote>  <p>That is the strongest case that can be made for recognising long Covid as an occupational injury for healthcare and front-line workers.</p><p>I have contacted the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, about the need for a long Covid clinic for the north west, to be located in Sligo, but so far there has been no progress.  Nationally there are an estimated 336,000 adults affected by long Covid.  This number keeps increasing.  We need a long Covid clinic in Sligo.  I want to use this opportunity to support Professor Jack Lambert and his long Covid clinic in the Mater.</p><p>An issue raised by many of the speakers is that of contract workers, security and cleaning staff who have not yet been paid the pandemic payment.</p> <p>Deputy Nash organised a meeting yesterday at which four of them spoke.  I was ashamed that they had to come to Leinster House concerning what should have been paid to them long ago.  Before the introduction of personal protective equipment, masks and vaccinations, etc., they protected people in healthcare settings.  They should be paid and thanked.</p></speech>

It was initiated by Miriam Cullen, who is in the Public Gallery with other long Covid patients.  I thank Deputy Naughten and the Regional Group for using Private Members' time to discuss this serious issue.</p><p>The current HSE plan for long Covid medical support is inadequate.  It proposes only eight post-acute Covid clinics nationwide for newly diagnosed people for the first 12 weeks.  Should a person need continued care, there will only be six long Covid clinics nationwide for sufferers to attend.  One of the problems with the proposed care plan is that if a person is newly diagnosed in County Donegal, he or she may attend a post Covid clinic for 12 weeks in Letterkenny, but should further care be needed, he or she would go on a waiting list, with thousands of other people, for the nearest long Covid clinics, which will be in Galway and Dublin.  This problem is mirrored throughout Ireland and I ask people to sign the petition.</p><p>This is a serious situation that can no longer be tolerated.  We have to get our heads around what is happening in communities, involving thousands of people.  It is likely that in excess of 336,000 adults are suffering with long Covid every day.  This figure is based on the extrapolation of research based in the Netherlands published in <i>The Lancet</i>in August 2022, which attributed long Covid to 12.7% of patients infected with the virus..</p><p>The fact that long Covid services do not exist for children is scandalous.  It is a disgrace that the clinic in the Mater hospital, which treats neurological conditions such as brain fog associated with long Covid, has been forced to reduce its services due to a lack of funding.  It is important that there is an electronic patient register.  We have to know how many people have long Covid in order to provide the care that is needed.  There are other points I wanted to make but I only had two minutes.</p></speech>

A Private Members' Bill was tabled last night on home care, which I was delighted to attend and speak on, and I am here again to discuss long Covid.  These debates are important and we have to have them.  I welcome the tabling of this motion.</p>  <p>  Long Covid is a challenging condition for those who experience it and for service planning and delivery.  There has been progress in establishing a national service and the Government will allocate additional resources in 2023 to ensure the full implementation of the service.  The budget will facilitate an overall investment of an additional &euro;6.6 million next year for the further development of long Covid services to ensure a full national service is in place, which is an important point.  We are moving away from the postcode lottery to a national service and no matter where a person is living, he or she will get support.</p>  <p>  There is probably not one family or extended family in Ireland that does not contain a person who feels they have symptoms of long Covid.  They are experiencing symptoms they did not have prior to getting Covid.  I know a person in my extended family who has been dealing with multiple issues for the past 12 months.  There may be some Deputies who previously leaned towards being Covid deniers and are now talking about long Covid in the D&aacute;il today.  It is important that we accept and realise it is a real thing.  I know it is a real thing judging by the interaction I have had with people who have long Covid.</p>  <p>  We have to talk about this as knowledge develops internationally.  Two and a half or three years ago we did not know anything about Covid and now we are experiencing the effects of long Covid.  As knowledge develops internationally, it is important that the HSE&rsquo;s interim model of care is adapted to ensure it will be in line with the most up-to-date evidence.  We have to adapt, be flexible and nimble to make sure we can support the best national approach to supporting those with long Covid.</p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to monitor demand for services and to model the numbers of people affected by long Covid based on national and international data.  In this regard, an epidemiological survey is planned that will provide insight into the prevalence of long Covid in the Irish population and risk factors for developing long Covid.  This study will inform further service development.  I am informed by the HSE that this study is in phase 1, which involves testing the design of the study and recruiting the personnel required.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also commissioned HIQA to conduct an international review to further inform the development of the service to ensure it is in line with international best practice.  The review is expected to be completed later this month.  HIQA has carried out several very useful evidence-based reviews over the duration of the Covid pandemic, many at the request of the National Public Health Emergency Team, that have helped to provide an evidence base for various public health measures implemented over the past two and a half years.</p>  <p>  As with all aspects of our national public health response to Covid-19, it is essential that the most updated evidence continues to be used.  The HSE and the Department of Health continue to monitor international data and research to ensure all available evidence is used to improve service planning and delivery.  The Department, through its lead funding agency, the Health Research Board, HRB, currently supports a number of studies into long Covid.  The HRB will continue to promote long Covid as a critical area where evidence is required to inform clinical practice and policy development.  With the support of the Department of Health and HRB, Ireland continues to participate in international research studies on Covid-19, including the WHO Solidarity PLUS trial and the EU SolidAct.  As Members have heard, providing care for those experience long Covid requires a multidisciplinary response, particularly as symptoms and their impact can be so variable.  I have been struck by how varied the symptoms are for different people.</p>  <p>  General practice plays a key role in the delivery of a national long Covid service with the initial role of GPs being to exclude acute or life-threatening complications and other unrelated diagnoses.  As part of the implementation of the model of care, the HSE has engaged with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and other professional bodies.  Through this engagement, it has identified the opportunity to provide further education and training in the management of long Covid, including when and how to refer patients to specialist services.  The HSE is liaising with the ICGP on how future training and education can be optimally designed and delivered.  I understand the HSE is also engaging with patient groups, such as Long Covid Ireland, on service development, which is important.</p>  <p>  Fortunately, evidence to date continues to indicate that most children recover quickly from long Covid and the incidence of long Covid in children and young adults is low.  The best available evidence supports the provision of care to children by their GPs and, if necessary, by general paediatricians, who work in multidisciplinary teams and have specialist terms to refer to, including paediatric respiratory and neurology teams as needed.  The national clinical programme for paediatrics and the national clinical advisors and group lead for children and young people continue to work closely with the HSE long Covid team to review evidence and support access to care.</p>  <p>  The motion speaks to the need to ensure services are in place for those with care needs as a result of long Covid.  I assure colleagues that addressing Covid-19 is something all Government partners have prioritised in the programme for Government.  The Strategic Approach for the Management of Covid-19: Preparedness for Autumn/Winter 2022/2023, which was published last month, acknowledges the need to ensure provision of a national service for those suffering from post-acute Covid and long Covid.  It also emphasises how the clinical understanding of this condition will continue to evolve through the review of expert guidance to reflect best practice and ensure an effective service, with a health workforce suitable upskilled in the recognition and management of both post-acute Covid and long Covid.</p>  <p>  Five new post-acute Covid clinics have been established, which manage patients between four and 12 weeks after the initial onset of infection.  Long Covid clinics manage patients 12 weeks post onset.  Five new long Covid clinics have also been established.  Patients are referred by their GP to these clinics as needed and more clinics are due to open in the near future in Cork, Letterkenny and Limerick.  To care for those experiencing long Covid, clinical input is provided as needed, depending on symptoms, by a range of health care professionals, including those working in respiratory medicine, infectious diseases, neurology, mental health, allied health professions, general practice and other community services.</p> <p>These interdisciplinary teams guide and support patients through all aspects of recovery, support and care for a range of primary symptoms.  This, coupled with the HSE's planned service developments, will ensure that all necessary supports will be put in place. </p> <p> I reiterate that those affected by long Covid will continue to be cared for through our health services.  The Government and the Minister have committed to continued investment in ensuring a national service is in place.  The service is evolving as international and national evidence becomes available to help us better understand the illness and its consequences.  It will continue to evolve as needed to ensure those in need of care due to long Covid can access it.  I again thank Deputies for raising this important issue.  I was happy to come to the House and speak to it.  As different statistics emerge, I believe we will deal with long Covid for some time to come.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on long Covid.  I would like to commend my good colleague, Deputy Naughten, and C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, our group administrator who, in fairness, did all the heavy work in preparing the motion.  I acknowledge and welcome the presence of patient advocates and long Covid patients in the Gallery, who are very welcome.  I also acknowledge the constructive contributions from all Members.  Long Covid is too important to leave the Government with the monopoly on responsibility.  It requires every side of the House to pitch in with constructive ideas to see whether we can address this national problem, just like we have done in the past.</p>  <p>  Long Covid is real and it is recognised by the WHO.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was reassuring in her reply and I am heartened to hear what she said.  It is a massive issue that affects significant numbers of people, judging by the correspondence we have received in the past week.  While the numbers are large, they would be much larger were it not for the vaccination programme and co-operation of the public with the control measures introduced over the past couple of years.  The situation is much more manageable than it would have been otherwise.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, namely that we should not establish a hierarchy of patients.  However, a disproportionate number of healthcare workers are in the long Covid cohort and we need to examine why that is the case.  They did not do anything wrong; in fact, they did exactly what we asked them to do.  As a Parliament, we asked them to man the barricades, so to speak, during a time of crisis.  They did that very effectively.  As a result they have been affected disproportionately.  The State has a duty of care to that group in particular.  It is in the State's interest to address this.  We need to get people back to work and support them on their journey.</p>  <p>  What I like most about the motion is that it does not just list problems but includes a comprehensive list of potential solutions.  I wish to focus first on the need for greater supports from a research point of view.  The Ministers of State, Deputy Butler, outlined that this is a novel condition and we do not know a whole lot about it.  We need to fund research not just in Ireland but internationally.  It is an international illness and there needs to be multi-centre trials.  Perhaps if the Ministers of State are in Europe, they could use their good offices to get as much information as possible and get international research going on how best to assess, investigate and treat long Covid.</p>  <p>  We need to get the doctors involved.  Professor Jack Lambert has been a lone voice in the wilderness for the past while.  I am reassured by what the Minister said about the HSE engaging with the ICGP, which is as it should be.  The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland should also be involved.  Perhaps it is an issue for the CMO.  He might extend an olive branch.  It is on board already, but if they are running study or CPD days it might be an idea for them to cover the topic of long Covid to get the message out and share experiences from the point of view.</p>  <p>  The third area I wish to focus on is resourcing.  Everyone in the House recognises that this is not just about money; it is also about structure and getting clinics up and running.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, outlined, the clinics are not yet fully manned, but need to be.  I have the pleasure of travelling past the children's hospital this morning, as I normally do.  Aside from the financial issue, which is a debate for another day, it is reassuring to see the building going up.  It is to be hoped that by 2024 it will be up and running.  We cannot wait until 2024 for a dedicated paediatric clinic.  The Minister of State said this should be paediatric-led, which is correct, but one of the children's hospitals in Dublin needs to be designated as a long Covid paediatric centre of excellence.</p>  <p>  I am heartened by the debate.  Many commitments have been given, and we need to translate them into action.  We can say all we want in this Chamber, but is all about the implementation.  As a wise person once said, "It is by our actions they will know us", and that is how we should be judged.</p></speech>

The reality is that many patients with long Covid are not being believed.  The motion provides some official acknowledgement that they are being listened to.  In fairness to most Deputies, they have not recognised this issue to date because patients have not come to them directly.  I want to thank C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh and, in particular the library and research service for its support and for performing significant background research over the past year that has assisted me in helping to highlight the need to support long Covid patients across the country.  I thank the Ministers of State and colleagues across the House for their support in allowing this important motion to be adopted unopposed.  I want the Ministers of State to keep two figures in mind when the debate is over.  One is six months and the other is &euro;500 million.</p>  <p>  At present, long Covid patients suffer have to suffer for, on average, six months before getting a first appointment in the specialist clinics being established by the HSE throughout the country because these clinics are not being staffed.  The Ministers of State made reference to long Covid clinics, in particular St. Vincent's University Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and University Hospital Galway.  There are just two staff appointed to St. Vincent University Hospital's long Covid clinic.  No staff have been appointed to the Beaumont clinic or University Hospital Galway's clinic.  That is why people are waiting.  The Mater Hospital clinic is set to close at the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Long Covid patients with serious and debilitating medical conditions, from brain fog to chronic fatigue, are waiting an average of ten weeks from the date of referral to specialist clinics, with the longest wait being 42 weeks for patients trying to access the clinic in St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin.</p>  <p>  We must not forget that to meet the criteria for long Covid, a patient must experience symptoms for at least 12 weeks and if they are lucky they will get to see a GP be referred to a clinic within four weeks.  This results in people suffering with long Covid related symptoms and having to struggle with their illness for at least six months, on average, or well over a year if they are waiting to access support in St. Vincent's University Hospital Dublin, as Deputy Brady said.  While those waiting the longest after a referral to St. Vincent's hospital are those in Tallaght, who are waiting for 26 weeks after referral, in Cork University Hospital the wait is 20 weeks and the wait in University Hospital Galway is 16 weeks after referral.</p>  <p>  Long Covid is costing at least &euro;500 million in lost work and welfare alone.  Data from the Department of Social Protection show that 0.81% of those who contracted Covid-19 and claimed the enhanced illness benefit payment were medically certified as being unfit to work 12 weeks later.  Extrapolating this across the total number of people infected with Covid-19 in the adult population equates to 21,459 adults who are unfit to work or hold down a job.  If we use the arbitrary six-month waiting time for care, this equates to &euro;586 million in lost wages and welfare payments alone, never mind the impact long Covid is having on our already overburdened health service.</p> <p>We heard personal stories from colleagues in the House earlier.  We have long Covid patients in the Gallery, each and every one of whom represents thousands of patients throughout the country, many of whom are watching this debate on Oireachtas TV.</p> <p> I will leave two stories with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  One is from a ten-year-old boy named Ois&iacute;n and the other is from an 11-year-old girl named &Oacute;rla.  The ten-year-old boy, Ois&iacute;n, performed when the Taoiseach visited to open his school recently.  It was a very proud day for him and his family to have the Taoiseach there but, sadly, his mum who is housebound was not physically able to witness that performance because she has long Covid.  Eleven-year-old &Oacute;rla is attending school just three days per week because of the symptoms of long Covid but, as she says, "I am still struggling and some days, I even have to go home earlier".  Covid has had a considerable impact on all of us but I ask that the Government to ensure that our children, such as Ois&iacute;n and &Oacute;rla, do not continue to suffer because long Covid patients cannot get access to the medical care that will make a real difference on their road to recovery.</p></speech>

It was incredible stuff and, therefore, I will share with the Taoiseach just some of the hundreds of accounts from people who have been in touch with us in the past 24 hours - victims of the housing emergency.</p><p>Christopher tells us:</p> <blockquote> 	I'm living in rental accommodation. I work full time in the defence forces, my partner works part time as we cannot afford full time childcare. Will never ever be able to afford a house with prices this high. At my wit's end. I genuinely have to hold back tears some days out of pure frustration at the state of things. </blockquote>  <p>Tracy tells us:</p> <blockquote> 	I Had to take an overdraft so I can pay the mortgage every month. I can't afford oil for heating. We&rsquo;re ripped off. I&rsquo;m considering moving to New Zealand. </blockquote>  <p>Christine story is as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	I got 6 months&rsquo; notice to leave after 9 years renting. I&rsquo;ve 4 ... [children all] under 10. I've been on the housing list for several years. Council ... [tell] me there are no houses and to start asking ... family. I&rsquo;m so stressed I&rsquo;ve had to go on medication. I work hard. I feel so let down. My heart is broken thinking my ... [children] might not have a home. </blockquote>  <p>Aoife tells us:</p> <blockquote> 	Myself, my husband &amp;amp; 3 kids have lived with my mother for nearly 5 years now. We make too much money for social housing and WAY too little to own our own home. Our only hope would be affordable housing. We couldn&rsquo;t afford to rent. We feel like our lives have been on hold for so long now. We pay all our taxes and bills. We truly are the working poor &amp;amp; hidden homeless. </blockquote>  <p>Cillian says:</p> <blockquote> 	I am 28 years old, ... [I live] in a house-share. I have a good job, ... [but] at this age I [had] hoped to my own place. The house I&rsquo;m in is overcrowded and damp. I hate going home ...[from] work, but I have no prospect of finding a nicer place. I&rsquo;m very much considering moving away for a better life. I know [there are] people are worse off than me, but my current situation is [so] depressing. </blockquote>  <p>Kate tells us:</p> <blockquote> 	We&rsquo;re back living with my parents along with two children. We are saving for a house, but prices are crazy. We both have good jobs but [we are] not massive earners. When my dad was diagnosed with cancer in September, we considered moving out and renting again to give my parents space. 17 applications were sent and not one response! My eldest child is so insecure about not having our own house and it causes huge worries for him and us. </blockquote>  <p>There the Taoiseach has it.  This is just a small sample of the real stories of Government's collective failure in housing - a father is close to tears every day; a mother on medication to cope with the stress; young people feeling depressed and looking to emigrate; children wracked with anxiety and fear; and families living in a state of panic.  Deir an Taoiseach nach &eacute;igeand&aacute;il tith&iacute;ochta &iacute; seo ach n&iacute; thagann an tuairim sin le f&iacute;orsc&eacute;al na ndaoine.  The claim made that this is not a housing emergency is painfully out of touch with the reality of people&rsquo;s lives.  If this is not a disaster, what is it?  If this is not a social catastrophe, what is it?  If this is not a housing emergency - as the Minister claims - what is it?</p></speech>

Since the Government has come into office, we have focused razor-like on the housing issue.  The evidence supports this with the new schemes that have been brought in, construction and so on, but I will deal with that in a moment.  The Deputy should be in no doubt the Government sees housing as the key priority.  It is a pillar of the programme for Government and much has been done over the past two and a half years, notwithstanding the impact of the lockdowns during Covid-19, of which there were two.</p>  <p>  We came out of those lockdowns to the war in Ukraine and an inflationary cycle that greatly increased building material costs but we got to grips with that through the work of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, on public tendering and reform to give confidence back to the sector to continue to invest in housing.  We are increasing the supply of housing and will continue to do so.  The plan is working.  We all accept the challenges facing people but the answer is to build more houses and get supply up, along with a range of other policies.  I have said repeatedly that I have seen no alternative to Housing for All from the Deputy's party or anybody else.  I have not seen it in substance, detail or additional recommendations that would go over and above what the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has introduced.  Those are the realities.</p>  <p>  The latest home completion data from the CSO show the country is well on track in exceeding the Housing for All plan for 2022.  We will go over 24,600 towards the end of this year.  Some 28,000 homes were built in the 12 months to September 2022.  Some 21,000 houses were completed in the first nine months of this year and we hope to go over the target that we set ourselves.  The plan is working but we need to build more houses, more quickly.</p>  <p>  There were more than 16,000 first-time buyers in the past 12 months.  That is the highest since 2007 and represents 33% of all house purchases.  House completions, commencements, permissions, home purchases, first-time buyers and mortgage draw-downs are all up to record levels.  We have had the highest housing delivery since 2008; the highest commencements on record; the highest planning permissions, the highest number of first-time buyers since 2007; and the highest number of homebuyers since 2008.</p>  <p>  We have also pushed strongly ahead with social housing.  Some 18,390 new social homes have been added to the social housing stock under the Government to the end of quarter 2 of 2022, including 11,301 new builds.  We have brought 5,000 social homes back into use under the voids programme.  We are also concluding the review of a fundamental overhaul of our planning code, because delivery of housing is key, as is the delivery mechanism in respect of objections to housing projects and the slowness of delivery in many councils over many years.  O'Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Road - you name it - have taken too long.</p></speech>

She says she has been with her boyfriend for six years and they are still living with parents in a box room.  They just want to start their own life and are just waiting for something to get better.  It is so hard, she says.  Michael says:</p> <blockquote> 	We are a working family with 2 children.  Renting for 21 years.  We&rsquo;ve been given a notice of termination.  We have no idea where we are going next.  We can't afford to buy, and we can't afford to rent.  We are not even eligible for council housing since we are above threshold.  The future is so unsure. </blockquote>  <p>Does the Taoiseach accept that this is a catastrophe?  Does he accept that we are living through a housing emergency?  If, like his Minister, he does not accept that, it would go a very long way to explaining the Government's abject failure to meet the housing needs of people.  I will ask the Taoiseach a straight question.  I have given him just a sample of the stories.  This is a housing emergency, is it not?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is welcome back from COP27.  Yesterday, I welcomed that he was attending COP27 and that the Government was represented there by him.  I called for more urgent action here at home to tackle the climate catastrophe.  I think it has been promised that we will have a debate on COP27 in the next week or so.  I look forward to hearing more about that then.</p>  <p>  I turn to the plight of the 3,000 people in Ireland, many of whom live and work in my constituency, who are employed by Facebook or its parent company, Meta, and currently do not know whether they will be in a job in a few weeks' time.  We heard this morning from Facebook that it plans to make 13% of its global workforce redundant.  That could mean as many as 390 people being made redundant here.  That is a devastating prospect for so many people.  It does not just apply to those employed by Facebook because this news follows a spate of lay-offs.  There have been announcements from Twitter and Stripe.  From news today, we know Zendesk is considering downsizing and Intel is considering job cuts.</p>  <p>  There are many thousands of people employed by tech and related companies in Ireland.  Not all will be directly affected but many are in fear as they face this appalling prospect of losing their job.  In a grim irony, many are discovering their fate in real time through a drip-feed of coverage on the same social media sites that are now threatening to take away their livelihoods.  The news about job losses was broken to many Twitter employees when they were suddenly locked out of their email accounts in their workplaces.  That is no way to treat humans.  It is no way to show any sort of dignity and respect to those who are highly skilled, highly qualified and working in what we might call high-value sectors.  However, we know job losses in high-value sectors can also have knock-on effects on low-paid sectors.  In Ireland, we have seen chronic conditions for low-paid workers over many years and many of those working in these sectors will also fear the knock-on effect.</p>  <p>  I am asking that the Taoiseach and his Government call for much stronger rights for workers.  We need to ensure, for example, that we see collective bargaining as a right and collective bargaining in the workplace because many of these tech companies are stridently anti-union.  The workers are not organised within the workplaces in these high-value sectors.  The lack of representation and collective solidarity may well have an impact now on the sort of redundancy packages we are going to see offered.  We also need to see leadership from the Government on improvements to collective redundancy legislation in the event of liquidation.  Clearly, that is not the issue today with the tech companies but it is a scenario that devastatingly arose for Debenhams workers two and a half years ago.  We still have not seen delivery of the promise to improve collective redundancy rights in the event of liquidation.  Will the Taoiseach guarantee strengthened collective bargaining and workers' rights in the face of these lay-offs and projected lay-offs?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, Meta has made a global pronouncement that will have implications for Ireland but we have to facilitate and provide for proper consultation between the company and its employees.  The employees who may be affected should at least be afforded - it is our understanding they will in this case - proper due consultation.  Meta employs about 3,000 people directly in this country and 6,000 contractors.  It has dramatically increased its workforce in Ireland over the last number of years.  That has been the case with many companies across the technology sector generally.  It was good news over a ten-year period to witness that dramatic increase in jobs.</p>  <p>  For any workers to learn at this time of year that they may lose their job is sad and difficult news.  The role of the Government and its agencies is to work with the company and also the employees to ensure every support is available to employees.  That applies both to supports and also potential alternative employment opportunities.  In the past six to nine months, we were experiencing almost full employment.  It is to be hoped there will be opportunities within the tech sector and broader sectors for anybody losing his or her job following the announcements a number of companies are making.</p>  <p>  We must keep the balance right as well, in that sectors go through change and many tech companies have, as I said, undergone very rapid periods of expansion, some of which is clearly being pulled back globally.  The world economy is changing, as we know.  There are headwinds across the globe and these are impacting on the technology sector.  We have been here before.  At the moment, the consultation and the work IDA Ireland is doing suggest this is something we are going to have to deal with.  However, we need to keep perspective and balance in our analysis of this and the description of what is actually happening.  We must see it against the backdrop of very rapid expansion over the last number of years.  We must ensure we do everything we possibly can to help the workers in this situation.</p> <p>We have a good system for doing that and we have managed to do it in the past.</p> <p> We should also seek out new opportunities that will arise in the reorganisation of this sector.  New opportunities will always arrive and it is important that we keep an eye open for them.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, SOLAS and the Department of Social Protection all stand ready to help workers who could get bad news in the next number of days.  That is a very difficult situation for them.  More broadly, foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland is still very strong and the pipeline is still very strong.</p></speech>

It is indeed sad and difficult news.  I know of friends, neighbours and constituents who are in a situation where two partners are both working for tech companies.  They have massive mortgages and enormous childcare fees.  They are locked into these commitments and are facing an uncertain future in which they see prospective job losses.  I absolutely accept there has been enormous expansion in the sector, supported by State investment.  Let us not forget that.  Indeed, I understand the State invested &euro;42 million in Stripe through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  There must be a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  There has to be a sense that companies are now going to treat workers with dignity and respect.</p><p>Can the Taoiseach confirm the statement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, yesterday that penalties and sanctions will be applied where companies are found to be in breach of existing laws requiring, for example, a 30-day notice and consultation period where collective redundancies are being discussed and presented and where there is required to be notification in advance to the T&aacute;naiste's Department?  We have seen indications that these legal obligations will be complied with but can the Taoiseach confirm sanctions will follow where there is a lack of compliance?  Can he confirm he will be looking to strengthen the rights of workers to ensure they are treated with dignity and respect in similar situations in the future?</p></speech>

I made it very clear in the context of the Twitter announcement that I was not at all happy with the manner of it.  Respect and dignity are very important in communication terms.  There are established frameworks for communication and there are obligations on employers in proposing collective redundancies, for example, which involve fines if they fail to consult with employee representatives or provide certain information to employees when proposing a collective redundancy.  There are fines covering that and the law will be enacted.  In the context of Meta, our understanding is there will be full and proper consultation with employees.  The same applies to Stripe.  The Twitter case was a much different context.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier, we have a strong diversity in our FDI mix in Ireland, from the life sciences to financial services and technology.  Last year was a record year.  This year is still a record year in terms of inward investment but our focus will be on the workers who could be getting bad news in the coming days.  We will do everything we possibly can to help them.</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach confirm its status?</p>  <p>  I understood the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would be taking Leaders' Questions today and I wanted to ask about student accommodation.  My question is about what is being proposed for the future, given that students have, to a large degree, been left at the back of the queue in terms of our accommodation crisis.  Some students might have the choice of living at home but they are largely in the minority of those accessing third level.  At best, it would be inconvenient for families who have the required economic resources.  For those who need to travel for education, accommodation issues certainly are a personal life-limiting event.</p>  <p>  The national student accommodation strategy from 2016, which runs for another two years, is a shared policy between the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Sadly, the strategy clearly is not up to the task.  I refer to the particular accommodation crisis in Waterford.  Bizarrely, despite the big plans that are forever in the future for Waterford's higher education sector, the Department's 2016 strategy models no additional student accommodation whatsoever for Waterford.</p>  <p>  Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT - now the South East Technological University, SETU - was at the vanguard in developing its own student accommodation, with the College Fields development dating back to 1992.  Great foresight was demonstrated by the college leadership at that time.  It prudently borrowed to build enduring public resources for students, which, 30 years later, provide income to the college.  In 2012, in the midst of construction work, the capacity for borrowing was taken away from WIT.  This is a capacity that has enabled the building of accommodation in every other university in Ireland, including in Galway, Cork, Limerick and Dublin.  Irish universities have more than &euro;1 billion of debt at this time, much of it to the European Investment Bank, EIB.  Little of it relates to funding accommodation for the new technological university, TU, sector.  At this point, none of it relates to SETU.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach commit to revising the national student accommodation strategy?  Will the Government reintroduce a borrowing capacity to SETU and end the discrimination within the third level capital funding capacity at present?  Most importantly, will the Taoiseach support the building of badly needed student accommodation in Waterford to allow the expansion of college numbers that is so badly needed to end the brain drain in the south-east region?  We need student accommodation that is tailored to student needs and to allow family homes that are inappropriately rented at this time to be returned to the rental sector and to private family use.</p></speech>

This is great news and we are very pleased with it.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point in respect of student accommodation.  I have been very engaged in this issue with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  The institutes of technology never had the capacity to borrow but now, as technological universities, they do.  A number of measures have been taken in the short term.  We brought in a tax credit for renters that will apply to situations where parents pay rent for their child attending third level.  In terms of accommodation, there has been a big viability gap between what colleges could build, and the cost they could build it at, and the rent at which it could be offered.  The rent would be too excessive for students.</p>  <p>  We have been examining ways and means of bridging that gap.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has set up a dedicated unit within his Department dealing with student accommodation.  The staff have gone to all the institutions to identity whether there are short-term initiatives the State could take to underpin projects.  We are looking for some early solutions in respect of accommodation.  The Minister will bring a memorandum to the Government in the next number of weeks in regard to this initiative.  We will then have to look at a more medium-term initiative for students in need, including, for instance, students in receipt of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant.  There are state aid implications if the State intervenes to support the construction of student accommodation.  We would need European Commission approval.  That is being progressed.  In the interim period, we are looking at four potential sites on which we could perhaps get initiatives under way to get badly needed accommodation for students in place.</p></speech>

They have engaged with me constantly on this matter.  It is a good day for the south east to see this project developing, and I thank the Taoiseach for that.  </p> <p> In regard to the national student accommodation strategy, I am mindful that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, told me a week ago that I never welcome anything.  That is not the case.  We have a deal of work to do and a road to travel and that is what I concentrate on.  WIT had an excellent reputation for developing its own accommodation from 2012 onwards.  We have lost much ground there.  The Taoiseach stated the Minister, Deputy Harris, would bring a memorandum to the Government and the TUs could have a borrowing framework.  Will he clarify whether that has been crystallised?  Can TUs now access capital independently under a borrowing framework to deliver student accommodation and also the teaching buildings they need to deliver?  We need a more appropriate strategy.  I am absolutely committed to working with the offices of the Government to deliver that.</p></speech>

That was a key ask, particularly to unblock the student accommodation issue.  Some of the institutions have land but the schemes did not add up in terms of viability, as I said.  That has slowed down much of the student accommodation in the past two to three years.  The State has to get involved to bridge that viability gap.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is working on that.  He established a dedicated unit which visited all the universities, both TUs and the more traditional universities, and it hopes to come forward with some interim solutions and then a more general scheme that supports State intervention to get more units built.</p>  <p>  Some 670 new beds were provided this year and some will be delivered by the University of Galway later this year.  This shows it can be done but it is clear the State has to get involved.  The rent-a-room scheme has been effective.  This is where people can earn up to &euro;14,000 in rental income before having to pay tax.  A lot of work went into marketing that scheme for this year&rsquo;s student intake.  It yielded some good results and the institutions promoted it strongly.  We are looking at other ways to make that option more attractive.  We have a lot of housing stock that is not optimally occupied.  That is a good scheme as it incentivises people who might be in a three- or four-bedroom house on their own and can bring somebody in.  It is a good use of existing housing stock and a quick way of getting extra stock in use.</p></speech>

In Donegal, 7,700 properties are lying vacant while 2,646 families are on the housing list in the county.  There is no doubt that there is a direct link between dereliction and the current housing crisis.  There is also no doubt that the whole us-versus-them narrative is one that has been fuelled by this Government unfortunately.  For this, it should be ashamed.  There is no reason we cannot house all those on the housing list in Donegal, displaced refugees and all those affected by the mica crisis, who are required to live elsewhere while their houses are being rebuilt.  I have been saying this for a while now but we need to figure out what we are going to do about the many families who will be displaced due to mica.  As time ticks on and the redress scheme is put in place, I am anxious that hundreds of families in Donegal will be displaced over the coming years.  I have been contacted by one family with a seven-year-old child with a disability.  They say:</p> <blockquote> 	I am sure you are aware of the shortage of rental properties in our country, never mind our county.  The possibility of us finding a rental property with wheelchair accessibility is going to be non-existent and a mobile home is going to be completely out of the question for us in our situation.  Our existing home may not be in great shape but is accessible for our son [at the moment].  We are a young normal family from Donegal that seem to be stuck in this unfortunate situation like so many others. </blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, this is only one of many mica families who have contacted me regarding their anxiety about finding rental accommodation while dealing with the mica crisis during a housing crisis and a cost-of-living crisis.  The Government is literally forcing people to endure crisis after crisis and doing absolutely nothing to help them.  This issue will only continue to get worse.  The Government needs to pull the finger out and put a plan in place.  I know of many people in Donegal who have offered their accommodation to Ukrainian refugees and were refused.  Is there no way we could set up a system to allow these people to offer their accommodation to mica families who need temporary accommodation while their houses are rebuilt?  We have shown that these systems can be put in place.  Why then are we not using them to help Donegal families?  What is the Government going to do to address the rental crisis faced by displaced mica families in Donegal?</p></speech>

We will exceed our targets on the Housing for All plan this year.  We will get more than 24,600 houses but that is not enough.  We need to get to 33,000 houses per annum.  Next year&rsquo;s target is 29,000, as per the plan.  That needs a collective approach from everybody in this House and from society.</p>  <p>  Our planning system will be overhauled but it needs to be overhauled because we do not have the luxury of opposing housing projects here, there and everywhere, on an ongoing basis or in a serial manner, because that just slows down the process whereby people who need houses get houses.  The younger generation needs houses and access to houses.</p>  <p>  In regard to Donegal, the Minister will meet the chief executive officer of Donegal County Council next week to discuss a range of issues.  The mica scheme is one for the long haul in the sense that a set number of homes is coming forward.  I think about 300 have been identified as needing major works.</p>  <p>  One area we are looking at is rapid build.  That has to be considered in addition to what we are doing already in regard to house building.  New technologies in house construction emerge all the time, which means we can shorten the time for constructing a house.  Last week, I had good discussions with Fingal County Council.  I was on a site where 1,000 houses will be built.  It can at least do this within 12 months, from sanction to people moving into the houses.  We use terminology incorrectly about this.  Much of it is new manufacturing technology and new models of delivery in terms of steel frame and factory sites doing much of the work off-site, which means people are in a position to accelerate the construction of a house.  We will see greater use of rapid build to deal with all of the issues we have, including the social housing waiting list, and to deal with situations that arise in terms of mica or whatever else.</p>  <p>  We have taken measures.  I met mica group representatives in Donegal more than a year and a half ago with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  The Minister then engaged on the cost of rent in advance, which had not been allowed in the previous scheme.  We rectified that.  The financial wherewithal is there now under the new legislation and new scheme to assist people in securing rental accommodation.  Deputy Pringle is pointing out that there is an issue.</p></speech>

Even if the mica scheme works well and 300 mica houses are done every year, where will the 300 affected families be housed?  If 300 houses are done every year, it will take many years to get through all the houses affected by mica.  We should be earmarking, buying and servicing sites now for temporary accommodation for people because when this scheme starts it will be too late to look for housing as it will take a year to deliver the houses.  We cannot have families waiting.  The problem is that families cannot get anywhere to rent.</p> <p>In my end of the county, one cannot get a house to rent.  There are families on the housing list that cannot get a house to rent.  It is not possible.  Yet, there are loads &ndash; thousands &ndash; of Airbnbs all over the place.  Why not target those?  If the accommodation is made available and can be done quickly for Ukrainian families, and rightly so, why has it not been done for Donegal families as well?  The Government needs to be pulling out all the stops.  I am glad that the Minister is meeting the chief executive next week and I hope he addresses these issues, which are vitally important and need to be addressed urgently.  We will end up with a scheme starting to repair houses where families will have no where to go to get their house repaired and that is just not on.</p></speech>

They are not in houses right now, but they are in pledged houses that individuals who, having seen what was happening in the war, decided to make their homes or vacant houses available to Ukrainians.  Therefore, Ukrainians have not affected the social housing market and that impression should not go out there - they have not and that is as clear as night follows day.</p></speech>

In terms of Ukrainians, we developed a new scheme.  I told the Deputy that we have to consider rapid build for social housing and the housing issue more generally to get the numbers of houses that we can build up significantly.  We need to build more houses than we are building.  The past two and a half years have seen very significant progress on the housing front.  The foundations have been built now legislatively as a whole range of schemes have been introduced in terms of affordability.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is there to get vacant, derelict houses rebuilt for people to own and occupy.  There is a lot there now, to be fair.  The first home scheme is there as well, which will help many young first-time buyers.</p></speech>

It is a great day for Waterford.  Well done to all involved.</p>  <p>  I raise the issue of spinal surgeries for children with scoliosis and spina bifida.  The Minister earlier this year presented a plan which, in fairness, was a collaboration of working with the hospitals, but also with the Opposition.  The plan set out funding on the one hand but also a number of targets on the other.  The first target is that we would reduce the number of children waiting from 224 in January to 128 by the end of the year.  That target will not be met.  The second target was that no child should wait longer than four months.  That target will not be met either.  The third target was that we would spend the money that was allocated - &euro;19 million.  We had an admission from the Minister yesterday that none of those targets would be met.  Now we have problems with even the &euro;19 million funding that was announced being spent because of staffing issues and because the surgical theatres will not come on as quickly as possible.  We need to get our act together on this issue and make sure the funding that was announced is actually spent.</p></speech>

We need to acknowledge the extraordinary work that is going on across multiple sites by our healthcare workers.  The main target was to increase radically the number of children who are getting this urgent surgery that they need.  As the Deputy will have heard Dr. Green say on RT&Eacute; recently and others, they are not only meeting all of those targets, they are exceeding them.  One thing has happened that they were not expecting, which is that there has been a very high additional number of children referred into Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, CHI, partly from private practice and partly from Galway.  Because of the additional unexpected number of children coming in, it will not reach the target of zero children by the end of the year.  However, I am very happy to share with the Deputy the latest information from CHI.  It will have gone from several hundred children at the start of this year down to fewer than 50 waiting more than four months by the end of December.  Critically, it confirmed to me that it is on course for what we all want, which is every single child to be treated in less than four months.</p></speech>

We see 572 patients in hospitals without a bed this morning, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  Some 100,000 people have gone without a bed so far this year.  The public health service is in danger of collapse if this trolley crisis is not resolved.</p>  <p>  I was in Limerick on Monday and I heard from many people there about the chronic overcrowding and waiting list problems in University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  Can the Taoiseach and the Minister guarantee some sort of plan to address this chronic issue in our hospitals across the country, in particular the serious issue with UHL in Limerick, but also more generally?  How can we guarantee that coming into this winter we will not see a complete collapse in capacity in public hospitals, particularly in emergency departments?  We are also seeing elective surgeries being cancelled, waiting lists for children&rsquo;s care and waiting lists spiral across the sector.  What is the plan for the winter and specifically for Limerick?</p></speech>

The Government&rsquo;s plan is to end winter trolley crises permanently.  The way we are doing that is adding more permanent capacity to our public health service than ever before, such as adding many thousands of healthcare professionals and by the end of the year more than 1,000 acute beds.  We are ahead of the 2018 capacity review on hospital beds, critical care and many other areas.</p>  <p>  However, in the context of Covid, Ireland, Australia, the UK and many countries across the world are suffering intense pressures through the winter.  This will be a difficult winter.  The Government has deployed a huge amount of money.  There is an all hands on deck effort being put in place by the HSE.  All 29 hospitals have tailored winter plans.  They are working directly with community care and nursing homes to get patients out of hospital as quickly as possible.  However, this winter, as in the UK and France and as has happened in Australia and other countries, it will be difficult due to this huge additional burden that Covid has caused and will continue to cause.</p></speech>

Housing commencements are in fact down 14%.  He also told the D&aacute;il that the housing plan is working, however, all of the evidence shows that it is not.  House prices and rents have never been so high.  Homelessness has reached record levels.  The number of people emigrating from the country because housing is unaffordable is increasing.  There are hundreds of thousands of people stuck living in their parents&rsquo; homes in their 20s and 30s because housing is so unaffordable.  Will the Taoiseach correct what he said on commencements?  The numbers are, in fact, 14% down.  Will he recognise that?</p></speech>

There was subsequently a flurry of publicity &ndash; television appearances and so on.  That obviously shamed the Government and Tipperary County Council into offering them emergency accommodation, which they moved into in Cashel.  I talked to Graham this morning who told me they are being told to leave by next Tuesday.  A homeless family with children is being evicted from homeless accommodation because of the income threshold and the failure of the Government to raise the threshold, which the Minister is now planning to outsource to consultants for yet another review.

The model on which the current service is operating was developed in the 1950s and is not fit for purpose in a modern working environment.  I acknowledge that the Department has undertaken investment in my constituency, with a new fire station in Tuam, a contractor having been appointed for Athenry and the Loughrea fire station going to Part 8 planning.  It is great to have the facilities but we also need to have retained firefighters in place so that they can man the fire stations and protect people.  If we learned anything from what the retained firefighters did in Creeslough, it is important that we take this on board as a matter of urgency and sort it out.</p></speech>

As the Deputy stated, the way in which they responded to the terrible tragedy in Creeslough was a shining example of the really important work they do.  I will make two points in respect of the fire services.  The Government has brought forward a capital plan of &euro;62 million over five years, as the Deputy mentioned.  We are seeing upgrades and new stations, fire tenders and equipment across the country.  The retained service is crucial.  The review is time bound.  The Taoiseach has engaged directly on this.  The review relates to how we can improve conditions for the retained service but also attract more people in.  One of the issues has been ensuring that people's employers, depending on the job they are doing, will give them the time to do that work.  In that regard, there is the potential to move to a shift base.  Dennis Keeley, the chief fire officer in Dublin - I will conclude on this important point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle - is heading up that review with colleagues.</p></speech>

The Powerstown-Lisronagh community alert group from Tipperary are coming up to meet her today.  It is fighting to save its community.  There is a lack of Garda numbers.  The local garda&iacute; are doing their best.  Save our Local Community in Tipperary came up to Dublin previously after a heinous robbery in Killenaule when a business family was nearly destroyed.  It lobbied hard for electronic tagging.  Electronic tagging started but only 151 persons - prisoners, those on remand or whatever - have been electronically tagged since 2006.  It is appalling.  In a reply from the Minister, she stated that electronic tagging has been discontinued since 2017 because of costs.  What is going on?  Why are garda&iacute; expected to run around after people who are out on bail when electronic tagging has been proven in many jurisdictions to be successful, easily monitored and a good system?  The Government has no funds to run it.  How are we going to support communities?  What message is the Minister, Deputy McEntee, going to give the good people of Tipperary today?  They are good people who want to save their communities.  How are they going to be supported if the Government is saying it has run out of money and cannot afford to do things that we in this House fought hard for and legislated for?</p></speech>

The Department conceded to the overturning of its own report findings that there was no evidence of wrongdoing in the planning department of Donegal County Council, apologised to Mr. Convie and paid him substantial compensation.  This led to the commissioning of the Mulcahy report in 2015 which was to be completed in October that year.  It took almost two years for it to be finalised.  It sat on Eoghan Murphy&rsquo;s desk for three years, and it has now sat on the desk of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for more than two years.  The excuses in the Minister's cut-and-paste replies to repeated parliamentary questions are unsustainable at this stage.  When he sat on this side of the House he called for the publication of the report, yet now he prevaricates.  What has changed?  Why is he now frightened to publish the Mulcahy report?   It is time to be honest on this issue.  Is the Government going to publish it?  If it is not, will the Minister come out and say that?</p></speech>

I am glad he is back to take it so I do not have to explain much of the background.  It involves the amalgamation of two secondary schools, namely, St. Vincent's Secondary School and North Presentation Secondary School, on the north side of Cork city.  All four Deputies representing Cork North-Central jointly tabled a Topical Issue matter last night.  We are unanimous in our opposition to the process that has taken place up to now.  There has been a complete lack of consultation with stakeholders.  I understand from the response of the Minister, Deputy Foley, last night that a meeting between both boards of management and trustees is to take place tomorrow morning.  I welcome that and hope there will be a resolution or further deliberation on the next stage of the process that is to be followed.  The only document I could find that is relevant to managing the amalgamation of secondary schools dates back to 2001.  It is a serious issue that we need to address.</p></speech>

The issue is basically that the patrons and trustees of both schools have set this process of amalgamation in train.  A fundamental principle of partnership in education is consultation.  Parents are clear that they have not been consulted enough in respect of this proposal.  I was not in the Chamber yesterday evening - I was in Cairo - so I did not hear the Minister for Education's reply.  I will follow up with her again.  My view is that there should be full and comprehensive consultation with the parents in respect of this issue because a lot of concerns have arisen.  There are broader concerns in terms of curriculum choice and so on in terms of the two schools and the number of pupils in each school.  There are issues there but, nonetheless, there should be comprehensive consultation all around.</p></speech>

It is something in which I, too, have taken a keen interest.  We have reached a point where we need to consider having dedicated physical education, PE, teachers in primary schools.  Such teachers could be shared among schools if the numbers in the schools are not particularly high.  I ask for that to be done because the latest WHO figures show that 34% of five- to nine-year-olds are overweight or obese and, in terms of the rankings in that report, out of 53 European countries, Ireland's five-to nine-year-olds rank ninth in terms of obesity while ten- to 19-year-olds rank tenth.  We have almost reached crisis point.  A practical measure would be to have dedicated PE teachers.  I know this is being considered in terms of the primary curriculum framework.  Such teachers are in secondary schools.  They should be put into primary schools.  That could involve sharing such teachers among schools of smaller size.  What is the view of the Taoiseach on that proposal?</p></speech>

We need to be careful that we do not compartmentalise this into one 45-minute period of the day.  One of the big problems with primary schools is curriculum overload because there are so many core subjects, with science and other subjects having been added in the past 20 years.  Physical activity should be part of every school day.  It should be part of the social, personal and health education aspect.  It should be integrated into the entire programme.  It is about nutrition.  There is a full range of issues that need to be considered.  Every teacher, in a way, should be part of this agenda.  The Minister will keep that under review but there are many priorities across the board in terms of resources and so on.  The physical activity issue and physical education requirements are something we have not done well historically in Ireland at primary level.  I acknowledge that.  It is a fair point.</p> <p>It is only in recent decades that we have developed junior cycle and senior cycle curriculums.  I acknowledge we have work to do at primary level.  I will not close the door on what the Deputy is saying.</p></speech>

They are living in defective block homes that are not fit for human habitation.  The Taoiseach and Minister must have seen some of the images on social media and on TG4 last night.  These houses are not fit for human habitation.  I appeal to them to either release the &euro;15,000 to allow these homeowners to find alternative accommodation or allow modular high-quality housing to be built on different sites.  It will be a huge problem - Deputy Pringle referred to it - that families will go through the scheme, please God, in the near future, but will not have alternative homes while their houses are being rebuilt.  When the Minister meets the chief executive of Donegal County Council, I ask him to come up with some solutions for the dozens of families affected this winter and the hundreds of families that will be affected in the years ahead.</p></speech>

I will meet the chief executive this Friday, when I intend to discuss this matter with him.  We are working very co-operatively with Donegal County Council.  Certainly, I have seen the images and I have spoken to owners of homes that are in a very poor state of repair.  As the Deputy knows, we have already made some changes in respect of the weathering grant in that we brought it forward.  I am certain we will be able to front-load some of the expenses where homes are dangerous.  I want to do that.  I want to get the scheme up and running and homes beginning to be remediated, especially in County Donegal.  It is happening in County Mayo.  We will bring in regulations before the end of the year to underpin the scheme.  I will come back to the Deputy, Deputy Pringle and my colleagues in County Donegal, including the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, following my meeting with the chief executive and his team, which I will have this week.</p></speech>

Therefore, I welcome the introduction of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, the expansion of the repair and lease scheme and the increase in the money available for it.  Will the Minister provide an update to the House on the extension of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe to single, one-off, rural cottages, farm buildings and other derelict buildings?

I will expand the repair and lease scheme to one-off rural houses this month.  An announcement on that can be expected imminently.  The guidelines for local authorities are also ready to issue.  That will happen in the coming days.  There is a lot of interest in it.  We have had well over 400 Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe applications from towns and villages throughout the country to bring derelict and vacant stock into use, which the Deputy has spoken about many times in the House.  It is a very good and simplified way of doing it.  I will announce that in the coming days.  We will also look at other options with regard to adding to affordable stock but I want to get Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe bedded in.  It has been a good start since August and we want to accelerate that.  I will keep the Deputy informed of progress.</p></speech>

However, there is an issue regarding support for the installation of these panels.  We have discovered that farmers who want to avail of solar panel grants can only use the electricity generated from those grant-aided panels on the farm they sit on and cannot pass on the benefit.  I spoke to a businessman in Tullow about this issue this week.  Murphy's Butchers has won the award for the best pork sausages in the world.  I congratulate Laz Murphy of Murphy's Butchers in Tullow.  It is a great achievement.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach knows, this is a business that relies heavily on refrigeration.  Mr. Murphy inquired about solar panels and, following a survey, decided to double his planned amount of money for installation.  He was told he would not get the extra grant approved.  He was very disappointed because he wants to install all these panels, on which he really relies.  As I said to him, this is part of the programme for Government so I know the Taoiseach will do what he can.</p></speech>

I will talk to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, regarding the first point the Deputy made in respect of farmers, where microgeneration can be used for energy within the farm but also for selling on to the grid eventually.  That is the objective of the scheme.  We want farming to become more involved on the energy side.  Farming has very strong potential on the energy side.  In fact, from the most recent consideration of this, the contribution agriculture can make through anaerobic digestion schemes, and many other schemes, is enormous as regards the development of energy.

Cricket is the second biggest sport in the world.  There would be a significant benefit to the Irish economy, millions of euro would come in as a result of it and it would lead to massive exposure for Ireland as a destination.  We recently had a great win over England and we are tenth best in the world.  In 2018, the Government promised it would build a cricket stadium but four years later nothing has happened.  Ground needs to be broken on a new stadium by 2023 so time is running out.

This is of concern because the haulage sector is vital to our economy, including our supply lines, supporting other sectors and ensuring those sectors are allowed to function.  This is a difficulty.  Support packages and financial supports are urgently needed.  We need to bear in mind that the haulage industry creates massive employment in every region of this State.  What is now needed before the new year and before a crisis emerges is to put a financial support plan in place because there will be difficulties in the new year otherwise.

When the scheme was first introduced in 2010, the capitation rate introduced was &euro;64.50 per child.  If that had kept pace with inflation, it would now stand at &euro;76, but it does not.  It stands at &euro;69.  That is putting incredible pressure on those services that provide ECCE services alone, and there are hundreds of them across the country.  Unfortunately, however, 80 of them have closed already this year because they are ECCE-only providers and do not have the opportunity of cross-subsidising the ECCE service from the other services that many other larger providers provide.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister to look at this again.  It urgently needs to be reassessed.  The very viability of ECCE-only services is under threat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900027#Z00800"><p>There needs to be a meeting of the ways here because the new funding model in operation since September offers ECCE providers public funding of at least an additional &euro;9.75 per child per week.  That is 40% more than the &euro;7 increase in capitation sought by the federation.  The change in the funding model increases investment in session and pre-school services from approximately &euro;14 million per year last year to &euro;27 million per year on top of standard capitation, an almost 90% increase.  Under core funding, therefore, the overwhelming majority of services will see an increase in their funding.  Most will see very substantial increases and no service will see a decrease in funding if its circumstances remain the same.  Services without a graduate lead educator will see capitation increase by &euro;9.5 million.  There may be a number of services for which this poses a difficulty.  I suggest that the Minister engages with those services and see if we can get something resolved.</p></speech>

I am asking for the same support for the two small communities of Clongeen and Foulkesmill, in south Wexford.  They are left with a trail of devastation following a mini tornado that struck those areas last week.  One man had almost completed the building of his new home only to find it flattened, with no possibility of a claim, but thank God there was no injury or loss of life.  Another woman lost the roof off her house.  I ask the Taoiseach for some flexibility and to provide emergency humanitarian support for these two rural communities, which have suffered from this freak act of nature, as existing schemes mostly only cover flood damage.</p></speech>

As part of the nation's welcome efforts to accommodate Ukrainian refugees running for their lives, in an unprecedented development, on Sligo County Council-owned lands, the OPW and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have invoked emergency planning regulations to erect 24 very fine modular homes exclusively for Ukrainian refugees.  Some of the over 1,500 families on the Sligo housing list, 2,400 on the Donegal housing list and 700 on the Leitrim housing list, all within my constituency, none of whom have a home, have told me they are beginning to wonder where they come in the pecking order as Irish citizens when it comes to Government action.  They have asked me to ask the Taoiseach why emergency planning has not been invoked to provide them with modular homes.  Many of them have been on the housing list for over a decade.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will be aware of the BurrenLife programme.  If he has not been photographed there, he is unusual as a Cabinet Minister.  Certainly, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have been there.  It is not within their area of responsibility, but there is collective Cabinet responsibility.  The new agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, will disadvantage the farmers in that scheme, as it will the farmers in the Sleeve Aughty area who are in the hen harrier area.  The standard they have to reach is lower but they will get less money.  Will that be reviewed and will the disincentive in common-----</p></speech>

Last week we saw an allocation of money to Men's Sheds which was vastly disproportionate to that given to Women's Sheds.  While I understand there are more Men's Sheds, we need to invest more in the establishment of new Women's Sheds.  What is the Government doing to encourage more Women's Sheds?  Also, what progress is being made on teen sheds, which seem to be getting very little attention?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="13:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900029#GG00300"><p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, agus f&aacute;ilte ar ais.  I also welcome the ex-servicemen from the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE.  My dad was a proud serviceman in the Defence Forces for 37 years, so the ex-servicemen are very welcome.</p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to address the House on water policy, which is a key strategic priority for the Government.  The past decade has seen significant reform of the water services sector in Ireland, together with a renewed approach to monitoring and regulating the water environment.  The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future seeks to advance and build on these reforms, setting out more than 30 commitments specific to water matters that are directed towards overcoming the infrastructural deficits that impact on the provision of safe and secure drinking water supplies, lead to pollution and environmental damage and challenge the achievement of sustainable development across urban and rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Today's statements afford a timely opportunity to consider the current water challenges we face, outline the Government's approach to water policy and update Members on the progress being made.  I particularly welcome the opportunity to hear Deputies' comprehensive views on this core area of public policy.  I will shortly be joined for the second half of the debate by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who will make the closing statement as the session concludes.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a rich supply of natural water resources that are the envy of many countries.  In recent weeks, many communities have seen far too much of the impact of this resource and that of climate change.  Adaptation and building in resilience are critically important and we will focus our minds on these aspects.  We have, however, a ways to go to ensure our water and wastewater networks and our broader environmental management systems are fully aligned with current and future needs.  </p>  <p>  Irish Water and local authorities, working together since 2014, have made real progress in consolidating our public water systems nationwide.  We now have a coherent national approach to water services and a stronger capacity to deliver and manage investment in water services at scale.  A robust policy on funding architecture for public water services is now in place following the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, as published in April 2017.  Robust governance, accountability and oversight arrangements are in operation, with economic regulation undertaken by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and environmental regulation overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, while An F&oacute;ram Uisce fulfils its important statutory public engagement and advisory function.</p>  <p>  While we have relatively good water quality, we face broad and significant challenges in how we protect and care for our water resources and ecosystems.  Last month, the EPA published its most recent assessment of water quality in Ireland and updated trends up to the end of 2021.  The report identifies some areas of improvement, but in too many areas the trends are going in the wrong direction.  The main risk to water quality continues to be excess nutrients, mostly phosphorus and nitrogen, in our rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal areas.  While the overall water quality trends are going in the wrong direction at a national level, we are seeing good indicators in some areas and in some sectors.  </p>  <p>  In the case of the priority areas for action, which were selected for special attention in Ireland's national River Basin Management Plan 2018 to 2021, the latest data show that the proportion of improvements within these priority areas exceeded improvements elsewhere.  This indicates that when targeted action is taken improvements in water quality can be achieved.  We will continue to focus our work on these areas over the next planning cycle and we will include new areas for action.</p>  <p>  The performance of Irish Water's treatment plants has been improving, with positive performance reported on EU directive compliance and on EPA priority action areas, as recounted in the EPA's most recent urban wastewater report published a few weeks ago.  Improvements, however, are being cancelled out by declines as the proportion of areas improving in status is less than the number of areas in decline.</p> <p> In terms of bathing water quality, the status report is more favourable, with the EPA's most recent report showing a plenitude of clean and safe natural bathing water amenities, which are increasingly being enjoyed by people all year around.  Our national bathing water expert group is working to gather the evidence required to consider how best to protect bathers' health, whether inside or outside of the current bathing water season.  Regular year-round water quality monitoring is now in place in the Dublin Bay area.  There are, of course, downside risks to extending the bathing water season, as sunlight and rainfall factors may adversely affect water quality during winter.  The optimum balance, therefore, must be struck between the length of the bathing season, water quality and health risks if we are to avoid the closure or de-designation of bathing waters locations.  It is important to point out that Deputies and Senators have been raising this matter with us in recent months.</p> <p> The Government's approach to meeting these challenges involves three complementary areas of action.  We must complete the transformation of Irish Water as the stand-alone water services authority in public ownership, which will deliver cost-effective water services in keeping with best practices and in response to customer needs.  We must continue to upgrade our investment in water services infrastructure in keeping with our EU drinking water and wastewater services obligations and in line with population growth and economic development needs in both urban and rural areas.  We must protect our rivers, lakes and groundwater by enhancing our river basin management plan, modernising our legal framework and working across government to address water quality, climate change and biodiversity challenges in an integrated way.</p> <p> The policy paper on water sector transformation published in February 2021 set out the Government's vision for water services based on the full integration of water services into Irish Water as a single national water services authority in public ownership.  The objective is to deliver a world-class public water services authority that meets customer needs, operates in line with best practice, represents value for money and facilitates economic development in urban and rural locations.</p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, the Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is progressing through the Oireachtas and I will take Report Stage of the Bill in the House this evening.  The Bill provides for the establishment of Irish Water as the stand-alone national water services authority separated from the Ervia Group.  The authority will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in recognition of the level of Exchequer funding now provided to Irish Water.  The legislation will be enacted before the end of this year and the new arrangements will take effect on 1 January 2023.</p> <p> Engagement with unions on a framework for future delivery of water services was concluded successfully this summer at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  This framework will enable Irish Water to work in conjunction with local authorities to complete the integration of public water services into its own organisational structure over a four-year period from 2023 to 2026, inclusive.  A comprehensive engagement exercise will be carried out to communicate the framework details directly to staff and ensure that all water services workers will fully understand the options available to them.  It is important to note that any transfers of staff to become permanent employees of Irish Water will be on an entirely voluntary basis.</p> <p> The Department also hosted parallel engagement with unions on policy matters of relevance to workers in the context of the water transformation programme, including a referendum on water ownership.  The Government regards public ownership as essential to its vision for water services and this is already legally guaranteed.  No change to State ownership of Irish Water is currently possible without majority support in a plebiscite of the people in line with the Water Services Act 2014.</p> <p> Engagement outcomes shared with unions on 18 July 2022 incorporate the planned approach to bring forward a referendum proposal on water ownership for consideration by the Government in conjunction with the anticipated recommendation of a proposed referendum on housing from the commission on housing.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, looks forward to definitively addressing the referendum matter in this way with Government colleagues in the near future.  Taken together, these legislative and policy commitments now bring clarity and certainty on future arrangements for the delivery of water services.</p> <p> The Government will continue to work closely with all parties to the transformation process, which include the water services workforce and their unions as well as management teams in Irish Water and the local government sector, to ensure the framework for the future is implemented in a balanced manner and is fair and reasonable to all concerned.</p> <p> In terms of investment, the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 sets out the broad vision and policy objectives for the development of water and wastewater services in Ireland.  Irish Water's investment plans are framed in this context.  The Department is currently reviewing the statement to ensure that Irish Water's capital investment plans remain in close alignment with the Government's evolving national investment plans under the national development plan, NDP, Housing for All and the updated river basin management plans.</p> <p> Recent years have seen record levels of Government investment in our water services and this investment will be sustained.  The national development plan commits to almost &euro;6 billion of capital investment to be undertaken by Irish Water in the period from 2021 to 2025.  Approximately 80% of Irish Water's funding requirement is met through the Government's voted Exchequer investment in Irish Water, which reflects the cost of providing domestic water services.  On this basis, &euro;1.56 billion is being provided to Irish Water to meet the cost of domestic water services in 2023.  This includes &euro;878 million of capital funding, which is critical to enhance the ongoing significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services and support the delivery of housing as committed to in Housing for All.</p> <p> This investment is delivering real benefits for citizens right across the country.  The Kilkenny regional water supply scheme, for instance, will ensure a safe and reliable drinking water supply for Kilkenny and its surrounding areas.  The people of Rathmullan, Milford and Ramelton in north Donegal will benefit from the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant.  In the eastern and midlands region, the water supply project will deliver strategic infrastructure to ensure future security of supply in the greater Dublin area, while providing further options for reinforcing future water supplies for communities such as Newport, Borrisokane, Cloughjordan, Mullingar, Carlow, Portlaoise, Navan and Drogheda.  In this way, the long-term water supply needs of an entire regional are being secured and future-proofed in a sustainable way to 2050 and beyond.</p> <p> In terms of wastewater, the greater Dublin drainage project is delivering a major new wastewater treatment facility to serve north County Dublin and parts of counties Kildare and Meath.  In conjunction with the significant upgrade of the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, this key strategic project will safeguard the environment, protect public health and facilitate new housing and development.</p> <p> Equally important is the Exchequer support provided through the rural water programme for water and wastewater services in areas which are not served by the public water system.  The Department is finalising work on the review of the rural water sector which is considering issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring, along with the wider investment needs of the sector to be provided for under the upcoming multi-annual rural water programme.  The aim of the working group is to recommend actions now and into the future to ensure an equality of outcomes for those who receive rural water services.  I pay tribute to the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, NFGWS, which does amazing work in a voluntary capacity.</p> <p> Overall investment in water services, whether provided through the public water system managed by Irish Water or under the rural water programme, will be maintained at high levels year on year to ensure security of quality supplies to customers across the country, while achieving greater environmental compliance in keeping with our water framework directive obligations.</p> <p> To restore water bodies to good status, the two most pressing areas in need of attention are, first, to reduce the excess nutrients being lost from land and discharged into our waterways and, second, to restore our rivers to a near natural physical condition and contribute positively to the co-benefits of water quality, biodiversity and climate.  The Government will shortly launch a new revised and strengthened river basin management plan, the third cycle of river basin planning for Ireland dealing with the period up to 2027.  This plan will outline a detailed set of over 100 measures centred around the three broad areas for action I described, namely, delivering the single national water services authority, sustained high levels of multi-annual investment and strong protection of water bodies.</p> <p> Irish Water's capacity to deliver significant capital investment programmes at scale is critical to our plans to reduce the impact from insufficiently treated wastewater discharges over time and will allow us to entirely eliminate the outdated practice of discharging untreated sewage.  The new Water Environment (Abstractions and Associated Impoundments) Bill 2022, currently before the Oireachtas, will modernise our legal framework in respect of abstraction, impoundments and other physical changes to water courses.  It represents an important step-up in the protection arrangements for our water bodies.  Some Deputies have raised concerns about the proposals around a Shannon pipeline to service the greater Dublin area.  I share those concerns but that important discussion is for another day.</p> <p> The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will also continue to work closely to address the causes of diffuse nutrient pollution, including delivering on the new management measures in the nitrates action programme and in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan to address agricultural discharges, the most significant pressure on our water quality.  Our new nitrates action programme includes stronger measures to reduce nutrient losses and improve water quality and it works in harmony with the new CAP strategic plan, which has brought ecosystem protection and environmental management to the fore in a positive and constructive manner from a water quality perspective.</p> <p>I have set out the Government's comprehensive approach to water policy.  We have set ourselves a high level of ambition as is clear from the programme for Government.  The Government is firmly focused on delivering a world-class water services system together with a robust water environment management system that works for nature and people.  I thank Members for their attention and I look forward to their contributions to the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900031#JJ00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  I thank Deputy Joan Collins who initially requested the debate, primarily to give us an opportunity in the D&aacute;il to discuss the conclusions and outworking of the negotiations between water services workers, Irish Water, the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the future delivery of domestic water services.  Before I make my remarks specifically on this issue, I acknowledge that the Minister of State discussed a wider range of issues.  I will not address them today.  It is not because they are not equally important.  We have dealt with many of them, including water quality in particular and the recent EPA reports, in the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and I am sure we will return to the Shannon pipeline project in the near future.  My focus will be on the future delivery of domestic water and wastewater services on the other side of the WRC negotiations.</p>  <p>  I always preface my remarks in these discussions by saying that Sinn F&eacute;in's approach to these matters has been shaped by our involvement in the Right to Water movement.  We believe people have a right to access good quality drinking water and wastewater on the basis of need and not on the basis of ability to pay and that they should be delivered through the highest quality public service that is attainable.  We have also long argued for holding a referendum to enshrine the public ownership of our water services and we look forward to further developments on this front later this year.</p>  <p>  When the then Minister, Eoghan Murphy, announced the decision to bring forward the end of the service level agreement between workers and their employers at the creation of Irish Water in 2018 Sinn F&eacute;in made it very clear we would not get involved in or interfere with industrial relations matters.  They were matters for workers and their trade union representatives, their employers and the Government.  Given the huge importance of domestic water and wastewater and the significant political controversies we had under a previous Government, we felt it was right and proper for the Oireachtas housing committee and the D&aacute;il to keep track of the public policy elements of the negotiations.  They are matters that affect not only the employers and the workers but the wider public and, therefore, the Oireachtas needs to be involved in them.</p>  <p>  We set out very clearly a set of views we had that if the Government was to move in partnership with workers and unions towards the creation of a single utility, a number of conditions had to be met.  First and foremost was that any move to end the service level agreement would have to be voluntary.  There could be no compulsory redundancies.  I welcome the fact that from the outset of the process, the then Minister, Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, made clear that this would be the case.  I want to acknowledge, however, that from speaking to water services workers, there continues to be concern that while the agreement in principle sets out that if people remain in local authorities they will retain their existing terms and conditions, these will only be their core terms and conditions and not any additional terms or benefits they have accrued from acting up or taking on additional roles and responsibilities.  I said to the Minister of State on the previous occasion we discussed this, and I will say it again, that the Government should clarify, and it would be helpful if it reaffirmed this, that workers who opt to stay with the local authority will retain the full terms and conditions they enjoy at present, despite the fact they may be redeployed from water services to other areas of activity.  The sooner this is clarified, the better.</p>  <p>  Another issue for us is public ownership.  We believe it would be of enormous benefit for the Government to set the date for the referendum.  I welcome the fact that SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa, Unite and other trade unions recently launched a very important campaign urging the Government to set the date for the referendum.  This could be one of those very valuable opportunities whereby we could have a very good public debate on why water as a utility is different from other utilities.  It is so fundamental to human well-being and community life that the idea of it being a public good in public ownership protected by the Constitution makes eminent sense.  I press the Minister of State to urge his colleague to say a little more about the timelines for the referendum because it is of particular importance to us and water services workers and their families.</p>  <p>  One of the big challenges and concerns many of us have with the move towards a single utility is the impact of the transfer of water services fully from local authorities to Irish Water Uisce &Eacute;ireann, as it will be formally known once the legislation passes through the Houses.  We have seen a hollowing out of services delivered directly by local authorities over the years.  Housing by and large is no longer primarily delivered through local authorities.  It is primarily achieved through purchased turnkey properties or Part 5.  Direct labour crews for maintenance have been run down in preference to contracted work.  Waste management is no longer with local authorities.  While the service level agreement means that workers continue to be employed by the local authority, albeit under the direction of Irish Water, if this process is completed, that will no longer be the case.  This creates a real problem because local authorities are best at providing good quality services to local communities.</p>  <p>  No matter what the final configuration of the single utility, it must continue to have footprint in our local authorities.  There are depots, offices and connections between communities and long-standing water services workers that are better located, irrespective of who the employer is, inside the infrastructure of the local authority.  Also from a planning and housing point of view, it makes much more sense if the housing department, the planning department and the water services department, even if it is an Irish Water controlled water services department, are all co-located in one building.  We see this with some aspects of our mental health services whereby HSE staff and local authority staff work in the same building.  Therefore, the continued physical presence of water services workers in the infrastructure of local authorities is key.  I encourage the Minister of State to give us more information on all of this in further remarks.</p>  <p>  Concern has been expressed about the final legal status of the new utility.  The Minister has, as per the outworkings of the WRC negotiations, restated the commitment to public ownership but, of course, this can take many different forms, as the Minister of State knows.  In addition to the issue of the terms and conditions of the workers who may opt to transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, there is also the issue of those workers who will be employed at a future point in time.  This is particularly relevant because local authorities are not honouring the existing WRC service level agreement on the replacement of existing staff.  Local authorities are assuming it can be dealt with by Irish Water at a later stage.  What are the guarantees as regards terms and conditions for these future workers?  Will they have the same full level of protection that they would get if they were covered by public sector pay agreements?</p>  <p>  Clearly this is a debate of enormous public importance for the terms and conditions of the workers, their families and their communities, the final configuration of the service in terms of its relationship with local authorities and the final legal status.  Some of these are not clear from the remarks of the Minister of State, previous debates on this or the second document that has emerged but has yet to be formally published, although it is in widespread circulation, on foot of the WRC talks.  The point I really want to emphasise is as follows.  There is still a lot of concern about the future delivery of water services.  There is still a lot of legacy mistrust arising from some of the policy decisions enacted or attempted to be enacted by previous Governments.  The Government would be doing itself an enormous favour, as well as doing our water services and the State an enormous favour, if it set a date and said it was committed to holding a referendum and intends to bring forward legislation at a certain point in time.</p>  <p>  I fully accept it would make much more sense to hold two referendums on the same day.  I would be more than happy to spend a considerable amount of my time campaigning for enshrining in the Constitution the right to housing and public ownership of our water services.  Our understanding is that the commission on housing will report back to the Government very soon.  We are very hopeful that it will recommend that the Government proceed to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  If it does so in the timeline it set out, which is November, I would like to see the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, bring the memorandum referenced by the Minister of State to Cabinet this year.  Many of us have a real concern that while Fianna F&aacute;il's position on referendums on the right to housing and water has shifted somewhat, Fine Gael is still implacably opposed to both.</p> <p>We do not and will not know that until the memorandum on the two referendums is brought forward.  The worry, however, is that the memo may come after the rotation of Taoiseach.  I am not sure whether the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, will be as amenable to the eminently sensible suggestions made by the trade unions, the housing commission, Sinn F&eacute;in and some members of Fianna F&aacute;il.  For this reason, we need to set the date and hold not one but two referendums.  We need to ensure, as the Minister of State said, that we have a world-class public water service providing the highest quality drinking water to communities, families and businesses, that we undo decades of neglect and underinvestment and, crucially, that it is publicly owned so that people will forever more have access to water and wastewater services free at the point of delivery based on need and not on ability to pay.</p></speech>

It found that only half of sewerage is treated to EU standards with more than 2.5 million tonnes of raw sewage being pumped into our seas and rivers every year.  This pollutes our environment and poses a real health risk to the public.  The most recent EU monitor report found that we have a compliance rate of 44% for the proportion of water that meets the requirements of the directive compared with an EU average of 76%.  Raw sewage is being discharged daily into 32 of our towns and villages, eight of which are in my home county of Donegal, namely, Burtonport, Coolatee, Falcarragh, Kerrykeel, Kilcar, Moville, Ramelton and Rathmullan.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, raw sewage contains bacteria, viruses and parasites that can cause illness.  The fact that so many in my county of Donegal are exposed to these risks is completely unacceptable.  In 2015, seven years ago, I submitted a complaint to the European Commission regarding the State's failure to deliver a sewerage scheme in my home town of Gweedore.  On receipt of that complaint, the Commission took infringement proceedings against the State.  Seven years later, the main scheme is yet to commence and only the demonstrations scheme, with 50 houses connected, has been completed.</p>  <p>  It is deeply concerning that it is not planned to connect five of the towns in Donegal - Coolatee, Falcarragh, Moville, Ramelton and Rathmullan - to a treatment plant until the second half of this decade.  The EPA has drawn attention to the fact that Irish Water has produced various plans and timeframes over the years to eliminate discharges of raw sewage but often changes these plans and extends its timeframes to complete this work, thereby prolonging the risks to the environment and public health.  We have seen that happen far too often.  This does not instil faith in these deadlines ever being met.  They should, in fact, be accelerated.</p>  <p>  I am pleading with the Minister of State on behalf of citizens in Donegal.  They cannot accept being, yet again, an outlier in the provision of basic services and infrastructure.  Irish Water and the Minister must ensure the infrastructure needed to stop raw sewage discharges is built in the interest of public health for the people of Donegal.  We will not wait until the end of this decade for that to happen.</p></speech>

Thousands of residents in Trim and Rathmolyon have had their water restricted for the past 11 days and this looks set to continue throughout this week.  This has caused huge distress to the people and businesses affected as they are left without running water for long periods.  Irish Water communication seems to entail posts on social media platforms.  The only way many older people and others who do not use social media find out is when they turn on the tap and find there is no water.  That is not good enough.</p>  <p>  The Trim water treatment plant requires delivery of a part from the United Kingdom, for which it is still waiting 11 days later.  If there was any urgency on the part of Irish Water, how could it wait on a part for 11 days in this day and age?  This is affecting thousands of people and businesses.  It is a joke.  The treatment plant in Trim is outdated and needs to be upgraded urgently.  I ask that this be done as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In other parts of the Meath West constituency people have been waiting for a long time for Irish Water to release funds for projects.  People in Ballivor have been waiting for an upgrade for the past few years.  Water tankers have been filling up the reservoir at different times of the year.  While it is supposedly on the list of projects that are to go to tender, the Ballivor project needs to be fast-tracked as it, too, affects thousands of people.</p>  <p>  At the other end of my constituency, in Westmeath, there is a section of old pipes less than a kilometre in length in the Castlepollard-Fore-Collinstown area that keeps breaking and causing misery for people.  We need Irish Water to release funding to address this.  I have been on to the council for years.  We have water services in the Meath and Westmeath local authorities that do their best.  However, when funding is not released for these projects, what can they do?  The Minister of State must engage with Irish Water on behalf of the people and businesses of Meath West to address these issues as a matter of urgency and to release funding.</p></speech>

There are three things I want him to do.  He needs to tell Irish Water to sort out the legacy debt and the leak credits for the group water schemes.  We have been begging Irish Water to do that for months and years.  In addition, the above-ground assets, such as reservoirs and pumping stations, also need to be transferred from the group water schemes to Irish Water.  This is very simple and must be done immediately.  Irish Water also needs to target the resources on the ground to manage the additional workload to get things done.</p>  <p>  I think the Minister of State referred to Newport earlier.  It is absurd that businesses in Newport are being asked to pay to pollute Clew Bay.  They have to pay the price of not having a proper scheme and then they are forced to pay by Irish Water.  That has to stop.  Businesses are rightly asking why they should have to pay for water going out.  They will gladly pay for water coming in but they want to know why they should pay for water going out in order to do that.  This scheme has to be accelerated and, in the meantime, businesses should no longer be forced to pollute the bay.</p>  <p>  I am glad the issue in Murrisk seems to be finally coming to a conclusion after all these years.  I welcome the fact that hundreds of families in the area may have water by the end of next year.  I commend the people in Downpatrick Head.  We have been trying to get water for them for more than a decade.  People outside Mayo and rural Ireland would not believe what happens in these rural areas in that they do not have something as basic as water.  That must be fixed.  I also refer to the case of Cleragh, near Kiltimagh, where 34 families have been blocked from accessing a water scheme.</p>  <p>  These issues must be sorted and Irish Water, with the Government, has to sort them out.  Since Irish Water was set up, however, the Government seems to have taken a hands-off approach and I am fearful of that.  The Government is responsible for providing clean water to our citizens and ensuring our bays and communities are not polluted.  Much needs to be done in those areas.  I commend the group water schemes but we have to lift the debt off them.  I ask the Minister of State not to leave this Chamber today and do nothing.  These measures need to be actioned.  Sinn F&eacute;in will follow up on each of them in the same way we have done with other communities.  Communities in Mayo and other parts of rural Ireland deserve better.</p></speech>

I have received calls from people in areas such as Ballyvolane, Gurranabraher, Farranree, Sunday's Well and right across the city saying discoloured or brown water has been coming from their taps in recent months.  Irish Water has admitted that this is due to adding too many chemicals to clean water by mistake.  I have been communicating back and forth with Irish Water in recent months and every time I have been told that the system will be flushed.  This might provide clean water for a day or two.  This is not good enough, however, because the brown water returns thereafter.  This water is not drinkable.  Irish Water has told people to run their taps.  That is not good enough.  People deserve better.  They deserve clean drinking water.  They should not have to contact Deputies to follow up with Irish Water.  They should have clean drinking water in their homes.</p>  <p>  Irish Water confirmed that it does not let vulnerable people know when the water is brown.  These are people who may have issues with their sight or intellectual disabilities.  They may be vulnerable or very old.  The only way they can find out if they have brown water is from Irish Water.</p> <p>They are vulnerable people.  There is an onus on Irish Water to make sure those people have clean drinking water and, if not, that they know about it.  There are major issues with Irish Water.</p> <p> I also want to recognise the huge effort made by water workers in Cork and nationally, especially in pushing for a referendum on putting water services in public ownership, which we support.  These workers also want clarity on their terms and conditions of employment if they remain in local authorities or move.  I have great respect for these workers, who are doing the work on the ground.  Moving forward, we need the referendum to be delivered as soon as possible.  There are huge concerns that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will not deliver a referendum.  What is the date for the referendum?</p></speech>

With the lack of clarity on whether the water was safe to drink, there was a boil notice which was changed to a do not consume notice.  The islanders still have questions and have not received answers.  While this particular issue has been ongoing for a number of months, in reality there have been problems for years.  A long-term solution is needed.  </p>  <p>  Islanders have complained about issues with immersion boilers and electric showers.  Water services on our offshore islands require a long-term solution and strategy.  I understand that is not something that can happen overnight, but it is something we could do far better on and we need to focus on.  One islander I spoke to today told me she had travelled to North Macedonia to view its water services.  She heard it had not had rain since last March.  It is a far less well-off country than Ireland, yet has been able to provide fresh water.  It was interesting to hear that comparison.</p>  <p>  Caithimid d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na deacrachta&iacute; uisce at&aacute; ann ar na hoile&aacute;in amach &oacute;n gc&oacute;sta.

Much has been written about the fact that the next war that will happen on this planet will be not over oil but rather over water.  We on this island are notionally blessed to have an abundance of water.  As every council engineer and Irish Water engineer will tell us, there is a fundamental difference between water falling from the sky and water arriving treated and potable in our taps.</p>  <p>  We should begin by acknowledging that we have failed, as a country, to provide adequate water and wastewater treatment across our nation.  The establishment of Irish Water was to be the fundamental shift.  We were to have a national utility resourced to do this once and for all.  Many of our people are used to going to Spain where there is no rain for weeks and months on end, yet when they go to the beaches they can wash sand from their feet and shower without difficulty.  I come from the sunny south east.  If we have three weeks of sunshine in the summer, we have no water in our taps.  That cannot be right.  We need to deal with that historic deficit.  </p>  <p>  Like others, I would like to deal specifically with the situation in my constituency.  I ask the Minister of State to focus on the Wexford town water supply.  The most recent boil water notice was issued on 21 October and lifted on 26 October.  There was another alert last Friday.  This is happening during the peak of the Wexford Opera Festival, where we have thousands of visitors from all over the world yet cannot provide people with a decent water supply without having to boil water.  It is shocking.  This is an ongoing issue.</p>  <p>  As I said, if we have too little rain we have no water in the summer and if we have too much rain the overflow cannot be treated and the water supply is not safe.  Too little or too much rain will ensure that we do not have a decent water supply in the town of Wexford.  There is a solution to this.  We had hoped for an immediate solution in the form of ultraviolet light treatment, but apparently that will not work and more substantial treatment is required.  It cannot be the case that 25,000 people are without a water supply or on a boil water notice every second month.  The Minister of State is from a neighbouring constituency and I ask him to ensure that the capital provision is provided to deal with this matter once and for all.</p>  <p>  The new utility will be a stand-alone entity.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the Labour Party perspective was to allow the elected representatives of workers in the trade union to deal with this and come to their conclusions.  There are overarching issues.  When a leak on a public road outside of a gate is reported to Irish Water, Wexford local authority workers who are contracted to Irish Water will deal with that immediately and resolve the leak.  However, if the leak is on the inside of a gate, under the first fix programme Irish Water will provide a contractor to do the work but it is taking weeks for them to arrive.  A leak in the water supply outside of a yard can be fixed immediately but a leak in a yard inside the boundary of the property means people have to wait.  In the most recent case I dealt with, with all due respect to the Ceann Comhairle, we had to wait for a contractor to come from Kildare to sort out the problem.  I am deeply concerned-----</p></speech>

There were 50 individual leaks on Coolballow Road in Wexford and there had to be a campaign before action was taken.  We need to do better.</p></speech>

This would have covered not just our public water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure but also our gas and electricity transmission networks.  Seven years on, we are no closer to seeing such a referendum being proposed.  It has always been our position that our water infrastructure should remain in public ownership.  It is most important to note that there was never any proposal to privatise it despite a lot of rhetoric on the issue.  Water is a public good that ought to be accessible and State-run in perpetuity to ensure the State is resilient in the event of any crisis in supply or distribution.</p>  <p>  With respect to the Minister of State, I have heard nothing about a referendum.  The wording of the Minister of State's speech is not specific as to when the referendum would take place.  We need a specific date and time or some timelines to ensure the referendum takes place.  </p> <p>It is vitally important to maintain public confidence by ensuring it is retained in State ownership.<br/><br/>I will address the quality of supply in the Cork region.  I will name places such as Inchigeelagh, Ballycotton, Castletownshend, Whitegate, Aghada, Mitchelstown, Rathcormack, Kinsale and Clonakilty from where raw sewage is going into the sea.  There are continuous boil water notices in places such as Aghada and Whitegate, as there is in the little enclave of Killavullen.  Good and decent people live in Killavullen who, up to a few years ago, never had a boil water notice.  As the local Deputy representing that area, I still cannot get an answer as to why there are boil water notices in Killavullen.  I still cannot get a definitive answer from Irish Water with regard to Whitegate or Aghada.<br/><br/>Cork county councillors will tell the Minister of State the same.  It was reported by Sean O'Riordan in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner</i>that they are extremely frustrated by the lack of engagement by Irish Water on matters such as boil water notices.  The quality of communications from Irish Water has diminished substantially in the past 12 months.  It is very hard to get up-to-the-minute information.  If we are trying to serve our constituents to the best of our ability, they deserve answers as to why there are boil water notices in Killavullen and in places such as Whitegate and Aghada.<br/><br/>We have not been able to define or pin down the nature of the problem.  Updates need to be provided and proper answers given to public representatives in this House and local authorities.  The quality of the engagement is exceptionally poor.  Dare I say it, every time I put down a parliamentary question to seek information from the Minister's Department, I am told it is not a matter for the Department.  In the most recent reply, dated yesterday, I was told that it is not a matter for the Department, that all operational matters are a matter for Irish Water, and that the Department &quot;maintains an ongoing engagement with Irish Water regarding strategic, financial and general operational matters&quot;.  If that is the case, I suggest the Minister's Department is answerable to this House and to individual Deputies when we put down parliamentary questions as to why there are boil water notices or when we seek information.  I ask the Minister to reverse engines on the policy of not informing us, as Members, because we need to be able to inform our constituents.  However, the fundamental question is why Killavullen, as one example, has boil water notices.  What is the reason for those boil water notices and why are they not being fixed?  Why is the problem not being resolved?  Why has the issue in Whitegate and Aghada not been resolved?</p></speech>

Despite many of the complaints I hear about Irish Water and individual towns and locations, we need to look at this in a broader perspective.  We would all have been taught about the hydrological cycle in school.  We know where water comes from.  We know that water is a finite and limited resource which is under severe pressure in this country.  These statements are fitting in a week when COP27 is trying to address the global nature of climate change and its impact on countries across the planet.  For example, changing weather patterns will impact on the hydrological cycle, on the amount of water that falls in this country and on how we store it.  An impact will be felt nationally and globally.</p><p>We seem to take water for granted in this country.  We think we have an abundance of it.  I think that is because we get considerable rainfall.  However, water is expensive to store, treat and distribute.  It is also expensive to maintain our very intricate network of drinking water pipes to our homes and the wastewater discharge pipes that come from our houses and end up in rivers, lakes and our coastal waters, thereby causing pollution.</p><p>The Sustainable Water Network, SWAN, An Taisce, the Water Advisory Body and Teagasc appeared before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage when we were looking at issues of water quality and impacts in Ireland.  I will read SWAN's synopsis of the last river basin management plan.  It said that &quot;an interim assessment of the previous river basin management plan reveals that only two out of ten expected outcomes ... have been achieved&quot;; that &quot;nitrate and phosphate pollution has increased significantly since 2013&quot; and that &quot;we have lost 96% of our most pristine rivers in the past 30 years&quot;.</p><p>When we hear complaints about the quality of water that comes out of our taps, we have to look at the source of that water.  It is coming from our rivers, lakes and groundwater.  If we continually carry out practices that pollute those water sources, we will have those problems at the end of the pipe where it comes into our houses.  Deputies are quite right to raise those problems.  Our water supply is on a knife-edge.  The pressures on our river water quality and our water supply are up there with the challenges we face in biodiversity and climate.  When we see disruptions in water supply, boil water notices and the remedial action list for the trihalomethanes that are in our water from excessive organic loadings, we need to stand up, take account and look at the sources contributing to that water damage.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to take on board a couple of my concerns with regard to water policy that we could bring into our overall water policy.  I wish to see greater funding provided for the testing of nitrates in our water to assist our farmers.  I do not believe any of our farmers wish to pollute water but the reality is that agriculture is contributing to water pollution.  The draft river basin management plan states:</p> <blockquote> 	... the principal causes of the decline in Ireland&rsquo;s water quality are the increasing loss into water of polluting phosphorus and nitrogen from farmland ... [and] inadequately treated waste water. </blockquote>  <p>That is the responsibility of Irish Water.  We have heavily modified many of our river courses which impacts on biodiversity and marine and aquatic ecology.  We need to address hydromorphology to comply with the water framework directive and to have those free-flowing rivers as required under the nature restoration plan.  How much time do I have left?</p></speech>

It will help us comply with the water framework directive and make our river basin management all the more easy to implement.  The Minister of State is the right Minister for the job.

I wish him well.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak at this debate this afternoon.  I consider there to be two wings to Irish Water.  The first is Irish Water "Incorporated" which is very frustrating to deal with and the second is on-the-ground crews that are very helpful in the community.  </p>  <p>I will speak about Irish Water "Incorporated" for a moment.  It is up there with the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the HSE.  They are all quangos.  It has put a huge degree of separation between central Government, local government and the people.  Irish Water is very tricky to deal with and when you manage to get through to it the call centre in Cork does not have on-the-ground knowledge.  Staff there could tell you a water leak in Kilrush is a result of a sprung pipe in Meelick, which is 60 miles away.  You get ludicrous information like that and Irish Water thinks that is adequate at a time when a community has gone three, four or five days without a water supply.  It is not good enough.  The call centre is the first point of contact people have with this.  It is not fit for purpose and it never has been in the nine years since its inception in July 2013.</p> <p> On the point around engagement, Irish Water does not engage with local authorities.  I do not know what it is like elsewhere in the country but I was a councillor in Clare in 2013 when Irish Water was set up.  All of us from the Munster region were brought down to the Rochestown Park Hotel in Cork for a briefing session.  Deputy Gould was also a councillor then and attended that day.  He came in the back door of the hotel holding placards and thumping his chest and he disrupted the whole meeting.  I have never seen the like of it.  That was a high-level briefing about the transfer of assets from local authorities to Irish Water.  It had to be abandoned.  That was the last public meeting the Irish Water hierarchy had with any local authority in open session.  Since then the hierarchy has had covert briefings and that is not good enough from a local authority point of view.</p> <p> I also have huge grievances with the suggestion we should extract water from Lough Derg to serve the greater Dublin area.  In 2019 the leak rate in Dublin was 42%.  If we bring this grandiose pipeline across Clare, Tipperary and Offaly and all the way over to Dublin we are only feeding Europe's largest sprinkler system.  That would be retrograde.  It is not environmental or sustainable.  It ignores the fact almost half the water in Dublin leaves the pipe network every single day and trickles off into the ground.</p> <p> There are a few programmes at home I hope will progress.  We got good news the other day that the upgrading of the Elton Court sewage treatment plant in Meelick will get underway at the end of this month.  This is a key piece of enabling work to allow Ballycannon, which is another housing estate in that community, to connect to the mains system.  The system the estate's residents have been living with for years is decrepit and unfit for purpose, so this work is key.  Another project is the upgrade of the water mains from Westbury out to Parteen in Clare.  Phase 1 of that was done earlier this year and has transformed things.  However, there is still a sizable amount of that community, from Larkin's Cross to O'Connor's Cross, that has had 15 outages in the last year alone.  There is a quite comprehensive capital plan for this but it needs a nudge and a push.  I have been speaking to Irish Water officials again today and those in Clare County Council but I ask the Minister of State to drive that on and help us deliver that.</p> <p> As a final point, there is a community in west Clare, Glendine, that has a group water scheme which is 28 km long.  I have never come across the likes of this before.  It is called a daisy chain scheme because there are little splinter schemes going off it left, right and centre.  The people in that scheme are facing five days now without water.  These are current issues.  This is not something that happened last year.  I am speaking about villages and parts of Ireland that are currently without water.  There is huge ineptitude in the hierarchy of Irish Water and it needs to grasp this.  We need more of these schemes to be taken into full public charge and run properly.  We should not always be burdening a local committee or secretary with trying to run a massive piece of infrastructure.</p></speech>

I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is in the position he is in because this is an issue he knows well.  It is one of those very rare issues upon which I find myself in agreement with most of the Green Party policy.</p>  <p>  In my part of the world, which the Minister of State knows well, there is the issue of intensive agriculture and its role in upgrading water quality, particularly that in our watercourses, streams and rivers.  An issue I have tried to raise with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and which I hope the Minister of State will be able to flag given his position, is the need to ensure there is some sort of promotion or extra emphasis given to areas of intensive agriculture where there are open watercourses and promoting, developing and expanding grant relief measures for intensive farmers to ensure they have the necessary storage capacity.  Huge leaps and bounds have been made during my time in the Oireachtas in the management of farms across the country.  The period has seen many environmental improvements and it has often been led by work from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on ensuring grant aid is available.  Farmers have shown time and again that if supports are there they will act.  It is the same when it comes to the issue of water quality.  There should be some extra weighting or promotion given to people who are in especially vulnerable areas and are engaged in intensive agriculture.  That sector will follow because it tends to be the most progressive.  The farmers who are in a position to ensure those works are carried out are generally farming full-time.</p>  <p>  Deputies have spoken about deficiencies in their own constituencies and the Minister of State will be aware of those in Kilkenny.  We have boil water notices quite regularly, alas, in places like Clogh, Moneenroe and Castlecomer in north Kilkenny.  In recent days we have even had notices for the Bennettsbridge and Ballyragget supplies.  The notices have been lifted but thousands of houses being left without a supply of water for a period of days is not a situation any organisation, including Irish Water, can stand over.  I fully agree with Deputy Matthews on Irish Water drawing up and confirming lists of works that need to be done on both water and wastewater treatment.  It does not need to be an exact list with the full details and costs but it must have a rough estimate of costings for works that are outstanding and need to be done.  Those are figure Irish Water should already have rough estimates of within the organisation.  It would be a very welcome development.  On wastewater treatment specifically, Deputies, including the Acting Chair, have outlined the villages and towns across the country that continue to pump raw sewage or almost completely untreated sewage into public waterways or the sea.  That position is untenable into the future and Irish Water should include that in any list of necessary measures it draws up.</p></speech>

The pace at which the latest upgrade works are being carried out is, I think we can all agree, very frustrating.  Questions need to be asked about why it will be 2046 before all lead piping in the system is replaced.  This was highlighted in a recent EPA report.  This is a public health issue and the replacement programme needs to be accelerated.</p>  <p>  I will move to a few local issues.  Constituents who are unable to move into their new homes have regularly been in touch with my office, and likely Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's office as well.  They have been getting delay after delay because there is a problem with getting these new housing estates connected to the water supply.  I appreciate this is a big issue across Dublin but it is totally unacceptable.  These people deserve better.  Another issue I had this week was a constituent contacting us to let us know her whole block of apartments had been disconnected.  She did not receive any information from Irish Water telling her this was going to happen.  When she tried to find out why this happened she was told nothing.  This is totally unacceptable and it is happening regularly.</p>  <p>  Let us go back to 2014 when Fine Gael and Labour attempted to privatise our water system.  Citizens organised and fought the Government of the day to roll back on its plans.</p> <p>Ever since then, there have been calls for a referendum to keep water in public ownership.  The trade union movement has launched a campaign, Keep Water Public, which calls on the Government to name a date for a referendum.  The campaign's demands are simple, namely, that the Government needs to set a date for a referendum to enshrine public ownership of our water system in the Constitution.  The Minister of State said he is open to such a referendum but he needs to back up that statement.  He must present citizens with the opportunity to insert the right to water in our Constitution as soon as possible.</p></speech>

That is not a problem just for people in my colleague's area.</p>  <p>  I make my contribution as a member of the climate committee in the week of COP27 and the growing public awareness on this island and globally that water, and access to it, is something we can no longer take for granted.  I attended a public meeting in Maynooth last night.  My constituents across north Kildare are in no doubt that we face a changed world.  We are ready to play our part in it.  My constituents know, as do all of us in this House, that even in the most developed and sophisticated parts of the world, water shortages arising from drought, caused and made worse by climate change, are becoming a feature of modern life.  It is not just heat and drought that are the problem.  The catastrophic flooding that has arrived in Europe can damage pipes and systems and make water supplies unusable.</p>  <p>  We are told that by 2030, the gap between global demand and supply of fresh water is expected to reach 40%.  Water is going to become a hot political issue in the EU, just as it already is in other parts of the world, such as in the Nile region.  While COP27 is taking place in Egypt, it is worth remembering the long-running issues between that country, Sudan and Ethiopia regarding the huge hydroelectric dam on the River Nile.  The Horn of Africa is gripped by famine, the graphic details of which we heard about at a recent meeting of the climate committee in which the issues of loss and damage played a big part in the discussion.  This year, the US envoy for the Horn of Africa met with Egyptian officials to find a way, under the African Union, to guarantee the long-term needs of all the people, in various countries, living along and relying on the River Nile for their water.</p>  <p>  Water is access.  It is food, health and wealth and it also contributes towards peace and power.  Politically, I am 100% opposed to the privatisation of water.  If the Government does not give us our referendum and if it wants to go back to water protests on the street, the women of Ireland are well ready for it.  If we look at the privatisation of energy, transport, healthcare and childcare, we see we are playing with fire if we privatise water.  It is essential to life.</p></speech>

It is completely and utterly unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Regarding lead pipes, we have a public health situation in which people's health is being seriously affected.  The programme in place to rectify this issue is moving so slowly that it will not address the problem for many people for many decades to come.  It is utterly unacceptable.  The volume of information available to people with leads pipes in their homes is not acceptable.  The line from Irish Water is that if homeowners replace the pipes on their side, it will replace them on its side.  I know of numerous instances where people do not have lead pipes on their side but there are lead pipes outside their homes and they are not being replaced.  I am aware of a case in which Irish Water has replaced lead pipes on half a road in an estate in which all the houses were built at the same time.  Half the pipes were replaced and then Irish Water told the remaining householders that it is not sure whether there are lead pipes in the area.  This is an estate built 100 years ago and, to the best of my knowledge, lead pipes were used for the entire estate.  All of that creates worry and anxiety for communities and it really is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  Before I deal with the substantive point about the need for a referendum and a date for it, I refer to the value that workers in water services give by way of the work they do.  I saw that at first-hand when I was a member of a local authority.  The knowledge and expertise these workers have built up of the water network in their areas is second to none.  That should be to the forefront of the minds of members of the Government as they delay the holding of a referendum.  One of the ways the Government could support and value those workers properly, as they should be supported, is by naming a date now for a referendum.</p>  <p>  We in the Social Democrats fully support the trade union campaign to name a date.  I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage of the Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 that would have ensured the Government had to set a timeline for naming the date.  Unfortunately, the Government voted it down.  I have tabled a similar amendment on Report Stage this evening and I call on the Minister of State not to oppose it.  I ask that he back our amendment to ensure a timeline for a referendum is set.</p>  <p>  I want to make a wider point about how utterly essential water is to our lives.  As we all know, we simply cannot live without water.  It is essential to cooking, washing and running a business or farm.  More than anything else in the world, apart from the air we breathe, we need water to live.  That is how essential it is.  Water is a natural resource that belongs to all of us and it is critical to every aspect of our lives, our economy and our society.  It is crucial to food production, factories, schools and businesses.  Any attempts to privatise water and make profit from it should never be countenanced.  It is far too important ever to allow any risk of it falling into private hands for profit and allowing those private interests to hold us to ransom by owning our water and wastewater infrastructure.</p>  <p>  That should never be allowed to happen but as long as we do not have it dealt with in our Constitution, there is always a risk it will.  I made a point at the committee that if, heaven forbid, Ireland ends up in an economic situation in which we have a repeat of the troika coming in and the International Monetary Fund being in town, having it enshrined in the Constitution that public ownership of water is guaranteed means there could be no insistence by such parties on privatisation or any other changes.  That would simply be off the table.  We would not need to speculate about the intentions of different political parties in government and so on.  Let us protect ourselves once and for all as a country by enshrining this matter in the Constitution to ensure that, no matter what happens, the privatisation route can never be gone down by any political party or Government.</p>  <p>  The experience of water privatisation around the world has been an absolute and utter disaster, so much so that there are 235 places globally where water has been renationalised and remunicipalised.  That was done because water privatisation led to a disaster in investment in public infrastructure.  I offer two examples of this.  In Berlin, after water was privatised, there were huge deficits in the maintenance of the infrastructure.  At the same time, the profits of the private companies that bought shareholdings in that infrastructure went up sharply.  This resulted in a popular vote of the people of Berlin demanding that water be brought back into public ownership.  That was done at great cost to the public in having to buy back those shares.  Similarly, in Paris, the privatising of water led to price hikes in water charges that were in no way justified by the low levels of investment in infrastructure.</p> <p>In 24 years of privatisation of the water supply in Paris the price of water increased by 174% while the profits of the owners soared.  Do we need to know anything more about water privatisation and the absolute madness of it that we should never countenance?  The first year of taking water back into public ownership in Paris saw public control efficiency savings of 35%, reduction in costs of 8% in households and increased investment in infrastructure.  This goes to show that public ownership of water infrastructure, and it should never be charged for, is and can be much more efficient than private sector control.  </p> <p> We need a referendum to enshrine in the Constitution the right to water and access public ownership of water resources.  The Government is more than half way through office and as yet no date has been set.  How difficult is it for the Government to do this?  What is stopping the Government from doing this?  Why must we wait any longer?  I support having the referendum on housing on the same day.  Let us name a date and get on with this.  We run the risk that this Government will run out of its term of office before anything is done on this which means all the commitments on this would be meaningless.  Is ceart daonna &eacute; an t-uisce.  Water is a human right.  </p> <p> I have one other point to make about why water services and infrastructure ended up in public ownership in the first place.  As we all know in this House it happened due to public health reasons.  A lack of public control and investment in water and wastewater infrastructure was disastrous in regard to spread of disease.  It was a disaster for the slum housing that existed in this city.  The Public Health Act 1848 was passed, obviously not in this House, and gave local authorities discretionary power over drainage and water supply.  That recognised how incredibly important water and, indeed. wastewater is to our very existence and public health.  Before proper investment was in place and before the clearance of slum housing, which was replaced with good quality local authority housing, there was widespread disease including cholera in slum housing because of the lack of public investment and control over water supply.  That is why it was brought into public ownership and there was public investment.  While thankfully the incredibly bad housing conditions, those slum conditions, no longer exist, we should never lose sight of how important this is and why it is crucially important that water infrastructure is kept in public ownership and that this is enshrined in the Constitution.  Safe access to water and, indeed, wastewater literally is and was a matter of life or death for people in this country.</p></speech>

Developing a water policy with so many complex issues and competing demands is not an easy task.  Over the past decade we started to make some inroads.  The two main issues are to provide safe, clean water to all of us and to treat all our wastewater so that when it is returned to the environment it does not cause damage to our health, to the rivers and seas or to other fresh water supplies.  A multitude of other issues are involved in developing a water policy.  I will try to address a few of them in the short time available to me.</p>  <p>  The first priority of a water policy is to ensure provision of clean, safe water.  We encountered a number of issues in recent years the most crucial being the contamination of existing supplies by a number of different factors and consumers not being alerted to this contamination immediately.  We must ensure that adequate warning systems are in place and that consumers are alerted to any possible contamination immediately.  I am aware that work is ongoing on replacing and rehabilitating old asbestos and cast iron water mains throughout the network and replacing lead pipes to individual houses.  It might be advisable to report on a yearly basis the ongoing progress being made on these schemes. </p>  <p>  I congratulate Irish Water on the completion in recent months of a new reservoir at Rockmount and complete replacement of the water mains from Mullagh to Milltown Malbay.  This will provide a safe, secure and reliable source of water to this part of west Clare, which has had many breaks in service over the years.  While this is a public water scheme managed by Irish Water, more than a third of households in County Clare source their water from group water schemes or private sources.  The vast majority of these schemes need to be upgraded to modern standards.  This work is supposedly to be funded by a multi-annual rural water programme.  I understand that Irish Water has not accepted any calls for funding from local authorities and, therefore, much-needed upgrading works and improvements cannot progress to the detriment of people living in rural Ireland who are dependent on their local group schemes.  It is imperative that when such upgrade work is complete on a group scheme, if it is the wish of the scheme members the scheme should be taken in charge by Irish Water immediately. </p>  <p>  The second priority must be to provide safe treatment of our wastewater.  County Clare is not unusual in that nearly half of the households in the county are not connected to the public water scheme.  More than 17,000 are connected to their own septic tanks.  First, we must take care of our public water treatment plants and invest in new plants where we are discharging untreated wastewater into our waterways and the sea.  There are 35 wastewater treatment facilities in County Clare, 22 of which have available capacity.  Work is progressing at present in five towns and villages throughout County Clare - Clarecastle, Liscannor, Kilkee, Kilrush and Ballyvaughan.  These wastewater schemes will stop the discharge of untreated sewage coming from these villages and towns but this is only tackling a small fraction of the problem.  I understand that there are nearly 50 of these small villages and settlements without sewer capability.  The EPA has for a number of years been listing these and County Clare has just under 10% of those listed for the entire country.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the establishment of the new wastewater pilot scheme announced by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, during the year.  Clare County Council has submitted two applications in respect of Broadford and Corraclare.  I look forward to the Minister approving those funding applications.</p></speech>

It is important that we have a discussion on water services and wastewater treatment throughout the country.  It is fundamental.  In the few minutes available to me I will raise the issue of the wastewater treatment plants that are inadequate, and in some places non-existent, in some of the smaller villages.  If they were to be prioritised and moved through the system, they could be a stepping stone to a huge amount of badly-needed housing in rural communities but also to housing that is such an issue nationally.  When there is a great deal of work done at local level by the local authorities and again at national level through the Departments, officials and Ministers, to get particular schemes onto a programme, there is frustration in trying to get them through the various hoops and regulations to get boots on the ground and get the investment.  While the funding is committed to it in the programme, it takes a huge effort to get the result on the ground.  We welcome the initiative brought in last year through the small towns and villages scheme in close co-operation with local authorities to try to get those water schemes prioritised rather than have Irish Water.  Concern and a degree of scepticism exist about the fact that the larger urban centres are being prioritised by Irish Water with a view to enabling the badly-needed houses to be built.</p> <p>However, that policy, on the whole, is not a good policy.  It is not a policy to get what we want, which is housing throughout the country and balanced regional development.</p> <p> In the Duhallow region, we have huge investment going into the Boherbue wastewater treatment plant, which will allow that village to expand.  The development proposed there includes a nursing home and further housing and a cheese plant is being envisaged there.  I know there was a huge amount of work done by Councillor Bernard Moynihan and Cork County Council to get that through the planning system and all its various stages.  It is great to see boots on the ground and the work going on that project.  </p> <p> In addition, last year, through the good offices of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Castlemagner was included in the small towns and villages programme.  I welcome the initiative and the help that he gave us on that.  However, the challenge is getting this scheme from the funding being committed to it to delivering what we are trying to do, which is to ensure that extra houses can be built in the community.  Castlemagner would be very well known to the Acting Chairman.  It is a central enough location and there has been huge development there.  It is a small village that has grown.  The challenge from Cork County Council&rsquo;s point of view and from Irish Water is the various different stages that have to be gone through.  </p> <p> Everybody has goodwill.  Many projects around the country would have a certain amount of antipathy towards them or a lack of goodwill, but there is a huge amount of goodwill in respect of these projects.  There is an onus on us to try to get the projects through the system.  </p> <p> Glantane has been crying out for a sewage treatment plan for many a long day and the lack of one has stifled development in that community.  Again, it is a very centrally located community that would benefit enormously from it.  The Department, Irish Water and Cork County Council should look and apprise themselves of the challenges that are there and the difficult hoops that have be gone through.  Is there a way of streamlining that and getting to the end game faster?  </p> <p> It behoves us as public representatives to listen to the challenges.  On a daily basis, we hear about our water quality and the discharge of raw or untreated sewage into rivers and streams.  People have to comply with many challenges in respect of the various water quality and other environmental regulations when building housing developments, once-off houses or, indeed, perhaps a development that would not be ordinarily in the countryside.  They have to go through all the hoops.  It behoves us to make sure that we are putting our money where we are talking to make sure that these schemes are fully funded.</p> <p> If we are to be brutally honest with ourselves, the challenge is that there are an awful lot of schemes being announced and we are overloading people to try to get to the end game.  We need to look at whether the system can be streamlined.  It has to be a priority where is quite clearly an issue in terms of contamination to soil or underground water from existing or inadequate wastewater treatment plants.  This has to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  If something is under private ownership, such as an individual house or whatever, and there is an inspection, there is a serious onus on the individual to make sure that their septic tank or otherwise is complying with the regulations.  When it is in public ownership, we must make sure that the same onus is on us to make sure we are complying with it and there is no issue.  </p> <p> Those are two of the schemes that I would like to see further work on.  I appreciate the co-operation of the officials in the Department, Irish Water and the county council.  However, sometimes the officials get frustrated as well because of the various hoops related to planning and various regulations and how they are to get through all of those.  We should look at it to see whether it can be prioritised.  Ultimately, that will end in what we are trying to do in solving the housing crisis, not just in urban Ireland, but throughout the country.  Rural Ireland can play an enormous part in solving the crisis.</p> <p> I thank the officials in Irish Water, Cork County Council and, indeed, the Department for ensuring that the Boherbue scheme got the go-ahead.  However, many more villages need to have a wastewater plant. </p> <p> There is another issue in terms of water quality and the supply of water.  The policy has been to shut down smaller, rural schemes and have one major scheme.  However, some of those schemes should be retained.  Particularly this summer during the drought, there were challenges with water supply.  We should not close everything down; we should keep them on standby because they may be need to booster the system as we go into drier summers.  That should be looked at as well from an Irish Water point of view and an operational point of view.  There are many challenges relating to water and wastewater treatment throughout the country, but we should not lose sight of the fact that it is an enabler to ensure that we have quality housing for people going into the future in both urban and rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I want to address the transfer of responsibility from local authorities to Irish Water and how the unresolved nature of this issue sets a worrying precedent for other problems that may lie in wait.  Specifically, it is the ability of councils to take charge of housing estates with developer provided infrastructure, DPIs.  This has been discussed at the Committee on Public Petitions and relates to the many estates that have been left in limbo since the transfer of responsibility for water services from the local authority to Irish Water.  While a memorandum of understanding has been put together to include a certain cohort of estates, those with stand-alone DPIs have been left out.</p>  <p>  According to Tipperary County Council, the local authority cannot take the estate in charge unless Irish Water agrees to assume responsibility for the DPl.  This, it said, is not happening as there is no national agreement in place and there is a lack of progress on the taking-in-charge process.  Until Irish Water puts in place a national strategy to address this, these estates, including the Rocksprings, Kilross, County Tipperary, will continue to make payments to the local authority, yet the council cannot maintain these estates as Irish Water will not take responsibility for the water services.</p>  <p>  The council seems to be doing all it can to address this, but without a coherent plan and understanding between Irish Water, the Department and local authorities, these estates are abandoned.  Irish Water is not living up to its commitment to put in place the national strategy it spoke of and the Department has a role to play in this regard to bang heads together and oblige Irish Water to resolve this.  Is Irish Water unprepared to shoulder the responsibility?  Is it waiting on more money from the Department?  We need answers and we need to know who is blocking progress.  I would appreciate a progress report on this from the Minister.</p>  <p>  On the proposals in general, the lack of preparation that I spoke of seems to extend to the lack of details about holding a referendum to enshrine public ownership of the water system in the Constitution.  This has potential impacts for employees in terms of the protections to be afforded to them as well as for the constituents of my home county who are failed by the utility company daily.  </p>  <p>  Irish Water refuses to come before the council to answer questions on its performance and its communications strategy.  We need accountability and we need to see Irish Water take responsibility for the services it has been charged to provide.  Faith in Irish Water is low, to put it mildly, and frustration with it is at an all-time high in Tipperary.  Will the Minister clearly outline what input councils may have towards water services in the future?</p></speech>

Hopefully, all Ministers responsible heard that it can be incredibly difficult to get decent communications from Irish Water.  We have all said that we need to set a date for a referendum to enshrine public ownership of the water system in the Constitution.  Beyond that, we want to make sure that workers&rsquo; conditions are dealt with properly and fairly.  We know that some of that has to be left to the workers, employers and unions.  However, anybody who has dealt with Irish Water over the past would not give the company ten out of ten for communications.</p>  <p>  I will speak about my town of Dundalk.</p> <p>Obviously, there was a CRU investigation in respect of the Cavanhill treatment plant.  There were breaches relating to manganese levels in 2020.  It happened again in June 2021.  I am reading from a press release I put out when I dealt with Irish Water at the housing committee.  Throughout the summer, we were told that by 14 September flushing processes would be in place, everything would be dealt with and the communications issues of Irish Water would have been considered.  In recent years, we had issues that were initially thought to relate to iron oxide but ended up being manganese.  I get that there is a higher level of manganese in the water at this time.  I get that research is being done in that regard but if that is what we are going to be dealing with in the likes of Dundalk, the problem is that the manganese reacts with chlorine and we end up with brown water.  We are told that the water we are getting, brown as it is, is very healthy, although I am not sure everyone necessarily believes that.  The problem, however, is that we were told that everything would be done and dusted in respect of Dundalk and its outlying areas by 14 September.  I saw the list of areas that were being addressed and raised with Irish Water the fact that many areas were not on the list.  The other problem is that 14 September has passed.  I assume some of this gets worse in summer but I am still getting videos and pictures of brown water.  I can see it in my own house.</p> <p> Beyond that, what we need is proper communications.  We need a process to deal with it.  We are going to be dealing with manganese for the next while, so, rather than flushing, we need to deal with a process and we need the Government to take action on it.</p></speech>

It was like watching "Reeling in the Years".  It was all the old hits - all the old propaganda about how the Government is committed to public ownership of water.  He reeled out the line that we should not worry as there cannot possibly be any privatisation of Irish Water because it is in the Water Services Act 2014.  Of course, he did not mention that the legislation can just be amended without a referendum.  After the next election, the Government can come in here committed to privatisation, as I believe Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in reality are still committed to it, change that legislation and do away with the requirement for a referendum.  We hear all the talk about a commitment to public ownership without mentioning the reality of widespread outsourcing throughout Irish Water - all the design, build and operate contracts that, in effect, amount to privatisation from the ground level up.</p>  <p>  Most sickening, we are here because of a request originally from Deputy Joan Collins - I was going to call her another name.  For some reason Joan Burton is on my mind.  I apologise sincerely.</p></speech>

We have been told that the Minister, Darragh O'Brien, looks forward to definitively addressing the referendum in the near future.  That is great.  We are having a debate about the future of water services now.  We have had repeated commitments to hold a referendum, yet here we are having a debate about it and there is no commitment.  Where is our referendum on water?  We have been waiting six years.  Six months ago, the Minister promised there would be a referendum this year or early next year.  Where is the referendum?  We are only a handful of weeks away from the next D&aacute;il recess, when the D&aacute;il will be off for another full month.</p>  <p>  Why is the Government continuing to try to push through privatisation through the back door?  That is already happening in terms of how Irish Water operates its outsourcing to private companies.  Large parts of our water infrastructure are already being run on a for-profit basis.  Officially, we are meant to be getting bills for excess usage of water next year.  They were originally meant to start in 2019.  As a result of the mass opposition, we have managed to delay them but it is clear the Government would like to come back to them.  However, just as the threat has not gone away, the opposition of the water charges movement will not go away.  That is the position of the vast majority of people in this country and the Government knows it.</p>  <p>  The other reason we are here today is the resistance of the water workers.  The water workers who are being faced with transferring to Irish Water were also given a promise that, before they transferred, there would be a referendum to ensure Irish Water could not be privatised.  They have been sold out on that promise by the Government.  The promise has not been kept.  We have no wording and no date, so the workers are absolutely correct to fight to protect their terms and conditions and to demand a referendum on public ownership of Irish Water.  It is great that a number of unions have come out to launch the Keep Water Public campaign to demand a date for a referendum to enshrine Irish Water in public ownership.</p>  <p>  It is important that we discuss the issue of the wording.  Six years ago, Deputy Joan Collins brought forward wording that was clear and would ensure there could be no future privatisation of our water services.  I sat in multiple committee meetings with her at which the Government came up with this, that and the other reason to oppose it.  The Government, however, has refused to come forward with its own wording thus far.  When the Taoiseach has been questioned on this in the D&aacute;il, he has been incredibly slippery, using language around the idea of keeping the resources in public ownership and so on in ways that make me think that if the Government is ultimately forced to give a date, whatever wording it comes up with will, in effect, be meaningless.  It does not want to have a referendum to enshrine water in public ownership because the clear policy preference, openly declared and so on, of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is ultimately for privatisation of our water.  That is what the water charges were about - commodifying our water in order for privatisation down the road.</p>  <p>  The water workers are absolutely right to fight their fight, a crucial part of which is to demand a referendum.  The public, which fought so heroically and engaged in mass non-payment, with 73% of people refusing to pay, need to keep watch on this issue now.  The Government may hope the attention has gone off and that we will just forget about the referendum so it will not have to hold one.  That is why public pressure is going to be brought to bear to demand a referendum, demand that we have water fully in public ownership and demand that investment is put in place to ensure we have proper water infrastructure in this country.  We still do not have such infrastructure.  That is not because we do not have water charges; it is because of the repeated refusal to invest in vital infrastructure.  We have the same investment being made as would have been the case if water charges had been brought in.</p></speech>

Rank and file water workers across the State have been campaigning for this, and I support their campaign.  I welcome the fact that the four trade unions with water worker members are now campaigning through the Keep Water Public campaign for a date to be named,.  A date must be named before the end of the year.  If that is not done, there will be strong opposition from rank and file water workers to being transferred over to Irish Water, to be known as Uisce &Eacute;ireann, on 1 January.  I welcome the fact that Unite the Union has decided to ballot its memberships on the framework document that allows for this.  I believe the three other unions should follow its example.</p>  <p>  The wording of a referendum must be clear and strong.  Water workers must remain strongly organised, even in the event of a successful referendum.  We have seen with the ESB how a utility that was formerly in State hands can be de facto privatised through large-scale outsourcing.  That is something the workers will need to fight.  I want to know where each of the Government parties stand on the referendum issue.  Press reports state that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will bring a proposal to the Cabinet early in the new year.</p> <p>I want to hear that from the Minister.  The T&aacute;naiste has been quoted as saying he does not see the need for a referendum; I would say he does not.  Is this the Fine Gael position?  Is there a split in the Government on this issue?  The Green Party seems to have been rather quiet on it.  Where does it stand on the question of a referendum to keep water in public ownership?  I would like to hear from the Green Party on that.</p> <p> Last but not least, for the benefit of any politician or political party that might be contemplating the idea of water charges down the road - do not even entertain the notion.  What was done on the streets of this country between 2014 and 2016 can be done again.  If the Government ever decides on water charges mark two, it will be met by the water charges movement mark two, which might even leave the first iteration of that in the ha'penny place.</p></speech>

At times, Irish Water has almost a pariah status in rural Ireland.  Like many of the speakers, I will localise my concerns.  A common theme across many of them is the delay in connections, especially for one-off rural houses where, on average, people are lucky if they get their connection within 16 months.  All rural Deputies have their own examples.  There are newly-wed couples who cannot move into a house because they do not have water.  There is a new Bill whereby they are required to have an air-to-water system but cannot move into their house because they will not have any heat, despite embracing everything they were meant to do in respect of environmental carbon reduction.  One of the most poignant cases I have had in recent months was that of recently widowed young woman.  She and her late husband built what they thought was their dream home.  She was looking forward, although it would admittedly be rather lonely, to moving into her new house and the fact that it would be something of a new start for her.  Yet, more than one year on and several months after the engineer from the county council came to look at it, she is still no further in getting a water connection.</p>  <p>  Irish Water is particularly slow on the delivery of services.  The Minister of State will be well familiar with the fact, as he is based just up the road from Edgeworthstown and Ballymahon, the second and third largest towns in County Longford, that both of them are crippled with inadequate wastewater treatment systems.  Irish Water has committed to me and the local authority that additional capacity will be in place for both towns by 2025.  That is a wafer-thin commitment, when we got a commitment in 2021 that we would have that capacity by 2023.  The reality is nobody believes these timelines from Irish Water.  They are wholly inadequate.</p>  <p>  One of the most disturbing cases we are dealing with in Longford is the pumping station at Lisbrack Downs where the family living immediately beside it, every time the heavy rains come, and needless to say the past five to six weeks have been particularly traumatic for them, sewage spills out of the pumping station into their garden and virtually into their house.  They are prisoners in their own home.  Irish Water told us in February 2021 that a consultant engineering firm had been appointed to review the catchment area pumping station and rising main.  An initial draft report was produced and a workshop held.  Since then, we have had radio silence on the issue, while all the time this family is in a heartbreaking situation.</p>  <p>  It is critical that there is momentum behind the provision of water and waste services.  It is fair to say that the Irish public has lost faith in the capacity and ability of Irish Water to deliver a service.  I appreciate that we have record investment in the development and delivery of infrastructure but this has to be backed by a sustained commitment to putting the necessary services into towns and villages that have been badly let down heretofore.</p></speech>

Everyone is in agreement that the importance of improving Ireland's water resources cannot be underestimated.  Having clean and healthy water catchments, safe and secure water supplies and a comprehensive wastewater service are, collectively, vital to protect public health, support economic growth and, what is very important, preserve our environment.</p>  <p>  An issue I continue to raise that causes grave concern among residents in north Mayo relates to the multi-annual rural water programme for 2022 to 2025.  It is a huge issue.  Some communities in north Mayo, including Carrowteige, Porturlin, Portacloy and Srahataggle and, in east Mayo, Lisduff and Cleragh, near Kiltimagh, still do not have running water.  That sends a chilling message down my spine.  These people are desperate to avail of a new community water connection.  They are sometimes dealing with condemned wells and are prevented from using water for both drinking and domestic purposes.  Their heating systems cannot reach the required temperature because they are clogged with material from bogs.  This is in the 21st century.  If departmental officials have not visited some of these households, it would be an education for them to see the challenges these people face on a daily basis.  Last July, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, said he expected the Department to announce details of the programme priorities and invite local authorities to submit bids later this year.  Four months on, we are still none the wiser as to when applications will be accepted under this programme.  Last month, I was informed by Mayo County Council that it had not yet received the request for submissions for the multi-annual rural water programme 2022 to 2025 from the Department.  The council expected this to happen in September but has received nothing to date.</p>  <p>  Maybe the Minister of State could address two questions in his final remarks.  When will Tobin Consulting Engineers complete volume two of its rural water sector review report and present it to the project oversight group?  When will the rural water working group make recommendations to the Minister on the future governance and investment requirements for this sector?  These are crucially important questions we need answered.  I have got signatures from people living in Carrowteige, Porturlin, Portacloy and Srahataggle.  They have successfully gathered momentum in order to remove any blockages to progress by the engineers in Mayo County Council who are currently awaiting the go-ahead to assess this proposed scheme, which will be of enormous benefit to these four north Mayo rural communities.  I understand the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has not yet issued the framework for the submission process, as I referenced.  I request that this be done as soon as possible.  I also urge the Minister of State to prioritise this programme.  It is very important in rural Ireland.  Many urban Deputies are not impacted to the degree rural Deputies are as regards households having access to domestic running water.  That is very important.  I ask for clarity on this matter.  It is crucial that the people of north Mayo get the basic necessity of running water as we enter these difficult winter months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900040#SS00400"><p>I commend Deputy Joan Collins on persevering with this, giving us all an opportunity to again have a whinge about Irish Water and to bring up all our localised issues, which is where this debate always seems to go.  I am guilty as charged as I will probably do the same.  Before I do so, I have to acknowledge that record investment is being made in upgrading infrastructure throughout the country.  The total of &euro;1.68 billion that has been committed in budget 2023 has to be acknowledged.  That is an increase of approximately &euro;110 million.  Over the next three years, an additional &euro;4.5 billion will be put into domestic water services.  That is the positive news.  What we are doing well is providing extra investment.</p>  <p>  However, as I said, my main gripe with Irish Water at present is how it prioritises that funding.  We all have examples throughout the country of where it is happening well and where it is not happening so well.  I listened to the Acting Chair mention Killavullen and other areas of north Cork that I am familiar with, and the travails people have to go through just to get an adequate water supply.  It is baffling to me, especially when I hear of the case of Arklow.</p> <p>It is a case Senator Casey is completely correct in consistently raising in our parliamentary organisation.  He has detailed how Arklow got a wastewater treatment plant worth &euro;147 million.  I understand why there was demand for that because raw sewage was being pumped into the sea.  Obviously, that has to be curtailed and contained.  When the sums are done on it, however, that was to accommodate additional population growth of 22,500 in that area.  As a result of the lack of joined-up thinking with the national planning framework and so on, under that development plan the local authority is, I think, restricted to granting 50 units per annum for the coming years.  It is baffling that an investment of &euro;147 million to provide for an extra 50 houses can be prioritised over a number of other projects in my county to which I can refer.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Sherlock, will be familiar with Carrignavar.  The school there has closed and there is a brownfield site in the middle of the village.  The new school is under construction, but nothing can happen with the brownfield site or the other lands that are zoned for residential development until such time as the existing treatment plant is upgraded, at an estimated cost of between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;2 million.  As to what that would return in comparison with the likes of Arklow, with that massive &euro;147 million investment, my local authority would deliver those units in a year or two.  I think the estimated time it would take to deliver 50 units per annum to make back that &euro;147 million is 175 years.  Therefore, as for Irish Water, when we acknowledge that record investment we need also to acknowledge that sometimes the prioritisation of it is questionable.</p> <p> I will mention two or three other issues.  Somebody mentioned group water schemes earlier.  That issue affects many of us in rural areas.  Very few people are talking about the additional costs of electricity and keeping those plants running.  Whatever about the fact that they are functioning correctly and appropriately and the replacement of filters and so on, their running costs have far exceeded the grants those communities get.  That needs to be looked at with the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps some form of grant can be provided.</p> <p> Deputy Flaherty mentioned the issue of connection costs and the delays in connections.  Any Deputy involved with a young family, in particular one building their first home, will testify to the fact that the waiting times are delaying planning applications and holding up the whole process, not to mention the costs of connections.  I know that from experience because my wife and I are looking at possibly building our first home in the next few years and I have already had people out to survey the costs of all these things.  The cost of a simple water connection now is astronomical compared with what it was a few years ago.</p> <p> The issue of septic tanks is also one we come across regularly, particularly in rural areas.  We operate on the basis of EPA guidelines, and I get why those guidelines are in place.  They are important.  The topography of a site is important.  The issue of percolation needs to be assessed.  I find it very difficult, however, when I go onto a rural site and something historic, such as a wastewater treatment plant or a septic tank, on the site might not fall within the remit of the EPA guidelines.  It is probably an historic thing that was built many years ago and does not tie in with the regulations.  However, when one proposes the construction of a new biocycle unit, the EPA guidelines are stringently enforced, irrespective of the positive impact the replacement of the septic tank would have.  We need to look at that if we are serious about helping people build their first one-off house.</p> <p> I do not have time to mention the last issue I wished to raise but I might table it as a Topical Issue matter.</p></speech>

One thing that is very clear is that the approach to water policy in this country needs a drastic realignment.</p>  <p>  As well as the communication and engagement issues that have been spoken about, the very basics need to be got right.  Today, in Westmeath, there is an 81-year-old man who lives alone in a rural area and has never had a water supply.  I have dealt with a hospitality business in Longford whose supply is so bad that it purchases and transports approximately 30,000 cu. m of drinking water every three to five weeks, which is mind-boggling in 2020.  A handball alley in my constituency received a bill for almost &euro;6,000 despite being closed for the vast majority of two years over the pandemic.  The resolution was absolutely soul-destroying for the volunteers running the club in question.  For the third time this week, a school in Kilbeggan has been closed because of the lack of a water supply.  No number of self-congratulating emails announcing the return of a supply will ease the stress of the students, parents or staff of the school.</p>  <p>  The practices that have led to those situations need to be resolved because the public will not have faith in any water service until they are.  That same public needs to be given assurances that the priorities of whatever entity ultimately ends up in charge of our water supply will be focused on improving water quality and wastewater treatment and fixing leaks and not, as the public has rightly feared over recent years, solely on profits, as happens in other jurisdictions.  I shudder to think of the families who would have found themselves not only in energy poverty but also water poverty if it were not for the very successful water campaign a number of years ago.  The Government parties need to set a date for the referendum on public ownership of water sooner rather than later.  I fully support the trade union campaign to name a date to resolve this issue permanently.</p></speech>

I have seen media reports that Irish Water has said that it is executing a programme of capital works at the plant through 2021 and 2022, but we have yet to see any benefit whatsoever from those works.  The ongoing issue of foul odours has been raised multiple times by residents, and the EPA has issued directives to Irish Water and the plant operators many times to deal with those issues.  That residents are complaining of smells is also an indicator that the environmental or contamination controls are not adequate.  We know they are not because all of us who live in Drogheda have to suffer and endure those foul odours, especially at night.</p>  <p>  I have another concern, and that is that the municipal wastewater is a breeding ground for several bacteria, fungi and viruses.  Toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide and methane are also present in high levels in areas such as influent lines and settling and clarification tanks.  We now know that the digesters at the wastewater plant are leaking and that a consultant's report recommended that the plant cease operation of the digesters and decommission them at the earliest available opportunity.  We need urgent assurance that this is not a danger to public health and that it is being dealt with properly by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister of State listening?</p></speech>

During a tour of the Staleen water treatment plant in August 2018, I asked the representatives at the plant whether the plant would be able to deliver increased volumes of treated water to Drogheda and south Louth.  I was told repeatedly by Irish Water representatives at that meeting that it would not be able to deliver the volumes of treated water required to meet Drogheda's projected growth.  The growth is happening now and we are still none the wiser.  We need information in order to plan for the future development of Drogheda.  We need facts and figures as to how the Staleen water treatment plant will supply the planned new homes in Drogheda and south Louth under the northern environs plan, which is expected to deliver 5,000 new homes.  If the numbers do not add up, both Irish Water and the Government will have to pay attention and come up with funding to increase capacity at Staleen or look at reopening the Rose Hall water treatment plant, which, I am informed, could serve between 40% and 80% of the north side of Drogheda but was decommissioned in 2017.</p>  <p>  We do not need spin about Irish Water being confident about delivery.  We need up-to-date information, facts and figures in cubic metres and, most importantly, a service that is fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I wish you the best of luck.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about Irish Water and water policy.  At times, I have spoken repeatedly about some of the issues creating problems with regard to the work carried out under Irish Water.  Irish Water has two main functions: water and wastewater.</p> <p> I will address wastewater first.  Other Deputies have also mentioned that a large number of private housing estates in this country are serviced by private wastewater treatment plants.  The cost of funding the running costs, maintenance and the future replacement of these plants is being foisted on the residents of these estates.  These residents are doing this in addition to paying their local property tax and all their other taxes.  When they bought their houses, they bought them in good faith.  Peculiarly, Irish Water is refusing to take these wastewater treatment plants in hand.  The local authorities are refusing to have anything to do with it.  They say it is Irish Water's problem.  What we have is an environmental time bomb.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, spoke about water control and quality.  Abbeyknockmoy in my constituency is in the Corrib catchment and is a special area of conservation, SAC.  There are six estates in Corofin, all of which are built around the River Clare, which is a catchment to the Corrib.  The Corrib is supplying water to a large part of Galway and Mayo.  We have an opportunity to put things right before we see fish lying upside down in the water with their bellies up and wonder what has gone wrong.  The EPA is hounding residents to make sure they do not pollute the rivers.  That is all wrong.  Funding needs to be given to Irish Water to take these treatment plants in hand.  Furthermore, Abbeyknockmoy and Corofin are two principal areas where we can have growth in terms of housing but are frozen out of the planning system because any development there will be premature pending the installation of a municipal treatment plant.  This is a decision for An Bord Plean&aacute;la going back to 2007 and has not changed.</p> <p> Funnily enough, in 2005 during my first few years on the council, there was a list of wastewater treatment plants to be built by Galway County Council with funding from the Department.  Corofin, Abbeyknockmoy, Craughwell and the municipal wastewater treatment east of Galway city were on this list.  None of them are anywhere at this stage.  There is a plethora of towns and villages where we could have people living but they cannot get permission to build houses because there is no wastewater treatment plant.  These are the facts.  We talk about a housing crisis and emergency.  It is all waffle if we do not do something about it.  It is important that we stop talking about it and put the necessary funding in place.  We must direct Irish Water to do what needs to be done in this country.</p> <p> Another good example is Athenry, where we built an extension to our wastewater treatment plant.  That plant now has the capacity to take all the housing estates in the town but none of them are connected because the contract for the network to connect them is still not sorted out.  There is an IDA site in Athenry, which is at the crossroads of our motorways and rail intersections between Limerick, Galway and Dublin.  Guess what - the IDA site is not serviced.  It has been looking at making a connection between Athenry and Galway to get into Mutton Island for a wastewater service costing &euro;16 million.  Shame on us for doing daft things like that with public money instead of getting our infrastructure right in the towns where we need to get it right.</p> <p> If we are serious about traffic in Galway, we need to build a municipal treatment plant on the east of the city out where we have what we call the Ardaun corridor, which is the place selected for the future development of Galway city.  It is in the east of the county but until we put in a wastewater treatment plant, we will not be able to put in the infrastructure we need.  If we are serious about not having a ring road around Galway, let us build the city where we can have access to it.  However, we cannot do it if we do not have the services.  It is very frustrating for public representatives because what we get is a load of feasibility studies and business costs analyses and reports and if you want to slow down, you ask for clarification and basically you end up doing nothing.</p> <p> If we are really serious and if we are having talks here about water, infrastructure, housing, health and all that goes with them and if we want to develop the west and south of Ireland, we need to provide the infrastructure and one of the basic commodities involves wastewater and water.  Will the Minister of State please bring this back to whoever is providing the funding and direct people about how Irish Water should spend its money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="15:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900042#UU00200"><p>I wish the Ceann Comhairle well.  I am glad to see him back.  The last time I had an opportunity to speak about water was in September when we discussed the Water Services (Amendment) Bill.  Some of what I said then is worthy of repeating.  My speech then concerned the Bill involving the change of the name of Irish Water to Uisce &Eacute;ireann and all of the associated amendments required to reflect this change across lots of different laws.  Quite frankly, I do not think anybody - constituents in any town or village, particularly in County Wexford - gives a damn what the organisation is called because on numerous occasions over the past few years, people have been more worried about contracting some sort of illness as a result of drinking water provided by service providers when they have water.  They want a useable service that does not require them to have a boil water notice for a few weeks every winter or where they have a ration of water once we have a few dry weather days.  Wexford town and the surrounding area are under a boil water notice.  Around the same time last year, we had the same thing.  A statement was released on Monday updating customers.  I will read part of it.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Irish Water would like to remind customers served by the Wexford Town Water Supply that a Boil Water Notice remains in place.  The notice, which was issued following consultation with the HSE on 2 November, is in place to protect the health of approximately 25,000 customers.  It was issued due to a decline in the quality of the raw water entering the treatment plant which resulted in the detection of giardia.  Continuing issues with poor water quality have increased the turbidity at the plant which can impact the disinfection process.  Areas impacted by the Boil Water Notice include Wexford Town, Taghmon and surrounding areas.   </blockquote>  <p>The notice went on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	Our drinking water compliance and operational experts are working with colleagues in Wexford County Council to resolve the situation with a view to having the notice lifted as quickly as possible. As these remedial works are carried out over the coming days, some customers may experience localised interruptions or loss of pressure but these should only last a short time and normal pressure should return quickly.  In the meantime, all customers of this supply are advised to continue to boil water before use until further notice.  Irish Water Operations Lead, Catherine McDonough, has acknowledged the impact the Boil Water Notice is having on the community and regrets the inconvenience to customers. <br /><br />&quot;Public health is Irish Water&rsquo;s number one priority, and we would like to assure customers that the notice has been put in place to protect public health.  We acknowledge the inconvenience caused to homes and businesses and would like to assure customers that we will lift the notice as quickly and as safely as possible, in consultation with the HSE.&quot; </blockquote>  <p>This was on a bank holiday weekend when Wexford was hosting the international opera festival.  A major omission from this statement from Irish Water is the lack of any commitment to actually prevent the problem from happening again.  Irish Water has assured customers that the notice has been put in place to protect them but I would imagine that a reliable service being put in place would be a far greater assurance.  Similar sentiments were echoed by Wexford County Council's director of services, who was quoted in the local newspaper:</p> <blockquote> 	I'm told that Irish Water hope to appoint a contractor to carry out work on the Newtown Road Treatment plant by Christmas.  Work will then begin early next year.  I'd imagine it would be a twelve month process at least.  It could even run into the following year (2024), but hopefully we can prioritise the most urgent work so that we can eliminate the need for boil water notices.  Of course, I wish things would happen quicker, but there are certain processes that Irish Water has to go through. </blockquote> <p>As I said in September, the practice of mending a pump here or a pipe there is obviously necessary to restore services quickly, but it is only placing a sticking plaster over the serious issues with our water infrastructure.  As the director of services, Mr. Hore, said, "there are certain processes that Irish Water has to go through", but the Government must look hard at where these processes can be simplified and carried out faster so that more progress can be made in a shorter time.  Most importantly, however, it must be ensured that the system is resourced properly.</p> <p> The Water Advisory Board, WAB, has not yet published its quarterly report for quarter 3 of 2022.  It is worth reminding ourselves that in its last quarterly report, it highlighted several ongoing problems with Irish Water, such as the fact that 21 areas were under a boil water notice in the second quarter of this year and 20 of these areas remained under the notice for more than 30 days.  It shows as well that Irish Water's five-day response rate for complaints was the lowest since reporting began in 2018.  Why do we have quarterly reports if they are not quarterly or produced on time?  Seriously, we must nip this in the bud now.</p> <p> I will be interested to see what the reports for quarters 3 and 4 will contain to establish whether these problems are getting worse or better.  If these reports are not produced on time, confidence in the system just dwindles.  The recent EPA report from 14 October is very concerning.  I understand that no system is perfect all the time and that problems will arise, but, unfortunately, they are happening too frequently for many of my constituents in County Wexford.  In this regard, I commend the ground staff in the New Ross municipal district area and Wexford County Council in Wexford.  I am pleased to say that funding has been sanctioned to provide up to 4 km of brand-new polythene piping infrastructure, alongside upgrading the capacity at reservoirs in my local area of Ballycullane and Taylorstown.  It is the right thing to do.  First, the completion of 1.6 km is expected by the end of February 2023.  The remaining 2.5 km should then be ready to commence.  In the summer of 2023, the Ring of Hook area in south-west Wexford should be a much better place in respect of its water supply and infrastructure than it was in the summer just gone.</p> <p> Excuse me, I did not realise I was out of time.  I look forward to there being one entity because I think there is too much passing of the buck at the moment.  When we have one entity dealing with this area, then we will have accountability.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy O'Connor for letting me go first because I have to go to another engagement.  My first point concerning Irish Water and its policy is that the process of transferring workers from county councils to Irish Water is currently under way.  In County Tipperary, definitely there has not been enough consultation, if any, with the workers.  This will have a major impact on and represents a huge change for these workers.  It will also impact their promotional prospects.  They are concerned that they will be put into a straitjacket in Irish Water and not have the same variety of promotional opportunities or terms and conditions of work as they have had heretofore with the county council.  I urge Irish Water to immediately get into consultation with the workers and their representatives to ensure these workers are satisfied and getting the same terms and conditions in Irish Water as they have had heretofore with the county council.  I refer as well to their promotional prospects also being recognised.</p>  <p>  I also wish to bring to light an issue raised with me today concerning a small estate in Tipperary.  It commenced in the 2008-09 era and was then left unfinished for several years.  Thankfully, the eight houses in this estate have now been finished.  The underground works, the water and sewerage, were done prior to 2015.  This means Irish Water is insisting that these works be dug up, renovated and replaced with new infrastructure.  Granted, the conditions Irish Water demands from housing estates have changed since 2015, but surely it makes no sense to go back in to dig up infrastructure that was compliant when it was put in prior to 2015.  It would mean this estate cannot be completed.  It will be left unfinished, with houses lying idle when we all know how badly we need them.</p>  <p>  I spoke to the county council about this issue this morning and this is not the only estate where this is happening.  Developers have seen an opportunity to finish off estates left lying idle for several years and to sell on the houses, but Irish Water is putting obstacles in the way of this happening.  I would, therefore, like to see this matter examined.  If conditions attached to putting in infrastructure projects prior to 2015 have been met, they should be recognised as fit for purpose today.</p>  <p>  Turning to waste treatment in my town of Thurles, the sewerage and wastewater systems are combined.  This caused serious flooding three years ago.  Irish Water has said that it will put the proper infrastructure in place, but it is talking about 2029 in this regard.  This is not satisfactory, and other towns are in the same boat.  This work must be brought forward and completed as quickly as possible in all these towns.</p></speech>

It is great to see him and I wish him well.</p>  <p>  I will make a few points concerning my interpretation of the situation with our water supply.  My report in this regard is not very good.  Moving away from the parochial and putting a more national focus on the subject for one moment, this situation stems from continuously devolving responsibility away from democratically elected individuals to independent State agencies.  Although there are many merits to doing this, when it comes to responsibility for failure it is incredibly difficult for us to get answers to questions.  I heard several Deputies referring during this debate to the lack of answers, whether through parliamentary questions or in writing, from Irish Water regarding concerns in our constituencies.</p>  <p>  My view is that Irish Water simply does not care.  It depends on where outages happen and the priorities of the organisation when it comes to repairs.  Looking at the water outages in Cork East, we have had several that have been exceptionally questionable.  In Whitegate, for example, thousands of residents have been repeatedly put on boil water notices for long periods of time over many years.  Despite years of representations having been made, Irish Water is only now coming forward with a plan to deal with this situation.  People will have to wait for yet another two years.  This is just not good enough.  This situation has been replicated across other areas.  Killavullen, a small village, for the first time ever now has a situation where decreasing water quality is starting to cause outages there and in other parts of north Cork.  Concern is growing about what the priorities of Irish Water are, while there seem to be an ever-growing number of cases in my constituency of Cork East regarding areas that Irish Water has responsibility for.  It is simply unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Also concerning Irish Water, why is it not being properly brought to answer questions about the areas of the organisation's failure when it comes to providing serviced land with water supplies for new housing developments?  My constituency has towns, with which the Minister of State is familiar, that could easily accommodate an extra 500 or 1,000 housing units if the wastewater infrastructure and drinking water supplies were put in place to provide serviced land, that is, if Irish Water chose to go and do this.  In the midst of perhaps what is one of the greatest housing crises this State has faced since its foundation, this is not being done.  It is, quite frankly, outrageous that I have to come in here to talk about this matter and that these opportunities are not being seen in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I have commented umpteen times on the Mitchelstown wastewater situation.  I have lost count at this stage of how many times I have mentioned it.  Irrespective of all that, I have still failed to get anyone within the organisation to come forward with a concrete plan to deal with this situation.</p> <p> I want to raise other issues as well.  Of course, Irish Water has responsibility for the lack of provision of sewage treatment.  We are lucky to have long rafts of scenic areas along the south coast of my constituency.  There are a number of locations where plans were drawn up in the 1990s - before I was born - to deal with some of the sewage issues and to give people pristine coastal waters.  Cork County Council had the foresight and the vision to come up with plans to deal with these areas but there is still an unacceptable outflow of sewage into the sea.  When Irish Water was created in 2013, it came along, curtailed these plans, ripped them up and never even looked at the revised version in areas around Shanagarry and Garryvoe.  I want to put that on the record of this House.</p> <p> If the Minister is listening back to the debate after today - I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will refer these points to him - I want to make the point that Irish Water has a lot of work to do to increase water quality in the east Cork area.  They have undertaken a number of projects.  I am not failing to acknowledge that.  They have done considerable work in Cork Harbour.  This comes back to their priorities.  Are their priorities the cities or are they merely abandoning rural Ireland?  If one looks at my constituency - I can give the Minister of State many examples here today - it will be clear that they have failed to deal with large rural areas across north-east Cork in my constituency.  Of course, they are ignoring ongoing problems in rural areas.</p> <p> It all comes back to this.  We need to be careful about what the next ten years in this country will look like if we are to keep creating more independent State agencies to do the work that politicians in the past would have been hands-on within local authorities in dealing with.  I am very concerned about it because the structures that are in place when it comes to accountability are just not good enough.</p></speech>

You were sorely missed.  Welcome back.  It is great to see you looking so well.</p>  <p>  I welcome, in budget 2023, the secured funding of &euro;1.68 billion for the delivery of water services.  While this involves a significant increase in many areas, there are many challenges.  One of them that I have been on about for years is the Bagenalstown wastewater treatment plant, the upgrade of which has been listed for quite a long time in Irish Water's current capital investment plan under the project title of "Muinebheag and Leighlinbridge Wastewater Treatment Plant".  The plant is also included in the wastewater treatment capacity register published on the Irish Water website.  The current projected delivery date for this - I have been onto the Department and got a commitment - is early 2023.  The capacity of the new plant will be 9,200 population equivalent.  It will be designed to cater for projected residential growth of up to 5,265 people over the next ten years, including the existing and future population, for those currently connected to private non-Irish Water infrastructure and for industry and non-domestic growth in line with the national planning framework.  My greatest concern is that no development in the area can proceed until this is upgraded.  The area is already 20% over capacity, and that is a huge amount.  The biggest issue brought up here today is that no sort of infrastructural work can be done - no housing or businesses can be built - unless we have this upgrade done.  My concern is that we need to get these projects done as soon as possible.  We cannot keep saying they will be done next year.  We are crying out for houses.  We are crying out for businesses to be built.  We must do whatever we can to make sure we have all the steps in place for that.</p>  <p>  I work with Irish Water.  In fairness, it has an Oireachtas line and a line that local authority members can ring.  However, I have had people onto me about trying to contact Irish Water who find that they are having huge issues.</p>  <p>  The other issue I want to talk about is leaks.  A number of people have contacted me to say that they have contacted Irish Water about leaks and bills.  This is about businesses.  One of them is a stud farm in County Carlow.  Those involved have been in contact with Irish Water on several occasions about leaks.  These leaks need to be sorted out.  A man who came to me only two weeks ago has a business in Carlow.  He said he had not got a bill from Irish Water for years.  He got a bill and he said that he will have to get a mortgage to clear it.  When Irish Water is working with businesses, it needs to have constant contact with them on their bills and what they have to pay.  One cannot give a business a bill after years, particularly that amount of a bill.  I had a convent on to me.  It has charitable status.  They have been receiving bills from Irish Water.  I might as well tell the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, that I am blue in the face contacting them.  I think we nearly have it sorted out.  Everybody has enough strain at the moment without putting all these pressures on businesses, and particularly those with charitable status that are getting bills that they should not have to pay.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure we work on this with Irish Water.</p>  <p>  I welcome the investment in Irish Water.  It will play a huge part in the future progress of Ireland, our businesses and our housing.  We need to make sure we work together with it and we deliver.  Communication is key here.</p></speech>

It is good to see you back, a Cheann Comhairle back.  F&aacute;ilte romhat ar ais.  T&aacute; s&eacute; go maith t&uacute; a fheice&aacute;il i mbarr do shl&aacute;inte agus do bheatha ar&iacute;s.</p>  <p>  On Irish Water, I might surprise the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, by starting out with a positive of sorts.  In fairness to Irish Water, there has been a long-standing problem in Cork Harbour with the discharge of foul waste, pollution and the impact on bathing waters,  It has to be acknowledged that there has been very significant investment in that important project.  Not every part of the schedule has run perfectly but, by and large, it is going well.  It will play a vitally important role in the future for the environment, for the quality of people's drinking water, for the quality of water in the harbour and for the potential for future development.  I want to acknowledge that before having some maybe adverse things to say about Irish Water.  It certainly is not all bad.</p>  <p>  It is my view that it is possible to have a national utility that is responsive and properly resourced.  I was never of the view that water charges were necessary to ensure investment in water services.  That can be seen in terms of the investment that has taken place in the North over the course of the past ten years where water charges were taken off the table.  Similarly, at least where it comes to Cork city, investment is possible without that model.  I suppose I would insist that it should remain the case that it is possible, provided the right political priorities are there, to ensure there is investment in our water services that comes through direct public taxation.</p>  <p>  The other element of that, of course, is that we need to ensure this remains in public ownership.  I was at a protest recently in Cork city centre organised by water services workers who work in Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  One of their key demands was a date for the referendum on the public ownership of Irish Water.  That is absolutely essential.</p>  <p>  In terms of Irish Water, as I say, there is a lot of work going on.  That sometimes causes expected outages, but in the course of things, naturally, through storms and whatever, there are unexpected outages too.  I can understand when people are not notified of an outage that cannot be expected but I must say I have been disappointed and frustrated on a number of occasions about the notice that has been received by residents in my constituency due to scheduled outages.  Unexpected weather, storms or whatever occur - these things happen, and that is fair enough.  I understand that but where there is scheduled work, it is vitally important to provide advance notice.  People in all sorts of public authorities point to the note in the newspaper as if people still leaf through the back pages of the local newspaper looking for these advertisements.  That is not how people will hear about outages.  They need to hear it through the radio.  When there are small numbers of houses affected - perhaps a couple of hundred - there is no reason Irish Water could not distribute literature directly to those houses.  It happens on occasion with bodies such as the Office of Public Works, OPW.  Where there is something to do with flood relief, the OPW ensures that the contractor delivers a notice door to door.  It should be the same with Irish Water.  When one is talking about more than 1,000 houses affected, perhaps that is not so realistic.</p> <p>Is it possible for a couple of hundred houses?  I believe it is and it is reasonable.  Many elderly and vulnerable people are hugely affected if their water supply is disrupted when they have had no notice of it.  A notice may have been in a newspaper but that is not to say that the key people will see it.  This brings me to another issue that has been flagged by several of my colleagues on Cork City Council.  There has been some progress on it.  This is the issue of notice for vulnerable people.  This relates to people who are hard of hearing or hard of sight.  It is about ensuring these people are contacted directly to make sure they are aware of it.</p> <p> Irish Water is on the ground regularly and it is doing a lot of work.  This affects the public realm fairly significantly.  Sometimes it is restored properly and quickly in co-operation with the local authority or by its own labour.  Unfortunately, it is not always the case.  Sometimes a road is dug up and a resident or two or a whole street are affected.  They can be a long time trying to chase Irish Water to remediate it.  A woman in my constituency had been trying to get Irish Water to fix the area in front of her drive for 11 months.  This is not good enough.  She had no choice about the works.  They were for the public good.  That is all fine but her drive and any street that has been affected needs to be made good quickly and promptly.  There must be courtesy and respect for residents.</p></speech>

More than seven villages in the county are on the list waiting for investment, including my village of Newcastle, Golden and Cloughjordan at the very north of the county.  The lack of progress on wastewater treatment plants is holding up development.  It is also causing huge pollution.  The EPA and everybody else is ignoring it.  There are regular boil water notices on the Galtee regional water scheme, as there are in Ahenny and the Carrick-on-Suir area.  There were also issues in the areas of Dualla and Ballinure during the summer.  The town of Clonmel, the vale of honey, is a massive town of 25,000 people with a hinterland.  There are boil water notices every second week.  A former council official, Jimmy Harney, did a lot of work and progressed to a certain extent a treatment plant to extract water from the river.  A landlord is willing to sell a site but it has stalled.  Businesses and households are putting up with dirty water, no water and boil water notices.  It is a shocking situation.</p>  <p>  We also have the privatisation of Irish Water.  It was the biggest fiasco of all time.  There is also the way the workers are treated.  I have mentioned a number of projects and I salute the plumbers, caretakers and all the staff.  I pay tribute to the late PJ Cullinan who died recently.  He was a wonderful caretaker.  The workers are being forced over to Irish Water.  They joined the county council and have given sterling service.  They want to continue to do so.  Today I have heard the parties of the left say the unions are now waking up and finally letting on to be representing their members.  I do not think they are.  They are in this deal.  I hear Government backbenchers speak all the time about utilities companies being set up.  We are taking the power away from the local elected officials.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath mentioned Cork County Council workers and employees who are having their rights completely changed.  Perhaps they have worked their whole lives for Cork County Council, having initially agreed their terms and conditions, and now they are changing.  It is a huge issue for a lot of people.  It is raised with me quite often in west Cork.  People need to step back and look at the rights of the employees.</p>  <p>  We also have a massive crisis in Clonakilty in west Cork where there is little or no water.  Many people are blaming climate change but it is not climate change.  It is common sense.  Clonakilty has developed.  It has been a great developing town for the past 20 years or more.  It is now at a complete standstill.  There will be no further development until the water issue is resolved in Clonakilty.  Imagine this.  The Government is lying idly by while the scheme develops at a snail's pace.  Anyone saying it is climate change is blinding us.  It is actually development and there is employment.  This is good and this is positive news.  There is great demand for housing in Clonakilty.  Areas of Clonakilty such as Clogheen, Lady's Cross, the bypass road, The Miles, Tawnies Lower, Barrack Hill and Scartagh are badly affected and have been terribly affected in recent months.  Roscarbery is on the Clonakilty scheme, as are other areas including Caherbeg and Reanascreena South.  I cannot understand it.  We had a problem in Schull.  We had holding tanks.  We put in tanks for holding water when there was a crisis.  What is the progress on the Clonakilty water scheme?  We need to know it right here right now for the greater development of the Clonakilty area.</p></speech>

We really have to appreciate these men.  They are worried about their future because of what is happening and being forced to cross over to Irish Water.  They started with Kerry County Council and they should finish out their time there.  Any of those who started with the council should be let finish their time in the council.  I know they work for Irish Water now but it is different to move the employment across.  I do not think it is fair on them.  We have to recognise the great work they do, as I said, at unearthly hours.  I remember we were eaten alive by the midges one particular night at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.  People have no idea.  You go under the bucket of the machine to get away from them.  They are only small things but they are troublesome.</p></speech>

Where is Limerick?  Oola has been waiting for an upgrade for 20 years; Hospital has been waiting for an upgrade for 20 years; Dromcolliher has been waiting 20 years; and there are also Glin, Foynes and Shanagolden.  People were in Foynes during the week looking at what projects would be done there.  There is raw sewage going into the River Shannon.  The Government has never invested in infrastructure.  We cannot build a house without infrastructure.  Does the Government not get it?  This and previous Governments have never invested in infrastructure.  This is why we have a housing problem.  Houses cannot be built because there is no infrastructure.  Raw sewage is going into the rivers and seas all around Ireland.  This is a problem.  It is estimated that &euro;11 billion will be the funding requirement for 2024, made up of &euro;6.1 billion investment in infrastructure and a &euro;4.9 billion investment in operating costs.  Now the Government wants those people who know the bad water system we have at present and who work for the council to swap over to Irish Water.  Even though the system is broken, everybody in the council knows how to fix it and the Government wants them to swap over to Irish Water.  They should be left to finish out their term with the councils where they started.  Stop using bully tactics to make them swap over.</p></speech>

It is great to have him in charge of the House again.  He was very much missed when he was away for a little time.  We appreciate him.  With regard to this issue, it is very important to acknowledge the great work done by the water section of Kerry County Council and the service it has given over the years.</p> <p>We have serious problems in Kenmare where we cannot have any development, and in many other villages, because of a lack of sewerage and water facilities in the town.  We need development in such places and there are many small villages throughout the county that are in serious trouble.  We have asked that the investment required for these places be fast-tracked so we can have development and allow for growth.</p> <p> As to what is happening with the whole system of transition, we want to think of the great people who have dedicated their lives to serving our county of Kerry, through their work in Kerry County Council and subsequently with Irish Water, and the great service they have given.  I too want to think about people such as Freddie Bartlett; Frank Sheehan, who has retired; Mattie O'Shea, from Glenbeigh, who is also retired; Maurice Fitzgerald; Rory O'Sullivan; Denis Reen; Jeremiah Murphy; and people who are gone from us.  There were great people in our county, such as the great Joe Murphy from Dromtine who worked with Jackie Healy-Rae in providing water to Sneem many years ago and getting water flowing, and people like the late Jack Lyon, as well as our uncle Dan Rae, who used to be outside day and night with a digger doing water repairs and fixing breaks in pipes.  These are the people who go out on Christmas Day or in the middle of the night.  They work continuously and when they are finished one break, another would appear somewhere else and they would have to keep going.  These are the people we have to appreciate.  They are more important than any man wearing a suit, you can be sure of that.  These are the people who do the work on the ground and I respect that.  We have to treat them with respect when decisions are being made in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

When thinking of water infrastructure, I strangely think about the difference between losing one's front teeth and dealing with one's blood pressure.  If you lose one of your front teeth, you will attend the dentist the next day to get it fixed.  However, if you are like the average Irish male and find out you have high blood pressure, you will probably wait for about five years before you do anything about it.  The irony of it is that it is the blood pressure that will kill you.  It is similarly the case in the investment in infrastructure, including water and energy infrastructure and the grid.  Our road network is like the front tooth; if there is a pothole outside a person's home, he or she will notice it and do something about it straightaway.  However, addressing water infrastructure is like addressing blood pressure.  Historically, we have a habit of underinvesting in it.  It is coming back to haunt us and it affects all the development we want to do.</p>  <p>  I refer to the EPA report on water quality in Ireland.  It starkly shows us the problem we have, not just in urban wastewater treatment but across rural settings.  A series entitled "Cois M&oacute;ire" will start on TG4 tonight that will follow the course of the River Blackwater from where it rises in north Kerry, through north Cork and into Waterford, an area spanning some of the best farming country in Ireland.  It is a river that used to be very famous for its fisheries, but that is no longer the case.  The stocks of fish in such rivers are declining steeply and this is to do with our water quality.  I looked at the EU nature restoration law that is coming down the tracks and the commitments we will have to live up to in protecting our estuarine areas, for example, and I am not sure we can continue to do that with the current level of pollution, particularly in respect of nitrogen and phosphorus.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed the Ceann Comhairle will miss my tour of Waterford.  I wanted to list the likes of Dungarvan town, which is under pressure, and Ardmore, which is getting new water treatment works that were much needed.  I will focus on the village of Bunmahon, an area about which I spoke last December.  An example of this can be seen all over the country.  The EPA, Waterford County Council and everybody involved have acknowledged that there is a need for a wastewater treatment plant in Bunmahon.  The community has been fighting tooth and nail for a wastewater treatment plant.  It is a coastal village that relies on tourism.  Water quality is of the utmost importance.  The community wants to build more houses for local people to live in but this is being held back by our investment in wastewater infrastructure.  It is good that we are taking this tour of the country because water quality is an issue that affects communities across the country.  It is good that we have the chance to list them.</p>  <p>  We have to look to Europe and what is coming down the tracks in the urban wastewater treatment directive, about which we heard news on 26 October.  It focuses on making wastewater energy neutral and making industry responsible for treating toxic micropollutants.  These provisions require us to move in the same direction.  We know we have built our development on a creaking water infrastructure, in which it is essential that we invest.</p></speech>

We need to be ambitious in how we seek to empower our towns and villages to grow and develop and become attractive places within which to live and work.</p>  <p>  We are still dealing with a legacy of a crash that left many homeowners in towns and villages high and dry almost a decade ago.  I am sure the Minister of State and many others have been dealing with that legacy and trying to support homeowners who are in estates that are serviced by private wastewater treatment facilities.  It is the policy of Galway County Council, and that of many other local authorities, not to take these private wastewater treatment facilities in charge, many of which are now malfunctioning a decade later.  Homeowners in these estates, some of which are quite large in towns and villages across County Galway, are left carrying the can.  We need to look at mechanisms, some of which were introduced five to six years ago, as to how these issues could be addressed.  They are not working.  Many homeowners across Ireland are left carrying the can of this legacy at a huge cost.  Some of the treatment facilities are simply not working and the Minister of State knows the outcome of that, which I do not have to explain to him.  We need to concentrate on supporting homeowners to address these legacy issues in whatever way we can.  Irish Water has a significant role to play in that regard, as do our local authorities.</p>  <p>  Another issue, which is welcome in one sense, is the demographic challenge of a growing population.  Our population has reached 5 million and is predicted to reach many more millions in the decades to come.  Our national planning policy is beginning to dictate, from which there are many positives arising, that the majority of our new housing developments should be built in our towns and villages within our settlement centres.  The majority of these settlement centres are not set up to accommodate that kind of development.  Craughwell is one village in my locality.  Its population has doubled in the past decade and the same is expected to happen in the next decade.  It is an incredibly attractive place to live and has many fine sports and educational facilities.  It is a village close to Galway city.  Again, it does not have a wastewater facility.  When I inquired with Irish Water several months ago as to what its plans were for the development of a wastewater facility in Craughwell, a burgeoning town, I was told it neither had the remit nor the funds to do so.  Craughwell is a perfect example of what needs to be done in the future.  Irish Water needs to become far more proactive in providing wastewater treatment facilities to facilitate our towns and villages in the future.</p> <p>As legislators we have the opportunity to ensure our policies and laws are fit for purpose.  If this debate is anything to go by, we have a lot of work to do to protect our water.  The most recent EPA report on water quality was published last month and it is not good news.  Only about half of our rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters are in a satisfactory condition and the overall ecological health of our waters have declined in recent years.  The analysis finds the main pressures on water quality agriculture, physical changes such as land drainage and dredging, forestry activities and discharges from urban wastewater.  The only good news is that although the number of water bodies impacted by urban wastewater remains high, it is reducing and the trend is going in the right direction.</p> <p> The number of water bodies impacted by agriculture has, however, increased in recent years and the train is going firmly in the wrong direction.  While we have regulations to control water pollution from agriculture, they need to be implemented.  I have concerns that these are not being enforced.  I fear our water quality will continue to decline in the areas where we have intensive farming with high levels of nitrogen input.  </p> <p> Many of the physical alterations to our watercourses are perpetuated by legislation that dates back to the 1940s.  The Arterial Drainage Act 1945 requires the Office of Public Works to maintain water catchments covering about 20% of our country.  This amounts to drainage, dredging, bank clearance and the clearing of silt and vegetation in more than 11,000 sq km of rivers and streams with no regard for anything natural living nearby.  The effect is to get water to flow more quickly out of the countryside.  Ultimately, we are draining our land and rendering it incapable of holding water in times of flood and guaranteeing that the land continues to act as a carbon source rather than a much-needed carbon store.  The Arterial Drainage Act should be reviewed.  It has been discussed by the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, which I chair, a number of times and we will publish an important report next week that will address this and other issues.  </p> <p> I must mention the project due to bring 350 million litres of water a day from the River Shannon catchment to Dublin.  The project highlights the many failures in how water is managed in this country and we need to drop it and start to think about clever solutions for where the urban growth for Dublin should go.  We can and should look at concentrating growth in our urban centres and places such as Limerick, Galway, Cork and Waterford where pressures are not as acute.</p></speech>

People are making complaints about their constituencies, which is only right.  There are areas of my constituency where there are issues with Irish Water.  I came into the D&aacute;il in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and made those complaints on behalf of my constituents, in particular those served by the Staleen water supply, which goes all the way from Staleen on the River Boyne to Ashbourne, Kilbride and Ratoath.  I was pleased that earlier this year major upgrades were done in Ashbourne to ensure the resilience of the water supply, thanks to a lot of people working together.</p>  <p>  Only this week, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I, along with other public representatives, turned the sod with Irish Water on a new reservoir that will serve Ratoath.  At the moment Ratoath has about three hours' water supply if anything goes wrong on the main pipeline.  With this work, it will have 24 hours' water supply, plus a better pipe network to prevent those problems arising in the first place.  This is welcome.  I am glad that I came into the D&aacute;il and made similar points to those colleagues have made today, but we are seeing results in government and I confident that will continue across the country under this Government, working with Irish Water, to improve the water supply for all of our constituents.</p></speech>

They are the people we see out at all hours of the night in wind and rain addressing local issues.  I wish to discuss two areas.  The first is Bailieborough, the town I live in, and the second is Virginia, County Cavan.  Sadly, over recent months there have been a lot of water outages, which happened because the wastewater plant has gone way beyond the capacity it was designed to deliver.  It needs a serious upgrade.</p>  <p>  Cavan County Council and private developers are working with might and main to deliver social housing.  East Cavan is closest to the city of Dublin and the N3, which is currently at design stage for a bypass of Virginia.  All our housing projects are being hampered because we do not have the wastewater treatment plants we need for Bailieborough and Virginia.  One particular development Cavan County Council wants to commence comprises 45 houses.  It has decided a separate independent wastewater plant will have to be developed and then decommissioned after the housing estate is built.  At least 200 houses cannot be built in the two towns because we do not have the required wastewater capacity.  Anything that can be done to accelerate the two projects will go a huge way towards giving us the housing supply we need in east Cavan.</p></speech>

Nine years after Irish Water was incorporated, this Bill is finding its way to the D&aacute;il.  It will provide the first bit of accountability in respect of Irish Water.  It will become accountable to the Committee on Public Accounts and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>  <p>  In terms of background to this discussion, the report on urban wastewater treatment was published by the EPA on 20 October.  It tells us that 7.5 million litres of sewage is flowing into Ireland's seas and rivers every day, enough to fill three Olympic-sized swimming pools.  I am not here to give out about Irish Water.  It was made into a boxing bag by various Governments.  We should have resourced local authorities and built on their knowledge and skill.  The Government did the opposite.  It was only because of the outrage on the ground that Irish Water has remained in the manner in which it is now, namely a semi public-private company.  We need a referendum quickly.</p>  <p>  To get back to the context of the discussion, the EPA has told us 32 towns and villages are still discharging raw sewage into the environment every day, including Carraroe to which I will come back if I have time.  Irish Water is finally reviewing its policy.  Just 51% of the waste from Ireland's large urban areas was treated to the EU standard.  Another EPA report published on 13 October on water quality in Ireland found it is not as good as it should be, to put up mildly.  Only about half of our surface waters are meeting the standard and we have gone backwards, related to the upswing in agricultural intensification.</p>  <p>  An EU deadline was set in 2005.  We were in court in 2019 and eight large urban areas were in trouble.  Dr. Tom Ryan of the EPA said at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 4 October that we are potentially looking at cases being taken against us.  It is a major challenge.</p>  <p>  I will fault Irish Water on one count.  It is not transferable.  We had no water in Cois Fharraige until very recently.  There is still no drinking water on Inishbofin.  There was no drinking water on Inisheer.  Deputies and local councillors were left like amad&aacute;ns emailing Irish Water trying to find out what caused the problem, when it happened and when it would be rectified.  There was a high level of manganese in the water.  Notices told people not to boil their water.  A few weeks later they were told not to drink the water.  We are still dealing with that tobacco.  Talk about muddying the waters.  I could go on, but I will stop for my colleague.</p></speech>

I know exactly what the Rural Independents were saying when they spoke about the work and commitment of water workers to ensure that water supplies continue across rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  One would be forgiven for reading the Minister of State's speech and thinking there were no water services before Irish Water came about.  That was not the case.  There were large water services that were kept going by people in local communities who ensured water services were delivered.  That is what will be lost through Irish Water.  It is in the process of being lost because jobs will transfer to Irish Water.  We do not know what will happen or whether there will be ongoing commitments to local staff.</p> <p>They will be lost and it will be to the detriment of water services throughout this country if that situation is allowed to happen.  However, that is the way it will work and it will happen from now on.</p> <p> This debate was supposed to be around the need for a referendum around water services.  I think it has been mentioned in one sentence of the Minister of State's speech, which is a seven- or eight-page document.  A referendum will be vitally important because it will ensure our water services stay in public ownership because, ultimately, what will happen is water services will move out of public ownership.  The onus is on the Department to make sure that happens.</p></speech>

That is badly needed because Irish Water is an overcooked organisation given the way it has done things.  Proper budgets are needed for Irish Water.  Previous speakers outlined where there are problems throughout the country.  These will not be magically solved overnight.  The problem is that over the years not enough money was given to resolve the issues in these towns, especially in the west.  They need to be treated the same as everywhere else.</p>  <p>  The House is in agreement that many people are very unhappy about what is going on with the workers in the councils.  The Minister needs to give a clear indication that a referendum takes place.  That is ferociously important.  The Government should say that straight away because many of the workers are very sceptical about what is going on.</p>  <p>  I support what Deputy Joan Collins proposed in her Bill.  The Minister of State should not forget the group water schemes.  However, what we have to deal with in this Bill is Bord G&aacute;is separating from Irish Water.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="16:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900048#AAA00300"><p>A number of local authority water service workers were in the Gallery this afternoon, one of whom, Anthony, is still here.  A couple of them had to leave to work the late shift.  These are the workers with serious concerns about their jobs, working conditions, pay and future pension entitlements.  It would be good if they could at least get some straight answers from the Minister and Government to the questions they have.  A key question relates to the issue of a referendum to enshrine public ownership of water and sanitation services in the Constitution.  They were promised such a referendum would be passed before any transfer of workers to Irish Water would take place.  Such a transfer was supposed to take place in 2026.  In the framework agreement agreed by the four unions involved and the Government at the Workplace Relations Commission, there is no mention of a referendum and a date for transfer has been brought forward by three years to January 2023, which is only a few weeks away.</p>  <p>  On 8 November 2016, six years ago yesterday, I moved the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016.  It set out the wording for a referendum and was agreed, supported and signed by right to water parties, the Right2Water campaign, the unions and the thousands of people on the streets.  That wording did not just deal with ownership but public management of water sanitation services inserted into Article 28.4.2.1&deg; of the Constitution which deals with the responsibilities of the State.  We do not want to place this text in the rights-based section of the Constitution where a human right to water may be in conflict with the ownership of our water system by some Irish oligarch or international vulture fund and some Supreme Court judge may decide whose right is sacrosanct.  We need the amendment placed in the governance section of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  The Bill was unopposed in 2016.  Fianna F&aacute;il supported it.  It had the unanimous support of the D&aacute;il on First Stage but has now been buried for six years on Committee Stage by the committee.  In those six years, we have had three Ministers, two of whom were Fine Gael and one of whom was Fianna F&aacute;il, and the current Minister.  The committee is controlled by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I have written six times since 2020 for the legislation to be brought before the committee and I have been told every time that there is no time.  Maybe another six years will be needed before anything happens.</p>  <p>  It would be good if the Minister gave an unequivocal statement of his intentions.  There is no mention of a referendum in the proposed legislation on waste services.  Will he give a date for the referendum as opposed to a vague commitment?  Will he give an indication of the proposed wording and where it is to be inserted in the Constitution?  This is important to ensure water does not remain in public ownership in name only, with the majority of services outsourced to private companies.</p>  <p>  I welcome that four trade unions have launched a campaign for a referendum date.  It would also be useful if Fine Gael clarified its position.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and the Senator Barry Ward of Fine Gael have stated in recent interviews that they do not think such a referendum is necessary.  The dishonesty of not opposing my Bill in open debate and killing it on Committee Stage speaks volumes.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and, indeed, the Green Party cannot be trusted on this issue.</p>  <p>  I received a letter from the Minister today in which he stated he was happy to confirm he would bring forward definitive proposals on a referendum on water ownership for consideration by Government early in the new year.  That is too late.  January 2023 is when these workers are expected to transfer into Irish Water.  It is not on.  We need the date beforehand and we need wording.  The position is too vague.  The workers are calling for a referendum.  They are calling for wording that states water and water services are to remain in public ownership.  Terms and conditions of local authority water workers do not include allowances and regular and restored overtime.  Allowances, rostered overtime and an on-call allowance must be red circled in the water framework document.</p>  <p>  A worker's pensionable allowances of two and a half hours per week is &euro;87.55, drainage allowance per week is &euro;53 and on-call allowance is &euro;86.  The worker's total loss per year is &euro;11,782 and the total loss when the worker retires will be &euro;188,522.88 before tax.  A worker has made the point with regard to rostered overtime allowance that no other grades are impacted.  It will take him 16 years to accumulate these earnings while some politicians and staff of Uisce &Eacute;ireann earn this amount in one year.  These pensionable overtime allowances have to be red circled for these unions.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, is wishy-washy on this matter.  In a recent letter, it stated that, with a view to ensuring that further detail and comfort is provided with regard to how individual circumstances can be addressed at local level, noting that the range of local variations and individual commitments across various local authorities brings a level of complexity that cannot be addressed centrally.  This has to be red circled for those workers.</p></speech>

In the short time remaining, I will sum up by responding to some of the concerns which were most commonly raised by Deputies in the debate.  Deputies will of course have other opportunities to raise any issues of individual concern or priority with the Minister directly, by way of correspondence or otherwise.</p>  <p>  As mentioned by my Government colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, earlier, the Government&rsquo;s water policy programme centres around three key essentials areas of action.  These are the full integration of water services under Irish Water as the single national water services utility; sustained high levels of multi-annual investment; and strong protection of water bodies.  The Government is progressing strongly on each of these fronts.</p>  <p>  Many significant milestones have already been achieved and have paved the way for the delivery of the further necessary transformations in our water sector.  These milestones include the framework for the future delivery of water services, which has been identified with unions at the WRC and will enable the full integration of water services under Irish Water by 2026; the Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022, which is now at an advanced stage in the legislative process and will see Irish Water legally established as the stand-alone national water services authority in public ownership by 1 January 2023; the sustained investment in Irish Water infrastructure which is currently being maintained at record levels, year on year, to meet citizens' needs for water services and to facilitate housing and development in urban and rural locations; and, just as importantly, the strengthening of the rural water programme with regard to governance, oversight and financial investment to ensure equality of outcomes for the rural water sector.</p> <p>The last point about the milestones is that, to underpin all Government activity in the water domain, Ireland&rsquo;s third river basin management plan is being finalised to cover the planning period to 2027 in order to deliver on our obligations to reverse the decline in water body status and restore water quality, while working towards climate change and biodiversity objectives.</p> <p> On the referendum, I appreciate the desire by Members to see a firm commitment on wording and timing.  The Minister has been clear on the approach here.  The wording being considered is focused on ensuring that the entity tasked with operating the public water system, Irish Water, must always remain in State ownership.  As for the timing, it is intended the Government will consider a referendum proposal on water ownership in conjunction with the anticipated recommendation of a proposed referendum on housing from the commission on housing.  The Minister looks forward to bringing proposals on both referendums to Government for consideration in the near future.</p> <p> The status of Irish Water as a statutory body is provided for in the Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022.  The Bill provides that it will be known as Uisce &Eacute;ireann and describes it as the national authority for water services with responsibility for the functions assigned to it by, or under, the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2022.  The Bill provides for a change in the existing share ownership arrangements such that the shares are to be held by both the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This is similar to the approach for other State-owned bodies.  Commensurate with the level of Exchequer funding it receives, Irish Water-Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p> There is no question of the framework for the future delivery of water services being implemented without due consultation with staff.  It is important to note that from a staff perspective, the framework sets out the options that will become available generally to all staff members in due course.  It empowers each staff member to decide voluntarily on the option best suited to his or her individual needs.  The framework already provides for a comprehensive engagement exercise to be carried out with local authority water services staff to communicate the framework details directly to staff.  This will ensure all water services staff will fully understand the options available to them under the framework.  Any transfers of staff to become permanent employees of Irish Water will be on a voluntary basis.</p> <p> Demonstrable progress is being made in addressing the challenges we face and the Government will continue to deliver strongly on the ambitious commitments to water services contained in the programme for Government.</p> <p> A few issues were raised by Deputies during the debate.  Several expressed concerns about communications with Irish Water.  We will revert to Irish Water and the Minister in connection with that.  I appreciate that given the uncertainty experienced by communities, it is critical public information is delivered to Members of the Oireachtas, and all our public representatives, so we can communicate with communities.  Deputy Dillon had a query about the rural water sector and the review.  Tobin Consulting Engineers was engaged to undertake a research and information project to inform the working group on its review of the rural water sector.  The report for this project is substantially completed and it is expected the working group will consider the final report shortly.  Once the working group has considered the report, a policy paper will be developed by the Department and a submission will then be made to the Minister for his consideration in early 2023.</p> <p> On the number of discharge points, it is important I put firmly on record the areas of improvement.  Irish Water has addressed some 18 areas since 2014, which is significant progress.  Of the remaining 32 areas of discharge, construction work has begun on half these sites.  Again, that shows the result of the significant Government investment in Irish Water.  Work is expected to commence on the remaining areas by 2024.  I acknowledge the many Deputies who pointed out the significant improvements to the water infrastructure in their locality.  We must be clear we had decades of underinvestment in our water and wastewater infrastructure.  It is Irish Water's job to rectify this and it is doing just that with a significant programme of work.  This money obviously has to be raised by the Exchequer.  We are all aware, when we point out the different problems in our society and communities, that money must be raised to resolve those issues.  That is why the Government has taken the significant decision to ensure Irish Water has over &euro;1.5 billion at its disposal this year and will continue to improve our water infrastructure and also unlock so many developments.  As I travel around the network of 31 local authorities, I see many developments that need to be unlocked in terms of having services to underwrite their capacity to develop into the future.  We work closely with the management of Irish Water to continue that programme of work and ensure we are transforming Ireland to ensure it is sustainable and our water services are up to scratch and meet the needs or our communities.</p></speech>

According to the Government, the intention is to respond to the economic difficulties resulting from the aggression against Ukraine by Russia by creating a specific Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  However, the problem with rising energy prices started long before the war in Ukraine, which started around 26 February.</p>  <p>  The skyrocketing Irish energy prices are largely caused by three factors.  The ongoing dysfunctional energy policy position places an effective ban on new domestic energy sources that are not renewable.  If we are to talk about the dismantling of the Shannonbridge and Lanesborough power stations, every day since they were closed the cost of electricity has gone up.  I welcome credit being made more easily available to businesses across the board.  However, we do not want businesses to go into debt.  The cause of many of them being in trouble is the cost of electricity, petrol and diesel.  When we talk about the cost of living going up, it is basically all due to the cost of energy.  There are so many things we could be self-sufficient in.  I do not agree with all this climate change because the records tell us that climate change happened back over the years.</p> <p>I do not agree that what we are doing is the cause of it, including the people cutting enough turf to keep themselves warm for the winter.  I am proud of the people who go out and cut their own turf and are keeping themselves warm when the rain and bad weather come.  I am proud of those people and they are proud of themselves for being self-sufficient.  We know members of the Government are not happy about it.  Do they want those people to be cold?  The cost of heating oil today is &euro;1.40 or &euro;1.50 a litre.  It costs an enormous amount at this time to fill a tank.  People are putting only &euro;300 or &euro;400 worth of oil in to keep themselves going for a couple of weeks.</p> <p> This country survived during the Second World War because of turf.  The Government seems to be blaming the current war for everything.  Surely we should be doing things to help ourselves to be as self-sufficient as we can be, not pandering to Russia by buying its coal and being dependent on it for gas.  We should be storing gas in the old Kinsale Head gas field.  We could have bought enough gas during the summer, when it was much cheaper, and stored it there for use.  We could be developing the oil field off Barryroe, from which we could derive gas, petrol and oil distillates.  Likewise, deposits of gas were found off the Kerry coast but, in 2019, the then Taoiseach, who is now the T&aacute;naiste, took away the licences from the prospective operators who were going to drill there.  We could now be exporting gas to other parts of the world if we sourced our own gas.  Instead, the Government has cut off its nose to spite its face.  It does not understand the harm it is doing to the poor honest people who are trying to live, keep a roof over their heads and travel to work faced with the high cost of petrol and diesel.</p> <p> The cost of electricity is another problem.  The Government is saying it will introduce a windfall tax and give it back to the people.  Why is it allowing the electricity companies to charge so much that they are tripling their profits?  Is it because the Government is getting triple the amount of taxes out of them?  Where is the energy regulator?  Where is the Minister who is in charge of this?  The people in Kerry I represent, like people in the areas other Deputies represent, are totally disenchanted by this type of policy.  Why are the energy companies not being curtailed at this time?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="16:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900050#CCC00300"><p>All across the country, SME owners are worried and struggling as we head into the winter due to rising costs, higher interest rates and waning consumer confidence.  While the Government cites the war in Ukraine as the rationale for this Bill, many other factors are also to blame.  The Government's ongoing dysfunctional energy policies, for example, mean Irish consumers are paying much higher prices than almost any other European citizens for petrol, diesel, home heating oil and electricity.  Yes, the war on Ukraine is driving up energy and commodity prices and making it harder to get certain materials, but it is deeply cynical for the Government to hide behind the war when its own policies are causing the most pain for Irish consumers.</p>  <p>  The taxes being charged on energy in Ireland are higher than in any other EU country.  Our carbon taxes are among the highest anywhere in the world.  These factors are causing our energy prices to soar.  Another factor is that the Government will not provide security of domestic energy supply by opening up drilling for new oil and gas supplies off our coast.  The Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme and other measures will, we hope, help businesses competing internationally and suffering the broader effects of skyrocketing energy costs.  However, they will do absolutely nothing to tackle the underlying causes of this crisis.</p>  <p>  The new credit guarantee scheme is expected to open before the end of the year, providing low-cost, unsecured working capital to SMEs and primary producers.  The Government says it is designed to help businesses to spread increased input costs and limit the disruption to supply chains.  However, while the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and others in government continue to give red-carpet treatment to the head of the European Central Bank, ECB, ordinary people are being hit hard by the ECB rate hikes, which will do more damage than intended and will almost certainly trigger deep recessions in many EU countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Ireland.  Worse still, they will see thousands of Irish mortgage holders lose their homes as they will not be able to meet the rising monthly loan repayments.</p>  <p>  On paper, the two-tier Irish economy will keep growing, thanks to the robust exports from the multinationals based here and buoyant corporate tax receipts.  However, the domestic economy, which impacts people in every community, will struggle gravely.  That is what I have been told in the past few months when I met with publicans, restaurant and caf&eacute; owners, hoteliers, family owners of supermarkets, farmers and fishermen.  They are in a crisis.  The Government has been throwing &euro;200 here and there at householders but the bottom line is the bills these businesses face are astronomical.  A payment of &euro;200 will do nothing for them.  The few quid they are getting is not enough.</p>  <p>  Many business owners are worried.  I met with hoteliers recently in Clonakilty who told me some of them, and their family members, would have to work for free next year.  The owners of family-run hotels will not take any money for themselves.  At the same time, the Government is saying it will leave the VAT rate at 9% for now but might increase it to 13.5% in February.  There must be clarity on that straight away, maybe even tonight.  Surely the Government understands the pressure on some of these hotel owners.  They are not all taking in refugees.  These are hotels that rely on a summer trade to do their business.  It is hard to believe but the owners and their families will have to work for free next year if the situation continues as it is.</p>  <p>  If the VAT rate goes from 9% to 13.5%, it will have devastating consequences for many of these hotel owners.  The same is true for shop owners.  The problem for these businesses is that their costs are rocketing, with electricity bills of &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 a month.  That increase has to go onto the price of the drum of milk, the loaf of bread and the box of eggs.  It has to go onto the shelf because the owners cannot take the hit.  Alternatively, they will have to reduce the number of staff on the floor, which will be another blow to people.</p>  <p>  The crux of the whole issue is that the Government was caught napping.  Not just this Government but successive Governments were asleep at the wheel.  We should have had our own energy supply and our own fuel.  A lot of speakers in this House waffle on with the spin that we can do without fuel.  We cannot do without it.  How do people get to this Chamber every day?  Some 99.9% of us drive here.  That is the way it is at the moment and there is no alternative.  If there was an alternative, I would be the first person jumping up and down to support it.  The alternative is not there.</p>  <p>  There are Deputies who continue to say they are delighted the Kinsale Head gas and oil field is going out of operation and that we do not need to open an oil field in Barryroe.  They are all in cloud cuckoo land.  The best experts in the world say wind energy will not take the place of any of these fuels until 2035 or 2040.  Some of the same Deputies tried to give that old spin in the audiovisual room more than a week ago when we had experts in to discuss the issue.  Those Deputies were all quietened with the click of a finger because they were given true and honest answers.  Many of them do not want to hear those answers but they are the facts.</p>  <p>  There are proposals for liquefied natural gas, LNG, floating gas terminals.  LNG is a very clean fuel that could perhaps be put through the pipes in Kinsale, provided the Government does not fill them with concrete, as it is strongly rumoured to be proposing to do.  That will have to be watched carefully.  There is a company in this country that has bought 250,000 tonnes of Colombian coal.  That coal is brought into the country from Colombia but we cannot produce anything ourselves.  We are beginning to look like a farcical nation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="16:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900050#CCC00400"><p>We are told the purpose of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2022 is to make amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 to support the needs of business to access additional finance.  According to the Government, the creation of a Ukraine credit guarantee scheme is in response to economic difficulties resulting from the aggression by Russia against Ukraine.</p> <p>My goodness what will we call it next?  Will we change our name altogether?  Instead of being Ireland will we become Ukraine?  The last scheme did not work.  The Minister will remember that.  It was an abject failure because the money was not given to the small companies; it was given to the grubby main banks and they would not lend it.  Farmers, agricultural contractors and businesspeople who had vibrant business plans were told "No, no, no".  Yet the Government makes the same mistake over and over again.  Someone told me one time that to keep doing the same thing over and over again is the definition of "mental illness".  Yet we see the Government doing the same thing here the whole time.  It is beholden to the banks.  It is selling off part of AIB now to make more money.  This is not going to work.  It does not cut it with me and it does not cut it with ordinary people.  The amount of money being talked about is staggering.  There are three reasons that I can see.  There is the ongoing dysfunctional energy policy, which places a ban on domestic energy sources, especially our own here if it is not renewable.  We all want to be renewable and be green but we do not have the wherewithal to do it.  We do not get into the car tonight and then take off two wheels before we go to drive it.  We have to keep it going, get the NCT and keep it roadworthy and have it taxed and insured and keep the licence and all to drive it.  However, here the clamour is to be greener and holier than thou.  It is complete codology.  I could call it worse.</p> <p> The lack of an energy facility is another madness until such time as we have the renewables.  Our oil prices and taxes are among the highest in the world, especially carbon tax.  One of our European partners, possibly Sweden - it will not come to me - deferred carbon tax two weeks ago because of the cost-of-living crisis but, no, the Government parties want to bring it in like they are going out on a fine day making a cock of hay in the field long ago.  They have a nice big cock to give out to their friends, the big business people.  That is what it is at.  As I said the providers for the scheme are supposed to be the primary producers and mid-caps defined as businesses with up to 490 people.  What is the minimum size of a business that is allowed to approach for a loan?  Who is looking after the business for the fear amh&aacute;in or the bean amh&aacute;in, the one-man show or one-woman show?  Who is looking after them, giving them money?  What about those with one to five workers who maybe have a couple members of the family working, or one to ten?  They are the businesses being crushed and walked over.  They cannot keep the lights on at the moment and then cannot get finance from any source.  They get it from the credit union to be repaid to the credit union but anybody else, no.  We are trying to support the credit unions.  The Central Bank, of course, moved in at the behest of the Government and the Minister at the time, Michael Noonan, and nobbled them and any idea they had.  We went abroad and looked at banking models.  There is a model in New Zealand and Sparkasse in Germany is a model of community banking, of the people for the people by the people.  I did research on those.  I have never been to Germany but I always thought it was about massive companies like Volkswagen and Bosch and the products that we see.  In Germany, 90% of the companies comprise one to 50 people and they have community banking that lends to the community and all the profits go back into the community.  That would not do in Mother Ireland at all because we could not look after the people who look after the Government parties, who bankrolled them and kept them in power for years.  The naked truth is as simple as that.  Why else would the Government not change and look after the people?  They look after the big people all the time.  </p> <p> We met with ESB senior officials today.  I thank them for coming to meet us, and I thank the ESB staff on the ground who work in all weathers and come out at all times.  We had a meeting of nearly two hours.  It was an exhausting meeting.  We expected something but they cannot do anything because of Government legislation and the so-called regulator who will not allow them to bring down the prices.  Imagine that the regulator will not allow that, the regulator who is meant to be acting on behalf of the people, daoine na h&Eacute;ireann, as the Government is, and as we are, elected for the time being to represent the people, but the Government abandoned the people a long time ago.  That is why the Government will be moved out of there soon and others will take its place because it has been there for 11 years and things have gone from bad to worse from the bank so-called bailout, which was a cleanout and robbery.  The Government put nothing only misery on the people and the regulator will not allow the ESB to drop the costs.  They were delighted for a while that legislation was being prepared at European level that might give us some hope of a reduction but, no, that cannot happen either even though legislation is going to be proposed in a blaze of glory.  Ministers will probably fly out again on jets to Europe or some part of Europe for another global summit, meet their global masters and come back to say they are introducing this Europe-wide.  However, it is not going to back off the meter on the wall or off the businessman who cannot keep his butcher shop open or his restaurant open.  Businesses are closing, including the one-man show, the two-man show and the firms with one to ten employees.  They are the people who are disappearing like snow off a ditch.  Family businesses for generations will never be replaced.  We lost the bakery in Clonmel town recently after 62 years of service to the people because of the cost of electricity.  The Government did nothing for them.  Its failure to act is a betrayal of the people.  It brings in Bills like this but it might as well use the paper to make a paper trail for the kids to play with in the front year because that is as far as it is going to get.  The Government will come back later on tonight to push through all Stages of this.  Irish Water is another big monopoly.  The Government parties are like children of five years of age let out of school.  They want everything big, like big sand castles.  It wants all these big utility companies.  The county councils and the ordinary people, na daoine beaga, served this country well.  They fought and freed it.  They gave us our democracy.  They brought us to where we are up till 20 or 30 years ago until the Government went greedy, mad and plundered our country.  I have said it before and I will say it again: Cromwell did not do as much damage to this country as the past three or four Governments have done.  I was part of the first one in 2007 and I was lucky to be released from the chains of that group but they have gone their merry way serving the global leaders of the world and not serving the ordinary daoine of &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

I was making the point that I agree with him but a younger generation would not get the comment about the cock of hay.  It was just in jest.  I thank the Acting Chair for the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  We are going to amend an important piece of legislation to ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are recapitalised and have a steady flow of money that will in some way alleviate the pain they are going to face in the months ahead.  It has been well covered in other speeches but I want to use my speaking time to address an issue that got a good deal of airtime today on the national radio stations.  It was covered on the front page of the <i>Irish Mirror</i>.  It is the story of Crowe&rsquo;s Gala Shop in Sixmilebridge, County Clare.  They are no relations of mine but they are people I know in the local community.  They run a valued supermarket locally.  On the front of that paper was Flora Crowe who is a young shopkeeper carrying on the family tradition of providing a store in the local community.  Sixmilebridge is a community that does not have a SuperValu, Lidl, Aldi or Tesco supermarket.  It is reliant on the service that the Crowes and the other major grocer in the village, the Flynns, provide.  To give some context this is a relatively small supermarket.  It could just about fit in the middle of the Chamber on the lower level.  The Crowe family now face a bill of &euro;20,000 for electricity.  This is devastating.  Last year they thought they had seen the bill to beat all bills with &euro;6,500 going up to &euro;8,000 on the following bill.  Now it has gone up almost threefold to &euro;20,000.  This is a bill they simply cannot pay.  On budget day the temporary energy support scheme was announced.  It is a positive intervention that will reduce some of the pressure that SMEs will face this winter.</p> <p>I looked on the Revenue website on 28 October.  It has not been updated since.  Business owners are checking it day in, day out to see how they can avail of this support.  On that day it stated that further details on how to apply for and draw down the scheme would become available in the weeks ahead.  That is almost a fortnight ago and businesses now need to know.  The likes of Crowe&rsquo;s Gala shop in Sixmilebridge and so many others are getting these bills in the post.  They do not know when they will be able to engage with this, how they will apply to Revenue or when that portal will be open.</p> <p> It is very important as well that some kind of reclassification is made in terms of small and medium-sized businesses.  Crowe&rsquo;s and Flynn's in Sixmilebridge, like many other stores around the country, are family-owned entities.  They have the branding over the door, but they are family-owned entities.  They do not have motherships like Dunnes Stores, Tesco, Lidl or Aldi to lean back on.  When these bills come in, they risk not being able to pay and risk defaulting with their energy providers.  That is of huge concern.  This scheme cannot come in quickly enough.  However, it needs to go beyond that.  Some better detail and clarification is needed.  On budget day, I heard that the intervention will cover up to 40% of gas and electricity bills.  In money terms, that will be &euro;10,000 per month.  That might benefit the larger store very well, but it certainly would not in its current guise benefit the small family-run store.  There is a need for some amendments in that regard.</p> <p> Most of these supports will expire at the end of February.  For the likes of Crowe&rsquo;s shop and many other retail outlets, however, turning off the refrigeration or the ovens in the deli counter area will simply not be an option when they get to the end of February.  These are stores that rely on food refrigeration and heating systems that simply operate on a 365-day basis.  They do not get shut off.  If the local store in Sixmilebridge was to close, there is nothing else.  This is a community that relies on its local shop.  As I have said, they do not have any of the giant supermarkets in their community; they rely on the local family-run store.</p> <p> On supports for businesses, our farming community is very reliant on grant incomes.  There is a huge farming community in Clare.  In fact, Clare has the highest reliance on suckler beef systems in the country.  About 85% of our farm systems in Clare are suckler beef.  I note that Deputy Mattie McGrath has left the room.  I am a suckler beef farmer.  I was out this morning at 6.30 a.m., foddering cattle in the shed before getting suited and booted and coming up to the D&aacute;il.  That is how many rural people live.</p> <p> I have concerns about the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, which is being introduced by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.  It is a good scheme but it does not bring everyone with it.  The Burren programme has been running in the Burren area of north Clare, with its famous karst stone landscape, for many years.  This very successful scheme has surpassed all expectations.  There are approximately 400 farmers in the Burren who sustain that environment.  They manage and maintain it better than anyone.  They manage it so well that UNESCO has now granted it world geopark status.  It is now being suggested that they should move forward with the Burren and Aran scheme in the ACRES programme.  I am very concerned that there will be a loss of funding for them.  For some of them, it will make it unviable.  They simply will not want to be out foddering cattle be it on a full-time basis or before or after work.  If they walk off the field, so to speak, it will be to the detriment of the Burren and once again we will see parts of that karst landscape with shallow soils returning to a hazelwood jungle.  That is what it looked like for many years and that is what that landscape looks like when it is not appropriately maintained.  I have spoken directly with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.  Farming is often cast aside as just a rural activity, but it is an enterprise and a business.  It sustains many families in rural Ireland, including 400 in the Burren area and many more throughout Clare. </p> <p> I conclude by welcoming this Bill that is before the Oireachtas.  It is positive and progressive.  However, the likes of the Crowe family, who are not related to me, need to have some certainty on those budget measures announced some weeks ago.  In the interests of farmers, including those in the north Clare area, ACRES needs to be adjusted before it is fully implemented in the new year to take account of those who have been on other schemes that paid better and had greater inputs with better outcomes for the landscape.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="17:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900052#EEE00200"><p>I thank the Acting Chair for the opportunity to speak on this legislation today.  I support the creation of a Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, developed under the provisions of the EU temporary crisis framework to support firms struggling with the economic difficulties resulting from the aggression against Ukraine by Russia.</p>  <p>  Recent months have been very difficult for small business owners, particularly those in rural Ireland.  I spoke recently to a shop owner in my constituency of Donegal who has seen an incredible 118.8% increase in their energy bill, working out at an additional cost of &euro;160,000 for the year.  Unfortunately, energy is not the only significant rise in cost that they have had to endure of late.  The high rate of inflation, due to the war, has led to all their suppliers having to increase costs as well.  To maintain competitiveness, this small rural shop has had to absorb some of these increases, which has impacted on its margins.  There has been a 10% increase in wrapping and packaging and a 15% increase in insurance over the past year, with insurance rising an incredible 32% since 2019.  When factoring in the increased costs, they were looking at a reduction of approximately &euro;220,000 in their bottom line. </p>  <p>  Businesses are being hit from all angles.  Prices are spiralling at an incredible rate with no sign of stopping any time soon.  This is completely unsustainable and without a doubt will force the closure of a number of local businesses in my town and throughout my constituency.  This Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, along with the likes of the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, are welcome but I am afraid they are too little, too late.  Businesses are facing closure today and many have been forced to close already.</p>  <p>  My own town of Killybegs has already seen closures due to rising costs.  It feels like 2008 all over again, with the constant threat of closures looming and activity in rural towns slowing to a halt as the cost of living continues to rise.  The outlook looks particularly bleak for Killybegs because the fishing industry, on which the town was built, is taking hit after hit.  I welcome that the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will include primary producers such as farmers and fishermen as well.  However, it is not nearly enough for our fishing industry, which is deteriorating very quickly.  The survival of our coastal communities is at stake and throwing a bit of money at them at this late stage in the game is sadly not going to make a blind bit of difference.  Fishing communities have been calling for the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to provide the emergency assistance that is urgently needed to meet fuel costs for months now.  Many other member states gave emergency fuel subsidies to their fishing fleets months ago following the adoption of the temporary crisis framework by the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  The temporary crisis framework allows member states to "use the flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy in the context of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine".  It provides for three types of aid, including limited amounts of aid in which member states are able to set up schemes to grant up to &euro;35,000, which could be granted in any form, including direct grants, to companies affected by the crisis that are active in the agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture sectors.  Other types of aid include liquidity supports in the form of State guarantees and subsided loans and aid to compensate for high energy prices.  This temporary crisis framework was adopted on 23 March.  It is now 9 November and the framework was initially only due to be in place until 31 December.  What has the Government been doing all this time?  While other countries have successfully put in place emergency assistance, we have waited until we are in our winter months to actually do anything.  I am thinking of all those businesses that could have potentially avoided closure had something been put in place much sooner.  This Government&rsquo;s inaction costs livelihoods, our rural communities and our coastal communities. </p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has turned a blind eye to our fishing industry for far too long.  All that is on offer to them is a tie-up scheme as part of the Brexit response, rather than anything to do with the financial crisis.  The Minister refused any further response because he did not want to affect any other funding that could come from Brussels in the meantime.  The crisis is now and we need funding now to support people.  The fishing communities have been calling for the implementation of aid measures since the temporary crisis framework was adopted eight months ago.  It simply is not good enough.  This Government has failed completely at responding to this cost crisis that businesses are facing.  It has failed in responding to the fishing industry in a time of real difficulty, it has failed in meeting the needs of its citizens and it has been too slow in responding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="17:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900052#EEE00300"><p>Today, the Rural Independent Group met with senior management of the ESB.  There was a debate and many questions were asked.  One of the questions was on the &euro;1.036 billion in operating profits it had after 18 months.  One question was why could it not use the profits to compensate the people of this country, as it is 96% State-owned.  However, under competition regulation, it is not allowed to do this, is it?</p> <p>Under regulation, ESB Networks is allowed to make &euro;1.063 billion in profits but it is not allowed to compensate households - every man, woman and child - and businesses.  That is sad, is it not?  Regulation is stopping those people and businesses from being compensated.</p> <p> Another matter relating to regulation is that the base cost of energy is based on regulation as well.  The regulation dictates that the base cost is based on the price of gas prices, coal and other fossil fuels coming into this country.  It then works on a base price of what energy is going to cost.  There is not much difference between any of the electricity suppliers in terms of the cost of electricity even though, according to energy bills, renewable energy accounts for 63% to 64% of energy produced.  Even though it is cheaper to use renewable energy to supply electricity, it comes under the same regulation base costs as fossil fuels.  Is that correct?  The suppliers have no choice.  As a result of a regulation, they have to charge the same base price for electricity from renewable energy as electricity from fossil fuel energy.  We are here listening to people preaching to us every day about renewable energy.  As a result of a regulation from Europe, the same price is being charged for renewable energy that accounts for 64% of our energy as is charged for electricity produced from coal at Moneypoint or from gas coming into the country.  The people are being ripped off when it comes to energy costs.</p> <p> According to statistics published this month by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, SMEs account for 99.8% of the total number of active enterprises in Ireland.  This represents 68.4% of employment.  I presume the Minister of State knows what SMEs are.  They account for 68.4% of employment.  I run an SME, as do many other people.  I have just outlined that, under regulation, the price of electricity in this country is based on fossil fuels coming in even though renewable energy is also playing its part.  Under competition law, renewable energy falls under the base cost of fossil fuel energy.</p> <p> Now we turn around to the fossil fuel on which the Government is taking 50% of every euro spent by people who are trying to go to work.  The 68.4% of the workforce who are employed by SMEs have no choice but to use their vehicle to go to work.  I and other members of the Rural Independents met with the ESB today.  The people we met are all based in Dublin, where they have public transport, bicycle lanes, taxis and the Luas that they can use to get to work, or where they can work from home.  They have everything.  I asked them about different things.  The Government is charging a 50% tax on fuel, supported by the Minister of State and all his colleagues, and this is a tax on people who do not have infrastructure.  It means 50% on foods being delivered to one's house, 50% on the delivery of the clothes on our backs and 50% tax on the shoes delivered to shops.  It is an unfair tax on every person in rural Ireland.  From the Red Cow roundabout out is rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland is not above in the mountains where people come down once a week for a bite of food; it takes in anyone outside the Red Cow roundabout who does not have infrastructure.</p> <p> The Government has taxes at 50% and it is talking about energy costs.  It is a failure by the Government, the Minister of State and all his colleagues.  I heard Deputy Cathal Crowe saying he is a suckler farmer.  Why is he not opening his mouth?  Why are none of the Government backbenchers opening their mouths about the energy crisis and the taxation?  It is like fuel - the more the electricity price charged by suppliers goes up, the more VAT the Government takes on the bill.  It is another tax on rural Ireland.  You have to factor in that a person who is on &euro;600 a week take-home pay and lives somewhere past the Red Cow roundabout has no choice but to go to work in a car.  An average car takes &euro;100 of fuel.  The Government takes &euro;50 of that before the person leaves home.  The person then has to go to work.  When the person gets up in the morning and turns on a light, the Government is taking VAT on the higher energy costs that are based on fossil fuel prices even though renewable energy is cheaper.  But, no, the Government takes it on the high base costs, even when it comes to a company that is 96% owned by the State, because of regulations that have been brought in by Europe and the Government.  It is another tax.  The fuel tax is an unfair tax on rural Ireland.  It is an unfair tax on people who have no choice but to drive to work.  It is an unfair tax on every SME.</p> <p> We heard about the butchers and other shops that are trying to keep the fridges on to store the food they will supply to families.  I found out today that the cost of energy is based on an outdated regulation.  If the regulation was changed, that would bring down the cost of energy.  The other energy suppliers could use their profits to subsidise the energy costs but they will not do so because they know they are caught under regulation.  Why can we not change the regulation?  Why can we not do something for the people in this country?  Why can we not do something that will save the jobs of the 68.4% of people working in this country who are employed by SMEs?  They are not all here in Dublin.  Many of them live near me.  Some of them are my family members.  They are all across the country and they want to support this country but all the Government does is tax them out of existence.  We see now that the technology crowd is starting to let people go because it does not think it is viable.</p> <p> The first time I raised the issue of the fuel crisis in the House, I could see the problem.  The Government could not see it.  The parties in Opposition could not see it, but I could see it because I am on the ground with people and I understand the cost of living.  The Government does not understand it.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, said that the citizens I was referring to are the citizens who are not in a position to support local economies and stores, so the Government takes less VAT there and that is why it is taking more tax on fuel.  With the unfair tax on fuel, he is penalising everyone who has no choice but to drive.  His answer was that because the citizens I was referring to are not in a position to support the likes of SMEs due to the escalating cost of food production, transport in this country is being brought down by the Government through its taxation system.  I would be sickened if I was in the shoes of the Minister of State over there.  I would be sickened by what the Government is doing to the next generation and to every SME in this country.  It will be held to account, believe me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="17:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900053#FFF00200"><p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The making of these amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 to support the needs of businesses to access additional finance is very important.  According to the Government, it is in response to the economic difficulties resulting from the aggression against Ukraine by Russia and the spill, as we would call it, from that, as well as the shock wave effect it is having on economies and the cost of energy, fuel and gas throughout Europe and the rest of the world and the detrimental effect it is having on so many people's lives.</p> <p>That is outside of the human side, which is outside all the financial side.  Sometimes, when we are in the Chamber talking about finances and economies, we have to remember the real people who are affected by the Ukrainian war and the invasion of Ukraine, including the moms, dads, children and grandparents who are being put out of their homes and are being bombed, killed and maimed.  We have to remember those people today and think of them in a sincere way and we then of course have to deal with the knock-on effects of what is happening.  We have to deal with the day-to-day trouble we have and businesses have in financing their day-to-day operations.</p> <p> I will talk about the problems we have.  It is timely because today, Deputy Mattie McGrath and I, as well as the others in the Rural Independent Group met senior officials from the ESB.  I was glad to have a meaningful engagement with them.  I was grateful for their time, as were the others.  It was meaningful, in that they gave us an insight into the way they perceive the situation and they have all been around for a while now.  They are not Johnny-come-latelies to the job but are experienced people.  They gave us the benefit of their knowledge, which I appreciated.  What it tells me, however, is that the hope we have with regard to energy for this winter is like everything in life.  It is a case of "What if?", "Hopefully" and "I wonder".  That is what we are really relying on because, first of all, we are hoping it will not be too cold.  At the same time, we are hoping there will be a bit of wind that will keep the turbines going.  If we really start to think about this, these are the things we need to happen in order that ESB prices will stay affordable in such a way that businesses will not have to close.  I will say again that we have to hope for a bit of wind and we have to hope and pray that it will not get too cold because if those two things happen, that is, if we have calm weather and it gets very cold, it will be detrimental to the Irish people, to families and to businesses, be they large, small or medium, because the price of energy will absolutely go through the roof.  We looked at a graph today on exactly what has been happening over the past four months.  The one thing that has made the graph on cost come down over recent weeks is the fact that it is mild outside.  If it was cold and if usage of energy went up, we would be crucified by the price of it.  We are crucified as it is.</p> <p> I have an insight into the running of a small business - I have a small shop - the massive increase in ESB bills and the fact we are all now in this situation.  I talk about "mom's purse" a lot, by which I mean the mom who has to balance the household budget on a Friday evening.  When mom or the businessperson has to dread opening an ESB bill, something is radically wrong.  When we go back over different times, whether it was during the 1980s and the slump we had at that time or during the crash of the property bubble and all that, even at that time, people did not dread the ESB bill but now they do.  They are really afraid of it.  I spoke today with a master butcher from County Kerry who went into great detail about what is happening in his business.  It is frightening because of the massive energy usage by his business.  Yesterday, I spoke with the proprietor of a large retail outlet.  Sometimes, when people hear of a large business owner they think they are flying but if 80 or 90 people are working in a place, it might not be flying.  It means the business owner has an awful lot of people to keep going, an awful lot of responsibilities and the bills are multiplied in accordance with the number of employees he or she has.  The more turnover a person has, the bigger the bills are.  It is like a vicious circle.  Equally, the smaller person is crucified because he or she does not have enough turnover.</p> <p> The world of business today is very difficult.  That is why the credit guarantee scheme and the amendments that are being made to it are important.  I know myself that when you are in trouble with a business, you have to be able to access finance.  No one of us in this world has enough money to run the show or to progress.  If you are in the business of creating employment, you cannot do it on your own.  You need support.  I am sorry to say that our pillar banks certainly do not do enough.  I have spoken to people in the banks.  I hate fighting about the banks because, to be blunt about it, I have to deal with them an awful lot.  That is one of the reasons I do not like fighting about them but I realise the constraints that are on them.  From talking to the Central Bank, the whole system of lending at present is wrong because no chance is being taken on people who see an ability to do something.  Instead of bank managers deciding to take a chance with this man, woman or family and to back them, bank managers no longer have the autonomy to be able to say they have trust or faith in this person and cannot do that any more.  It has to be about filling up paperwork and sending it to Dublin and that it must be evaluated.</p> <p> Many is the time I have said I want to know who is evaluating my application.  I want to know who is dealing with it.  Who are this team?  The one thing you will never be told is that it is so and so and you can pick up the phone and talk to that person.  They are faceless, are hiding away in some office in Dublin and you will never get to speak to them whereas, to be fair, long ago there was a system in place whereby people togged themselves out as well as they could, looked as respectable as they could, faced the bank and met a person who was in charge.  People literally had to sell themselves and they either were good at it and got on all right or, if they made a bad hand of it, they might have to have another go.  They were relying, however, on a person they could look at and deal with but unfortunately that has now gone.  That is one of the reasons small businesses find it so difficult to survive.</p> <p> Not everybody is in the situation of having the big reputation, like the big conglomerates and so on, and can make an application for massive loans and be approved.  Sometimes, a loan of a few thousand euro would mean an awful lot.  That is why I have so much respect for the likes of the credit unions, which help families and small businesses by giving them loans to help them get to a better day or month and get them over a hump.  I know nobody in life who was involved in business who could say they had a great run, never had a problem, and everything always went right for them because that is not the real world.  This is especially so when you are self-employed because you will have a good day when you might do great and then you could have a bad week when everything could go wrong.  You could say to yourself that if you were doing nothing or anything else, you would be better off.  It is like the story of the person who gets up in the morning and works very hard but by the time he or she goes to bed at night, he or she might have done better by staying in bed all day.  People cannot do that.  They have to get up every day and fight, even if they are on the flat of their back to try to get over the day and do their day's trading.  It is difficult.</p> <p> Business is a lonely place at present.  The one thing I would like our businesspeople in this country to think, and our moms and dads with mom's purse on a Friday, is that the Government and the Opposition have their backs and that we understand the difficulties they have.  It is very easy to stand up in the Chamber to criticise the Government and say it does not have a clue.  I do not want to say that because each member of the Government has families.  They might have businesses and many of the difficulties everybody else have.  We have to work together as a team.  That is all I wanted to say. </p></speech>

We are running out of time.  The Minister of State has approximately six minutes to wrap up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-09a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="17:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110900054#GGG00300"><p>I will make sure to wrap it up.  If I run over time, I ask the Ceann Comhairle to tell me to finish up.  I will make a couple of comments.  I welcome all the contributions made last night and to date on this Bill and the support for what we are trying to achieve.</p> <p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae certainly got that message across.</p> <p> The Bill seeks to support businesses through a very difficult time.  By doing so, we support the jobs they create.  By supporting those jobs, we support the families involved.  There is a connection in that regard that is often missed in debates on supporting businesses or setting up a pro-business or pro-enterprise environment in this country.  It is really important we support businesses where we can because they are the ones creating the jobs and taking the risks and the ones that could, as was said, decide to stay at home if they wanted to do so and not contribute.  We are lucky to have so many businesses, many of which are SMEs.  There are a few hundred thousand SMEs creating over 1 million jobs throughout the country.  We are very lucky as a country to have 2.5 million people at work at a very difficult time right across the world.  It is something I will never take for granted, nor does the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, or the rest of our Department.  We are constantly trying to see how we can assist to drive the agenda of being pro-enterprise and pro-business and supporting businesses.  It is important we do that to help support those jobs.  It is just as important, as Deputy O'Reilly said yesterday, that they are good-quality jobs with good conditions and that the welfare of workers is looked after.  The majority of business owners do their best to look after their staff and want to do so.  There will always be a few we have to try to deal with, but the majority have their members' and their workers' interests at heart, and we need to allow for that and work on that.</p> <p> This initiative is about supporting businesses and jobs.  I recognise that the majority here spoke in favour of the Bill.  Many other issues outside the extent of the Bill were raised.  I will not go into the issues of fishing, farming and so on because I wish to focus my time on the Bill and what it is about, which is supporting businesses.  I recognise that the majority of contributors would say that many businesses do not want to borrow and do not want to be in that position.  We recognise that but, exactly as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, in some situations they have to borrow.  When that happens, certainly in times of crisis, and we had similar discussions here during Covid and Brexit, those businesses have to look at a combination of Government assistance through grants and supports, their own cash reserves they have built up, if they are lucky enough to have done so, and borrowing, if need be, to get through difficult periods in the running of their businesses.  We are in that situation yet again.  This credit guarantee is about making it cheaper to borrow that money and to de-risk it in order that those who are making the decisions will be more sympathetic to the businesses and take an approach that seeks more to give out the loans.  The State is guaranteeing this up to 80%, which reduces the need for the bank to be overly concerned.  Businesses will still need a proper credit rating - there is no doubt about that - but it is a matter of giving a chance to those businesses that are viable but need to get through a difficult time.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  We recognise that the majority support this.  We also recognise that this is not just about borrowing but that it will reduce the cost of borrowing and make it easier to access.</p> <p> As the Minister of State with responsibility for retail in this Department, I am glad we are bringing this Bill through.  It was part of the response in the budget that we said we would bring it forward.  It is an initiative that has worked extremely well on other occasions, including during Covid and Brexit.  It came first as a tool in the box back in 2012 or 2013.  That was a little late for the financial crisis but at that time would have been a great support to businesses.  I am glad it is an initiative we now have on our books that we can adjust and change, as we are doing here, at different times.</p> <p> Certain speakers gave the impression that small businesses cannot avail of this scheme or that it is for somebody else.  To be absolutely clear, 7,566 of the 9,800 loans were made to microbusinesses.  I am sorry the Deputy who raised this, a man from Tipperary, is not here.  It suits him not to be here for the facts.  While he is entitled to his opinion, he is certainly not entitled to his own facts.  The facts are the facts.  Those 7,566 micro-enterprises benefited from this scheme to the tune of just under &euro;1 billion.  The scheme is targeted at those small businesses that need such assistance during difficult times.  I encourage business owners to take the chance now to avail of schemes like this one when it is up and running in a few weeks' time and to see if this is an appropriate time to borrow money at low cost over a long number of years to get them through a difficult time.  It is a time to financially assess one's business.  While businesses may not want to borrow, it might make sense financially to do so now and to avail of these credit guarantees when they are in place because they will not be there for ever.  This one is due to end at the end of 2023 under the current EU framework, so it is an appropriate time for businesses to look at their situation, to make an assessment and to avail of these schemes if they think it will help their businesses.</p> <p> The scheme is similar to its predecessor, the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, the success of which I will outline.  The design of the scheme meets the European Commission's temporary crisis framework requirements.  It is a good opportunity for businesses in Ireland to gain strong levels of State support without any state aid implications.  It is hoped the scheme will be opened before Christmas with some of the banks.  Across the board there has been an open call for all lenders to avail of it, similar to the previous schemes with credit unions.  Non-traditional lenders got involved in that as well.  That will probably happen in the new year, so that should be widely available.  The lending institutes have been encouraged to use this scheme, backed by the State, to make money available.  That is what we are trying to do here.</p> <p> It is important to mention that Microfinance Ireland is involved in making loans available to small businesses and the startups for microbusinesses.  Very successfully, through legislation supported in this House, it has increased its ability to loan or reach more businesses and has done so during difficult times like Covid and Brexit and is in a position to do so again.  Generally, it makes loans of &euro;10,000 up to a maximum, I think, of &euro;50,000, but the majority will be around the &euro;25,000 mark.</p> <p> The main feature of this scheme is that it is a scheme for SMEs, primary producers or small mid-caps of up to 500 employees.  Previously, only about five would be mid-caps in that category, so it is generally SMEs.  They are the ones we expect to be the main beneficiaries.  Loans must be new loans and will be available to viable but vulnerable businesses which have been impacted by cost increases arising from Russia's aggression in Ukraine.  What is the cost increase businesses have to be able to show to qualify for the scheme?  The borrowers will have to declare that costs have increased by a minimum of 10% on their 2020 figures and that the loan is being sought specifically as a result of difficulties being experienced due to the crisis.  In reality, that will not be difficult for businesses to demonstrate because the majority of businesses are under pressure.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 1 provides for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make an order appointing a dissolution day for that purpose.  The amendment also provides that the advisory body will stand dissolved on that dissolution day.  On Committee Stage, I signalled the intentions of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in respect of this matter.</p> <p>The Bill provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  These heightened levels of accountability and transparency are commensurate with the level of Exchequer funding of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  However, as a consequence, there will be an overlap between the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Water Advisory Body with regard to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The Committee of Public Accounts is best placed to hold Uisce &Eacute;ireann to account and consider the transparency and accountability of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and its performance.</p> <p> Having regard to the role of other statutory agencies with regard to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, the removal of the Water Advisory Body will not give rise to any shortcoming in respect of transparency and accountability in the oversight of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The other statutory agencies - the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and An F&oacute;ram Uisce - will continue to have specific statutory functions with regard to Uisce &Eacute;ireann's performance.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities will continue to be statutorily responsible for ensuring Uisce &Eacute;ireann performs its functions in an open and transparent manner.  Both the commission and An F&oacute;ram Uisce have statutory functions relating to Uisce &Eacute;ireann's customers and the quality of service provided to them.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage will also continue to have a role in respect of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and reports or otherwise of the agencies tasked with its oversight and regulation.</p> <p> When the Water Advisory Body was established under the Water Services Act 2017, Irish Water was then not accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be subject to greater scrutiny following the enactment and commencement of this Bill.  The Water Advisory Body will cease to have the advisory and reporting functions on 1 January 2023.  This is because Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts on that date.  The Water Advisory Body will be given until 28 February 2023 to complete its annual report and quarterly reports for 2022.  The Water Advisory Body will then be dissolved.  </p></speech>

It is also made up of very different people, including environmental activists and people with expertise in water quality.  It seems very strange simply to dissolve the Water Advisory Body, so I will pose a few questions before I decide whether to push this to a vote.  What consultation took place with the Water Advisory Body in advance of the tabling of these amendments?  Did it make the case to the Minister of State that it should be retained in some shape or form?  Does the Minister of State at least accept that the function of the Committee of Public Accounts, particularly in terms of its role in bringing Accounting Officers in front of it versus the Water Advisory Board, is very different and that something could be lost as a result of simply abolishing it rather than changing the relationship between the body and the Water Advisory Body?</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned NGOs' participation.  Again, we are talking about advisory in terms of oversight by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the EPA and now the Committee of Public Accounts, which is directly accountable to the Oireachtas.  In terms of consultation, the Department has engaged with the Water Advisory Body on its dissolution and the body highlighted the need for the Committee of Public Accounts to engage actively and regularly with the relevant statutory agency - to challenge Uisce &Eacute;ireann to perform at the level expected and to hold it to account appropriately.  Given the debate this afternoon across the House where Deputies have been asking about Irish Water and its accountability, the Committee of Public Accounts has a wide remit in terms of expenditure, delivery and value for money - all of those elements that are really important for what we have been discussing.</p>  <p>  We are of the view that it is the correct thing to do.  The Water Advisory Body also noted that it has tended to have a technical focus as opposed to An F&oacute;ram Uisce, which is much broader in terms of water issues.  We all agree it needs to have a more customer centred focus.  This can be offered through the direct accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are satisfied its dissolution is the right thing to do and not to have duplication in terms of accountability.  Direct accountability to us as Members of the Oireachtas is something we have all been seeking for quite a while in respect of Irish Water.</p></speech>

I think we all support that.  It is a very good thing.  For all the criticisms many of us have of Irish Water, it has also made itself available to our committee regularly and in very detailed form.  That is not the question I am asking.  The makeup of the Water Advisory Body is very different.  It includes a range of people.  If the Minister of State has decided on this course of action, how does he propose that those people, organisations and interests that will no longer be part of any of the accountability architecture alongside Uisce &Eacute;ireann now engage with this process?  This is not an either-or - one or the other.  I am nervous we are losing something valuable.  Has there been any discussion about whether they have some other mechanism to participate in an ongoing structured consultation as opposed to individual consultations?</p></speech>

Given the oversight not just of the Committee of Public Accounts but also the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, there is an opportunity to bring a body to that forum for wider discussion on the efficacy, function and programme of works of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  We are confident this is the correct thing to do.  Consultation has taken place and we are satisfied this is the best way forward in terms of accountability to the public, value for money, public expenditure and the myriad of issues raised by Deputies around the water policy debate.</p></speech>

A typographical error is also corrected.  Amendment No. 2 provides that reference to the Act of 2017 means the Water Services Act 2017.  Amendment No. 3 provides that &quot;dissolution day&quot; means the day appointed under section 27.  Amendment No. 4 inserts a definition of the Water Advisory Body.  Amendment No. 10 corrects a typographical error.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 provide for the fourth paragraph (d) to be added to the list of amendments made to the Water Services Act 2007 by section 27 of the Bill.  The new amendment deletes paragraph (d) of section 16 of the 2007 Act.  This is the provision under which the grant may be paid to the Water Advisory Body by the Minister.  As the Water Advisory Body is being dissolved, it will have no requirement for such a grant.  Amendment No. 15 deletes section 29 of the Bill.  This section had sought to amend section 44 of the Water Services Act 2017, which concerns the functions of the Water Advisory Body.  Due to the dissolution of the Water Advisory Body, section 44 of the 2017 Act is being repealed by amendment No. 5 and so the amending provisions of section 29 of this Bill are no longer necessary.</p></speech>

This amendment removes those functions by repealing the specific provisions of the 2017 Act.  Section 44(1) of the 2017 Act is about the Water Advisory Body advising &quot;the Minister on the measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water for the purpose of increasing the confidence of members of the public in Irish Water&quot;.  This section is also about the Water Advisory Body providing quarterly reports to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the performance by Irish Water in the implementation of its business plan.  Amendment No. 5 repeals this section of the Water Services Act 2017.  Section 53 of 2017 Act is about the Water Advisory Body's annual report and its laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are no annual accounts of the Water Advisory Body.  It is funded through the Vote of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and this Department is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the Water Advisory Body's expenditure.</p><p>The purpose of subhead B9 of this Vote is to fund the Water Advisory Body's secretariat, overhead and administration costs, members' fees and expenses, as well as any consultancies undertaken by the body.  Amendment No. 5 repeals this section of the Water Services Act 2017.  The other section of this Act relating to the establishment and functions of the Water Advisory Body are also being repealed by this amendment.  These are sections 42 and 43, which contain provisions relating to the establishment of the body; section 44, which details arrangements for the work of the body; sections 45 to 49, inclusive, which outline the membership of the body, including the chairperson and the terms of membership and office; sections 50 and 51, which are about the body's meetings and procedures and matters relating to such meetings; and section 52, which is about the provision of grants to the body, as well as administrative arrangements.</p></speech>

The body will cease to have advisory and reporting functions on 1 January 2023, when Uisce &Eacute;ireann becomes accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts on that date.  It is appropriate, however, from a governance and transparency perspective, that the Water Advisory Body complete its work regarding 2022 while it is statutorily in existence.  It is necessary to give the body time to complete its outstanding reports, so these administrative tasks will be facilitated prior to the formal dissolution of the body.  </p><p>This amendment provides that the Water Advisory Body will complete its final 2022 quarterly report on the performance of Irish Water in the implementation of its business plan and submit this to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as provided for in section 44(1) of the Water Services Act 2017.  The amendment also provides that the body will complete the final 2022 annual report and submit this to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as provided for in section 53(1) of the Water Services Act 2017.

As the Minister of State knows, we have been making a strong case for the Government to provide more information on its intention regarding holding a referendum to enshrine public ownership of the water system in the Constitution.  The Minister of State outlined his position a few hours ago and will do so again now to say that he is dependent on the outcome of the report of the Commission on Housing and whether it recommends enshrining the right to housing in the Constitution, and then on whether the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, brings forward a proposal to Cabinet to hold two referendums next year, namely, one on water and one on housing.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is on record as saying he wants to do this and we take him at his word.  Our problem is that we know that Fine Gael currently does not support such a proposition.  We know this from our discussions at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage concerning these referendums and other public comments.</p><p>The logic of these amendments therefore is to ensure that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is not able to disappear into the wilderness on foot of the Commission on Housing's report in November and avoid responding.  It is reasonable, therefore, whether in the context of the one month Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has suggested or the two months contained in my amendment, that there is a requirement in this legislation that the Minister lays before the House a report on precisely this issue.  I suspect the Minister of State is not going to support this amendment, but we are going to press it.</p><p>The trade unions that represent water services' workers, Unite, F&oacute;rsa, SIPTU and others, recently launched what I thought was a good initiative.  Historically, we have had many divisions and battles over water in the political process and the trade union movement, but now all the unions have united and made a simple call for the Government to name the date for the referendum.  Having a requirement in this legislation for such a report within the restricted time limit we have outlined will help to build this momentum and make it a little bit more difficult for some of the participants in the Government who are less willing to proceed with something I think is hugely important.  </p><p>Why is this important?  It is important because one of the biggest public movements in recent history in this State was the Right2Water campaign.  Its central premise was that people should have access to water based on need and not on ability to pay.  This is one of the primary reasons that we are one of the only EU member states with zero water poverty.  There is always the concern, though, that a Government, whether this one or one in the future, would jeopardise this record and seek to privatise water services.  Having public ownership of water services enshrined in the Constitution is the strongest and best way to prevent this from happening.  This is, therefore, an important amendment and I look forward to the response from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Turning to my amendment No. 9, fundamentally there is nothing to stop the Government from setting a date for a referendum on this issue now.  It could be done and should be done.  This has been talked about for years.  We need the Government to finally get off the fence on this issue and to name and set a date.  If the Government were to do this, then we could then start to move forward on this topic.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin said this or a future Government could end up trying to privatise our water services if this right is not enshrined in the Constitution.  As I said before, there is always the risk that if things go bad economically we could end up in some sort of Troika situation again where bodies external to Ireland could, as a condition of providing loans, finance or anything else, stipulate that one requirement was the privatisation of water services.  If the right to water is enshrined in the Constitution, then this possibility would be off the table.  It could not happen and could not be done.  It would not be possible to argue with the Constitution and what is in it.  This is, therefore, the best possible way of safeguarding our water resources.  I refer to drinking water and wastewater servicers, which are so key to everything in our lives.  I urge the Government to name a date in this regard as quickly as possible so we can get on with this process.</p></speech>

There are 3,000 water workers in this State.  The feeling runs strong among them that a date must be set for a referendum.  I welcome that the four trade unions with membership among the water workers are now campaigning for a date for the referendum to be named in respect of keeping water services public.</p>  <p>  I also make the point that it would be important that a date for a referendum be set before the end of this year, because 1 January 2023 is the date for the transfer of water assets from the local authorities to Irish Water-Uisce &Eacute;ireann and for local authority water workers to transfer over to that organisation as well.  A large body of rank-and-file water workers are of the opinion that there is not going to be a successful transfer on 1 January 2023 unless a referendum date has been named by then.</p> <p>Pressure and sentiment are building on that issue.</p> <p> Reports were published in the press some weeks ago saying that the Minister intends to bring a proposal to Cabinet early in the new year in this regard.  The T&aacute;naiste has been directly quoted as saying that he is not convinced of the need for such a referendum.  I have heard bits and pieces from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies on this issue.  I have heard less from Green Party Deputies.  I would be interested to know what is the position of the Green Party and its Deputies on this issue, if the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, would care to tell the House and to inform the public.  Either way, pressure will only grow on this issue.</p> <p> It is important that a date be named before the year's end.</p></speech>

Not that I have fundamental hang-ups about referendums.  I have a strong conviction that the men and women and local authority officials who have looked after water so well in all weathers and in the face of all challenges over the decades need to be respected and treated well.  I do not know if naming a date for the referendum will do anything to help their cause of not transferring by consent by 1 January 2023.  That is going apace and there is much unease and unhappiness.</p>  <p>  It is scandalous, as far as I am concerned, that people joined the local authority in good faith, many of them joined other sections as general operatives or whatever, and transferred into water services, they gained valuable experience as caretakers, plumbers, electricians and chemists and in many other aspects of it and now, all of a sudden, they are being bullied into a job that they did not apply for and did not work for.  Would the Minister of State blame them for being afraid to transfer, even if the conditions were right, into Irish Water when the model is so unsound looking?  In previous amendments, one had the Minister of State setting up advisory councils and everything else.  It is more jobs for the boys and not being responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts until such time as they have everything r&eacute;idh.  They are long enough there now to have their house in order.</p>  <p>  I want to maintain our water in public ownership.  I also want, if the Ceann Comhairle would allow me, to mention the people - the Ceann Comhairle himself will know many of them - who set up and formed group schemes.  They are still operating those group schemes, with the cost of the electricity, chlorination plants etc. now on them.  They are getting very few supports.  What rights do they have?  What of people who have their own pumps and wells, and the people who are only getting it from a stream who have no water supply and no hope of getting a supply?  We are forgetting about them and we can have referendums.</p>  <p>  Much of the other legislation that we have here is grand, but it is irrelevant to many people.  There are tens of thousands of people who have their own wells.  They have their own septic tanks for wastewater and there are only approximately 20 inspections in each county annually.  One cannot get the so-called "great" grant to upgrade them unless one is inspected.  It is another trick of the loop.  Then we have the public sewerage schemes in many villages and towns in my county belching into the river causing pollutants and the EPA turned a blind eye on the authorities.  I am all for clean water and all for fair play.  Fair play is fine play with me.  We must respect those workers in the service and the service their former colleagues have given as well and that must be written in.</p>  <p>  As we are on amendments on a referendum, is there any possibility of a plebiscite for Tipperary to ask the people are they happy to allow their water to be pumped all the way from Tipperary right up through the country?</p></speech>

I have nothing against the people in Dublin, in case someone would think I have, but there is 50% of the water leaking in Dublin.  When it leaks out, when there are outages and everything else, obviously, other commodities leak back in.  Some of them are very unsavoury.  I have a bit of experience in this work and I know what I am talking about.  It is not very nice.  I am shocked at the Green Party having put this project to bed because of the runaway costs there will be and because of the damage it will do to the environment to bring that massive construction right through the length of the country.  It will be of no benefit to any of the areas that it is passing through that have water shortages and outages.  There are plenty of sources around Dublin.  There are wells, supplies, under supplies and everything, for instance, Poulaphouca, if they are looked after properly.  Ghana was able to repair the leaks in its capital city and we cannot do so.

Before I do, I will address some of the points raised by the Deputies in terms of the referendum.</p>  <p>  I share the concerns of Deputy Mattie McGrath in terms of the Shannon project but that is not being addressed here today.  From an ecological perspective, I would have concerns about it.  In terms of Government support for the referendum, it is absolute.  My own party's support for a water referendum is absolute as well.</p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised around local authority staff and other issues.  I pay tribute, as I did earlier, to the federation of group water schemes.  I thank Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Gould and Cian O'Callaghan for their proposed amendments which require that the Minister report on the proposed wording for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure, the timeline for the referendum and other key considerations.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 7 proposes that the Minister lays a report before the Oireachtas committee within two months of the passing of the Act.  Amendment No. 9 gives the Minister one month to lay the report.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan proposed a similar amendment which gave the Minister six months after the passing of the Act to provide the report on the wording and the timeline of such a referendum.  This amendment was rejected by the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, I cannot accept these two amendments as they do not come within the scope of this Bill.  As the Deputies will be aware, this is a technical Bill to separate Uisce &Eacute;ireann from its parent company, Ervia.  I can, however, advise Deputies that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, expects to be a position to bring forward definitive proposals on a referendum on water ownership for consideration by Government in the near future.</p>  <p>  The Government's vision for a world-class public water system in Ireland based on the full integration of water services in a national water services authority is set out in the policy paper on water sector transformation published in February 2021.  Public ownership is central to the vision and is already legally guaranteed.  No change to State ownership of Irish Water is currently possible without majority support in a plebiscite of the people in line with the Water Services Act 2014.</p>  <p>  In the context of engagement at the Workplace Relations Commission on a framework for the future delivery of water services, the Department hosted parallel engagement with unions on policy matters of relevance to workers, including a referendum on water ownership.  A paper, entitled Irish Water Transformation: The Wider Policy Context, was shared with unions on 18 July 2022.  This paper reflects the engagement outcomes and is available to Members in the Oireachtas Library.  This paper sets out the planned approach to bring forward a referendum proposal on water ownership for consideration by Government in conjunction with the anticipated recommendation of a proposed referendum on housing from the housing commission.</p>  <p>  We cannot be clearer that the commitment is there.  It is there in writing in the Irish Water Transformation policy document.  It is there from Government.  We are giving that commitment that a referendum will take place on water and housing.</p>  <p>  On the concerns raised by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan around what happened in other countries on structural adjustment programmes, that is not the case here.  Even as it is, there is no possibility of changing the State ownership of Irish Water without a plebiscite.</p>  <p>  I give those assurances to Members.</p></speech>

The legislation will support the concert hall's effort to return the orchestra to full strength and further empower it to deliver on the recommendations outlined in the Boaden report.

Under section 69, employees, advisers and consultants are indemnified by PIAB against all actions or claims, however they arise, in respect of the discharge by that person of those functions.  Mediators may be employees of the board or appointed from a panel of mediators.  Mediators appointed from such a panel are not members of the staff of the board and, therefore, an additional reference is required to provide indemnity for such individuals.  This follows the approach already taken in section 168 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  This indemnity will only be provided where the board is satisfied they have undertaken their work in an appropriate manner and in good faith.</p></speech>

Deputy Shanahan was particularly keen that we introduce a review provision in the Bill.  I note he has his own amendment which he will move shortly.  Having engaged with the Deputies and the Office of the Attorney General on the matter, I have decided that a review mechanism, considering the new provisions introduced by the Bill, as proposed by Deputy Shanahan, is appropriate.  This amendment introduces a new section 22 which provides for a ministerial review of the new provisions contained in the Bill 18 months following its commencement.</p><p>Section 22 also provides for the laying of a report on the review before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months of the review being commenced.  In conducting the review, section 22 provides that the board and other appropriate persons shall be consulted.  The text of the amendment is based on recent provisions contained in section 4 of the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Act 2019 and is appropriate to the new functions provided to the board by the Bill.</p></speech>

Of course there is nobody here to see it, but it is one example of when we work together we work very well and can get stuff done.  I do not have any amendments to this section.  Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are grouped.  They are not massively dissimilar.  That does not mean I oppose the Minister of State's amendment; rather, I feel Deputy Shanahan's amendment is stronger.  I am minded to support it and abstain on the Minister of State's amendment.  It is not my intention to oppose it.</p>  <p>  I would be interested in hearing from the Minister of State why it is the case that what is essentially the stronger amendment of the two is the one that is not accepted by him.  We all are agreed on the need for review.  The question is what we will review, for how long and who is going to do it.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the section in Deputy Shanahan's amendment which would compel the Minister of State or the T&aacute;naiste, as the senior Minister, to act on any review or report with amendments to the legislation.  I need to know why the Minister of State would not support Deputy Shanahan's amendment.  The two amendments seem broadly similar.</p></speech>

To be fair, the former Minister of State, Deputy Troy, also engaged on this.  Deputy O'Reilly and I are members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the subject came up in the pre-legislative scrutiny work of the committee.  Insurance reform has been a long-running saga in Ireland, to say the least.  As I said to the Minister of State and T&aacute;naiste in the committee, I seem to remember a Fine Gael Minister in Wexford who came and went trying to deliver insurance reform.  It was not possible.</p>  <p>  We implemented PIAB in 2003, to a lot of fanfare, and I believe people expected significant things from it in terms of reform.  It was supposed to streamline the process and try to reduce costs on the award side, as well as the cost of claims and legal fees.  For a while, it seemed as if it was going to have some success but unfortunately, over a period of time, a march came along and, as the Minister of State is aware, the majority of cases are not now going to PIAB and are instead going towards the direction of the courts or are being settled out of court.</p> <p>We then had the appointment of a judicial review council to try to arrive at a better foundation for the claims outlook to try to get a fair book of quantum, especially in mind of how most of insurance is underwritten from the UK and elsewhere.  Our book of quantum is completely out of whack with theirs.  All of this was done as part of the ongoing PIAB legislation.  We now have a book of quantum that is agreed, and we have judicial guidelines around that.  It has still not happened but we hope to see the Law Society taking stronger notice of those guidelines.</p> <p> The amendment I have proposed to the Minister of State was quite clearly prefaced on the basis of having a recurring review procedure to ensure that all facets of the PIAB and personal injuries resolution board, PIRB, legislation will work as designed and we see whether we are making progress on the areas on which we need to make progress.  I was looking at the legal services legislation of 2015 in which there was an in-built review procedure.  It essentially asked that the Minister of State would do a review within 12 months and no later than 18 months of the initial enactment.  It also asked that the Minister of State would provide a periodic review and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas every three years further that.  Any resulting recommendations could be brought in amendments to try to change the founding legislation.  That was the reason.</p> <p> As I read the Minister of State's proposed amendment, I do not see how we can get back to the founding legislation.  His amendment only speaks only to the latest legislation.  That is a misstep.  I accept the Minister of State's bona fides when he says he will leave no stone unturned and will make sure that he will look at this in detail.  However, I would prefer to see something in the legislation that speaks to that.  I accept he has agreed to a review and I am sure that was not easy with regard to where the Department wished to be.  It may be very onerous on the Department.  He has committed to a review and maybe we can still get something done if he is prepared to accept some periodic review procedure.  It is needed, first and foremost, for transparency.</p> <p> I was interested in listening to a recent radio debate about insurance.  We have a very difficult insurance market as the Minister is well aware.  A significant number of underwriters and players have left the market.  In order to try to entice new competition into the sector, which is what we all wish to see, we must have better transparency as to where the payout and claims situation will land.  I understand the Minister of State is working on the duty-of-care and occupiers' liability insurance legislation.  Liability insurance, as the Minister of State will be aware, has risen by almost 50% for many businesses this year.  Businesses who have not made any claims have suddenly seen an increase of 50% in their insurance.</p> <p> The problem is largely that we have many latent claims still lying around but there is no security in the insurance sphere.  We have had a reduction in motor insurance which is to be welcomed but we have had a dramatic rise in liability insurance at the same time.  The difficultly I see is that when the Minister of State brings in the duty-of-care legislation, we will probably be bound up in this process again, but we will not have a review process beyond this one look-back.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to outline what more he can give.  I do not want to use the word "guarantees" because that is not fair, but I ask what his office can give.  He may not be the one to occupy that chair in the future.  Maybe somebody else will.  How can we bind the Department to a meaningful review of this legislation once enacted to try to give us the look-back and understand the legislation is working as required?  That will clearly mean that more cases will go through PIAB.</p> <p> Whether they go through PIAB or the courts, the sum of the awards are nearly the same but the legal fees are dramatically different.  I looked at table earlier today which showed that cases in PIAB were being settled for &euro;1,018 whereas they were costing &euro;23,000 in legal fees through the courts.  That makes no sense and it is damaging credibility and is absolutely hurting businesses and policyholders.  We have to get to a point of insurance reform in which people can believe.</p> <p> The Minister of State and I spoke earlier.  He outlined his position, which, I accept, is difficult, but I ask him to highlight what kind of guarantees he can give that we will have a robust process with regard to this review.  If the review brings something up, what is the legislative procedure to bring further amendments?  How does he see that happening?  It would be a help if he were able to highlight that.</p></speech>

I also appreciate both Deputies remarks on the work we did on this.</p>  <p>  Deputy Shanahan's amendment is based on the provisions contained within the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  The PIAB was established in 2004 and has been making assessments for more than 18 years.  The legislation under which it was established has been reviewed several times since enactment.  We have had amending legislation twice since I entered this House, in 2007 and, most recently, in 2019.  The legislation has not been static.  It has been reviewed even without a formal review clause.</p>  <p>  The Bill is the result of a thorough examination of the legislation and the operation of the board.  It included extensive engagement with stakeholders.  While I was not the Minister of State at the time - Deputy Troy was - the pre-legislative scrutiny was especially helpful.  It has led us to introduce this new function for the board through mediation.  We all agree that a review of these new powers of mediation is appropriate.  I am concerned that a statutory requirement for a constant rolling review of the legislation, which is what is envisaged in Deputy Shanahan's amendment, will result in a certain element of paralysis within the system in which there are constant reviews and people are constantly preparing for or responding to a review.  I wish to see whether the mediation will work.  I wish that the mediation be given the space to work and that the PIRB be given the time and space to make mediation work.  We all hope that mediation will result in a much better outcome for those going into it.  I wish that the board be given that.</p>  <p>  The statutory provisions with regard to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority require the body to review itself and the operation of its own Act and make recommendations to the Minister, having done the review.  The amendment I have tabled on behalf of the Government proposes that the Minister of the day will undertake the review rather than having the PIRB reviewing itself.  The Minister of the day is answerable to the House.  I do not know who will be here, but he or she will be more answerable to the House than the PIRB.</p></speech>

We differ on that, but I accept that is his position.  With regard to the commitment he has given within the amendment to engage with stakeholders, is there something that could be written within that to ensure that the Minister of the day and the Department will engage with umbrella groups or representative groups of stakeholders?  I worry about who will be speaking to the policyholders.  It is very important in that if we are talking about insurance reform, we are talking about try to reduce costs.  There is no point in talking to other people about the process if we are not talking to those who are paying the costs and bills and supporting the activity.</p>  <p>  The review the Minister of State proposes will be undertaken by the Minister of the day.  I can see how that would probably make sense but the question is as to whether it will be done through an external appointed body.  Is the plan be to appoint some external review process or will it be done in-house as a report the Minister will present to the House?  There are obvious difficulties with that.  We do not wish to go back to second guess legislation or reform but that is exactly what we should be doing to be quite frank.  Considerable legislation is passed in this House for which we should have some kind of a look-back facility.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State said it is possible for Members to bring forward a Bill or a Private Member's motion, but it would be far easier if the process were set in the context of the enactment of the legislation.  I have spoken to the Minister of State a number of times on this matter.  I thank him for that engagement.</p> <p>It has been positive but the proof is going to be in the pudding.  The Minister of State has committed to a review.  It cannot be comprehensive and wide-ranging enough.  I would like to see recommendations resulting from it as well that might make their way back into the House at a future point.</p></speech>

That is a good thing.  However, there seem to be some mechanisms of that which still have to be worked out, including how it is going to happen and when.  We all know the power we have to compel a Minister.  It is small when one is in opposition, and the Minister of State knows this.  We can reserve the right be in a bad mood about it but if we do not have the numbers there is nothing we can do about it, so the Minister of State should not be pretending we are getting something we are not getting.  Having said that, he might elaborate on how he sees this working.  Perhaps there might be some element of that as part of the Seanad debate that could be recorded as well to give people comfort that at the very least, there will be a halfway house between the rigorous review proposed by Deputy Shanahan and the one proposed by the Minister of State.  I do not suggest the Minister of State's proposal is not rigorous but perhaps there could be some kind of halfway house that could be discussed between now and the Bill making its way to the Seanad.  I think we are all agreed this should go through.  People are waiting on it, we want to see it, it is progressive etc.  Perhaps there is an opportunity there.</p></speech>

It is deliberately not prescriptive because in a couple of years' time, there could be relevant persons who do not exist now, but it puts a requirement on the Minister to consult people in this space.  If there is one certainty it is that the officials or their successors will be there when we are not and they have done huge consultation and shown great co-operative spirit in trying to make this work.  That will continue within the Department.</p>  <p>  My reading of Deputy Shanahan's amendment is that it is a rolling review rather than a periodic one.  That speaks to my concern that this would be constantly under review and that we will not get the space to get the function up and running.  My review is targeted at the mediation side of things because as I said, since 2004 we have had two separate items of legislation, in 2007 and 2019, updating the whole thing and this will be third Bill related to the PIAB.  We have not left it there.  We are watching it.  We are not throwing it out there and going away.  It will be under constant scrutiny.  The review process as laid out in the Government amendment provides for consultation that must be done within a given time period.</p></speech>

The amendment provides the new mediation function may be commenced separately for different classes of claim.  This models how the original Act was commenced in 2004.  The Second Stage debate stressed the importance of a properly-operated mediation function.  Providing that mediation may be commenced in a staggered manner will allow the board to manage the introduction of mediation in a careful and considered way.  Providing the board with additional functions to increase the number of claims settled through its process will increase the number of claims that are settled faster and, as Deputy Shanahan referred to, at less cost than other settlement channels.  This in turn should have a knock-on effect on the cost of insurance.  I will speak to that at the end of the process.</p><p>I again thank Deputies for their engagement to date.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the huge work Deputy Troy put into this legislation.  He engaged in a lot of consultation previous to this.  I thank Deputies O'Reilly and Shanahan, who have been especially engaged with this.  I also thank the committee and Senator Mullen as we proceed to the Seanad.  I thank the officials involved who are present, John Maher and Anne Barrett, as well as the team in the Department, who are continuing to put extraordinary into this.</p>  <p>  I wish this function every success.  We all have a stake in it being successful and I wish the team at the PIAB every success.  We are doing a lot of heavy lifting in this House on insurance.  We are working across parties here and also at Government level.  The work we are doing should be resulting not just in reduced motor premiums but reduced premiums on employers and on public liability.  A message needs to go from this House to the insurance industry that we are doing heavy lifting for it and it is time it passed on the benefit to customers.  The public can be assured we will continue to sit on the insurers until they pass on the benefits of this legislation to customers.</p></speech>
