A Deputy has 30 seconds to introduce the question and the Minister has two minutes to respond.  Then there is an initial supplementary question of one minute's duration, to which the Minister has one minute to respond, and a final supplementary question and a final opportunity for the Minister to respond.  I am very anxious we stick to the timeframe.  I will let Members know when the time is up in order that we can proceed to have as many questions as possible answered in the Chamber.</p></speech>

Last June the Minister directed that there be a review of the way in which rape trials are conducted in this State.  He sought this review in the aftermath of a very prominent trial that took place in Northern Ireland.  He made the good decision to select Dr. Tom O'Malley to conduct the review.  Has the review been completed, where is it and when will it be published?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900003#A00600"><p>The review is at an advanced stage and nearing completion.  It is vitally important that victims of sexual assault feel able to report matters to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is equally important that complainants in sexual assault cases are spared any unnecessary distress in the investigation and prosecution of such offences and cases.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Callaghan noted, a review of protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences is well under way.  The review will examine the entire legal process surrounding sexual offences, from the initial reporting of an offence through to the end of any court proceedings.  The review concerns in particular the treatment of complainants and vulnerable witnesses throughout this process.</p>  <p>  Terms of reference for the review have been published.  The review is examining the adequacy of the mechanisms available in law and in practice to protect vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, including access to specialist training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the Judiciary and legal professionals dealing with sexual offences; practical supports for vulnerable witnesses; the provision of additional legal supports to witnesses during court processes; measures in place to protect vulnerable witnesses during evidence; and restrictions on attendance by members of the public at, and media reporting on, trials of sexual offences.</p>  <p>  The working group is having regard to research published in this area, submissions from victims' organisations, representatives of which I have met, and individuals and will carry out consultations with relevant stakeholders, including the legal professional bodies.</p>  <p>  The impetus for this review arose from a round of consultations I had with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in April of this year.  I met representatives of NGOs, including Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, One in Four and the National Women's Council of Ireland and I acknowledge their submissions and their assistance on this matter.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is the case that some damage has been done to public confidence in these very important prosecutions.  The Government needs to concentrate on a number of specific areas.  First, we in this House and the Seanad introduced a new definition of "consent" last year.  This needs to be further advanced in order that the public be made aware of it.  Second, we in Fianna F&aacute;il put forward in legislation the proposal that we should have a system whereby when complainants make complaints, they are given some support by way of a solicitor funded by the State and available through the auspices of, say, the local rape crisis centre, which could advise them as to what will be involved in making that complaint and in the trial process.  Very many complainants find the process harrowing.  Obviously, any criminal trial will be an adversarial process and will be difficult for individuals, but we can provide greater levels of support.  I ask the Minister to consider this in the review.</p></speech>

I am very keen to listen to what all Deputies have to say on this important issue because it is essential we have appropriate legal protections available to complainants.  I acknowledge again the work, assistance, guidance and leadership of many of the non-governmental organisations on these important issues and thank them for their input.  It is expected that the working group, or the review group, to which Deputy O'Callaghan referred earlier, will provide me with a final report early next year.  I do not wish in any way to pre-empt the outcome of the review but I look forward to its recommendations and would be happy to share its contents at a very early date with Members of the House and perhaps the justice committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900003#A01100"><p>There are certain steps the Government can take that would make it easier for complainants.  For instance, the Minister was recently on television with Leona O'Callaghan, a complainant and a victim of serious rape who deserves to be commended on coming out and speaking publicly about it.  What she said was the most harrowing aspect of her time before the courts was the length of time it took for her case to come before the courts.  She said it took four years.  The State can deal with this factor.  We can speed up the process of the investigation and indeed the prosecution of these offences.</p><p>We can better resource the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions so that files can be considered and decisions can be made more promptly.  A complainant, and indeed an accused, should not have to wait for a number of years before a decision is made as to whether or not there will be a prosecution.  A trial is a difficult process.  We have to try to make it easier for complainants while not interfering with the fact that there is a presumption of innocence and that an individual can only be convicted of a criminal offence if it is proven beyond all reasonable doubt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00200"><p>I am concerned about the specific issue of delay and the time lapse from the date upon which a complaint is initially reported to the matter appearing in court.  This is an issue that is being looked at by the review group, and I do not wish to pre-empt its findings, but I want to acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in the manner in which victims are treated within the criminal justice system.  The improvements include the facilities in place for victims in courts.  It is absolutely essential to ensure that those people, women and vulnerable witnesses in particular, who have a complaint to make have confidence in the system and that they get the distinct feeling that the system and the State is very much on their side.  I acknowledge the importance of the standard courthouse design guide which improves facilities for complainants and vulnerable witnesses.  I also acknowledge the protections available through the Legal Aid Board, for example, which provides advice and guidance to vulnerable witnesses.  I look forward to further engagement, when we will have more time to discuss these important issue.</p></speech>

I will take this opportunity to condemn entirely the quite disgraceful arson attack that took place in Moville.  Having said that, while the issue is in the public domain and is being discussed, it is my view that direct provision is a deeply flawed and broken model.  It effectively warehouses those seeking asylum in this country for prolonged periods of time.  It is neither sustainable, efficient, affordable nor humane, and it is time for the Government to move beyond that model, end direct provision and take an alternative approach.  I will elaborate on that, and am happy to engage on the issue.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00600"><p>Since 2015, this Government has transformed the system known as direct provision and will continue with this programme of reform.  At a time of serious pressure in the accommodation market it is important to note that any person who presents himself or herself seeking international protection will immediately be offered shelter and a range of supports.  Since Ireland opted into the EU's recast reception conditions directive, this has all been placed on a statutory footing ensuring such services are provided as of right.</p><p>The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years.  These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres.  As a result of this initiative, over 1,500 residents in five centres has now moved to the independent living model.  In parallel with the delivery of these changes, a number of other accommodation centres are providing self-catering facilities with fresh food provided by either the contractor or the residents themselves.  In total over 2,900 residents in the centres are no longer under the direct provision model as originally set-up, and further progress will be made in this area.</p><p>In addition, there have been significant improvements to recreation opportunities, such as the provision of outdoor sports pitches, including all-weather facilities, as well as the introduction of teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.  Friends of the centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.</p><p>Following the McMahon report, a standards advisory group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of that report and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State.  The standards will meet the standards set out in the recast reception conditions directive and the European Asylum Support Office, EASO, guidance on reception conditions.  Operational standards and indicators will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process.  They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the public sector equality and human rights duty.  A working document has recently issued for widespread consultation.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The decision to opt-in to the directive is a significant and positive measure, not only in addressing the matter of labour market access, but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision.  In addition, any complaints about accommodation and related matters can be made to the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children as appropriate. </p><p>We have already introduced far-reaching and important reforms to the overall system and this process will continue as we strive to make further improvements in the future.  The nature of international protection is that it is demand led and accordingly the State must provide sufficient accommodation to meet that demand.  This process is underway with the aim of meeting both short and medium term requirements.</p><p>I have previously indicated that Ireland, unlike most other European countries, has no NGO run centre.  I take this opportunity to reiterate to civil society, including to approved housing bodies, that we would welcome an expression of interest from them to offer to provide such reception facilities.  My officials have begun to explore with civil society what might be possible in this regard.</p><p>With regard to recent events, the Minister and I have already condemned in the strongest possible terms the recent arson attack in Moville.  There is no place in a civilised society for that type of behaviour and it does not represent the views of the vast majority of decent people who recognise the need to offer assistance and welcome for those in need of international protection.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00800"><p>While I acknowledge movement on certain issues including the right to work, although I am of the view that it is not entirely perfect, there are still very significant issues.  Direct provision is a model that has been criticised roundly by NGOs and the public at large as being far from fit for purpose, particularly for families.  I fear that in future years we will hear many stories about it and will look back upon this episode with great regret.  We also have to confront the fact that it is very bad value for money.  This substandard and inhumane accommodation has cost the taxpayer &euro;1.25 billion since 2001.  To house a parent with two children costs the State &euro;40,000 per year in direct provision.  Would it not be not only far preferable from a human rights perspective to locate those seeking asylum in directly provided accommodation rather than by contract through the private sector?  This could be done through a non-profit housing association.  People could have own-door accommodation rather than dormitory-style accommodation.  They could then be encouraged, when they are able, to seek their own accommodation, and be provided with the means to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00900"><p>It is completely unacceptable that the Members are continually breaching the rules they themselves have set.  I am not specifically referring to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  It is happening all the time.  Time is being wasted and people who are waiting to have their questions answered are missing out.  I am asking every side to adhere to the times allocated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B01000"><p>I have previously indicated that Ireland, unlike most other European countries, has no NGO-run centre.  I take this opportunity to reiterate to civil society, including approved housing bodies and others, that I would welcome any expression of interest from that cohort that would offer to provide reception and housing facilities.  There is no blockage there.  Officials have begun to explore with civil society organisations what might be possible in this area.  A value for money and policy review was carried out in May 2010 on the whole issue of a reception and integration agency and an accommodation programme and it was found that it provides the best value for money.  It was a really comprehensive study, and I invite the Deputy to read it, if he has not already read it, and perhaps he would come back to me with his views on it.  It found that: "[alternative] options would be significantly more expensive than direct provision and concluded that the use of direct provision has proven to be the correct choice in providing for the accommodation needs of asylum seekers."  That study was carried out in 2010.</p>  <p>  On the suggestion that there could be a State building programme, it should be noted that over the longer term the number of asylum seekers has varied widely, from as few as 1,200 in the 2000s to 1,500 in other years.  Any system of accommodation must be flexible to cater for wide variations in demand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B01100"><p>In the long run the value for money aspect would change substantially because the property or asset would be permanent rather than something that is constantly renewed and paid for.  Tendering does not suit that kind of process.  The State should intervene directly and seek to provide permanent accommodation.  Acting in conjunction with NGOs or housing associations should be an option on the table.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that communities that have been identified as locations for direct provision centres have been very welcoming, and that is very positive.  However, some of the challenges faced by residents of those communities should be identified.  Moville is ten hours, travelling through the six counties, which is not allowable, from Dublin.  Kenmare is probably an overnight trip.  It is possible to travel to Lisdoonvarna in one day, involving a very short period of time in Dublin.  Mount Trenchard does not even have public bus access.  People have to be in Dublin for interviews, appeal hearings and renewals of certificates.  This is not an acceptable situation.  As much as possible should be brought to the direct provision centres, but the Department should also directly provide transport for the residents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B01200"><p>We are very much aware of the issue of transport to Dublin.  With that in mind, my Department has agreed with a contractor to arrange overnight accommodation and comfort breaks for those travelling to Dublin from the accommodation centre in Sligo.  We will also source overnight accommodation in Dublin if required.  I have also requested that the Department examines the logistical and resource implications of business being carried out at the remote centres.</p><p>It would mean that rather than asylum seekers having to travel to Dublin, officials would travel to the centres.  The Deputy is right in that regard.  </p> <p> I join with the Deputy in condemning in the strongest terms the recent arson attack in Moville.  There is no place in civil society for that type of behaviour.  It does not represent, as he rightly said, the views of the vast majority of decent people who recognise the need to offer assistance and support to those seeking international protection.  </p> <p> I draw the Deputy's attention to the value for money report that examined the direct provision system.  It found it was not up to speed with respect to value for money.  The Value for Money and Policy Review of the Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme was a comprehensive and impressive report carried out by the RIA in 2010.  </p></speech>

One day of the week garda&iacute; can be asked to investigate issues pertaining to financial crime.  On other occasions, they can be asked to investigate issues concerning child or sexual abuse.  I will ask the Minister about the latter group.  It was announced recently specialist groups in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be rolled out to deal with vulnerable witnesses.  What is the status of that roll-out?  When will they be up and running?</p></reply>

The setting up by the Garda Commissioner of the divisional protective services units is one of the actions outlined in the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The strategy, in accordance with programme for Government commitments is a whole-of-government approach, involving seven Departments and a number of State bodies, including Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>A key element of the strategy was the recent enactment of the Domestic Violence Bill 2018.  Under the existing Garda reform programme,<i></i>divisional units of the Garda national protective services bureau are being rolled out across the country in two phases.  The bureau and its divisional units are tasked with improving services to victims, improving the investigation of sexual and domestic violence incidents and identifying and managing risk.  Phase 1 of the roll-out has been completed with divisional units established and working in three areas, Dublin metropolitan region west, Cork city and Louth.</p><p>I strongly welcome the important statement by Commissioner Harris this week at the launch of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre annual report on his commitment to the continued roll-out of the divisional protective services units.  I am confident that under his leadership and stewardship, there will be rapid progress in the delivery of these important units.</p><p>Following an evaluation of the pilot, the next phase will see an additional six divisional bureaus established in Dublin metropolitan region south central, Waterford, Kerry, Kilkenny-Carlow, Limerick and Galway before the end of 2018 with the objective of extending them to all remaining Garda divisions before the end of 2019.  </p></speech>

I welcomed what he said.  He gave a commitment that there would be a roll-out of the divisional protective service units in all 29 Garda divisions.  It is important to note that taking evidence or a statement from a victim of child abuse or a complainant in a rape or sexual abuse case is a complicated matter that requires expertise, sensitivity and training.  That is why I very much welcome the establishment of these units.  Unfortunately, there have been reports in recent weeks that garda&iacute; are being told they cannot take part in specialist courses due to budgetary constraints.  That is of severe concern to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also to the victims of such crimes and complainants who wish to come before the court.  Will the Minister give us assurance that funding will be provided and that it will be ring-fenced for these vital units?</p></speech>

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that all Garda personnel receive training in the investigation of incidents considered to be domestic abuse in all its forms with additional training provided to garda&iacute; who have been selected for duties as detectives.  Further and more specific training has been developed by the director of training with the senior management team at the Garda national protective services bureau for training to be provided to personnel selected for duty within the divisional protective services units where the roll out has taken place.  This has commenced in the three divisions I mentioned in Louth, cork city and Dublin metropolitan region west.  I am keen to have all the Garda divisions involved in the process by the end of next year.  I acknowledge the importance of the recommendations in the recently published report by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, placing an emphasis on the need to support victims of crime and the need for the garda&iacute; to have an appropriate level of training.</p></speech>

It is a difficulty and problem that exists within the force.  We keep making laws in this House and in the Seanad, which make the law more complicated.  Garda&iacute; have to investigate any breaches of the law.  It needs to ensured that they are adequately trained to deal with legitimate complainants who come forward using those laws.  That is why it is so important to ensure funding is ring-fenced for these units.  I welcome that the units will be rolled out in the 29 Garda divisions but I am also conscious of what has been said by members of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, who stated they need to ensure there is a proper professional national training plan to deal with front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not appropriate to put a young garda who is not adequately trained before complainants in such cases.</p></speech>

I acknowledge an increase of 8% in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote in the recent budget.  There is &euro;1.7 billion available to the Garda Commissioner to engage in the type of activity he believes is important to ensure the issues raised are dealt with.  I am informed that all Garda personnel receive training in the matter of domestic abuse.  I acknowledge the importance of the pilot areas.  Induction training has been provided for personnel in these units.  A briefing is being provided to all appropriate State agencies beyond the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The training referred to by the Deputy includes specific training in the investigation of sexual crime, online child exploitation, domestic abuse, human trafficking, children in care who are reported missing and sex offender management.  I look forward to ensuring that all divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the appropriate units within the timeframe envisaged, which is 12 months from now.</p></speech>

Under the programme, the Government committed to accept up to 4,000 people, mostly Syrian, into the State through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism, established by two Council of the European Union decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme, which is focused on resettling refugees from Lebanon.</p>  <p>  Ireland agreed to opt in to Council of the European Union decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1601 which allocated the number of asylum seekers that was to be relocated to each member state participating in these decisions.</p><p>Ireland agreed to accept 2,622 persons under these decisions.  As it was not possible to operationalise the commitment in respect of Italy, which numbered 600 persons, the Government agreed to increase the number of refugees it would accept under the resettlement programme.  This includes Syrian refugees who had been given temporary asylum in Lebanon.<br/><br/>We committed to accept 1,040 programme refugees under the resettlement strand of the programme.  A total of 928 people have arrived, 875 of whom are Syrian, and 113 people will arrive in mid-December 2018.  My officials are working with the relevant international bodies to ensure that refugees selected during a mission to Lebanon in June 2018 will arrive soon thereafter.<br/><br/>The Government has pledged to take a further 945 programme refugees from Lebanon or Jordan by the end of 2019.A further mission to select 231 refugees was carried out in Lebanon in October 2018.  This mission completed our pledge to the EU for 2018.  Two further missions to select 600 persons will take place in 2019.<br/><br/>Ireland's EU relocation programme concluded in March 2018.  Overall, 1,022 people, 959 of them Syrian, arrived safely from Greece and work continues on sourcing housing in communities throughout Ireland. <br/><br/>As of 27 November, 287 Syrians, including Irish-born children, were living in emergency response and orientation centres. <br/><br/>A key step in the integration of refugees is moving them to permanent housing.  The Deputy will appreciate that housing falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I will set out the general processes that apply in the Irish resettlement model.<br/><br/><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i><br/><br/>The Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP, which falls under the ambit of the office for the promotion of migrant integration, OPMI, within my Department has a co-ordinating role in respect of all matters related to the settlement of refugees.<br/><br/>Resettlement in communities is co-ordinated by Inter-Agency Working Groups, chaired by the relevant local authority and with members from relevant agencies such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Education and Welfare Service, the education and training board and the IRPP.  Once a family is resettled in a community, an implementing partner procured by the local authority provides appropriate services for a period of twelve to eighteen months.  The standard model is now focussed on an eighteen month period.  The implementing partner plays a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through their expertise in community integration and relevant supports.  The funding for the implementing partner is provided by the IRPP and the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), both managed under the auspices of my Department.<br/><br/>The implementation of the programme requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities are represented on the national task force which oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is co-ordinated overall by the IRPP, but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity. <br/><br/>A total of 1486 Syrians have been housed throughout the country and are accommodated in local authority housing across 18 counties.<br/><br/>Overall, 1690 refugees - Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi - have been housed by local authorities and the Irish Red Cross under the programme.  This figure includes Irish born children. In terms of all refugees who have arrived under this programme almost 85 per cent of persons have been housed.<br/><br/>The Irish Red Cross is also managing an aspect of the programme to secure accommodation pledged by members of the public.  This is largely being deployed to meet the needs of single persons, as few accommodation options exist within the local authority sector for this cohort.  To date the Red Cross have sourced accommodation for 96 beneficiaries in 11 counties.</p></speech>

That is a welcome initiative.</p>  <p>  Is the stream of refugees we were due to take from Italy closed off now?  Is that finished?  I do not know whether the Minister of State is in contact with his colleagues from Italy and elsewhere.  Given the political situation in Italy, it is interesting that the country with perhaps the most difficult political issue with migration and refugees at the moment seems to be the one that has failed to relocate refugees.</p>  <p>  Second, how we integrate refugees once they are here is critical.  There is concern about the numbers in emergency accommodation and, while we have a housing crisis, it is critically important that in the processing of people, once they come here, they are not held in long-term hotel or other emergency accommodation and are settled in houses.</p>  <p>  What is the Minister of State's expected timeline in that?  Even in broad figures, rather than going down to the minutiae of numbers, when does he think there will be 4,000 refugees here?  How long will it take to get them housed?</p></speech>

We tried hard but were not successful in doing that, although we wanted to.</p><p>A total of 1,486 Syrians have been housed throughout the country and are accommodated in local authority housing across 18 counties.</p><p>Overall, 1,690 Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi refugees have been housed by local authorities and the Irish Red Cross under the programme<i>.  </i>This figure includes Irish born children.

Communities are welcoming Syrian refugees throughout the country and that is of benefit.</p><p>We also have made significant funding available.  I do not have the time to go into that detail now, but I can provide it to the Deputy if he so wishes later.</p></speech>

Within those figures, over the next five years, it would be good to see the levels of language ability and whether there has been success in bringing the level of understanding and use of English up.  It would be interesting to see figures on the level of work and assimilation into the education system.  There is an urgency for us to get that right.  T&uacute;s maith leath an oibre.  We need to start on the right foot in getting children and adults into education quickly, getting people into work as quickly as we can, and getting people out of emergency accommodation and into housing to ensure they integrate well.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Minister keeps his attention, focus and, if necessary, budget on these matters because we need to get this right for the confidence of our people, for the respect of those who are coming, and for other people who may come in the future, so we learn how to do this well.</p></speech>

I visited Donegal last week and met some Syrian families there.  Children are going to school, and parents are learning English and working and so on.  A lot is happening.</p>  <p>  We also mobilised EU funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund to provide supports, through local authorities, to refugees.  Local authorities play a critical role in ensuring the successful integration of refugees through the provision of housing and implementation of a process carried out by the implementing partner, with expertise in community integration and relevant supports.  This programme of implementation of integration requires a high level of co-ordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Departments, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities are represented on the national task force that oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is co-ordinated overall by the IRPP but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is important we get integration right and I thank him for his support on this.  We are working hard on that, with the various bodies, and there is support given for up to 18 months to the refugees to help them integrate and it is working well.</p></speech>

She has long been a voice against cruelty and neglect and has debated the subject on a number of occasions in the House and at committee.  It is also appropriate that I pay tribute to the important role played by animal welfare charities such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, who are at the forefront of animal welfare in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While the particular Acts highlighted by the Deputy fall under the auspices of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have made inquiries with the Garda authorities to see how many times these Acts have been invoked by garda&iacute; in the course of their duties and I am advised that the specific information requested by her is not recorded on PULSE. </p>  <p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides a modern and robust framework for dealing with issues relating to animal welfare.  It also updated and replaced approximately 40 items of primary legislation in the area of animal welfare and health back going back more than 100 years. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Control of Horses Act 1996 provides powers to local authorities to deal with stray and abandoned horses and for the designation by each local authority, by way of by-laws, of areas in which horses cannot be kept without a licence.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been assigned powers commensurate with those of authorised officers under the legislation. </p>  <p>  In this context, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na liaises and works closely with both local authorities and the local offices of the ISPCA.  All complaints of cruelty to animals made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are subject to investigation, with an investigation file submitted to the DPP who will then decide if a prosecution should take place, and for what offence.</p></reply>

I find it difficult to understand that, if garda&iacute; are involved, incidents are not recorded on PULSE.</p>  <p>  Abuse of animals is, sadly, a reality in Ireland.  Whether we are talking about hares, greyhounds, horses, badgers, foxes or puppy farms, that is the reality.  I am continually told that we have the legislation - the Animal Welfare Acts and the Control of Horses Act - as if they were covering and sorting everything.  Those Acts are only as good as the extent of the implementation and enforcement.</p><p>We know it is not happening for whatever reason.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in a previous reply stated that it is the responsibility of individuals to ensure the welfare of their animals, including horses.  That is quite right, but I am asking about circumstances where owners do not take responsibility.  There was a protest outside Leinster House.  All of the horse welfare groups came together.  We have seen cases of starving animals, cases of animals whose illnesses are left unattended, and cases in which large numbers of animals have been kept in confined spaces.  It is the animal welfare groups that are picking up the pieces.  Surely the Garda could be more proactive in checking on microchipping and registering.</p></speech>

As stated, many of the issues involved here are more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I say that in the context of my wish to ensure that any issues particular to the Department of Justice and Equality or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are dealt with.  I acknowledge the importance of the specific training provided to garda&iacute; in Templemore.  In addition, I am advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that there have been five training seminars held to familiarise Garda officers and officials of that Department with the application of the Act.  The programme is ongoing.  Further seminars are planned.  I would be happy to keep the Deputy informed in that regard.</p></speech>

The Clondalkin Equine Club does great work and yet, at this time last year, there was an horrific case of cruelty to horses outside Clonmel.  The carcasses of seven dead horses were found and the remaining animals had been left without food, water and so on.  Notice was given for the owners to contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There has been no contact made and, to my knowledge, nobody has been prosecuted for that horrible case of animal cruelty.  The legislation is there but it is not always enforced.  Garda&iacute; - and I know the community garda&iacute; in my area - are very much informed of what is happening.  They will know about these situations.  It is when they know about them that they will use whatever powers they have to progress matters.  For whatever reason, they are sometimes not doing that.  It would be good to have more facts about this situation because we know it is happening and people are getting away with it.</p></speech>

I acknowledged earlier that the specific information sought by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is not recorded on PULSE.  However, the Garda authorities advise that PULSE incident types classified as control of horses and offences against animals, which from a search of a narratives appear to relate to incidents of animal neglect and cruelty, do exist.  As of last Sunday, there had been 351 incidents involving control of horses and 152 incidents of offences against animals recorded on the PULSE system this year alone.  I understand these incident types also include incidents of illegal hunting and incidents in which animals stray onto public roads.  I stress to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that these figures from the Garda are provisional and may be subject to change.  I would be happy to engage further with the Deputy to see how best her concerns might be addressed in the context of my role as Minister for Justice and Equality and my relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Until recently, we thankfully did not have substantive problems with drug-related crime or drug-related issues.  Unfortunately, that has changed in recent times.  Communities throughout Cavan and Monaghan have serious concerns regarding the use, misuse, prevalence and availability of drugs in every parish.  Unfortunately, it is my understanding that is the position in all rural areas.  Additional resources are needed.  The Garda is working extremely well and as effectively as possible with limited resources.  I would hope the Minister would be in a position to enhance those resources.</p></reply>

He may also wish to be aware of work under way in the context of the Government's national drugs and alcohol strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.</p></speech>

He referred to a person who is found in possession of drugs worth &euro;13,000 or more and the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  From reports I have heard and from what I have read, there always seems to be mitigating circumstances.  How often are those sentences actually handed down?  In many instances we hear that a given person in a community, who is known to possess and sell drugs, has been before the courts again and is out again and not in prison.  I understand that we cannot questions decisions made in courts but there is concern among communities that sentences are not severe enough.  The Minister mentioned the severity of sentences in his response.  The widespread narrative is that in many instances the penalties do not meet the crime being committed, the pain and suffering inflicted, and the innocent lives destroyed by these peddlers of drugs.</p></speech>

I want to refer to the effectiveness of the minimum mandatory sentence for drug offences to which the Deputy refers.  While acknowledging, as Deputy Brendan Smith does, the separation of powers and that the matter of sentencing is an issue for the courts, I want to acknowledge the work recently carried out by the group established to undertake a strategic review of penal policy.  That group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  That group was of the view that the continuation of existing presumptive minimum sentences and the threshold for their application in drugs and other offences should be reviewed in the context of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  This recommendation was made with a view towards determining if the type of sentencing to which the Deputy refers satisfies the need for proportionality in sentencing and fulfils the objective of reducing crime.</p><p>This merits further consideration by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality because it is an important issue that is giving rise to community concerns, as evidenced by Deputy Brendan Smith's question.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by people from previously quiet communities who have never had cause to approach me or any other public representative in their lives.  They are now utterly frustrated with the prevalence of drugs and the horror being caused by the ready availability of certain drugs.  We have discussed previously in this House the unique policing requirements of the part of Border region comprising Cavan and Monaghan.  I am not suggesting that the drugs in Cavan and Monaghan are solely coming from Northern Ireland.  Far from it; they are coming from all over this State too.  That said, in his discussions with the Garda Commissioner on the allocation of resources for 2019, I appeal to the Minister to ask that particular cognisance be given to the need to provide additional resources to Border divisions.  I attended a joint policing committee meeting in Ballyconnell on Monday night last and the issue of drugs, their availability and the problems besetting communities as a result was discussed.  Widespread concern was expressed and the chief superintendent and his colleagues outlined the work being done, but they need additional resources.  I ask the Minister to ensure that due recognition is given to the unique policing demands in the Border region.</p></speech>

The review to which I referred earlier on the principle underpinning mandatory sentencing is still under consideration by my Department.  On completion of that consideration, I would be happy to share the contents of the review with Deputies and, more particularly, the justice committee.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of Garda resources..  That said, the Deputy makes a reasonable point regarding areas that present particular challenges.  A number of very significant seizures have been made in recent times by the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau in conjunction with the Revenue's custom services.  At Dublin Airport, 15 kg of heroin with an estimated street value in excess of &euro;2 million were seized.  Another consignment of drugs with an estimated value of &euro;4.6 million was intercepted at Rosslare Europort.  At my regular meetings with Garda management, I am happy to continue to voice the concerns of Deputies and, in this case, those of Deputy Brendan Smith regarding the Cavan and Monaghan area.  I assure the Deputy of the active engagement of the appropriate units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p></speech>

In north Dublin recently, a farmer approached a number of people who were on his land.  Those people subsequently viciously attacked him and he sustained serious injuries.  One of the issues raised by the Irish Farmer's Association, IFA, is the fact that if farmers identify people trespassing on their land, they cannot avail of the criminal law.  Under the law, what can farmers do if they find people on their land and want them to leave?</p></reply>

I acknowledge the interest of various farm and rural organisations, particularly the IFA, in this issue.  I meet regularly with representatives of the IFA in my constituency of Laois-Offaly.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended, contains provisions specifically relating to the unauthorised entry onto and occupation of land, including farmland.  Part IIA of that Act, comprising sections 19A to 19H, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides for offences relating to illegal trespass and occupation of land which result in a range of specified adverse consequences.  Such land includes privately-owned land and public land provided or maintained by a statutory body.  The legislation empowers An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to direct trespassers to leave the land concerned and, if necessary, remove any object belonging to them from the occupied land.  A person who is guilty of an offence under this Part of the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;4,000 or a term of imprisonment, or both.</p>  <p>  The Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act 1971 also contains provisions relating to trespass.  Under this Act it is an offence to forcibly enter land, including buildings, or remain in forcible occupation, or to encourage or advocate the commission of such an offence.  The word "forcibly" is defined as using or threatening to use force in respect of persons or property, and such action is not necessarily linked to any other crime.  A person found guilty under the Act is liable to a fine, a term of imprisonment or both.</p>  <p>  There are already significant legislative provisions and penalties in place relating to trespass and I have no immediate plans to change the law in this regard.  I am anxious to hear what Deputy O'Callaghan proposes in this regard.</p></speech>

Farmers find that when people trespass on their land, they have no remedy in the criminal law.  When they contact members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are told that officers can only intervene if there is a threat to commit a criminal offence or if criminal damage has been done.  In my constituency or that of any Dublin Deputy, if I found someone in my back garden, I would call the Garda immediately.  I suspect that garda&iacute; would regard that person as having sought to enter my house and would arrest him or her on suspicion of intending to burgle my house.  However, a different law appears to apply to people who are on farmland.  It is not enough for the Minister to state that trespass is a civil offence.  Everyone knows that trespass is a civil offence.  What is required is for the legislative measures that the Minister has stated exist to be put into operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is not happening and farmers find that if someone is on their land, they are left helpless vis-&agrave;-vis the criminal law.</p></speech>

I have already referenced relevant statutes and would add that trespass in respect of buildings is also dealt with in section 11 of the Public Order Act 1994 .  Section 13 of that Act refers to the offence of trespassing "without reasonable excuse" on a building or in the vicinity of a building in such a manner as to cause fear in another person.  There is a suite of legislation available in this area but I am keen to hear more from Deputy O'Callaghan and would be amenable to a review of the law this area if I thought it might point to a more immediate remedy, as envisaged by the Deputy.  I would add that the aforementioned Public Order Act empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request a person to desist from acting in such a manner as to amount to a breach of the peace.</p></speech>

They want there to be consequences for people for being on their land.  There may be a civil remedy available but that requires farmers to institute proceedings against unknown individuals who then have to be brought before the courts.  Farmers have to apply for injunctions before a civil court restraining those persons from coming back onto their land.  That is a very complex and detailed process.  Farmers require greater protection than that being afforded to them at present.  Their legitimate concern is that people are coming onto their property to see if there is any valuable equipment on it and with a view to returning subsequently to try to obtain that equipment.  This is something that the Minister, as a rural Deputy, will know is happening and other rural Deputies in this House tell me that it is happening frequently.  There may be trespass-related provisions on the Statute Book but, unfortunately, they are not being used by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they are not effective for farmers.</p></speech>

I would be happy to speak to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to ensure these issues are kept under review.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that rural crime in general is a key focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there is a relentless pursuit on the part of the force of those responsible for crime in rural areas.

I have requested the Courts Service to examine the requirements, including system development and resource issues, needed to enable the compilation of such statistics going forward.</p>  <p>  However, she will also be aware that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Health, is the competent authority for the implementation of EU and national legislation relating to medicines in Ireland.  One of the HPRA's roles is to investigate potential breaches of legislation and, where necessary, take corrective action, including legal proceedings.  My officials have been informed by the Department of Health that the HPRA initiated ten prosecutions relating to the unauthorised supply of anabolic steroid containing medicines between 2014 and 2017.  Of those, seven resulted in a guilty plea or a conviction; two in 2017 and five in 2018, and the remaining three cases are pending court hearings.</p>  <p>  The prosecutions have included the offences of manufacturing, advertising and supply without prescription to individuals and for wholesale supply.  If any person is offering, facilitating the supply of, or supplying anabolic steroid containing medicines in breach of the legislation, he or she risks investigation at the hands of the HPRA and may face enforcement actions up to and including prosecution.</p></speech>

We are attempting to get a clear picture on the issue from all Departments because, as the Minister pointed out, the issue does not only concern one Department.</p>  <p>  The HPRA seized 450,000 doses of anabolic steroids in 2017 in comparison to just 109,000 in 2016.  That would indicate that there is an increase in the use of such drugs.  I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of a condition known as muscle dysmorphia.  It is where a person becomes obsessively focused on not being muscular enough and it affects more men than women.  It is an issue we should tackle.  We are all having conversations about how men behave but we must also consider how men view themselves and what can be done in that regard.  Our interest is to ascertain if there is an increase in such drug usage and to try to understand the reason.</p></speech>

I would be happy to engage further as needs be.  My officials have been informed by the Department of Health that in 2017 the HPRA, working in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue's customs service, detained almost 500,000 anabolic steroid dosage units in tablets and capsules form, compared to a little more than 100,000 units detained in 2016.

I acknowledge the importance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, established in 2015, which is leading the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies, and is working in conjunction with divisional drug units across the country.</p>  <p>  From a criminal justice perspective, this works fits neatly into the actions on the part of my colleague, the Minister for Health, on the Department of Health strategy, reducing harm, supporting recovery and the new public information campaign to raise awareness of the serious side effects and the risk to health of using unprescribed anabolic steroids.  The campaign was announced in recent weeks.  Between the HPRA and the public information campaign by the Minister for Health, on the one hand, and the deterrent factor involved in the criminal justice approach of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise this important matter.</p></speech>

He was the first to raise the matter and he never loses an opportunity to raise what is an important issue to him and to many other Deputies, as well as to me.</p><p>The illegal use of quad bikes and scramblers gives rise to public safety concerns affecting a significant number of local communities.</p><p> I have asked my officials to convene cross-agency consultations to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which can assist in dealing with the misuse of these vehicles comprehensively.  It is important we determine responsibility and timeframes for the implementation of solutions identified.  This process began in April and involved the Departments of Justice and Equality, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.  The misuse of scramblers in public parks was a particular point of focus for these consultations.</p> <p> Following this engagement, legislation was brought to the attention of the Office of the Attorney General to determine whether any legislative amendments were necessary to assist in curbing activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned without giving rise to any unintended consequences.  My Department has now received formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  The advice is comprehensive in nature and is now being carefully considered by my officials, together with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the context of its responsibility for road traffic legislation.  It will be necessary to consult again with other relevant Departments and public bodies via the cross-agency forum established by my Department.  A further meeting will take place this week.</p></speech>

When I met Councillor Charlie O'Connor, a former Deputy and a colleague of Deputy Lahart, recently, he told me of the issues people are facing in Kingswood, Tallaght.  I also spoke with another colleague, Councillor Paul McAuliffe, who informed me of the same issue in Ballymun.  This is not, first and foremost, a problem particular to any one area.  It is widespread across Dublin and, I suspect, other parts of the country.  Often in the debate, my concern is that we only talk about our parks and open places but it is also happening on public roads and in private housing estates.  Elderly people are afraid to go out of their houses when these quads and scramblers are on the roads.  Parents are afraid let their children out.  During the summer, we had a tragic case in one park where a person was hit.  Much of the focus has been on this activity in parks but it is equally a nuisance and a danger to people in housing estates.</p></speech>

I extend my sympathies to his wife, Anzhela Kotsinian, and to their families.  That tragic incident all too sadly highlights how the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes can cause real damage to people, their families and communities.</p>  <p>  I am committed to actively supporting any positive action in respect of this matter.  I have received legal advice from the Attorney General and I am committing it to some study.  I have been informed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that it is also engaged in seeing how best we can deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  The use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by local authorities under the 2011 parks and open spaces by-laws.  Insofar as national parks are concerned, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has legislative powers to prohibit the unauthorised use of off-road vehicles in them.  There is a cross-departmental remit.  I am keen to liaise with Deputies Curran and Lahart, as well as Councillor Charlie O&rsquo;Connor, on this matter.  It is complex but that should not mean that it is not urgent and important.</p></speech>

Quad bikes and scramblers are dangerous and a nuisance and their use is illegal.  I regularly attend joint policing committee meetings where the Garda has clearly indicated that the crux of the problem is that it cannot enforce road traffic laws.  Garda&iacute; are not physically in a position to stop quads and scramblers.  Whether on the roads or in the parks, the same physical challenges are there.  It is both dangerous for garda&iacute; and those on the quads and scramblers.</p>  <p>  We need to look at the issue in a different way.  For example, we need to look at the regulations and legislation concerning the registration and ownership of these vehicles.  We also must look at how these vehicles can be seized after an event on intelligence led information.  In cases where the Garda and people in an estate know who are using these vehicles, we must ensure follow-up operations can take place without jeopardising and putting at risk the life and safety of either garda&iacute; or those who are illegally using them.</p></speech>

That would be only one of a number affected by the use of quad bikes and scramblers, however.  In Killinarden, one resident described 99% of the open space designated for public use in that estate being destroyed by 1% of the local community.</p>  <p>  An issue arose during the snow earlier in the year.  I refer to the incident at Lidl in Jobstown.  The Garda in Tallaght has only one four-by-four vehicle.  If a garda rocks up in a Ford Focus to deal with somebody on a scrambler or a quad bike, he or she simply has no capacity to catch that individual.  There is a resource issue involved too.</p>  <p>  I welcome the information the Minister supplied regarding a cross-departmental approach and local authorities being involved.  There needs to be a promotion of available space for people to engage in scrambling.  Both our constituencies are close to the Dublin Mountains where there are opportunities for legal scrambling and the legal use of these vehicles.  Local young people should be encouraged to move in that direction.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his continued interest in this issue.</p></speech>

In any event, the Acting Chairman will not let me.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the importance of the cross-departmental and cross-agency group.  In the lead-up to Christmas, people will be buying quad bikes and scramblers as presents.  These are mechanically propelled vehicles within the meaning of road traffic legislation.  As such, irrespective of the engine capacity, the user of a scrambler motorbike, a quad bike or a vehicle of a similar type in a public place must have motor tax, an insurance policy and a driving licence and must wear a helmet.  There are severe penalties under the road traffic laws, such as fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizures of the vehicles.  The Garda will make every effort to ensure that the existing law is firmly complied with.  In the meantime, the cross-departmental group will meet this week with a view towards dealing with this issue in an overall comprehensive way which will involve several agencies and Departments.  I am happy to keep the House further informed about this matter.</p></speech>

When joint committee's report on the general scheme was laid before the Houses in November 2013, the matter was with the Office of the Attorney General for consideration and drafting until late 2017.  At that point, my Department and I sought the Government's permission to review the draft legislation to take into account technological and other changes that had occurred in the interim.</p><p>The Government duly granted permission to review the 2013 general scheme by way of decision of 10 January 2018, aimed at establishing an independent regulatory authority for the gambling industry in Ireland.</p> <p> To advance the review of the 2013 general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill, per the Government decision of 10 January 2018, I chaired an interdepartmental working group on gambling, comprising all stakeholder Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.  The group met on five occasions between February and June of this year and reviewed all the provisions of the 2013 Scheme as well as other relevant developments since.  Further, the group in its deliberations had regard to the Government's preference for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority.  It is the Government's view that an independent body would be best placed to conduct the significant and complex range of licensing, regulatory, monitoring, inspection and enforcement tasks of the industry in all its manifestations.  The group is currently finalising its report which I hope to bring to Government for consideration as soon as possible.</p> <p> I would also like to take the opportunity to update the Deputy on the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill, which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is based on Part 13 of the Civil Law and Courts (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 approved for publication by the Government.  The amendments proposed under this Bill address certain deficiencies with regard to the conduct of activities regulated under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, and provide for the modernisation of that Act by way of, among other matters, updating stake and prize limits and standardising the minimum gambling and betting age to 18.  Further, it is intended that this Bill will provide greater clarity and certainty for all promoters and participants involved, primarily in local fundraising efforts, and to ensure the best conduct in the promotion of such activities.  It is hoped this Bill will be published before the end of the current Oireachtas session.</p></reply>

As I said in the opening question, it was in 2011 that the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, announced plans to change the law on gambling.  In 2013, the Department of Justice and Equality published the general scheme of a Gambling Control Bill which was expected to update the 1956 legislation.  Since the publication of that general scheme in 2013, there has been extremely limited progress.  We engaged on this matter and were hoping the Government would bring forward legislation but such was its delay that earlier this year Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward its own legislation based on the general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill.  My colleagues, Deputies Jack Chambers and Rabbitte, were instrumental in that.  We produced the legislation and I think it got through Second Stage in this House.  It is now the responsibility of the Government to ensure that Bill gets through or its own legislation is promptly produced.  We have waited too long and we need adequate answers.</p></speech>

We have established a working group which is reviewing the main provisions of the 2013 Gambling Control Bill.  In this regard, the group gave particular attention to considering the optimum structure of the proposed regulatory authority having regard to the decision on this by Government on 10 January 2018.  The group considered governance and logistical practicalities of the establishment of the proposed regulator.  Other issues considered by the group included the future licensing of gambling activities, including gaming, arcades, lotteries and casinos, combatting possible money laundering through gambling, improved protection for consumers and vulnerable persons, the approach to be taken to advertising sponsorship and the promotion of gambling activities and match fixing.</p>  <p>  The working group will inform the redrafting of the general scheme and assist in the achievement of the objectives of betting regulation, the channelling of all gambling in legitimate ways, enhancing consumer protection and increasing the protection of vulnerable persons.</p>  <p>  The Government did not oppose the Private Members' Bill.  It was very useful to have that Bill and to debate the issues.  As I noted during the Second Stage debate, it is a reproduction, as the Deputy said, in its entirety of the general scheme of the Bill approved by Government and published in 2013.  The Private Members' Bill, surprisingly, made no mention of the significant decision of Government in January 2018 to update the 2013 scheme and to produce independent statutory regulation.</p></speech>

It approved the proposal to establish an independent regulatory authority, which we support, for control and regulation of the gambling industry.  We are told that this interdepartmental working group has met on five occasions since January 2018.  What progress has been made on this?  Where is the draft legislation?  The Government and Fine Gael have been talking about this since 2011, which is seven years ago.  It is hard to understand why it is taking so long for a Government Bill to be introduced in this House.  The current situation is untenable and unfair.  It is not simply unfair to people who are in the business of gambling who need to be properly regulated and many of them recognise that.  It is especially unfair, however, on the very many victims and their families of gambling addiction throughout this country.  We cannot say we empathise with those people until we regulate the gambling business.</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Callaghan said, the first Bill was brought forward by the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, more than seven years ago now.  The scale of the harm that gambling can do has been laid bare before the public in recent times.  In many instances, it has devastated families and individuals.  There is a clear need for action.  Ireland is recognised as a jurisdiction that is practically the wild west in terms of lack of regulation.  Previous Ministers and the Department in previous iterations recognised that lack of regulation and the need for legislation, and yet it has not progressed.  There is a wide consensus in society, even within the industry but most of all among families devastated by problem gambling, that this needs to be dealt with.  Gambling is something can have a place, provided it is properly regulated.  However, that is not the case now and unless we legislate, people will continue to have free rein.</p></speech>

I am also frustrated at the lack of progress.  We had five meetings, which I chaired.  They were long detailed meetings and I was struck by the complexity and how far this area has developed in the last number of years.  There were some very serious people around the table representing almost all Government Departments and agencies concerned with this issue.  I have seen a draft copy of the report and it is quite detailed, long and involved.</p>  <p>  While regulation is important and desirable and we will have it, it must be stressed that no amount of regulation can act as a panacea for problem gambling and gambling addiction.  Even in a well-regulated jurisdictions, such as Britain, 0.8% of the population aged over 16 identified as problem gamblers in 2015.  This underlines the fact that problem gambling and gambling addiction are ultimately public health issues.  It is important colleagues understand that regulation will only go so far in assisting problem gambling and that addiction is a health issue.</p></speech>

As the Minister will know, many community groups want to put them in place.  In Laois and Offaly, communities located close to the motorway are affected by crime due to their proximity to it.  Community groups have raised money voluntarily.  Grants are available to erect CCTV, which are very welcome, but, unfortunately, they cannot be drawn down because of the problem of who controls the data.  Is it the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or is it the local authority?  It came up at the last joint policing committee in Laois and I was asked to raise it with the Minister in the D&aacute;il, which I am doing this morning.</p></reply>

The legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must conform to three conditions, namely, be approved by the local joint policing committee, JPC, and I acknowledge Deputy Stanley's attendance at a recent JPC in my constituency from which I received a report; have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, which I understand is forthcoming in most cases on the basis of local advice; and have the support of the relevant local authority, which must under law act as data controller.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their being set up.  In accordance with this legal framework, I understand the majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes.  This is the case in the current grant aid scheme, as administered by my Department, and in the previous grant aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities across the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to know, as confirmed by the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s office as recently as May of this year, that the Data Protection Commissioner does not have any concerns about the legislative basis for CCTV.</p><p>However, the office is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV.  We expect findings from this process to be of assistance to all concerned and, in particular, to local authorities.   My Department is engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association to clarify queries regarding the scheme and to offer assistance to resolve concerns. </p> <p> To date, there have been 27 applications to the scheme.  Twenty applications have been approved for grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further four applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered.</p></speech>

Stephen was going about his daily job and was tragically killed as he sat in a parked car on Main Street in Castleblayney.  He was a family man, only 47 years of age in the prime of his life, and it was a life that was being very well lived.  His wife, two children and family and the Border community are this morning reeling, their lives ripped asunder.  He was the assistant sacristan in his local church and was described as the go-to man for many in his community.  The tribute earlier on "Morning Ireland" from his local canon reflected that.</p>  <p>  The clips we saw on RT&Eacute; and on all media last night from CCTV in Castleblayney on Tuesday evening are like something from the movies, except they are very real for the family and the community.  After crashing into Stephen's parked car at high speed, the driver then drove on and crashed into a pole.  He has since been detained.  It seems that earlier this same person arrived at Castleblayney Garda station, was recognised by a garda who had previously had dealings with him and who then tried to stop this person leaving the station.  The person left, drove on regardless and this tragedy unfolded.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will also join me in paying tribute to Garda Michael Devlin who showed enormous courage and who, I understand, was previously injured on duty.  He showed more courage and bravery again on Tuesday evening and we think of him and his family today.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will agree that, in isolation, this story is horrendously tragic.  When we read the reports today about how the suspect was on the run for a number of years and was well known to the Garda and the PSNI, it will make people question how he was allowed to walk our streets free, let alone drive on our roads, and how many other such cases are there within our system?  Can he confidently say that our garda&iacute; are resourced and have the available knowledge to brief them on this kind of suspect were they to meet a suspect or another one, particularly along the Border which they cross over and back, in such circumstances?  Does the T&aacute;naiste or the Government have a plan to review this incident and how it happened?  How many other people is the Government aware of who are on the run in situations similar to this?  Will the Government and the Garda Commissioner discuss this matter the PSNI?  Are there plans to increase co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and the courts system to ensure that those who are convicted of an offence on either side of the Border are not allowed to roam free for years and cause more tragedy?</p></speech>

Like him, I extend the sympathy of everybody in this House to the Marron family.  Two children and a wife have been left without a father today because of an outrageous and tragic set of circumstances that could not have been anticipated for the family concerned.  We are thinking of them today and they are very much in our thoughts and prayers.</p>  <p>  I also want to recognise the courage and bravery of Garda Devlin, who is in a critical condition as a result of trying to do his duty.  We hope that he will make a full and speedy recovery.  </p>  <p>  The issue of course is concerning.  The Minister has asked for a full report on what happened.  There will also be a full Garda investigation.  It is important that we are careful about what we say in order that we do not in any way undermine the detail of that investigation.  </p>  <p>  On some of the Deputy's more general questions, there is probably better co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI now than ever before on cross-Border crime to ensure they are responding appropriately to people moving on both sides of the Border.  We need to wait to get a full detailed report on what happened here and to allow the Garda and, if necessary, the PSNI to do their job in carrying out a full and detailed investigation and, presumably, a prosecution.</p></speech>

We need to ensure that warrants on both sides of the Border can be executed in both jurisdictions and that this situation does not happen again.  I ask that whatever investigation the Minister is undertaking be robust, efficient and done quickly so that we can give reassurance to communities.  The family and the public need to know this will not happen again.</p>  <p>  There have been similar cases.  We are all familiar with the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell.  The driver of the car that killed him had more than 42 serious convictions and was well known on both sides of the Border.  The O'Farrell family have been stoic, brave and courageous in their search for justice for Shane, and I acknowledge, in particular, the role Deputy McGuinness has played in this.  They have made complaints to the Garda, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Department of Justice and Equality.  They have been requesting a commission of inquiry into his death and this House passed a motion to allow this to happen.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that commission will proceed along with the wishes as expressed by this House?</p></speech>

When that report from GSOC is available to the Minister, we will take the appropriate action at that stage.</p>  <p>  Regarding this tragedy that happened to the Marron family, this case has also been referred to GSOC and, therefore, I am somewhat limited in what I can say but it is important to say that there will be full investigations and reports by the Garda and GSOC to make sure that we understand what happened here and that we learn full lessons from these tragedies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900012#K01000"><p>This morning, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs launched a report prepared by her Department on the early years sector.  It is a comprehensive survey with responses from almost 4,000 childcare services across the State.  Its findings, however, do not paint a pretty picture.  The findings in respect of the cost of childcare reinforce the point which was made time and again by my colleague, Deputy Denise Mitchell, particularly in the budget debate where she outlined that the cost of childcare in this State is among the highest in the developed world.  That is a massive issue with a wider social and economic impact.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the cost of providing childcare amounts to a second mortgage every month for many families.  It makes more sense for some of them for one or other parent to opt out of the workforce due to the scandalous costs involved.  That simply is not right and cannot continue.</p>  <p>  The average cost of childcare, as outlined in the report, is &euro;178 per week or more than &euro;700 per month.  In many parts of this State, it costs more than &euro;200 per week in some areas, including in the T&aacute;naiste's city of Cork.</p><p>In my county, Donegal, we have seen costs rise year on year at the second highest level across the State, at &euro;15 per week.  It is ludicrous that we are seeing those types of increases for hard-pressed families.  In addition, the report finds that capacity is decreasing and the number of available spaces in the sector is falling.  Separate from this morning's report but crucially linked are the difficulties in the sector and the challenges faced by thousands of childcare workers.  It is a sector which, in many cases, pays well below the living wage which means that we are losing experienced, well-trained childcare workers who are going into other professions.  These are skilled, trained workers who are being let down.  When we lose them, it means we are losing places and have a lower quality service in the early years, which are crucial for our child's development.  We cannot just keep our fingers crossed and hope that this will change.  We need to actively work towards fair pay for workers in the sector.</p> <p> High quality, affordable childcare is socially and academically beneficial to children.  We all know that.  It also benefits society and the economy by allowing parents to return to work.  We need an early years sector that we can be truly proud of, which we do not have at this point, given the costs and the low pay within the sector.  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that the system is desperately in need of support?  Does he accept that there needs to be reform of the universal childcare subsidy with increased investment by the State to help offset the cost to these families?  Does he accept we need to see an increase in capitation grants to support providers in delivering quality childcare?  Does he accept that there is a need for a sector-wide pay agreement to ensure that every childcare worker in the sector receives, at a minimum, the living wage?</p></speech>

Over the last four years, we have seen the amount of money available for reforming and changing the childcare sector increase by 117%.  The available budget for childcare has gone from &euro;265 million to &euro;574 million over four budgets.  The report the Deputy refers to shows that more families than ever are taking up childcare subsidies and supports.  More than 200,000 children are now subject to those supports.  There has been a 24% increase on the previous year.  The families of almost 40,000 children have now benefitted from non-means-tested subsidies introduced last year, worth &euro;1,040 per year.</p>  <p>  There are signs, although they are only signs, that childcare costs are stabilising.  The cost of full-time childcare has increased by approximately 2% on average over the last year.  This compares to an increase of 4% in the previous year.  It has halved.  We are not there yet.  The Taoiseach often talks about this.  It is about incremental change as we can afford it.  Childcare is arguably the best example of that in government, where we are seeing dramatic change happening over a relatively short period.  We now have a ten year strategy called First 5, which was launched last week.  We saw enhanced subsidies introduced last September which have been accessed by more than 84,000 families.  By the end of next year, which will mark enormous progress in the childcare sector, we will see the introduction of a new affordable childcare scheme.  There will be significant build-up to that.  I accept that this is an area where Ireland has not performed well by international and EU standards but those statistics are changing.  The affordability of childcare in Ireland is changing and the supports available for families on low incomes are changing quickly.  We need to continue down that path.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900013#L00300"><p>The T&aacute;naiste is right that it is changing.  I will outline what the changes are.  In 24 out of 30 areas, the cost for full-time childcare is increasing.  In Cork, it increased by &euro;15.29 per week, by &euro;18.70 in Kerry, &euro;15.60 in Donegal, &euro;14.18 in Laois and &euro;14.27 Leitrim.  I could go on and outline the other 19 counties where the cost of childcare has increased.  The reality is that the measures being introduced by the Government are not keeping pace with the increase in fees being charged to hard-pressed families.  That is at a point when we have the highest cost of childcare in the developed world.  There needs to be radical action, more support and reform of the universal child credit.  The report stipulates clearly that the capacity within the system is not keeping pace with demand.  It also makes it clear that because of the issue with low wages in the sector, we are losing high-quality, highly-trained people with more academic progression than ever seen before, yet the turnaround in a year is 24% of staff.  Unless we deal with this and get our heads out of the sand, we will see more and more pressure not only in the childcare sector but for families.  Will the T&aacute;naiste not look at proposals that we have put forward that would cut the cost of childcare in half and ensure that every worker in the sector would, at a minimum, have the living wage?</p></speech>

We are clearly coming from a difficult place with regard to childcare costs in Ireland.  If the Deputy looks at turnover in staff, where people are paid low wages, there has been a decrease of 3.5% in staff turnover in the last year.  It is still too high but it is moving in the right direction.</p></speech>

We have seen other measures that complement the changes to childcare, from the initial introduction of one free year of pre-school to now having two free years of pre-school for parents and families; an extension to paternity leave; and two weeks of paid paternity leave.  Across multiple areas, we are trying to make childcare more affordable, to make sure that the quality is guaranteed and audited and we are trying to ensure that the working conditions within childcare facilities also improve incrementally.  All of that cannot happen overnight but much is happening and we are seeing dramatic increases in the financial resources going into driving that change.</p></speech>

Where is the evidence of that?  In all my time in this House, never has the majority voice in the D&aacute;il been ignored so often as in this D&aacute;il by this Government.</p>  <p>  In June of this year, the D&aacute;il passed a motion on Dublin Fire Brigade.  We recognised that Dublin Fire Brigade provides crucial ambulance services.  The D&aacute;il rejected the suggestion of merging that ambulance service with the National Ambulance Service and of removing any element of Dublin Fire Brigade's fire-based emergency medical service system.  The D&aacute;il accepted a Labour Party amendment to that motion, calling on the Government to implement in full the report of the expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin which was published in December 2015.  What has the Government's response been?  As far as we can tell, management in Dublin City Council is not engaging in a process of discussion with Dublin Fire Brigade.  We understand that simple, low-cost technical solutions are available to address specific concerns raised by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  This would permit a seamless communication link-up between Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service.</p>  <p>  We have invested over the years to create a system of fire-based emergency response, including ambulances and highly-trained paramedics in our fire service.  It is fairly unique for the fire service to be trained paramedics.  It is a great addition.  Other countries are moving in that direction.  In the UK, there is a move towards integrating blue light services.  They see that as best practice, to generate efficiencies and enhance public safety.  We have been doing it in this city for over 100 years.</p><p>For some unknown reason, we have decided to move in the other direction from what is now regarded as best practice elsewhere, which is to model on what has been achieved in Dublin.  There is a concern that our fire-based ambulance services are not being properly funded.  This, of course, in and of itself is a risk to public safety.  My simple question to the T&aacute;naiste is will he now undertake to implement the resolutions passed by the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to maintain and fully restore Dublin Fire Brigade's ambulance service for this city and county?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, this has been an ongoing discussion for quite some time, trying to ensure we have the best possible pre-hospital emergency response capacity in Dublin.  Undoubtedly we have a very well trained and highly capable fire service in Dublin but we also have a very competent ambulance service linked to hospitals and the HSE.</p>  <p>  With respect, I do not think it should be politicians who decide on what the best mix and collaboration between two excellent services should look like in future.  We should leave it to the experts and the management teams of both to interact.  Of course, we have to provide much of the funding to make sure the service is well funded and can do the job it needs to do but the actual technical elements of emergency response and using the resources we have in the Dublin fire service as well as the ambulance service should be left to the experts, with respect.</p></speech>

It is under the Constitution that we vote the moneys for them and hold the services to account.  We are accountable, in turn, to the people for this.  That is how democracies work.  We do not hive them off for others to make a decision on these matters.  In this case, our common objective is what is best practice.  We have debated this in Private Members' time and the House made a decision on it.  Is it the T&aacute;naiste's view this was a waste of time?  Why would we have a debate if we have no control over it and our say does not count?</p>  <p>  I understand a process headed by Kieran Mulvey is under way, but my information is it is going nowhere because of a lack of engagement by Dublin City Council.  Will the T&aacute;naiste at least give a commitment there will be open transparent analysis of the facts so the common objective we have of providing the best, safest and most efficient emergency services for the city and county will be maintained?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, the way democracy works is we have to ensure we are accountable for the decisions made but we also need to rely on the expertise of those involved.  Politicians are not, with respect, paramedics.</p></speech>

We also know Ireland has the fifth lowest revenue to GDP ratio in the European Union, the figures being 35% for Ireland and 40% for the EU.  Ireland is a low tax country.  The real question is why it is a low tax country.  Of course, the answer to this question is that the Government and previous Governments pursued a conscious and deliberate policy of protecting the massive wealth of the rich and powerful in our society and has allowed them not to pay their fair share of taxation.  We know the top 10% of income recipients pay a smaller proportion of their income in all taxes than the bottom 10% of recipients.  We know the top 10% of financial asset holders now have approximately &euro;40 billion more than they had at peek boom levels in 2006 and they are not asked to pay a cent from this windfall.  We also know the share of gross income going to the top 1% of earners increased from 34% in 2011 to 39% in 2016.  We also know that more than half of the increase in total income over the past five years has gone to 10% of the highest earners.</p>  <p>  The country has become unequal and this has been accelerated in the recent budget.  We know the 300 wealthiest individuals, who have &euro;100 billion, will not pay a cent of tax on this.  We also know, because the Comptroller and Auditor General told us recently, that 83 high net worth individuals, with assets in excess of &euro;50 million each, declare taxable income of less than the average industrial wage of &euro;36,500.  This is perfectly legal but absolutely shameful.</p>  <p>  The country is profoundly unequal and it is a far cry from the vision of equality and fairness set out 100 years ago in the democratic programme of the First D&aacute;il that met 100 yd. from here in the Mansion House in January 1919.  Will the Government bring forward legislation to remedy the situation revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General recently whereby 83 high net worth individuals, with in excess of &euro;50 million in assets each, declare taxable incomes of less than the average industrial wage?  At present, this is perfectly legal under legislation being presided over by the Government.  Will the Government introduce a supplementary budget in January to reverse the inequity of the recent budget and make the rich and powerful pay their fair share in taxation?</p></speech>

The priority has been on increasing public expenditure, improving public services and supporting people who need the support of the State in multiple sectors that have not had the type of investment needed through a recessionary period.  Expenditure versus tax cuts has been provided on a ratio of 2:1 repeatedly in budget after budget.</p><p> I do not accept that Ireland is a low-tax economy.  The Government must always try to get the balance right between incentivising business growth, innovation and employment and incentives to work and progress through the workforce with the responsibilities of the State to have a fair and equitable tax policy.  Independent reports on Ireland's tax policy from the OECD and others show that the country is seen internationally as having a very progressive tax policy in terms of the redistribution of wealth.  We should be proud of that.</p></speech>

It is an excuse to allow the rich and powerful - people who have massive incomes and assets - pay little or no taxation and certainly not their fair share.  The budget was for the super-rich.  It was unequal.  For example, 1.8 million workers are on incomes of less than &euro;30,000.  That is 40% of the workforce, and they got no relief in the budget.  The vast majority of the &euro;356 million for tax relief in the budget went to people with significant incomes, certainly well in excess of &euro;100,000.  Allowing the rich and powerful to avoid paying their fair share of taxation is simply not compatible with providing decent, modern public services.  That is why we have a housing emergency, 10,000 people homeless, 780,000 people living below the poverty line, 70,000 children growing up in poverty and why the Society of St. Vincent de Paul received 137,000 calls last year and paid &euro;27 million to needy families.</p></speech>

On foot of the debate last week, we are aware of the many initiatives that are in place.  We are trying to have a long-term plan for a fair deal-type scheme for 2021.  I have spoken about this matter on numerous occasions in the House.  We hope to publish the plan in 2020 in order to give people a look at what it will involve.  Until we get to that point, we will not be able to meet the demand that exists.  There is no point in pretending that we will.  Last year, we delivered 17 million home help hours and I hope to improve on that this year.  The service plan will be agreed in the next week to ten days.  We certainly will improve on that figure but we will not get to where we need to be.  The current system is not fit for purpose and involves sending people 7 miles north or 8 miles south for half an hour here and half an hour there.  We cannot get the people we need to deliver the service either.  There are challenges on a number of fronts.  We are making every effort to try to allocate whatever resources are available, but we are competing with other areas.  Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on health is seeking equalisation for consultants, home help and other items, all of which cost &euro;20 million, &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.  We cannot provide it all.  We can only continue incrementally to do the best we can.</p></speech>

I will focus on one narrow element.  During the week, there was an easterly wind which briefly closed Dublin Port and which caused traffic to be backed up from the port and out towards the airport.  This is the main entrance and egress point for the bulk of our trade so we must have specific plans to deal with the imports and exports coming to and leaving this country.  The other port is Rosslare Europort.  That port needs specific funding to complete the M11 access and to ensure the port is reconfigured to deal with the new circumstances.  Will the T&aacute;naiste share what planning is taking place for these specific points, which could be catastrophic if we are not prepared?</p></speech>

It is important to say that those contingency plans are based on a central case scenario.  This assumes that we would have a transition period for at least 21 months and that we would have a withdrawal agreement signed off and ratified.  Of course, if we have to put in place contingency planning for a more urgent situation involving a no-deal Brexit, we have been working for months on this, but we do not believe that it is prudent to publish anything in that regard-----</p></speech>

There is a backlog of 80,000 tests from women who underwent cervical screening in recent months.  CervicalCheck has issued a warning on its website about a wait of more than five months in a small number of cases.  This follows revelations that an additional laboratory in the UK, which is run by MedLab Pathology and which screens tests in Dublin, is being asked to reduce some of the backlog.  During this entire scandal, tests are being sent to private companies abroad who then outsource the tests.  As was discovered recently, in many cases CervicalCheck did not even know where the tests were going.  It is clear that lives are being put at risk for profit and for cost.  Is it now the time to re-nationalise the screening of all of these important diagnostic tests and bring them back into the public health system?</p></speech>

I also pay tribute to one of their colleagues who died recently, Sergeant Martin Hopkins, who was an excellent young garda.</p>  <p>  It is just not fair.  It has been announced more times, including by previous Ministers such as Deputies Alan Kelly and Michael Lowry and many others.  We know some contracts were signed and there is a public private partnership, but when are we going to see any movement towards putting the station on the new site?  We had an announcement this week about funding for the site at Kickham Barracks.  I welcome that but there has been nothing for the Garda station or the garda&iacute; who work in those appalling conditions.

Unfortunately, when the opportunity arose in the D&aacute;il to support such "positive actions", the Government failed to do so.

I am pleased to say that the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill 2018 proposes only one amendment to one section of the legislation that was enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this year.  The section the Bill seeks to amend, or rather to replace, is section 30.  The version of section 30 that was enacted deals with the micro-targeting and profiling of children.  It provides expressly that it would be an offence under the Act for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child as defined by section 29 for the purposes of direct marketing, profiling or micro-targeting.</p><p>The purpose of section 30, as enacted, is to protect children from being marketed junk food and drinks.  The total lifetime cost of childhood obesity in Ireland is estimated to be approximately &euro;4.6 billion.  In addition, there is a significant problem with the number of children experiencing childhood obesity.  At present, research estimates that 55,000 children currently living in Ireland and 85,000 on the island of Ireland will die prematurely due to being overweight or obese.  We note research by the World Obesity Federation which predicts that, by 2025, up to 141,000 schoolchildren in Ireland will be overweight or obese and as many as 9,000 will have impaired glucose intolerance.  The consequences of childhood obesity are significant, not just for the individual child as he or she develops into adulthood but also for the healthcare system.</p><p>The purpose of section 30 is to deal with that problem.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality did not commence the section as a result of advice he received from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that it is incompatible with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  There are two concerns in this regard.  The section, as enacted, expands upon the permitted restrictions to the processing of personal data.  There was a concern that the term &quot;micro-targeting&quot; was non-specific and undefined and that, consequently, people who were committing an offence did not know the specific nature of that offence and that, as a result, the provision would be unfair on them.  The Office of the Attorney General wrote to the European Commission outlining its concerns and asked it for its views regarding the compatibility of section 30 of the Act.  The Office of the Attorney General confirmed that the section would not be brought into effect until such time as it received information and advice from the Commission.</p><p>We note that advice was provided by the European Commission which clarified that, as set out in recital 38 of the GDPR, children merit special protection, particularly where the personal data of children is being used for marketing or creating personality-of-user profiles.  The letter confirmed that while direct marketing to children is a permissible activity under the GDPR, this provision must be balanced by the interests of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data, especially where the data subject is a child.  Consequently, the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing is not unlawful.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a new wording for section 30, which seeks to overcome the concerns identified by the Office of the Attorney General and to take into account the advice presented by the European Commission.  The wording is consistent with the wording of Article 22 of the GDPR and the rights and restrictions it introduces.  It removes the reference to there being &quot;an offence&quot; and replaces it with the word &quot;unlawful&quot;, and it will make it easier for a data subject to vindicate his or her rights under the Data Protection Act.  It also removes any debate as to whether an offence has been lawfully created.  The Bill proposes to amend section 30 of the Data Protection Act so that we can seek to give effect to the protection that no doubt everyone in the House believes should apply to protect children from micro-targeting, particularly in the context of junk food and junk drinks.</p></speech>

We are hoping the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and others will have seen that the housing and homelessness crisis has become such an epidemic that it is now necessary to undertake these measures.  The Bill is urgently required to prevent many of the cases of homelessness that we are now seeing.  Homelessness has increased by 57.4% since this Government came into office.  The shameful figures of 10,000 homeless in emergency accommodation is widely known.  However, the much larger effects of hidden homelessness and the ongoing ripple of homelessness for everybody is also very important.</p><p>The solution to the housing and homelessness crisis is of course the building on public land of thousands of new public homes that are affordable for people to buy or rent.  Doing so would take people off the waiting lists and make homes available to the thousands of families struggling with rent and unable to get mortgage approval.  This Bill aims to put a bandage on the haemorrhage to stop the ongoing evictions that are taking place.  On 26 May, the <i>Irish Independent </i>outlined the main reasons for terminations of tenancies.  Some 36% are because a landlord is selling; 16% because a family member is moving in; and 10% due to renovation.  If passed, the Bill will give tenants the right to remain in a property if it is being sold.  It would allow a tenancy continue in the case of renovation and would require compensation to be paid to a tenant where a property is required for family use, hopefully to act as a deterrent for abuse of that aspect of the law.  The chief executive of Threshold has said many landlords are abusing the legislation to hike up rent yields by using &quot;fake sale&quot;, or by falsely saying there is a family member moving in or that there is a need for renovations.  They are called dubious terminations.  These are not just loopholes; the D&aacute;il has been made well aware of them and has refused to close them.  They need to be closed.</p><p>Commercial tenants can remain in a property but human tenants are evicted when a property is being sold.  That is Leo Varadkar's and Fine Gael's Ireland.</p> <p> The Bill makes a range of other changes to improve the position of tenants.  Clarity will be given to the landlord-tenant relationship where a receiver takes possession.  Tenancies of more than two months will be given much more security and there is also an extension of notice periods.</p> <p> Another important aspect of the Bill that was not covered in the 2016 Bill is giving tenant rights to students in specific student accommodation.  Solidarity has been in contact with USI about this and we are very anxious to advance it in the Bill.</p> <p> The homelessness crisis is getting more depraved.  This morning I was contacted by a young couple.  The young man works nights.  He effectively has no access to emergency accommodation because he works nights.  Those faced with homelessness and housing crises are working people who often get up very early in the morning.  In this man's case they are trying to have a home to which to return when he finishes work early in the morning.  What does it say about capitalism that working people are not even able to secure accommodation?  It is back to Dickensian times.</p> <p> Given this D&aacute;il's ideological commitment to profit for private landlords and investors, rents are skyrocketing.  A one-bedroom apartment in Berlin or Vienna would cost &euro;8,500 less than Dublin.  In Paris it would cost &euro;4,500 less.  In Copenhagen it would cost &euro;3,000 less.  Given the commitment to capitalism and private profit, the law gives more weight to landlords and private property rights than to the right of people to a home.  Thousands of young people are suffering.  Many who are living with parents may want to move on in life, but are unable to do so.  The National Housing and Homelessness Coalition has called for a demonstration on Saturday, starting at the Garden of Remembrance at 2 p.m.  I hope this is the start of a massive movement against the housing crisis and for real action to build public homes.  This Bill is a contribution to that movement.</p></speech>
