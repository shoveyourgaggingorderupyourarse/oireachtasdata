A Deputy has 30 seconds to introduce the question and the Minister has two minutes to respond.  Then there is an initial supplementary question of one minute's duration, to which the Minister has one minute to respond, and a final supplementary question and a final opportunity for the Minister to respond.  I am very anxious we stick to the timeframe.  I will let Members know when the time is up in order that we can proceed to have as many questions as possible answered in the Chamber.</p></speech>

Last June the Minister directed that there be a review of the way in which rape trials are conducted in this State.  He sought this review in the aftermath of a very prominent trial that took place in Northern Ireland.  He made the good decision to select Dr. Tom O'Malley to conduct the review.  Has the review been completed, where is it and when will it be published?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900003#A00600"><p>The review is at an advanced stage and nearing completion.  It is vitally important that victims of sexual assault feel able to report matters to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is equally important that complainants in sexual assault cases are spared any unnecessary distress in the investigation and prosecution of such offences and cases.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Callaghan noted, a review of protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences is well under way.  The review will examine the entire legal process surrounding sexual offences, from the initial reporting of an offence through to the end of any court proceedings.  The review concerns in particular the treatment of complainants and vulnerable witnesses throughout this process.</p>  <p>  Terms of reference for the review have been published.  The review is examining the adequacy of the mechanisms available in law and in practice to protect vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, including access to specialist training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the Judiciary and legal professionals dealing with sexual offences; practical supports for vulnerable witnesses; the provision of additional legal supports to witnesses during court processes; measures in place to protect vulnerable witnesses during evidence; and restrictions on attendance by members of the public at, and media reporting on, trials of sexual offences.</p>  <p>  The working group is having regard to research published in this area, submissions from victims' organisations, representatives of which I have met, and individuals and will carry out consultations with relevant stakeholders, including the legal professional bodies.</p>  <p>  The impetus for this review arose from a round of consultations I had with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in April of this year.  I met representatives of NGOs, including Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, One in Four and the National Women's Council of Ireland and I acknowledge their submissions and their assistance on this matter.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is the case that some damage has been done to public confidence in these very important prosecutions.  The Government needs to concentrate on a number of specific areas.  First, we in this House and the Seanad introduced a new definition of "consent" last year.  This needs to be further advanced in order that the public be made aware of it.  Second, we in Fianna F&aacute;il put forward in legislation the proposal that we should have a system whereby when complainants make complaints, they are given some support by way of a solicitor funded by the State and available through the auspices of, say, the local rape crisis centre, which could advise them as to what will be involved in making that complaint and in the trial process.  Very many complainants find the process harrowing.  Obviously, any criminal trial will be an adversarial process and will be difficult for individuals, but we can provide greater levels of support.  I ask the Minister to consider this in the review.</p></speech>

I am very keen to listen to what all Deputies have to say on this important issue because it is essential we have appropriate legal protections available to complainants.  I acknowledge again the work, assistance, guidance and leadership of many of the non-governmental organisations on these important issues and thank them for their input.  It is expected that the working group, or the review group, to which Deputy O'Callaghan referred earlier, will provide me with a final report early next year.  I do not wish in any way to pre-empt the outcome of the review but I look forward to its recommendations and would be happy to share its contents at a very early date with Members of the House and perhaps the justice committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900003#A01100"><p>There are certain steps the Government can take that would make it easier for complainants.  For instance, the Minister was recently on television with Leona O'Callaghan, a complainant and a victim of serious rape who deserves to be commended on coming out and speaking publicly about it.  What she said was the most harrowing aspect of her time before the courts was the length of time it took for her case to come before the courts.  She said it took four years.  The State can deal with this factor.  We can speed up the process of the investigation and indeed the prosecution of these offences.</p><p>We can better resource the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions so that files can be considered and decisions can be made more promptly.  A complainant, and indeed an accused, should not have to wait for a number of years before a decision is made as to whether or not there will be a prosecution.  A trial is a difficult process.  We have to try to make it easier for complainants while not interfering with the fact that there is a presumption of innocence and that an individual can only be convicted of a criminal offence if it is proven beyond all reasonable doubt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00200"><p>I am concerned about the specific issue of delay and the time lapse from the date upon which a complaint is initially reported to the matter appearing in court.  This is an issue that is being looked at by the review group, and I do not wish to pre-empt its findings, but I want to acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in the manner in which victims are treated within the criminal justice system.  The improvements include the facilities in place for victims in courts.  It is absolutely essential to ensure that those people, women and vulnerable witnesses in particular, who have a complaint to make have confidence in the system and that they get the distinct feeling that the system and the State is very much on their side.  I acknowledge the importance of the standard courthouse design guide which improves facilities for complainants and vulnerable witnesses.  I also acknowledge the protections available through the Legal Aid Board, for example, which provides advice and guidance to vulnerable witnesses.  I look forward to further engagement, when we will have more time to discuss these important issue.</p></speech>

I will take this opportunity to condemn entirely the quite disgraceful arson attack that took place in Moville.  Having said that, while the issue is in the public domain and is being discussed, it is my view that direct provision is a deeply flawed and broken model.  It effectively warehouses those seeking asylum in this country for prolonged periods of time.  It is neither sustainable, efficient, affordable nor humane, and it is time for the Government to move beyond that model, end direct provision and take an alternative approach.  I will elaborate on that, and am happy to engage on the issue.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00600"><p>Since 2015, this Government has transformed the system known as direct provision and will continue with this programme of reform.  At a time of serious pressure in the accommodation market it is important to note that any person who presents himself or herself seeking international protection will immediately be offered shelter and a range of supports.  Since Ireland opted into the EU's recast reception conditions directive, this has all been placed on a statutory footing ensuring such services are provided as of right.</p><p>The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years.  These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres.  As a result of this initiative, over 1,500 residents in five centres has now moved to the independent living model.  In parallel with the delivery of these changes, a number of other accommodation centres are providing self-catering facilities with fresh food provided by either the contractor or the residents themselves.  In total over 2,900 residents in the centres are no longer under the direct provision model as originally set-up, and further progress will be made in this area.</p><p>In addition, there have been significant improvements to recreation opportunities, such as the provision of outdoor sports pitches, including all-weather facilities, as well as the introduction of teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.  Friends of the centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.</p><p>Following the McMahon report, a standards advisory group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of that report and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State.  The standards will meet the standards set out in the recast reception conditions directive and the European Asylum Support Office, EASO, guidance on reception conditions.  Operational standards and indicators will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process.  They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the public sector equality and human rights duty.  A working document has recently issued for widespread consultation.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The decision to opt-in to the directive is a significant and positive measure, not only in addressing the matter of labour market access, but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision.  In addition, any complaints about accommodation and related matters can be made to the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children as appropriate. </p><p>We have already introduced far-reaching and important reforms to the overall system and this process will continue as we strive to make further improvements in the future.  The nature of international protection is that it is demand led and accordingly the State must provide sufficient accommodation to meet that demand.  This process is underway with the aim of meeting both short and medium term requirements.</p><p>I have previously indicated that Ireland, unlike most other European countries, has no NGO run centre.  I take this opportunity to reiterate to civil society, including to approved housing bodies, that we would welcome an expression of interest from them to offer to provide such reception facilities.  My officials have begun to explore with civil society what might be possible in this regard.</p><p>With regard to recent events, the Minister and I have already condemned in the strongest possible terms the recent arson attack in Moville.  There is no place in a civilised society for that type of behaviour and it does not represent the views of the vast majority of decent people who recognise the need to offer assistance and welcome for those in need of international protection.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00800"><p>While I acknowledge movement on certain issues including the right to work, although I am of the view that it is not entirely perfect, there are still very significant issues.  Direct provision is a model that has been criticised roundly by NGOs and the public at large as being far from fit for purpose, particularly for families.  I fear that in future years we will hear many stories about it and will look back upon this episode with great regret.  We also have to confront the fact that it is very bad value for money.  This substandard and inhumane accommodation has cost the taxpayer &euro;1.25 billion since 2001.  To house a parent with two children costs the State &euro;40,000 per year in direct provision.  Would it not be not only far preferable from a human rights perspective to locate those seeking asylum in directly provided accommodation rather than by contract through the private sector?  This could be done through a non-profit housing association.  People could have own-door accommodation rather than dormitory-style accommodation.  They could then be encouraged, when they are able, to seek their own accommodation, and be provided with the means to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B00900"><p>It is completely unacceptable that the Members are continually breaching the rules they themselves have set.  I am not specifically referring to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  It is happening all the time.  Time is being wasted and people who are waiting to have their questions answered are missing out.  I am asking every side to adhere to the times allocated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B01000"><p>I have previously indicated that Ireland, unlike most other European countries, has no NGO-run centre.  I take this opportunity to reiterate to civil society, including approved housing bodies and others, that I would welcome any expression of interest from that cohort that would offer to provide reception and housing facilities.  There is no blockage there.  Officials have begun to explore with civil society organisations what might be possible in this area.  A value for money and policy review was carried out in May 2010 on the whole issue of a reception and integration agency and an accommodation programme and it was found that it provides the best value for money.  It was a really comprehensive study, and I invite the Deputy to read it, if he has not already read it, and perhaps he would come back to me with his views on it.  It found that: "[alternative] options would be significantly more expensive than direct provision and concluded that the use of direct provision has proven to be the correct choice in providing for the accommodation needs of asylum seekers."  That study was carried out in 2010.</p>  <p>  On the suggestion that there could be a State building programme, it should be noted that over the longer term the number of asylum seekers has varied widely, from as few as 1,200 in the 2000s to 1,500 in other years.  Any system of accommodation must be flexible to cater for wide variations in demand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B01100"><p>In the long run the value for money aspect would change substantially because the property or asset would be permanent rather than something that is constantly renewed and paid for.  Tendering does not suit that kind of process.  The State should intervene directly and seek to provide permanent accommodation.  Acting in conjunction with NGOs or housing associations should be an option on the table.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that communities that have been identified as locations for direct provision centres have been very welcoming, and that is very positive.  However, some of the challenges faced by residents of those communities should be identified.  Moville is ten hours, travelling through the six counties, which is not allowable, from Dublin.  Kenmare is probably an overnight trip.  It is possible to travel to Lisdoonvarna in one day, involving a very short period of time in Dublin.  Mount Trenchard does not even have public bus access.  People have to be in Dublin for interviews, appeal hearings and renewals of certificates.  This is not an acceptable situation.  As much as possible should be brought to the direct provision centres, but the Department should also directly provide transport for the residents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900004#B01200"><p>We are very much aware of the issue of transport to Dublin.  With that in mind, my Department has agreed with a contractor to arrange overnight accommodation and comfort breaks for those travelling to Dublin from the accommodation centre in Sligo.  We will also source overnight accommodation in Dublin if required.  I have also requested that the Department examines the logistical and resource implications of business being carried out at the remote centres.</p><p>It would mean that rather than asylum seekers having to travel to Dublin, officials would travel to the centres.  The Deputy is right in that regard.  </p> <p> I join with the Deputy in condemning in the strongest terms the recent arson attack in Moville.  There is no place in civil society for that type of behaviour.  It does not represent, as he rightly said, the views of the vast majority of decent people who recognise the need to offer assistance and support to those seeking international protection.  </p> <p> I draw the Deputy's attention to the value for money report that examined the direct provision system.  It found it was not up to speed with respect to value for money.  The Value for Money and Policy Review of the Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme was a comprehensive and impressive report carried out by the RIA in 2010.  </p></speech>

One day of the week garda&iacute; can be asked to investigate issues pertaining to financial crime.  On other occasions, they can be asked to investigate issues concerning child or sexual abuse.  I will ask the Minister about the latter group.  It was announced recently specialist groups in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be rolled out to deal with vulnerable witnesses.

The setting up by the Garda Commissioner of the divisional protective services units is one of the actions outlined in the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The strategy, in accordance with programme for Government commitments is a whole-of-government approach, involving seven Departments and a number of State bodies, including Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>A key element of the strategy was the recent enactment of the Domestic Violence Bill 2018.  Under the existing Garda reform programme,<i></i>divisional units of the Garda national protective services bureau are being rolled out across the country in two phases.  The bureau and its divisional units are tasked with improving services to victims, improving the investigation of sexual and domestic violence incidents and identifying and managing risk.  Phase 1 of the roll-out has been completed with divisional units established and working in three areas, Dublin metropolitan region west, Cork city and Louth.</p><p>I strongly welcome the important statement by Commissioner Harris this week at the launch of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre annual report on his commitment to the continued roll-out of the divisional protective services units.  I am confident that under his leadership and stewardship, there will be rapid progress in the delivery of these important units.</p><p>Following an evaluation of the pilot, the next phase will see an additional six divisional bureaus established in Dublin metropolitan region south central, Waterford, Kerry, Kilkenny-Carlow, Limerick and Galway before the end of 2018 with the objective of extending them to all remaining Garda divisions before the end of 2019.  </p></speech>

I welcomed what he said.  He gave a commitment that there would be a roll-out of the divisional protective service units in all 29 Garda divisions.  It is important to note that taking evidence or a statement from a victim of child abuse or a complainant in a rape or sexual abuse case is a complicated matter that requires expertise, sensitivity and training.  That is why I very much welcome the establishment of these units.  Unfortunately, there have been reports in recent weeks that garda&iacute; are being told they cannot take part in specialist courses due to budgetary constraints.  That is of severe concern to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also to the victims of such crimes and complainants who wish to come before the court.  Will the Minister give us assurance that funding will be provided and that it will be ring-fenced for these vital units?</p></speech>

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that all Garda personnel receive training in the investigation of incidents considered to be domestic abuse in all its forms with additional training provided to garda&iacute; who have been selected for duties as detectives.  Further and more specific training has been developed by the director of training with the senior management team at the Garda national protective services bureau for training to be provided to personnel selected for duty within the divisional protective services units where the roll out has taken place.  This has commenced in the three divisions I mentioned in Louth, cork city and Dublin metropolitan region west.  I am keen to have all the Garda divisions involved in the process by the end of next year.  I acknowledge the importance of the recommendations in the recently published report by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, placing an emphasis on the need to support victims of crime and the need for the garda&iacute; to have an appropriate level of training.</p></speech>

It is a difficulty and problem that exists within the force.  We keep making laws in this House and in the Seanad, which make the law more complicated.  Garda&iacute; have to investigate any breaches of the law.  It needs to ensured that they are adequately trained to deal with legitimate complainants who come forward using those laws.  That is why it is so important to ensure funding is ring-fenced for these units.  I welcome that the units will be rolled out in the 29 Garda divisions but I am also conscious of what has been said by members of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, who stated they need to ensure there is a proper professional national training plan to deal with front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not appropriate to put a young garda who is not adequately trained before complainants in such cases.</p></speech>

I acknowledge an increase of 8% in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote in the recent budget.  There is &euro;1.7 billion available to the Garda Commissioner to engage in the type of activity he believes is important to ensure the issues raised are dealt with.  I am informed that all Garda personnel receive training in the matter of domestic abuse.  I acknowledge the importance of the pilot areas.  Induction training has been provided for personnel in these units.  A briefing is being provided to all appropriate State agencies beyond the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The training referred to by the Deputy includes specific training in the investigation of sexual crime, online child exploitation, domestic abuse, human trafficking, children in care who are reported missing and sex offender management.  I look forward to ensuring that all divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the appropriate units within the timeframe envisaged, which is 12 months from now.</p></speech>

Under the programme, the Government committed to accept up to 4,000 people, mostly Syrian, into the State through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism, established by two Council of the European Union decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme, which is focused on resettling refugees from Lebanon.</p>  <p>  Ireland agreed to opt in to Council of the European Union decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1601 which allocated the number of asylum seekers that was to be relocated to each member state participating in these decisions.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Ireland agreed to accept 2,622 persons under these decisions.  As it was not possible to operationalise the commitment in respect of Italy, which numbered 600 persons, the Government agreed to increase the number of refugees it would accept under the resettlement programme.  This includes Syrian refugees who had been given temporary asylum in Lebanon.<br/><br/>We committed to accept 1,040 programme refugees under the resettlement strand of the programme.  A total of 928 people have arrived, 875 of whom are Syrian, and 113 people will arrive in mid-December 2018.  My officials are working with the relevant international bodies to ensure that refugees selected during a mission to Lebanon in June 2018 will arrive soon thereafter.<br/><br/>The Government has pledged to take a further 945 programme refugees from Lebanon or Jordan by the end of 2019.A further mission to select 231 refugees was carried out in Lebanon in October 2018.  This mission completed our pledge to the EU for 2018.  Two further missions to select 600 persons will take place in 2019.<br/><br/>Ireland's EU relocation programme concluded in March 2018.  Overall, 1,022 people, 959 of them Syrian, arrived safely from Greece and work continues on sourcing housing in communities throughout Ireland. <br/><br/>As of 27 November, 287 Syrians, including Irish-born children, were living in emergency response and orientation centres. <br/><br/>A key step in the integration of refugees is moving them to permanent housing.  The Deputy will appreciate that housing falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I will set out the general processes that apply in the Irish resettlement model.<br/><br/><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i><br/><br/>The Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP, which falls under the ambit of the office for the promotion of migrant integration, OPMI, within my Department has a co-ordinating role in respect of all matters related to the settlement of refugees.<br/><br/>Resettlement in communities is co-ordinated by Inter-Agency Working Groups, chaired by the relevant local authority and with members from relevant agencies such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Education and Welfare Service, the education and training board and the IRPP.  Once a family is resettled in a community, an implementing partner procured by the local authority provides appropriate services for a period of twelve to eighteen months.  The standard model is now focussed on an eighteen month period.  The implementing partner plays a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through their expertise in community integration and relevant supports.  The funding for the implementing partner is provided by the IRPP and the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), both managed under the auspices of my Department.<br/><br/>The implementation of the programme requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities are represented on the national task force which oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is co-ordinated overall by the IRPP, but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity. <br/><br/>A total of 1486 Syrians have been housed throughout the country and are accommodated in local authority housing across 18 counties.<br/><br/>Overall, 1690 refugees - Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi - have been housed by local authorities and the Irish Red Cross under the programme.  This figure includes Irish born children. In terms of all refugees who have arrived under this programme almost 85 per cent of persons have been housed.<br/><br/>The Irish Red Cross is also managing an aspect of the programme to secure accommodation pledged by members of the public.  This is largely being deployed to meet the needs of single persons, as few accommodation options exist within the local authority sector for this cohort.  To date the Red Cross have sourced accommodation for 96 beneficiaries in 11 counties.</p></speech>

That is a welcome initiative.</p>  <p>  Is the stream of refugees we were due to take from Italy closed off now?  Is that finished?  I do not know whether the Minister of State is in contact with his colleagues from Italy and elsewhere.  Given the political situation in Italy, it is interesting that the country with perhaps the most difficult political issue with migration and refugees at the moment seems to be the one that has failed to relocate refugees.</p>  <p>  Second, how we integrate refugees once they are here is critical.  There is concern about the numbers in emergency accommodation and, while we have a housing crisis, it is critically important that in the processing of people, once they come here, they are not held in long-term hotel or other emergency accommodation and are settled in houses.</p>  <p>  What is the Minister of State's expected timeline in that?  Even in broad figures, rather than going down to the minutiae of numbers, when does he think there will be 4,000 refugees here?  How long will it take to get them housed?</p></speech>

We tried hard but were not successful in doing that, although we wanted to.</p><p>A total of 1,486 Syrians have been housed throughout the country and are accommodated in local authority housing across 18 counties.</p><p>Overall, 1,690 Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi refugees have been housed by local authorities and the Irish Red Cross under the programme<i>.  </i>This figure includes Irish born children.

Communities are welcoming Syrian refugees throughout the country and that is of benefit.</p><p>We also have made significant funding available.  I do not have the time to go into that detail now, but I can provide it to the Deputy if he so wishes later.</p></speech>

Within those figures, over the next five years, it would be good to see the levels of language ability and whether there has been success in bringing the level of understanding and use of English up.  It would be interesting to see figures on the level of work and assimilation into the education system.  There is an urgency for us to get that right.  T&uacute;s maith leath an oibre.  We need to start on the right foot in getting children and adults into education quickly, getting people into work as quickly as we can, and getting people out of emergency accommodation and into housing to ensure they integrate well.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Minister keeps his attention, focus and, if necessary, budget on these matters because we need to get this right for the confidence of our people, for the respect of those who are coming, and for other people who may come in the future, so we learn how to do this well.</p></speech>

I visited Donegal last week and met some Syrian families there.  Children are going to school, and parents are learning English and working and so on.  A lot is happening.</p>  <p>  We also mobilised EU funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund to provide supports, through local authorities, to refugees.  Local authorities play a critical role in ensuring the successful integration of refugees through the provision of housing and implementation of a process carried out by the implementing partner, with expertise in community integration and relevant supports.  This programme of implementation of integration requires a high level of co-ordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Departments, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities are represented on the national task force that oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is co-ordinated overall by the IRPP but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is important we get integration right and I thank him for his support on this.  We are working hard on that, with the various bodies, and there is support given for up to 18 months to the refugees to help them integrate and it is working well.</p></speech>

She has long been a voice against cruelty and neglect and has debated the subject on a number of occasions in the House and at committee.  It is also appropriate that I pay tribute to the important role played by animal welfare charities such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, who are at the forefront of animal welfare in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While the particular Acts highlighted by the Deputy fall under the auspices of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have made inquiries with the Garda authorities to see how many times these Acts have been invoked by garda&iacute; in the course of their duties and I am advised that the specific information requested by her is not recorded on PULSE. </p>  <p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides a modern and robust framework for dealing with issues relating to animal welfare.  It also updated and replaced approximately 40 items of primary legislation in the area of animal welfare and health back going back more than 100 years. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Control of Horses Act 1996 provides powers to local authorities to deal with stray and abandoned horses and for the designation by each local authority, by way of by-laws, of areas in which horses cannot be kept without a licence.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been assigned powers commensurate with those of authorised officers under the legislation. </p>  <p>  In this context, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na liaises and works closely with both local authorities and the local offices of the ISPCA.  All complaints of cruelty to animals made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are subject to investigation, with an investigation file submitted to the DPP who will then decide if a prosecution should take place, and for what offence.</p></reply>

I find it difficult to understand that, if garda&iacute; are involved, incidents are not recorded on PULSE.</p>  <p>  Abuse of animals is, sadly, a reality in Ireland.  Whether we are talking about hares, greyhounds, horses, badgers, foxes or puppy farms, that is the reality.  I am continually told that we have the legislation - the Animal Welfare Acts and the Control of Horses Act - as if they were covering and sorting everything.  Those Acts are only as good as the extent of the implementation and enforcement.</p><p>We know it is not happening for whatever reason.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in a previous reply stated that it is the responsibility of individuals to ensure the welfare of their animals, including horses.  That is quite right, but I am asking about circumstances where owners do not take responsibility.  There was a protest outside Leinster House.  All of the horse welfare groups came together.  We have seen cases of starving animals, cases of animals whose illnesses are left unattended, and cases in which large numbers of animals have been kept in confined spaces.  It is the animal welfare groups that are picking up the pieces.  Surely the Garda could be more proactive in checking on microchipping and registering.</p></speech>

As stated, many of the issues involved here are more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I say that in the context of my wish to ensure that any issues particular to the Department of Justice and Equality or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are dealt with.  I acknowledge the importance of the specific training provided to garda&iacute; in Templemore.  In addition, I am advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that there have been five training seminars held to familiarise Garda officers and officials of that Department with the application of the Act.  The programme is ongoing.  Further seminars are planned.  I would be happy to keep the Deputy informed in that regard.</p></speech>

The Clondalkin Equine Club does great work and yet, at this time last year, there was an horrific case of cruelty to horses outside Clonmel.  The carcasses of seven dead horses were found and the remaining animals had been left without food, water and so on.  Notice was given for the owners to contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There has been no contact made and, to my knowledge, nobody has been prosecuted for that horrible case of animal cruelty.  The legislation is there but it is not always enforced.  Garda&iacute; - and I know the community garda&iacute; in my area - are very much informed of what is happening.  They will know about these situations.  It is when they know about them that they will use whatever powers they have to progress matters.  For whatever reason, they are sometimes not doing that.  It would be good to have more facts about this situation because we know it is happening and people are getting away with it.</p></speech>

I acknowledged earlier that the specific information sought by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is not recorded on PULSE.  However, the Garda authorities advise that PULSE incident types classified as control of horses and offences against animals, which from a search of a narratives appear to relate to incidents of animal neglect and cruelty, do exist.  As of last Sunday, there had been 351 incidents involving control of horses and 152 incidents of offences against animals recorded on the PULSE system this year alone.  I understand these incident types also include incidents of illegal hunting and incidents in which animals stray onto public roads.  I stress to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that these figures from the Garda are provisional and may be subject to change.  I would be happy to engage further with the Deputy to see how best her concerns might be addressed in the context of my role as Minister for Justice and Equality and my relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Until recently, we thankfully did not have substantive problems with drug-related crime or drug-related issues.  Unfortunately, that has changed in recent times.  Communities throughout Cavan and Monaghan have serious concerns regarding the use, misuse, prevalence and availability of drugs in every parish.  Unfortunately, it is my understanding that is the position in all rural areas.  Additional resources are needed.  The Garda is working extremely well and as effectively as possible with limited resources.  I would hope the Minister would be in a position to enhance those resources.</p></reply>

He may also wish to be aware of work under way in the context of the Government's national drugs and alcohol strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.</p></speech>

He referred to a person who is found in possession of drugs worth &euro;13,000 or more and the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  From reports I have heard and from what I have read, there always seems to be mitigating circumstances.  How often are those sentences actually handed down?  In many instances we hear that a given person in a community, who is known to possess and sell drugs, has been before the courts again and is out again and not in prison.  I understand that we cannot questions decisions made in courts but there is concern among communities that sentences are not severe enough.  The Minister mentioned the severity of sentences in his response.  The widespread narrative is that in many instances the penalties do not meet the crime being committed, the pain and suffering inflicted, and the innocent lives destroyed by these peddlers of drugs.</p></speech>

I want to refer to the effectiveness of the minimum mandatory sentence for drug offences to which the Deputy refers.  While acknowledging, as Deputy Brendan Smith does, the separation of powers and that the matter of sentencing is an issue for the courts, I want to acknowledge the work recently carried out by the group established to undertake a strategic review of penal policy.  That group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  That group was of the view that the continuation of existing presumptive minimum sentences and the threshold for their application in drugs and other offences should be reviewed in the context of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  This recommendation was made with a view towards determining if the type of sentencing to which the Deputy refers satisfies the need for proportionality in sentencing and fulfils the objective of reducing crime.</p><p>This merits further consideration by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality because it is an important issue that is giving rise to community concerns, as evidenced by Deputy Brendan Smith's question.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by people from previously quiet communities who have never had cause to approach me or any other public representative in their lives.  They are now utterly frustrated with the prevalence of drugs and the horror being caused by the ready availability of certain drugs.  We have discussed previously in this House the unique policing requirements of the part of Border region comprising Cavan and Monaghan.  I am not suggesting that the drugs in Cavan and Monaghan are solely coming from Northern Ireland.  Far from it; they are coming from all over this State too.  That said, in his discussions with the Garda Commissioner on the allocation of resources for 2019, I appeal to the Minister to ask that particular cognisance be given to the need to provide additional resources to Border divisions.  I attended a joint policing committee meeting in Ballyconnell on Monday night last and the issue of drugs, their availability and the problems besetting communities as a result was discussed.  Widespread concern was expressed and the chief superintendent and his colleagues outlined the work being done, but they need additional resources.  I ask the Minister to ensure that due recognition is given to the unique policing demands in the Border region.</p></speech>

The review to which I referred earlier on the principle underpinning mandatory sentencing is still under consideration by my Department.  On completion of that consideration, I would be happy to share the contents of the review with Deputies and, more particularly, the justice committee.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of Garda resources..  That said, the Deputy makes a reasonable point regarding areas that present particular challenges.  A number of very significant seizures have been made in recent times by the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau in conjunction with the Revenue's custom services.  At Dublin Airport, 15 kg of heroin with an estimated street value in excess of &euro;2 million were seized.  Another consignment of drugs with an estimated value of &euro;4.6 million was intercepted at Rosslare Europort.  At my regular meetings with Garda management, I am happy to continue to voice the concerns of Deputies and, in this case, those of Deputy Brendan Smith regarding the Cavan and Monaghan area.  I assure the Deputy of the active engagement of the appropriate units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p></speech>

In north Dublin recently, a farmer approached a number of people who were on his land.  Those people subsequently viciously attacked him and he sustained serious injuries.  One of the issues raised by the Irish Farmer's Association, IFA, is the fact that if farmers identify people trespassing on their land, they cannot avail of the criminal law.  Under the law, what can farmers do if they find people on their land and want them to leave?</p></reply>

I acknowledge the interest of various farm and rural organisations, particularly the IFA, in this issue.  I meet regularly with representatives of the IFA in my constituency of Laois-Offaly.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended, contains provisions specifically relating to the unauthorised entry onto and occupation of land, including farmland.  Part IIA of that Act, comprising sections 19A to 19H, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides for offences relating to illegal trespass and occupation of land which result in a range of specified adverse consequences.  Such land includes privately-owned land and public land provided or maintained by a statutory body.  The legislation empowers An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to direct trespassers to leave the land concerned and, if necessary, remove any object belonging to them from the occupied land.  A person who is guilty of an offence under this Part of the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;4,000 or a term of imprisonment, or both.</p>  <p>  The Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act 1971 also contains provisions relating to trespass.  Under this Act it is an offence to forcibly enter land, including buildings, or remain in forcible occupation, or to encourage or advocate the commission of such an offence.  The word "forcibly" is defined as using or threatening to use force in respect of persons or property, and such action is not necessarily linked to any other crime.  A person found guilty under the Act is liable to a fine, a term of imprisonment or both.</p>  <p>  There are already significant legislative provisions and penalties in place relating to trespass and I have no immediate plans to change the law in this regard.  I am anxious to hear what Deputy O'Callaghan proposes in this regard.</p></speech>

Farmers find that when people trespass on their land, they have no remedy in the criminal law.  When they contact members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are told that officers can only intervene if there is a threat to commit a criminal offence or if criminal damage has been done.  In my constituency or that of any Dublin Deputy, if I found someone in my back garden, I would call the Garda immediately.  I suspect that garda&iacute; would regard that person as having sought to enter my house and would arrest him or her on suspicion of intending to burgle my house.  However, a different law appears to apply to people who are on farmland.  It is not enough for the Minister to state that trespass is a civil offence.  Everyone knows that trespass is a civil offence.  What is required is for the legislative measures that the Minister has stated exist to be put into operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is not happening and farmers find that if someone is on their land, they are left helpless vis-&agrave;-vis the criminal law.</p></speech>

I have already referenced relevant statutes and would add that trespass in respect of buildings is also dealt with in section 11 of the Public Order Act 1994 .  Section 13 of that Act refers to the offence of trespassing "without reasonable excuse" on a building or in the vicinity of a building in such a manner as to cause fear in another person.  There is a suite of legislation available in this area but I am keen to hear more from Deputy O'Callaghan and would be amenable to a review of the law this area if I thought it might point to a more immediate remedy, as envisaged by the Deputy.  I would add that the aforementioned Public Order Act empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request a person to desist from acting in such a manner as to amount to a breach of the peace.</p></speech>

They want there to be consequences for people for being on their land.  There may be a civil remedy available but that requires farmers to institute proceedings against unknown individuals who then have to be brought before the courts.  Farmers have to apply for injunctions before a civil court restraining those persons from coming back onto their land.  That is a very complex and detailed process.  Farmers require greater protection than that being afforded to them at present.  Their legitimate concern is that people are coming onto their property to see if there is any valuable equipment on it and with a view to returning subsequently to try to obtain that equipment.  This is something that the Minister, as a rural Deputy, will know is happening and other rural Deputies in this House tell me that it is happening frequently.  There may be trespass-related provisions on the Statute Book but, unfortunately, they are not being used by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they are not effective for farmers.</p></speech>

I would be happy to speak to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to ensure these issues are kept under review.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that rural crime in general is a key focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there is a relentless pursuit on the part of the force of those responsible for crime in rural areas.

I have requested the Courts Service to examine the requirements, including system development and resource issues, needed to enable the compilation of such statistics going forward.</p>  <p>  However, she will also be aware that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Health, is the competent authority for the implementation of EU and national legislation relating to medicines in Ireland.  One of the HPRA's roles is to investigate potential breaches of legislation and, where necessary, take corrective action, including legal proceedings.  My officials have been informed by the Department of Health that the HPRA initiated ten prosecutions relating to the unauthorised supply of anabolic steroid containing medicines between 2014 and 2017.  Of those, seven resulted in a guilty plea or a conviction; two in 2017 and five in 2018, and the remaining three cases are pending court hearings.</p>  <p>  The prosecutions have included the offences of manufacturing, advertising and supply without prescription to individuals and for wholesale supply.  If any person is offering, facilitating the supply of, or supplying anabolic steroid containing medicines in breach of the legislation, he or she risks investigation at the hands of the HPRA and may face enforcement actions up to and including prosecution.</p></speech>

We are attempting to get a clear picture on the issue from all Departments because, as the Minister pointed out, the issue does not only concern one Department.</p>  <p>  The HPRA seized 450,000 doses of anabolic steroids in 2017 in comparison to just 109,000 in 2016.  That would indicate that there is an increase in the use of such drugs.  I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of a condition known as muscle dysmorphia.  It is where a person becomes obsessively focused on not being muscular enough and it affects more men than women.  It is an issue we should tackle.  We are all having conversations about how men behave but we must also consider how men view themselves and what can be done in that regard.  Our interest is to ascertain if there is an increase in such drug usage and to try to understand the reason.</p></speech>

I would be happy to engage further as needs be.  My officials have been informed by the Department of Health that in 2017 the HPRA, working in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue's customs service, detained almost 500,000 anabolic steroid dosage units in tablets and capsules form, compared to a little more than 100,000 units detained in 2016.

I acknowledge the importance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, established in 2015, which is leading the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies, and is working in conjunction with divisional drug units across the country.</p>  <p>  From a criminal justice perspective, this works fits neatly into the actions on the part of my colleague, the Minister for Health, on the Department of Health strategy, reducing harm, supporting recovery and the new public information campaign to raise awareness of the serious side effects and the risk to health of using unprescribed anabolic steroids.  The campaign was announced in recent weeks.  Between the HPRA and the public information campaign by the Minister for Health, on the one hand, and the deterrent factor involved in the criminal justice approach of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise this important matter.</p></speech>

He was the first to raise the matter and he never loses an opportunity to raise what is an important issue to him and to many other Deputies, as well as to me.</p><p>The illegal use of quad bikes and scramblers gives rise to public safety concerns affecting a significant number of local communities.</p><p> I have asked my officials to convene cross-agency consultations to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which can assist in dealing with the misuse of these vehicles comprehensively.  It is important we determine responsibility and timeframes for the implementation of solutions identified.  This process began in April and involved the Departments of Justice and Equality, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.  The misuse of scramblers in public parks was a particular point of focus for these consultations.</p> <p> Following this engagement, legislation was brought to the attention of the Office of the Attorney General to determine whether any legislative amendments were necessary to assist in curbing activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned without giving rise to any unintended consequences.  My Department has now received formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  The advice is comprehensive in nature and is now being carefully considered by my officials, together with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the context of its responsibility for road traffic legislation.  It will be necessary to consult again with other relevant Departments and public bodies via the cross-agency forum established by my Department.  A further meeting will take place this week.</p></speech>

When I met Councillor Charlie O'Connor, a former Deputy and a colleague of Deputy Lahart, recently, he told me of the issues people are facing in Kingswood, Tallaght.  I also spoke with another colleague, Councillor Paul McAuliffe, who informed me of the same issue in Ballymun.  This is not, first and foremost, a problem particular to any one area.  It is widespread across Dublin and, I suspect, other parts of the country.  Often in the debate, my concern is that we only talk about our parks and open places but it is also happening on public roads and in private housing estates.  Elderly people are afraid to go out of their houses when these quads and scramblers are on the roads.  Parents are afraid let their children out.  During the summer, we had a tragic case in one park where a person was hit.  Much of the focus has been on this activity in parks but it is equally a nuisance and a danger to people in housing estates.</p></speech>

I extend my sympathies to his wife, Anzhela Kotsinian, and to their families.  That tragic incident all too sadly highlights how the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes can cause real damage to people, their families and communities.</p>  <p>  I am committed to actively supporting any positive action in respect of this matter.  I have received legal advice from the Attorney General and I am committing it to some study.  I have been informed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that it is also engaged in seeing how best we can deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  The use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by local authorities under the 2011 parks and open spaces by-laws.  Insofar as national parks are concerned, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has legislative powers to prohibit the unauthorised use of off-road vehicles in them.  There is a cross-departmental remit.  I am keen to liaise with Deputies Curran and Lahart, as well as Councillor Charlie O&rsquo;Connor, on this matter.  It is complex but that should not mean that it is not urgent and important.</p></speech>

Quad bikes and scramblers are dangerous and a nuisance and their use is illegal.  I regularly attend joint policing committee meetings where the Garda has clearly indicated that the crux of the problem is that it cannot enforce road traffic laws.  Garda&iacute; are not physically in a position to stop quads and scramblers.  Whether on the roads or in the parks, the same physical challenges are there.  It is both dangerous for garda&iacute; and those on the quads and scramblers.</p>  <p>  We need to look at the issue in a different way.  For example, we need to look at the regulations and legislation concerning the registration and ownership of these vehicles.  We also must look at how these vehicles can be seized after an event on intelligence led information.  In cases where the Garda and people in an estate know who are using these vehicles, we must ensure follow-up operations can take place without jeopardising and putting at risk the life and safety of either garda&iacute; or those who are illegally using them.</p></speech>

That would be only one of a number affected by the use of quad bikes and scramblers, however.  In Killinarden, one resident described 99% of the open space designated for public use in that estate being destroyed by 1% of the local community.</p>  <p>  An issue arose during the snow earlier in the year.  I refer to the incident at Lidl in Jobstown.  The Garda in Tallaght has only one four-by-four vehicle.  If a garda rocks up in a Ford Focus to deal with somebody on a scrambler or a quad bike, he or she simply has no capacity to catch that individual.  There is a resource issue involved too.</p>  <p>  I welcome the information the Minister supplied regarding a cross-departmental approach and local authorities being involved.  There needs to be a promotion of available space for people to engage in scrambling.  Both our constituencies are close to the Dublin Mountains where there are opportunities for legal scrambling and the legal use of these vehicles.  Local young people should be encouraged to move in that direction.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his continued interest in this issue.</p></speech>

In any event, the Acting Chairman will not let me.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the importance of the cross-departmental and cross-agency group.  In the lead-up to Christmas, people will be buying quad bikes and scramblers as presents.  These are mechanically propelled vehicles within the meaning of road traffic legislation.  As such, irrespective of the engine capacity, the user of a scrambler motorbike, a quad bike or a vehicle of a similar type in a public place must have motor tax, an insurance policy and a driving licence and must wear a helmet.  There are severe penalties under the road traffic laws, such as fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizures of the vehicles.  The Garda will make every effort to ensure that the existing law is firmly complied with.  In the meantime, the cross-departmental group will meet this week with a view towards dealing with this issue in an overall comprehensive way which will involve several agencies and Departments.  I am happy to keep the House further informed about this matter.</p></speech>

When joint committee's report on the general scheme was laid before the Houses in November 2013, the matter was with the Office of the Attorney General for consideration and drafting until late 2017.  At that point, my Department and I sought the Government's permission to review the draft legislation to take into account technological and other changes that had occurred in the interim.</p><p>The Government duly granted permission to review the 2013 general scheme by way of decision of 10 January 2018, aimed at establishing an independent regulatory authority for the gambling industry in Ireland.</p> <p> To advance the review of the 2013 general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill, per the Government decision of 10 January 2018, I chaired an interdepartmental working group on gambling, comprising all stakeholder Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.  The group met on five occasions between February and June of this year and reviewed all the provisions of the 2013 Scheme as well as other relevant developments since.  Further, the group in its deliberations had regard to the Government's preference for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority.  It is the Government's view that an independent body would be best placed to conduct the significant and complex range of licensing, regulatory, monitoring, inspection and enforcement tasks of the industry in all its manifestations.  The group is currently finalising its report which I hope to bring to Government for consideration as soon as possible.</p> <p> I would also like to take the opportunity to update the Deputy on the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill, which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is based on Part 13 of the Civil Law and Courts (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 approved for publication by the Government.  The amendments proposed under this Bill address certain deficiencies with regard to the conduct of activities regulated under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, and provide for the modernisation of that Act by way of, among other matters, updating stake and prize limits and standardising the minimum gambling and betting age to 18.  Further, it is intended that this Bill will provide greater clarity and certainty for all promoters and participants involved, primarily in local fundraising efforts, and to ensure the best conduct in the promotion of such activities.  It is hoped this Bill will be published before the end of the current Oireachtas session.</p></reply>

As I said in the opening question, it was in 2011 that the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, announced plans to change the law on gambling.  In 2013, the Department of Justice and Equality published the general scheme of a Gambling Control Bill which was expected to update the 1956 legislation.  Since the publication of that general scheme in 2013, there has been extremely limited progress.  We engaged on this matter and were hoping the Government would bring forward legislation but such was its delay that earlier this year Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward its own legislation based on the general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill.  My colleagues, Deputies Jack Chambers and Rabbitte, were instrumental in that.  We produced the legislation and I think it got through Second Stage in this House.  It is now the responsibility of the Government to ensure that Bill gets through or its own legislation is promptly produced.  We have waited too long and we need adequate answers.</p></speech>

We have established a working group which is reviewing the main provisions of the 2013 Gambling Control Bill.  In this regard, the group gave particular attention to considering the optimum structure of the proposed regulatory authority having regard to the decision on this by Government on 10 January 2018.  The group considered governance and logistical practicalities of the establishment of the proposed regulator.  Other issues considered by the group included the future licensing of gambling activities, including gaming, arcades, lotteries and casinos, combatting possible money laundering through gambling, improved protection for consumers and vulnerable persons, the approach to be taken to advertising sponsorship and the promotion of gambling activities and match fixing.</p>  <p>  The working group will inform the redrafting of the general scheme and assist in the achievement of the objectives of betting regulation, the channelling of all gambling in legitimate ways, enhancing consumer protection and increasing the protection of vulnerable persons.</p>  <p>  The Government did not oppose the Private Members' Bill.  It was very useful to have that Bill and to debate the issues.  As I noted during the Second Stage debate, it is a reproduction, as the Deputy said, in its entirety of the general scheme of the Bill approved by Government and published in 2013.  The Private Members' Bill, surprisingly, made no mention of the significant decision of Government in January 2018 to update the 2013 scheme and to produce independent statutory regulation.</p></speech>

It approved the proposal to establish an independent regulatory authority, which we support, for control and regulation of the gambling industry.  We are told that this interdepartmental working group has met on five occasions since January 2018.  What progress has been made on this?  Where is the draft legislation?  The Government and Fine Gael have been talking about this since 2011, which is seven years ago.  It is hard to understand why it is taking so long for a Government Bill to be introduced in this House.  The current situation is untenable and unfair.  It is not simply unfair to people who are in the business of gambling who need to be properly regulated and many of them recognise that.  It is especially unfair, however, on the very many victims and their families of gambling addiction throughout this country.  We cannot say we empathise with those people until we regulate the gambling business.</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Callaghan said, the first Bill was brought forward by the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, more than seven years ago now.  The scale of the harm that gambling can do has been laid bare before the public in recent times.  In many instances, it has devastated families and individuals.  There is a clear need for action.  Ireland is recognised as a jurisdiction that is practically the wild west in terms of lack of regulation.  Previous Ministers and the Department in previous iterations recognised that lack of regulation and the need for legislation, and yet it has not progressed.  There is a wide consensus in society, even within the industry but most of all among families devastated by problem gambling, that this needs to be dealt with.  Gambling is something can have a place, provided it is properly regulated.  However, that is not the case now and unless we legislate, people will continue to have free rein.</p></speech>

I am also frustrated at the lack of progress.  We had five meetings, which I chaired.  They were long detailed meetings and I was struck by the complexity and how far this area has developed in the last number of years.  There were some very serious people around the table representing almost all Government Departments and agencies concerned with this issue.  I have seen a draft copy of the report and it is quite detailed, long and involved.</p>  <p>  While regulation is important and desirable and we will have it, it must be stressed that no amount of regulation can act as a panacea for problem gambling and gambling addiction.  Even in a well-regulated jurisdictions, such as Britain, 0.8% of the population aged over 16 identified as problem gamblers in 2015.  This underlines the fact that problem gambling and gambling addiction are ultimately public health issues.  It is important colleagues understand that regulation will only go so far in assisting problem gambling and that addiction is a health issue.</p></speech>

As the Minister will know, many community groups want to put them in place.  In Laois and Offaly, communities located close to the motorway are affected by crime due to their proximity to it.  Community groups have raised money voluntarily.  Grants are available to erect CCTV, which are very welcome, but, unfortunately, they cannot be drawn down because of the problem of who controls the data.  Is it the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or is it the local authority?

The legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must conform to three conditions, namely, be approved by the local joint policing committee, JPC, and I acknowledge Deputy Stanley's attendance at a recent JPC in my constituency from which I received a report; have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, which I understand is forthcoming in most cases on the basis of local advice; and have the support of the relevant local authority, which must under law act as data controller.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their being set up.  In accordance with this legal framework, I understand the majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes.  This is the case in the current grant aid scheme, as administered by my Department, and in the previous grant aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities across the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to know, as confirmed by the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s office as recently as May of this year, that the Data Protection Commissioner does not have any concerns about the legislative basis for CCTV.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>However, the office is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV.  We expect findings from this process to be of assistance to all concerned and, in particular, to local authorities.   My Department is engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association to clarify queries regarding the scheme and to offer assistance to resolve concerns. </p> <p> To date, there have been 27 applications to the scheme.  Twenty applications have been approved for grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further four applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered.</p></speech>

Stephen was going about his daily job and was tragically killed as he sat in a parked car on Main Street in Castleblayney.  He was a family man, only 47 years of age in the prime of his life, and it was a life that was being very well lived.  His wife, two children and family and the Border community are this morning reeling, their lives ripped asunder.  He was the assistant sacristan in his local church and was described as the go-to man for many in his community.  The tribute earlier on "Morning Ireland" from his local canon reflected that.</p>  <p>  The clips we saw on RT&Eacute; and on all media last night from CCTV in Castleblayney on Tuesday evening are like something from the movies, except they are very real for the family and the community.  After crashing into Stephen's parked car at high speed, the driver then drove on and crashed into a pole.  He has since been detained.  It seems that earlier this same person arrived at Castleblayney Garda station, was recognised by a garda who had previously had dealings with him and who then tried to stop this person leaving the station.  The person left, drove on regardless and this tragedy unfolded.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will also join me in paying tribute to Garda Michael Devlin who showed enormous courage and who, I understand, was previously injured on duty.  He showed more courage and bravery again on Tuesday evening and we think of him and his family today.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will agree that, in isolation, this story is horrendously tragic.  When we read the reports today about how the suspect was on the run for a number of years and was well known to the Garda and the PSNI, it will make people question how he was allowed to walk our streets free, let alone drive on our roads, and how many other such cases are there within our system?  Can he confidently say that our garda&iacute; are resourced and have the available knowledge to brief them on this kind of suspect were they to meet a suspect or another one, particularly along the Border which they cross over and back, in such circumstances?  Does the T&aacute;naiste or the Government have a plan to review this incident and how it happened?  How many other people is the Government aware of who are on the run in situations similar to this?  Will the Government and the Garda Commissioner discuss this matter the PSNI?  Are there plans to increase co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and the courts system to ensure that those who are convicted of an offence on either side of the Border are not allowed to roam free for years and cause more tragedy?</p></speech>

Like him, I extend the sympathy of everybody in this House to the Marron family.  Two children and a wife have been left without a father today because of an outrageous and tragic set of circumstances that could not have been anticipated for the family concerned.  We are thinking of them today and they are very much in our thoughts and prayers.</p>  <p>  I also want to recognise the courage and bravery of Garda Devlin, who is in a critical condition as a result of trying to do his duty.  We hope that he will make a full and speedy recovery.  </p>  <p>  The issue of course is concerning.  The Minister has asked for a full report on what happened.  There will also be a full Garda investigation.  It is important that we are careful about what we say in order that we do not in any way undermine the detail of that investigation.  </p>  <p>  On some of the Deputy's more general questions, there is probably better co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI now than ever before on cross-Border crime to ensure they are responding appropriately to people moving on both sides of the Border.  We need to wait to get a full detailed report on what happened here and to allow the Garda and, if necessary, the PSNI to do their job in carrying out a full and detailed investigation and, presumably, a prosecution.</p></speech>

We need to ensure that warrants on both sides of the Border can be executed in both jurisdictions and that this situation does not happen again.  I ask that whatever investigation the Minister is undertaking be robust, efficient and done quickly so that we can give reassurance to communities.  The family and the public need to know this will not happen again.</p>  <p>  There have been similar cases.  We are all familiar with the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell.  The driver of the car that killed him had more than 42 serious convictions and was well known on both sides of the Border.  The O'Farrell family have been stoic, brave and courageous in their search for justice for Shane, and I acknowledge, in particular, the role Deputy McGuinness has played in this.  They have made complaints to the Garda, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Department of Justice and Equality.  They have been requesting a commission of inquiry into his death and this House passed a motion to allow this to happen.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that commission will proceed along with the wishes as expressed by this House?</p></speech>

When that report from GSOC is available to the Minister, we will take the appropriate action at that stage.</p>  <p>  Regarding this tragedy that happened to the Marron family, this case has also been referred to GSOC and, therefore, I am somewhat limited in what I can say but it is important to say that there will be full investigations and reports by the Garda and GSOC to make sure that we understand what happened here and that we learn full lessons from these tragedies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900012#K01000"><p>This morning, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs launched a report prepared by her Department on the early years sector.  It is a comprehensive survey with responses from almost 4,000 childcare services across the State.  Its findings, however, do not paint a pretty picture.  The findings in respect of the cost of childcare reinforce the point which was made time and again by my colleague, Deputy Denise Mitchell, particularly in the budget debate where she outlined that the cost of childcare in this State is among the highest in the developed world.  That is a massive issue with a wider social and economic impact.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the cost of providing childcare amounts to a second mortgage every month for many families.  It makes more sense for some of them for one or other parent to opt out of the workforce due to the scandalous costs involved.  That simply is not right and cannot continue.</p>  <p>  The average cost of childcare, as outlined in the report, is &euro;178 per week or more than &euro;700 per month.  In many parts of this State, it costs more than &euro;200 per week in some areas, including in the T&aacute;naiste's city of Cork.</p><p>In my county, Donegal, we have seen costs rise year on year at the second highest level across the State, at &euro;15 per week.  It is ludicrous that we are seeing those types of increases for hard-pressed families.  In addition, the report finds that capacity is decreasing and the number of available spaces in the sector is falling.  Separate from this morning's report but crucially linked are the difficulties in the sector and the challenges faced by thousands of childcare workers.  It is a sector which, in many cases, pays well below the living wage which means that we are losing experienced, well-trained childcare workers who are going into other professions.  These are skilled, trained workers who are being let down.  When we lose them, it means we are losing places and have a lower quality service in the early years, which are crucial for our child's development.  We cannot just keep our fingers crossed and hope that this will change.  We need to actively work towards fair pay for workers in the sector.</p> <p> High quality, affordable childcare is socially and academically beneficial to children.  We all know that.  It also benefits society and the economy by allowing parents to return to work.  We need an early years sector that we can be truly proud of, which we do not have at this point, given the costs and the low pay within the sector.  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that the system is desperately in need of support?  Does he accept that there needs to be reform of the universal childcare subsidy with increased investment by the State to help offset the cost to these families?  Does he accept we need to see an increase in capitation grants to support providers in delivering quality childcare?  Does he accept that there is a need for a sector-wide pay agreement to ensure that every childcare worker in the sector receives, at a minimum, the living wage?</p></speech>

Over the last four years, we have seen the amount of money available for reforming and changing the childcare sector increase by 117%.  The available budget for childcare has gone from &euro;265 million to &euro;574 million over four budgets.  The report the Deputy refers to shows that more families than ever are taking up childcare subsidies and supports.  More than 200,000 children are now subject to those supports.  There has been a 24% increase on the previous year.  The families of almost 40,000 children have now benefitted from non-means-tested subsidies introduced last year, worth &euro;1,040 per year.</p>  <p>  There are signs, although they are only signs, that childcare costs are stabilising.  The cost of full-time childcare has increased by approximately 2% on average over the last year.  This compares to an increase of 4% in the previous year.  It has halved.  We are not there yet.  The Taoiseach often talks about this.  It is about incremental change as we can afford it.  Childcare is arguably the best example of that in government, where we are seeing dramatic change happening over a relatively short period.  We now have a ten year strategy called First 5, which was launched last week.  We saw enhanced subsidies introduced last September which have been accessed by more than 84,000 families.  By the end of next year, which will mark enormous progress in the childcare sector, we will see the introduction of a new affordable childcare scheme.  There will be significant build-up to that.  I accept that this is an area where Ireland has not performed well by international and EU standards but those statistics are changing.  The affordability of childcare in Ireland is changing and the supports available for families on low incomes are changing quickly.  We need to continue down that path.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900013#L00300"><p>The T&aacute;naiste is right that it is changing.  I will outline what the changes are.  In 24 out of 30 areas, the cost for full-time childcare is increasing.  In Cork, it increased by &euro;15.29 per week, by &euro;18.70 in Kerry, &euro;15.60 in Donegal, &euro;14.18 in Laois and &euro;14.27 Leitrim.  I could go on and outline the other 19 counties where the cost of childcare has increased.  The reality is that the measures being introduced by the Government are not keeping pace with the increase in fees being charged to hard-pressed families.  That is at a point when we have the highest cost of childcare in the developed world.  There needs to be radical action, more support and reform of the universal child credit.  The report stipulates clearly that the capacity within the system is not keeping pace with demand.  It also makes it clear that because of the issue with low wages in the sector, we are losing high-quality, highly-trained people with more academic progression than ever seen before, yet the turnaround in a year is 24% of staff.  Unless we deal with this and get our heads out of the sand, we will see more and more pressure not only in the childcare sector but for families.  Will the T&aacute;naiste not look at proposals that we have put forward that would cut the cost of childcare in half and ensure that every worker in the sector would, at a minimum, have the living wage?</p></speech>

We are clearly coming from a difficult place with regard to childcare costs in Ireland.  If the Deputy looks at turnover in staff, where people are paid low wages, there has been a decrease of 3.5% in staff turnover in the last year.  It is still too high but it is moving in the right direction.</p></speech>

We have seen other measures that complement the changes to childcare, from the initial introduction of one free year of pre-school to now having two free years of pre-school for parents and families; an extension to paternity leave; and two weeks of paid paternity leave.  Across multiple areas, we are trying to make childcare more affordable, to make sure that the quality is guaranteed and audited and we are trying to ensure that the working conditions within childcare facilities also improve incrementally.  All of that cannot happen overnight but much is happening and we are seeing dramatic increases in the financial resources going into driving that change.</p></speech>

Where is the evidence of that?  In all my time in this House, never has the majority voice in the D&aacute;il been ignored so often as in this D&aacute;il by this Government.</p>  <p>  In June of this year, the D&aacute;il passed a motion on Dublin Fire Brigade.  We recognised that Dublin Fire Brigade provides crucial ambulance services.  The D&aacute;il rejected the suggestion of merging that ambulance service with the National Ambulance Service and of removing any element of Dublin Fire Brigade's fire-based emergency medical service system.  The D&aacute;il accepted a Labour Party amendment to that motion, calling on the Government to implement in full the report of the expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin which was published in December 2015.  What has the Government's response been?  As far as we can tell, management in Dublin City Council is not engaging in a process of discussion with Dublin Fire Brigade.  We understand that simple, low-cost technical solutions are available to address specific concerns raised by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  This would permit a seamless communication link-up between Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service.</p>  <p>  We have invested over the years to create a system of fire-based emergency response, including ambulances and highly-trained paramedics in our fire service.  It is fairly unique for the fire service to be trained paramedics.  It is a great addition.  Other countries are moving in that direction.  In the UK, there is a move towards integrating blue light services.  They see that as best practice, to generate efficiencies and enhance public safety.  We have been doing it in this city for over 100 years.</p><p>For some unknown reason, we have decided to move in the other direction from what is now regarded as best practice elsewhere, which is to model on what has been achieved in Dublin.  There is a concern that our fire-based ambulance services are not being properly funded.  This, of course, in and of itself is a risk to public safety.  My simple question to the T&aacute;naiste is will he now undertake to implement the resolutions passed by the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to maintain and fully restore Dublin Fire Brigade's ambulance service for this city and county?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, this has been an ongoing discussion for quite some time, trying to ensure we have the best possible pre-hospital emergency response capacity in Dublin.  Undoubtedly we have a very well trained and highly capable fire service in Dublin but we also have a very competent ambulance service linked to hospitals and the HSE.</p>  <p>  With respect, I do not think it should be politicians who decide on what the best mix and collaboration between two excellent services should look like in future.  We should leave it to the experts and the management teams of both to interact.  Of course, we have to provide much of the funding to make sure the service is well funded and can do the job it needs to do but the actual technical elements of emergency response and using the resources we have in the Dublin fire service as well as the ambulance service should be left to the experts, with respect.</p></speech>

It is under the Constitution that we vote the moneys for them and hold the services to account.  We are accountable, in turn, to the people for this.  That is how democracies work.  We do not hive them off for others to make a decision on these matters.  In this case, our common objective is what is best practice.  We have debated this in Private Members' time and the House made a decision on it.  Is it the T&aacute;naiste's view this was a waste of time?  Why would we have a debate if we have no control over it and our say does not count?</p>  <p>  I understand a process headed by Kieran Mulvey is under way, but my information is it is going nowhere because of a lack of engagement by Dublin City Council.  Will the T&aacute;naiste at least give a commitment there will be open transparent analysis of the facts so the common objective we have of providing the best, safest and most efficient emergency services for the city and county will be maintained?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, the way democracy works is we have to ensure we are accountable for the decisions made but we also need to rely on the expertise of those involved.  Politicians are not, with respect, paramedics.</p></speech>

We also know Ireland has the fifth lowest revenue to GDP ratio in the European Union, the figures being 35% for Ireland and 40% for the EU.  Ireland is a low tax country.  The real question is why it is a low tax country.  Of course, the answer to this question is that the Government and previous Governments pursued a conscious and deliberate policy of protecting the massive wealth of the rich and powerful in our society and has allowed them not to pay their fair share of taxation.  We know the top 10% of income recipients pay a smaller proportion of their income in all taxes than the bottom 10% of recipients.  We know the top 10% of financial asset holders now have approximately &euro;40 billion more than they had at peek boom levels in 2006 and they are not asked to pay a cent from this windfall.  We also know the share of gross income going to the top 1% of earners increased from 34% in 2011 to 39% in 2016.  We also know that more than half of the increase in total income over the past five years has gone to 10% of the highest earners.</p>  <p>  The country has become unequal and this has been accelerated in the recent budget.  We know the 300 wealthiest individuals, who have &euro;100 billion, will not pay a cent of tax on this.  We also know, because the Comptroller and Auditor General told us recently, that 83 high net worth individuals, with assets in excess of &euro;50 million each, declare taxable income of less than the average industrial wage of &euro;36,500.  This is perfectly legal but absolutely shameful.</p>  <p>  The country is profoundly unequal and it is a far cry from the vision of equality and fairness set out 100 years ago in the democratic programme of the First D&aacute;il that met 100 yd. from here in the Mansion House in January 1919.  Will the Government bring forward legislation to remedy the situation revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General recently whereby 83 high net worth individuals, with in excess of &euro;50 million in assets each, declare taxable incomes of less than the average industrial wage?  At present, this is perfectly legal under legislation being presided over by the Government.  Will the Government introduce a supplementary budget in January to reverse the inequity of the recent budget and make the rich and powerful pay their fair share in taxation?</p></speech>

The priority has been on increasing public expenditure, improving public services and supporting people who need the support of the State in multiple sectors that have not had the type of investment needed through a recessionary period.  Expenditure versus tax cuts has been provided on a ratio of 2:1 repeatedly in budget after budget.</p><p> I do not accept that Ireland is a low-tax economy.  The Government must always try to get the balance right between incentivising business growth, innovation and employment and incentives to work and progress through the workforce with the responsibilities of the State to have a fair and equitable tax policy.  Independent reports on Ireland's tax policy from the OECD and others show that the country is seen internationally as having a very progressive tax policy in terms of the redistribution of wealth.  We should be proud of that.</p></speech>

It is an excuse to allow the rich and powerful - people who have massive incomes and assets - pay little or no taxation and certainly not their fair share.  The budget was for the super-rich.  It was unequal.  For example, 1.8 million workers are on incomes of less than &euro;30,000.  That is 40% of the workforce, and they got no relief in the budget.  The vast majority of the &euro;356 million for tax relief in the budget went to people with significant incomes, certainly well in excess of &euro;100,000.  Allowing the rich and powerful to avoid paying their fair share of taxation is simply not compatible with providing decent, modern public services.  That is why we have a housing emergency, 10,000 people homeless, 780,000 people living below the poverty line, 70,000 children growing up in poverty and why the Society of St. Vincent de Paul received 137,000 calls last year and paid &euro;27 million to needy families.</p></speech>

On foot of the debate last week, we are aware of the many initiatives that are in place.  We are trying to have a long-term plan for a fair deal-type scheme for 2021.  I have spoken about this matter on numerous occasions in the House.  We hope to publish the plan in 2020 in order to give people a look at what it will involve.  Until we get to that point, we will not be able to meet the demand that exists.  There is no point in pretending that we will.  Last year, we delivered 17 million home help hours and I hope to improve on that this year.  The service plan will be agreed in the next week to ten days.  We certainly will improve on that figure but we will not get to where we need to be.  The current system is not fit for purpose and involves sending people 7 miles north or 8 miles south for half an hour here and half an hour there.  We cannot get the people we need to deliver the service either.  There are challenges on a number of fronts.  We are making every effort to try to allocate whatever resources are available, but we are competing with other areas.  Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on health is seeking equalisation for consultants, home help and other items, all of which cost &euro;20 million, &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.  We cannot provide it all.  We can only continue incrementally to do the best we can.</p></speech>

I will focus on one narrow element.  During the week, there was an easterly wind which briefly closed Dublin Port and which caused traffic to be backed up from the port and out towards the airport.  This is the main entrance and egress point for the bulk of our trade so we must have specific plans to deal with the imports and exports coming to and leaving this country.  The other port is Rosslare Europort.  That port needs specific funding to complete the M11 access and to ensure the port is reconfigured to deal with the new circumstances.  Will the T&aacute;naiste share what planning is taking place for these specific points, which could be catastrophic if we are not prepared?</p></speech>

It is important to say that those contingency plans are based on a central case scenario.  This assumes that we would have a transition period for at least 21 months and that we would have a withdrawal agreement signed off and ratified.  Of course, if we have to put in place contingency planning for a more urgent situation involving a no-deal Brexit, we have been working for months on this, but we do not believe that it is prudent to publish anything in that regard-----</p></speech>

There is a backlog of 80,000 tests from women who underwent cervical screening in recent months.  CervicalCheck has issued a warning on its website about a wait of more than five months in a small number of cases.  This follows revelations that an additional laboratory in the UK, which is run by MedLab Pathology and which screens tests in Dublin, is being asked to reduce some of the backlog.  During this entire scandal, tests are being sent to private companies abroad who then outsource the tests.  As was discovered recently, in many cases CervicalCheck did not even know where the tests were going.  It is clear that lives are being put at risk for profit and for cost.  Is it now the time to re-nationalise the screening of all of these important diagnostic tests and bring them back into the public health system?</p></speech>

I also pay tribute to one of their colleagues who died recently, Sergeant Martin Hopkins, who was an excellent young garda.</p>  <p>  It is just not fair.  It has been announced more times, including by previous Ministers such as Deputies Alan Kelly and Michael Lowry and many others.  We know some contracts were signed and there is a public private partnership, but when are we going to see any movement towards putting the station on the new site?  We had an announcement this week about funding for the site at Kickham Barracks.  I welcome that but there has been nothing for the Garda station or the garda&iacute; who work in those appalling conditions.

Unfortunately, when the opportunity arose in the D&aacute;il to support such "positive actions", the Government failed to do so.

I am pleased to say that the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill 2018 proposes only one amendment to one section of the legislation that was enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this year.  The section the Bill seeks to amend, or rather to replace, is section 30.  The version of section 30 that was enacted deals with the micro-targeting and profiling of children.  It provides expressly that it would be an offence under the Act for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child as defined by section 29 for the purposes of direct marketing, profiling or micro-targeting.</p><p>The purpose of section 30, as enacted, is to protect children from being marketed junk food and drinks.  The total lifetime cost of childhood obesity in Ireland is estimated to be approximately &euro;4.6 billion.  In addition, there is a significant problem with the number of children experiencing childhood obesity.  At present, research estimates that 55,000 children currently living in Ireland and 85,000 on the island of Ireland will die prematurely due to being overweight or obese.  We note research by the World Obesity Federation which predicts that, by 2025, up to 141,000 schoolchildren in Ireland will be overweight or obese and as many as 9,000 will have impaired glucose intolerance.  The consequences of childhood obesity are significant, not just for the individual child as he or she develops into adulthood but also for the healthcare system.</p><p>The purpose of section 30 is to deal with that problem.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality did not commence the section as a result of advice he received from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that it is incompatible with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  There are two concerns in this regard.  The section, as enacted, expands upon the permitted restrictions to the processing of personal data.  There was a concern that the term &quot;micro-targeting&quot; was non-specific and undefined and that, consequently, people who were committing an offence did not know the specific nature of that offence and that, as a result, the provision would be unfair on them.  The Office of the Attorney General wrote to the European Commission outlining its concerns and asked it for its views regarding the compatibility of section 30 of the Act.  The Office of the Attorney General confirmed that the section would not be brought into effect until such time as it received information and advice from the Commission.</p><p>We note that advice was provided by the European Commission which clarified that, as set out in recital 38 of the GDPR, children merit special protection, particularly where the personal data of children is being used for marketing or creating personality-of-user profiles.  The letter confirmed that while direct marketing to children is a permissible activity under the GDPR, this provision must be balanced by the interests of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data, especially where the data subject is a child.  Consequently, the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing is not unlawful.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a new wording for section 30, which seeks to overcome the concerns identified by the Office of the Attorney General and to take into account the advice presented by the European Commission.  The wording is consistent with the wording of Article 22 of the GDPR and the rights and restrictions it introduces.  It removes the reference to there being &quot;an offence&quot; and replaces it with the word &quot;unlawful&quot;, and it will make it easier for a data subject to vindicate his or her rights under the Data Protection Act.  It also removes any debate as to whether an offence has been lawfully created.  The Bill proposes to amend section 30 of the Data Protection Act so that we can seek to give effect to the protection that no doubt everyone in the House believes should apply to protect children from micro-targeting, particularly in the context of junk food and junk drinks.</p></speech>

We are hoping the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and others will have seen that the housing and homelessness crisis has become such an epidemic that it is now necessary to undertake these measures.  The Bill is urgently required to prevent many of the cases of homelessness that we are now seeing.  Homelessness has increased by 57.4% since this Government came into office.  The shameful figures of 10,000 homeless in emergency accommodation is widely known.  However, the much larger effects of hidden homelessness and the ongoing ripple of homelessness for everybody is also very important.</p><p>The solution to the housing and homelessness crisis is of course the building on public land of thousands of new public homes that are affordable for people to buy or rent.  Doing so would take people off the waiting lists and make homes available to the thousands of families struggling with rent and unable to get mortgage approval.  This Bill aims to put a bandage on the haemorrhage to stop the ongoing evictions that are taking place.  On 26 May, the <i>Irish Independent </i>outlined the main reasons for terminations of tenancies.  Some 36% are because a landlord is selling; 16% because a family member is moving in; and 10% due to renovation.  If passed, the Bill will give tenants the right to remain in a property if it is being sold.  It would allow a tenancy continue in the case of renovation and would require compensation to be paid to a tenant where a property is required for family use, hopefully to act as a deterrent for abuse of that aspect of the law.  The chief executive of Threshold has said many landlords are abusing the legislation to hike up rent yields by using &quot;fake sale&quot;, or by falsely saying there is a family member moving in or that there is a need for renovations.  They are called dubious terminations.  These are not just loopholes; the D&aacute;il has been made well aware of them and has refused to close them.  They need to be closed.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Commercial tenants can remain in a property but human tenants are evicted when a property is being sold.  That is Leo Varadkar's and Fine Gael's Ireland.</p> <p> The Bill makes a range of other changes to improve the position of tenants.  Clarity will be given to the landlord-tenant relationship where a receiver takes possession.  Tenancies of more than two months will be given much more security and there is also an extension of notice periods.</p> <p> Another important aspect of the Bill that was not covered in the 2016 Bill is giving tenant rights to students in specific student accommodation.  Solidarity has been in contact with USI about this and we are very anxious to advance it in the Bill.</p> <p> The homelessness crisis is getting more depraved.  This morning I was contacted by a young couple.  The young man works nights.  He effectively has no access to emergency accommodation because he works nights.  Those faced with homelessness and housing crises are working people who often get up very early in the morning.  In this man's case they are trying to have a home to which to return when he finishes work early in the morning.  What does it say about capitalism that working people are not even able to secure accommodation?  It is back to Dickensian times.</p> <p> Given this D&aacute;il's ideological commitment to profit for private landlords and investors, rents are skyrocketing.  A one-bedroom apartment in Berlin or Vienna would cost &euro;8,500 less than Dublin.  In Paris it would cost &euro;4,500 less.  In Copenhagen it would cost &euro;3,000 less.  Given the commitment to capitalism and private profit, the law gives more weight to landlords and private property rights than to the right of people to a home.  Thousands of young people are suffering.  Many who are living with parents may want to move on in life, but are unable to do so.  The National Housing and Homelessness Coalition has called for a demonstration on Saturday, starting at the Garden of Remembrance at 2 p.m.  I hope this is the start of a massive movement against the housing crisis and for real action to build public homes.  This Bill is a contribution to that movement.</p></speech>

In 2017, the Minister informed me that, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, &quot;the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment, ENP, to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income&quot;.  She also told me the scheme was demand-led and was costing &euro;32 million in 2017.</p><p>I have received many complaints from constituents and I have received advice from their legal advisers to the effect that the addition of this reference to unforeseen expenditure is illegal and is not in the legislation.  When one reads over it, one sees that there is no basis for adding this administrative condition regarding the exceptional needs payment.  One example I encountered is where, say, a grandmother had a fatal illness and when the issue of funeral expenses arose following her death, while it may have been an exceptional expense for the family, it was not necessarily unforeseen.  The test in the 2005 legislation is that payment may be made if exceptional circumstances arise but it appears the Department is erecting a further hurdle to make it more difficult to secure exceptional needs payments.  The Department's interpretation of the matter is basically illegal.  With regard to the definitions, the statutory test in the 2005 Act includes the word &quot;exceptional&quot;.  I am informed that to seek to add the further statutory hurdle of &quot;unforeseen&quot; is unlawful.</p><p>In 2016, Mr. Justice Hogan gave an explanation of the meaning of the word &quot;exceptional&quot; in the case of McE <i>v</i>. Residential Institutions Redress Board.  From this decision, it is clear that &quot;exceptional&quot; means exceptional circumstances <i>simpliciter</i>, with the standard of exceptionality measured by reference to contemporary standards prevailing within the general public.  To include the additional standard of &quot;unforeseen&quot; appears unlawful.  A number of the legal advisers of constituents have pursued legal actions in respect of this definition.  It is notable that those cases were settled before the matter went to court.  The reason they are being settled by the Department is that the Minister does not have a leg to stand on in legal terms.  She should accept the amendment and change the 2005 Act.</p><p>It appears that a gross anomaly has arisen on foot of the implementation of austerity from 2008, when the Government crushed the social protection budget and tried to, at all costs, keep it under &euro;19 billion.  The area of exceptional was most vulnerable at that time and it was where the Government made the biggest savings.</p><p>One of the major problems that arises relates to the fact that the Government does not keep records of the people who have applied.  The Minister provided detailed information from 2017 and earlier this year which shows that approximately 9,000 applications per month are successful.  However, the Department does not keep a record of the applications that have not been successful, particularly those that have been refused because of this additional administrative law that the House has not sanctioned.  I am informed that, of the 100,000 successful applications for exceptional needs payments per year, it is impossible to know how many eligible applicants are being refused due to what is clearly an improper test being applied.  As stated, the Department is continuing to apply this test and it is clear that this is due to the powers granted to deciding officers under section 201 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  The Minister's predecessor made law on the hoof during the years of austerity, which was wrong.  The Minister should accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that it was never in the law; it was never intended to be in the law.  I ask the Deputy to consider not pressing the amendment on the basis that because it was never in the law, it should never have been put into the guidelines.  For some reason, it was put into the guidelines.  The Deputy can blame who he likes but it certainly was not me who did that.  However, I removed it last January.  I would be disheartened if the Deputy is able to tell me that people are still being refused exceptional needs payments on the basis of unforeseen circumstances since January because I specifically changed the guidelines at that time.</p>  <p>  Exceptional needs payments are for the purposes of meeting exceptional needs.  If people could see such needs arising, they might not be exceptional.  Either way, the reason we are here is as the last bastion of a source of income for people.  If they need our help, they need our help.  People do not choose to have exceptional needs.  It was never in the legislation and, therefore, it was never a condition.  While it was put into the guidelines, I took it out last January, so it should not be happening this year.</p></speech>

It relates to a point raised by Deputy Penrose regarding post-2012 pensioners and the date from which the change kicks in, that is, 1 September.  The point the Deputy made was that there is an argument the scheme should kick in earlier, on 6 April.  If there is some rationale for it being 1 September, the Minister might explain that.</p></speech>

It does not bear any changing of the date.  The introduction of the new bands happened on the date of the introduction of the new legislation with regard to the T12 project.</p>  <p>  I also take the opportunity to put on record a point concerning an amendment Deputy O'Dea kindly withdrew from the domiciliary care allowance section of the Bill on Committee Stage.  It relates to our inability, under the current regulations, to recognise that parents have new family relationship arrangements for minding children.  As a result of the five-day rule in regulation, domiciliary care allowance is being withheld in the cases of some children.  I am proposing to change the regulations in the coming weeks and I have correspondence to come to the Deputy in that regard.  I thank the Deputy for withdrawing the amendment.  I will make the amendments to the regulations in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

There are serious issues facing carers.  The rule that they have to provide care for at least 35 hours a week restricts them from getting a job because they are limited to 15 hours work a week.  This is also the case for education.  We see more young carers now caring for family members and others.  That will have a long-term impact on them because they can study for only 15 hours a week.  We know of the huge saving carers make for this State because they get only &euro;16 above the jobseeker's payment.  They save the State millions of euro.  Everyone acknowledges that, and the Minister does as well.</p><p>I am asking for a review of the carer's allowance, its impact on them and the long-term impact in terms of pension entitlements because if a carer is caring for 20 years or more they will not benefit from the total contributions approach, TCA.  I had proposed that a review be carried out and brought back within three months.  I have reworded the amendment to have that review and report within six months.  There was broad agreement that if that change was made we could proceed with this amendment.</p></speech>

One in 20 people in Ireland today is a carer.  It is estimated that number will rise to one in five by 2030.  We have to get ready for that.  There are several problems with the carer's allowance as operated.  There is lack of flexibility around the number of hours a person can work.  I appreciate that if somebody is to be a carer they cannot work full-time outside the home but there should be some flexibility in the eligibility conditions.  In addition, Family Carers Ireland and other worthy associations have made several recommendations that would substantially improve the carer's allowance at fairly minimal cost to the Exchequer and make it much more efficient.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brady tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and wanted a report within three months but we took the view that six months might be a more realistic timescale.  He has changed it to six months and in view of that I support the amendment.</p></speech>

Carers work extremely hard and get nothing for it.  They get only a pittance that does not come anywhere near the minimum wage.  I heard an example this morning of a lady who has come back from England.  She is 50 odd years of age.  She worked for 30 years in England and bought a house, which she sold.  She brought home approximately &euro;200,000.  She is now at home looking after her father, keeping him in his home.  She does not want anything from the State except a GP visit card.  I asked her what about the carer's allowance.  She said she was not entitled to it.  I told her of course she was because if her dad had to go into an institution, it would cost &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,500 a week, or more in Dublin.  In the country, it is an average of &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,200.  She said she would have to go through the means test.  It is abominable.  This lady is not in my constituency but carers have been a personal crusade of mine since the day I came in here 26 years ago.  It is time to abolish that means test.  It is deterring a person like that lady who is obviously entitled to it.  She is now sending the money she got when she sold her house in England.  A trip to the doctor costs &euro;60 or &euro;70.</p>  <p>  The problem in this situation is that the demands of caring affect the health of the carer.  I saw my uncle doing it many years ago, looking after his elderly mother.  It is some demand.  I am very proud of people, in-laws, sons and daughters and other relatives who look after people in their own homes.  We should salute them.</p>  <p>  When I was a councillor I was abused for advocating rural planning.  One of the reasons for this was that the son or daughter, nephew or niece could get a house near people in their own area.  The great environmentalists said I was an environmental vandal.  I was very proud to be an environmental vandal if it meant keeping people in their own place.  This is one of the reasons for a review of the carer's allowance.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brady is right that the conditions are very restrictive, namely, 15 hours outside the home.  I will give an example of his point.  I remember a man who had a small farm.  He had approximately 25 head of cattle and with a feeder he could feed them in an hour and a quarter every day.  I had to go to an appeal with that man.  First, there was no understanding that 25 or 30 head of cattle could be fed with a front loader in 20 minutes.  They did not accept that and said he had 30 acres.  There would not be room to rear a snipe on 30 acres.  They did not know but I gave them a bit of agricultural knowledge and let them know that horse was not going to trot.  The man won his appeal, and rightly so.</p>  <p>  There is a view within the social welfare system that if a person has something, the person will be milking the system by getting something else which is critical.  I support this amendment unambiguously.  It is a great amendment because nothing has been done for carers since I prepared my report in 2002 or 2003.  It is time to consider it again.  There were 15 recommendations in that report and we implemented seven.  We kept consultants out.  Forget about those boyos coming in looking for &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000 to sit down and look at us.  They do not have an ounce of knowledge compared with the people giving the money.  This is good.  The Minister should not have any consultants, rule them out.  We do not want any of them near this review.  We will do it ourselves in a committee.  We will bring in the Care Alliance Ireland and all the other people involved.  Let us get the best way of working this forward.  It is an excellent amendment.</p>  <p>  I do not know how long I will be here but when I leave this place, I would love to see the means test for carer's allowance abolished.  I know it cannot be abolished forever.  The caree qualifies on medical grounds.  That is the most important parameter.  After that, one gets into the nitty-gritty of the carer's allowance.  The State is giving only &euro;200.  That works out at less than &euro;3 an hour.  The State is not being robbed - in fact, it is being subvented because after two to five years of caring, the carer can end by being more ill than the caree.  I would say the Minister's heart is in making more improvements for the carers.  We acknowledge the improvements made in recent years.  The carer's grant is not a lot but it is a lot better than what is available elsewhere.  I have done much research on this and it is good.</p><p>Many people do not get the carer's allowance but get the carer's grant and that is important.  I have been involved with some of those people over the years.  I know the Minister does not have a limitless pot and must spread it out.  She provided for qualified children this year, which I acknowledge.  It is a poverty issue.  If she continues in the job, and best of luck to her if she does, this is the area on which I appeal to her to focus because carers are our unsung heroes.  As I said on Second Stage, &euro;100 million is needed for part 2 of the national carer's strategy.  It is not a question of whether we can afford it because if we do not look after carers, we will end up in trouble.  We will pay the price in our accident and emergency departments and in other institutions if we fail to look after them.</p></speech>

I also support strongly the amendment in the name of Deputy Brady.  Day in, day out we come across the many constituents we have who are in caring roles.  They are often women in their 30s or 40s caring for two parents in their mid to late 80s.  While it is great that people are living longer, there is no question that those carers are saving the State countless millions every year.  I recall that when I was a member of his party, Deputy Penrose and I launched a report entitled Caring for our Carers in which we tried to lay out a step by step approach to recognise caring as a job of work and to look after carers adequately.  Very often, it is traumatic for the person who has been carrying out the work when the caring is over.  Supports are withdrawn and the person may have missed out, like women returners, on access to various schemes.</p>  <p>  A closely related matter is the welcome news that we will look at the cost of disability.  The Minister was awarded &euro;300,000 by the Minister for Finance to do that work.  When will it start and when can we expect a report?  It is something that was in our charter and part of the Caring for Carers document I referenced earlier.  All parties have prepared similar documents and this is something we all want.  When will it happen?</p></speech>

We discussed at the joint committee the importance of carers and the role they play.  This report would be very revealing and helpful to analyse what is going on in a layer of society at which no one really looks.  Very often, these are women.  In most cases, they are women who work into their 50s and 60s to look after an elderly parent or an elderly or ill sibling.  They often then find themselves incapable of entering the workplace due to their age.  Technically, there is no such thing as ageism as that is illegal, but in reality it exists and it is often very difficult for those older people to access the labour market.  I congratulate Pensioners for Equality which has achieved a great deal, with the Minister complying to remove the denial of the years of service of home carers, which is related to this issue of caring at home.  It is not just about caring for children.  It is also about caring for adults and parents.  The pensioners who fought so hard to reverse that injustice can celebrate the passing of this legislation as part of their achievement.  I congratulate them.</p>  <p>  It is kind of a technical point, but when I was in prison 15 years ago for political activity, many people did work in the prison.  I did not commit a crime, it was a civil action, in case Members think I am a robber.  Some people work in prison to pass the day given the huge boredom they face.  We all got an allowance of &euro;2 per day, but those who worked in the prison got an extra &euro;2.  Subsequently, someone I know was imprisoned for protesting at Shannon over the war and for breaking a warplane.  He volunteered to work in the kitchen and was given his extra &euro;2 a day.  He is now taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights to vindicate what he believes is his entitlement to have been paid the minimum wage for performing that work on behalf of the State in the prison to prepare and serve meals.  Technically, a carer could argue the same point.  I have worked as a carer and carers perform work on behalf of the State.  If they did not, people like my mother or someone else's sister or father would end up in a hospital, home or other institution.  As such, carers provide a safety net for the system.  Technically, one could argue that carers should be paid the minimum wage for the 168 hours of care they provide every week.  A carer is still caring for someone at night when he or she goes to bed.  That may be a tall story and a tall argument, but the case could be taken because instead of being paid the minimum wage, the maths indicate that carers receive less than &euro;2 per hour.</p>  <p>  The amendment does not ask for that or anything like that.  It asks simply that we look at the restrictions and the barriers and that a report be laid before the House by the Minister.  Those restrictions and barriers include limitations on access to hours of work and the way means testing impacts on the life of a carer who reaches a certain age after the person being cared for passes away.  People's lives are being left almost empty because they cannot access the labour market.  The proposed report would be a very useful and insightful one on the lives of the women who, in the main, do the caring.  It would contribute a great deal to the Department and to everyone who lives in Ireland.</p></speech>

As previous speakers said, it does not demand anything, albeit if anyone could or should make demands, it is the carers of Ireland.  They are the unseen heroes.  However, the amendment does not do that but is instead a carefully couched proposal for a timely review to consider the impediments to carers seeking to enter or return to the job market, including to do part-time work.  Indeed, people on social welfare should be allowed to some bit of light work.  Last week, the annual awards ceremony of Family Carers Ireland was held in Dublin.  I attended the Tipperary awards and we had a contestant at last week's awards from the O'Keeffe family.  I salute Family Carers Ireland and Catherine Cox as well as the regional manager for Carers Ireland in my area, Councillor Richie Molloy, who is also a colleague.  They do tremendous work.</p>  <p>  As Deputies, people trying to access carer's allowance come to us regularly but we cannot do much to help them.  We try and we engage, but the process is too slow.  The Minister knows that.  There are too many regulations and too much ruaile buaile.  As Deputy Penrose said, someone who qualifies medically should qualify under the means test unless he or she is a millionaire.  The means test is so cruel and short-sighted because it is blind to the huge savings made in the health system, in particular.  Accident and emergency queues are out the door and step-down facilities are non-existent.  There have been cutbacks after cutbacks.  The weekend respite which used to be available from district hospitals like St. Patrick's in Cashel is almost impossible to get now.</p>  <p>  The carer may be a spouse, a brother or a sister.  I remind Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that many men do it well.  I had a frightening reply to a parliamentary question recently which set out the number of children who provide care.  Young boys and girls in their teenage years should be at school during the day and after school they should be allowed to interact with their families and engage in sport and other social activities.  They should have fulfilling childhoods, engaging with the world and being out with their friends rather than bearing an onerous burden.  It is great for them to help.  It is a wonderful experience and a good grounding in life to understand people who get ill.  However, it becomes very punitive when the child is a carer.</p><p>I do not have the figures with me but it is quite shocking and staggering to see the amount of people who are in this situation and it should be looked at.</p> <p> This amendment asks the Government to look at that and to lay the results before the joint committee.  It is more than timely with the large budget that is going into health and with fewer outcomes every year.  There are many good outcomes in health but if older people do not have someone to advocate for them, they are abandoned and even with advocates it is not easy.</p> <p> Care Alliance Ireland put on a lot of training and valuable further education and training awards council, FETAC, courses of different grades for people who are caring.  It is a supportive organisation and I attend as many of their coffee mornings as I can on issues such as that.  Those involved love for people to listen to them because they do this out of love and the goodness of their hearts to help their siblings, loved ones and parents and it can engross their whole life so it is important that they get respite and that the person who they are caring for gets respite.  It is important that they have a chance to go out for an hour or so to engage with others and to share the different ideas they have and their good and bad news.  A natter, a chat and an engagement break the monotony.  The area of getting access carers is nearly impossible.  As others have said, qualification should be on medical grounds and means testing is a cruel weapon in this regard.  Carers themselves might be pensioners or be on social welfare and their means might not be wonderful anyway so why do we have to keep them waiting for 12 weeks or 4 months with so many back and forth exchanges because it is so difficult and obstructive a process for them?  It is way too bureaucratic.</p> <p> Often times a carer will just give up the ghost and do it alone quietly and unknown with no allowance and no help because they cannot cope with the system and the bureaucratic regulations and the obstacles that are put in their way.  This request for a root and branch review and to bring that review back to the committee to deal with it is over time.  It is timely but it is over due because people should get it.  Without the carers we would be a much poorer society.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile is the old proverb that I like and they do it, they put their shoulder to the wheel and keep it there 24/7.  It was mentioned that if we were to pay them, even when they get the carer's allowance, they are there night and day, they are on call and they are expected to be on call.  That bond is there but the reassurance is also there that they can be called by the person they are caring for 24/7.  They are earning less than &euro;2 per hour if they work 168 hours per week.  It is criminal.</p> <p> We give out about people not paying the minimum wage and having proper statutory wages but this is something that we are getting.  It is a great process that we have in our nation and it is a wonderful culture to foster, but why do we not show respect for it, support them and make it less onerous and cumbersome to try to avail of this and not have them looking over their shoulders?  We should allow them to keep their finger in the job market so that when their loved one passes on they will not have the bigger void of unemployment and getting back into the job market after they have been caring for their loved one 24/7.  We need to have a root and branch examination and I wholeheartedly support this amendment.</p></speech>

I will not reiterate all of the points that were made but I support this amendment.</p>  <p>  It is noticeable the number of times that the issue of carers and carer's allowance has been raised by Members in this House, particularly in the past year.  It has been on Leaders Questions and we have had motions on it.  We are becoming more and more aware of the role of carers, particularly as we have an ageing society.</p>  <p>  This may be slightly tangential but it gets to the point.  How frequently have we heard about the issue of somebody who is either in hospital or is about to be discharged and they cannot get home support services or a carer and we have delayed discharges as a result?  The level of support that comes with a home support package is quite minimal and in many cases, family members become full-time carers and they play a huge role.  When we talk about it in this House, I often feel that we speak about it in the abstract and we do not realise how much it impacts.  I look at my wife who became a full time carer on two occasions.  She became a full-time carer to my daughter when she was unwell and in more recent times she was a full-time carer to her mother.  When I observed it, I saw that it is all-consuming when one becomes a carer.</p>  <p>  Deputy Penrose referred to a woman who said that she did not want the carer's allowance and that is down to the hassle and intimidation around means testing, which makes people feel so bogged down.  This review is important and I also want to mention that it is not just the carer's allowance as Deputy Brady has specifically said, but a number of people will have been in the workplace and gone out on carer's benefit and it is the transition that affects them because carer's benefit runs out and they may not qualify for carer's allowance.  They are then left in a bind because the person they are caring for still needs the care because they may not have passed on or they may not be in residential care.  Their daily life will not have changed but just because they do not meet the means test does not mean that they can afford to live without carer's allowance.  We need to have a look at this full picture.</p>  <p>  We also have to be cognisant of people being work ready and getting them back to work, which the Minister often mentions, but if a person is out caring for an extended period, he or she loses those work skills.  It is important to recognise that and to afford people who are carers an opportunity to work to ensure that when the time comes, they have the opportunity and the work skills to revert back to the workplace.</p>  <p>  The amendment arose on Committee Stage and as Chairman of the committee I did not say anything.  The Minister was asked to change the three months to six months.  I hope the Minister accepts the amendment and while the six months affords her more time to do so, I am also conscious of the fact that it then proposes to revert to the committee and that brings us towards next summer so I ask the Minister to accept the amendment, not to wait for the Bill to be enacted and to commence this work as soon as possible so that the committee has it and can make meaningful recommendations to the Minister on a cross party basis in the run up to the budget.  If recommendations are to emanate from this report that are meaningful, we should have them in the committee in time to have them seriously considered for next year's budget.  That would be useful work from the Minister and from an all-party committee subsequently.</p></speech>

I know where Deputy Brady is coming from but it is reflected in all of the contributions that the scope of this conversation should be much larger and wider, rather than one that is just around financial hardship because there are probably tens of thousands of people who I would not be looking towards if I were just to do a financial hardship review.  We need more and the people who we all represent and think so much of probably deserve more so I am happy to accept this and there is no pushing it but I may tweak an amendment when it goes to the Seanad to go a little bit further and add other stuff to it, but I will talk to Deputy Brady about it and I will not do anything mad.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me if I did not put on record how much the State values the work that carers do, not just those who get an income support from us but all of those who do it for absolutely nothing other than the love of their family member.  We have strived in recent years to give three or four years of increases in the carer's allowance and the means testing element of it is there because there have to be conditions for a scheme, wherever those conditions begin.  Of all of the schemes that are available to the State, the conditions for this scheme are the least onerous, but it is difficult to administer.  We have worked long and hard with Care Alliance Ireland to try to bring in a new form to try to address all of the issues that the recipients are telling us about around the difficult journey of getting the carer's allowance.</p><p>We have increased the respite grant and services to carers through the carer's support grant.  As recently as this week, I looked at the possibility of issuing dormant accounts money to particular carers organisations to extend the services and supports, the bereavement counselling and the back to work training that is required.  We all know what is needed but it would be useful for us to put it down in one document so that we can address it line by line and find the money.  It may not be found in one year because it is such a large cohort of people.  As Deputy O'Dea said, it is an increasing cohort of people, therefore, it needs planning and thoughtfulness in the coming years.  </p> <p> On that basis, I am happy to accept the amendment, do the work and come back to the committee thereafter.  We can then work towards putting a plan and a roadmap in action to look after the carers in our society who are the backbone of community and family care in this country.</p></speech>

She said she will not do anything mad in tabling an amendment when the Bill goes to the Seanad but I hope whatever she brings forward will strengthen provision in this area because a considerable volume of work needs to be done regarding all the issues facing carers.  With respect to Family Carers Ireland, what I have touched on encapsulates their priorities set out ahead of the recent budget in their pre-budget submission.  I would be the first to say there are more complex issues facing carers across the board and that we need to examine all of those.  The Minister said she will not do anything mad but I hope that will not delay this review and report that is so badly needed.</p>  <p>  To echo what Deputy Curran said, we need this ahead of next year's budget.  Hopefully, it will come before the joint committee in a timely manner.   When the Oireachtas joint committee takes on a job of work it is very thorough and produces excellent reports.  I am sure the Minister would be the first to acknowledge that in case of the one-parent family report we published.  She took on board some but not all of the measures outlined in it.  She did not go far enough on some of them but she acted on others and that is to be welcomed.  Hopefully, the same will be the case with this report.  There are major issues in this area, on which all of us have touched.  I am conscious there are also many more issues.  It would be a very useful report that, hopefully, would bring about major changes that would benefit not only the people in receipt of care but the carers.  Let us get this done.  There should be no delay in doing this.  This report will be a major item of work for the members of the committee to consider in its engagement with the organisations  Let this report be the start of a comprehensive job of work that will ultimately benefit those who need it most and who are saving this State not only millions of euro but providing a fantastic service.</p></speech>

We had a comprehensive discussion on this on Committee Stage and there was agreement on the timeframe for it.  Initially, I had asked for a report and a review within three months to be brought before the committee.  There was an issue with the placement of the word &quot;child&quot; in the amendment.  I have amended the proposal, changed the timeframe to six months and removed that word.  </p><p>There are major issues with maintenance payments being assessed as household income.  It is not only in the case of social welfare payments in that it involves broader issues.  Some local authorities take maintenance payments into consideration for the differential rent scheme and others do not.  There are issues across the board regarding maintenance payments.  I do not consider it, nor should it be considered, as a household income.  It is an income for the child.  </p><p>We know the figures on poverty rates among children in one-parent families and all the evidence shows that maintenance payments should and could be used as a means of lifting children out of consistent poverty.  We know there are major issues relating to maintenance payments and the process involved for parents who have to go court to try to get the payments.  I touched on that issue in a previous amendment, which, unfortunately, was ruled out of order.  My party and I brought forward proposals on the creation of a child maintenance service, which we discussed extensively in previous committee hearings.  The Minister would say that is an issue for the Department of Justice and Equality but, unfortunately, there is no desire on the part of the Minister or the Department to push that forward.  The creation of a statutory child maintenance service to deal with maintenance payments is another important piece of work that needs to be done.</p><p>  The amendment deals with the means testing of maintenance payments, and the implications and ramifications of that for welfare payments.  It would be a useful report and review on all the impacts of that across the board.  I have amended the Committee Stage amendment in respect of the timeframe and the removal of that word and I hope, as indicated previously, this amendment will be accepted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900026#BB00500"><p>This is an ongoing problem we are all familiar with because we come up against it on a regular basis in our constituency offices.  The first question that arises is whether maintenance should be means tested at all.  The statistics for poverty among lone parents and, by extension, their children, are exceptionally high.  I understand the latest figure indicates a 51% deprivation rate.  If our objective is to target poverty levels, removing the means testing of maintenance would considerably enhance the income of those lone parents and help lift them out of poverty.  There are a number of technical problems with the current means test.  For example, the same formula is used if the maintenance is being received by a single parent with one child or a single parent with seven or eight children.  It is the same means test but surely that cannot be correct.</p><p>Where somebody sues, goes through the horrors of the legal system and secures a maintenance order, if the recalcitrant party - the party against whom the order is given - does not pay, the Department still insists on counting this notional income as maintenance, which is unfair and a major deterrent, and people would not want to take the risk.  Why finish up collecting a lower rate of lone parent's allowance or none at all while not getting paid maintenance, which the court has ordered to be paid?  There is a good deal of work to be done in that regard.</p><p>  The other anomaly is that with the change in the regulations relating to lone parents and the reduction of the age of the relevant child to seven, the State can step in to help somebody who has a child up to the age of seven.  Even though he or she is still a single parent, once the child reaches the age of seven, the benefit payment changes from lone parent allowance to a jobseeker's transitional payment.  Once the child is a day over the age of seven, the single parent is on his or her own.  It is impossible to justify that.  It is simply a lacuna in the legislation.</p><p>  What we need - and we see this in other jurisdictions so it is not a question of reinventing the wheel - is a statutory agency to pursue this matter.  We have discussed that with the Minister and she has pointed out that the Department of Justice and Equality also has to be involved, which I accept.  However, I would like her to indicate where we are in respect of these matters when she is responding.  This was proposed by way of an amendment on Committee Stage.  We thought the three-month period was a little short and undertook to support it on the basis that the three months be changed to six months, and there would be another slight amendment to the proposal, which has been done.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We would be disposed to support this amendment.  I think it calls for a report.  It deals with a problem which we will ultimately have to face up to, so the sooner, the better.</p></speech>

I have seen cases like that where a person's maintenance payment is calculated and he or she gets a reduced payment as such, even though the payment is not coming through.  The amendment is quite narrow in that it talks about financial contributions and financial issues.  The issue relating to maintenance is larger and we probably need a much bigger review of how maintenance works.  In my experience, quite a number of people who are told to seek maintenance for one reason or another are not in a position to do so.  They either cannot make contact with a former partner, or they are afraid to, or whatever.  The idea of establishing some sort of management agency to deal with these claims for maintenance seems to make sense.  This motion is not calling for that specifically.</p>  <p>  Another anomaly that arises is as follows.  I recently had a gentleman in with me who is paying a prescribed payment from the court, following a court settlement, which reduces his salary considerably but his reduced salary does not come into the calculation for his eligibility to apply for social housing for himself.  We need to have a joined-up view.  I have often said that it spans more than the Minister's Department but if maintenance payments are to be meaningful and fair, across the Departments of Justice and Equality, Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the Minister's Department, she needs to talk to her colleagues about it.  It is not envisaged in this amendment but it needs to be done.  People have an obligation to make maintenance payments and should make them but they need to be recognised across Departments.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment as is.</p></speech>

This report shall examine any cases and provide costings of providing payments in such circumstances.&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>I hope the Minister keeps to form and agrees to pass this one too.  I am sorry I missed the earlier ones.  I am sure others have come across this before.  It arises from a woman who was in receipt of lone parent payments.  She had two children of her own who have since grown up and technically passed out of her responsibility, according to legislation.  She is no longer entitled to lone parent payment but has two foster children in her care.  She receives payment from the HSE for the children in foster care but she has been told by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that she has to sign on as a jobseeker.  How can she be a jobseeker and mind the children?  If she is a jobseeker, she has to be available for work.  If she is minding the children and has to make herself available for work, she will have to surrender the children according to the law here because she is not entitled to claim jobseeker's allowance unless she is available.  This amendment seeks a report on this conundrum that will hopefully allow somebody in her position to continue to claim the lone parent payment in the circumstance where she is parenting foster children.  That is being asked for here.</p></speech>

Now that I know exactly what she is looking for, the difficulty is that I do not have the data about why people would be unsuccessful in applying for something.  We do not keep records if one applies for something and does not get access to it.  If that lady applied for lone parent payment, she would not qualify because she is not the children's parent.  I cannot correlate information between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which makes the foster parents payment, because there is no legal ability to share the data between our Departments.  Even if I was to try to get all of the names of people who have applied and been unsuccessful, I will not know the reasons why they have been unsuccessful.  I have no way to cross-reference them with the people who are currently in receipt of foster care payments because of data protection.  I do not want to refuse the Deputy but do not know how to give her what she is looking for because I do not have access to the information, unless she can think of another way.</p></speech>

I do not want to reiterate all that has been said in the Chamber in the context of this Bill and another Bill we are dealing with about bogus self-employment.  Bogus self-employment should be combatted by the State for a number of reasons.  The obvious one is that employees have gained many rights, largely due to our membership of the European Union.  Miscellaneous legislation on the Statue Book protects workers' rights and ceases to operate once a worker becomes self-employed.</p><p>At a stroke of a pen people who are really workers and who are forced to designate themselves as self-employed unilaterally surrender all these hard won rights.</p> <p> There are also revenue implications for the State.  In a situation where somebody is actually a worker but is forced, and we are speaking about people who are forced and not people who opt to be self-employed, to designate themselves as self-employed then payment of employers' PRSI is lost to the State.  As I understand it, this phenomenon started in the construction trade and has spread to other areas including retail generally and high-tech areas.  Let it be said and put on record that the State itself, in the shape of State and semi-State companies, is among the worst offenders in this regard, or at least it is beginning to be among the worst offenders.  Something needs to be done about this.</p> <p> The Minister will recall that I tabled an amendment to the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that was passed by the House.  While we were waiting for the Bill to be progressed to the Seanad I got intimations from the Department that the Minister could not proceed with the Bill unless the section introduced by the amendment was removed.  I also received correspondence, which I have with me, from ICTU asking me not to oppose this removal on the basis the other basic protections in the Bill were badly and urgently needed and had been awaited for a long time.  On this basis I told our Senators not to oppose any proposal by the Government on Committee Stage to remove that particular provision as it would delay much needed reforms for people in precarious employment.  I understand Committee Stage is being taken next week.  Of course, this does not make the problem go away.  We still have the continual problem with bogus self-employment.  I receive complaints about it and instances of it literally every week that passes.  I do not care about reports that state the problem has stabilised or the numbers are not as big as elsewhere or as big as we suggest.  Anecdotally I see it on a constant basis and I hear about it from my colleagues.  Sometimes when I read official reports I wonder whether we are living in a different world down in the midwest.  My colleagues, not just in Fianna F&aacute;il but in all parties, have confirmed to me that it is a persistent and continuing problem and something has to be done about it.</p> <p> I have moved the amendment mainly to give the Minister the opportunity to outline, now that we have agreed to remove the section of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, what precisely are the Government proposals in this regard.  Will it bring forward its own legislation?  Does it have definitive proposals?  Has it thought about this or discussed it?  There will be an ongoing discussion on it by the committee but in this regard the power lies with the Government and I am very anxious to know where the Government stands on it at this juncture.</p></speech>

Some time ago, the Minister brought us back a report, which she had independently commissioned, that stated this is not as big a problem as we had outlined.  I do not want to be at odds with reports because I am sure they are done in good faith but sometimes we receive reports that may not directly address the issue we feel is important.  This has been a bugbear for a long time.  It represents huge losses to the individuals who are in artificially contrived bogus self-employment.  It is bogus and it is contrived in order to deprive people who are, in effect, employees of what would be a significant corpus of employment law.  This is the idea.  It is all right to be self-employed.  People pay everything themselves and the differentiation between an employee and a self-employed person is well laid down in law and has been determined over a long period of time by the courts, in particular the High Court.  This brings us into schedules D and E.</p>  <p>  In this case, it effectively means people lose the right to time and a half or time and a quarter, the right to a proper basic wage, the right to holiday pay and superannuation and the most important right of all, which is the PRSI contribution.  We meet people in our clinics who were on the lump, particularly in England.  We have dealt with many people who came back after working all their lives in England.  Because they were on the lump they might as well have not existed.  It is no use looking for the snow that fell last winter and telling people they must have something on what they earned in 1972.  It does not work like that.  The important thing is that people have a contribution.</p>  <p>  The PRSI contribution in the most valuable thing.  I have always exhorted people to pay it even when they were under the limit.  People had to have &pound;2,500 back in the 1980s.  The Minister will remember this because she was self-employed.  I was an agricultural consultant and before farmers came into the net in 1986 I used to beg them to make voluntary contributions.  Some of them were very slow, I might as well be honest.  They were still slow in 1986 but then it became compulsory.  Now they are very thankful because it is a great saving for people who may have very low incomes to have a pension now.  This is how critical it is.</p>  <p>  Any artificial contriving of the nature of employment to classify it differently to what it is certainly means a significant deprivation of people's entitlements.  Unfortunately, some people may be left in a position whereby they must accept the employment because it is put in such a way that if they do not take it they will not be given the job.  We had a big rush on this back during the boom times and we are heading a bit that we again.  Deputy O'Dea is attempting to pre-empt this.  This horse has already had a good spin around one track and it will not start to run around loose a second time.  We want to lock this horse back in the stable.  Perhaps the Deputy will agree to six months more, in fairness.  The Minister is looking at it and it is very important.</p>  <p>  At the other end, the Minister wants PRSI contributions and she would get more this way, and the tax contributions would be far better.  We are losing at every end.  Significant losses are accumulating and I have no doubt the Minister wants to curtail them.  Over the years, thousands of people have been very grateful to the 300,000 genuinely self-employed people for the jobs they have created.  There are villages where many spheres of activity would have been wiped out only for them and we are very grateful to them.  It irritates ICTU and its various constituent unions that people are artificially worked into bogus self-employment, as Deputy O'Dea has described.  They have been making significant noise about this for a long time.  Generally unions move on and they go to the next issue but they keep coming back to this.</p>  <p>  The State gives out big contracts and perhaps we will find people are being compelled into a self-employment situation not of their own making but because of the construct they face and because they are told to take it or leave it.  In any major contract there will be subcontractors but it is very important that we keep an eye on this to make sure it is done in a proper fashion.</p>  <p>  This is a reasonable amendment.  I agree that we cannot have legislation by reports and I appreciate this.  People will take a reasonable view.  Deputy Brady's earlier amendment was legitimate, as is this.</p><p>We have a good social protection committee.  I am not a member of it but I have been accepted to the meetings when I sought to attend by the committee's excellent Chairman, Deputy Curran.  I would certainly attend for either of those matters and make a contribution from the knowledge I have garnered over the years.</p> <p> Although we do not wish to load the Minister with too many reports, I hope she will see a way to do this.  I appeal to my colleagues not to load the legislation with too many more reports.  If we get a couple of them, we would be quite happy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900029#EE00200"><p>I will try to be brief but this is an important issue.  The Minister is aware that the joint committee, under its Chairman, Deputy Curran, has started a comprehensive consideration of bogus self-employment.  Our first meeting was fascinating.  It was with officials from the Department and they appeared to think that this is a non-issue and that it is not as extensive or rampant as is the case.  There is plenty of evidence, including that of an anecdotal nature, dating back over many years.  Reports indicate that bogus self-employment is costing the State &euro;600 million in the context of the Social Insurance Fund.  I am sure the Minister would love that money to be spent on social protection and other necessary measures.  Of course, the people who are forced into bogus self-employment are missing out on the net that would be provided if they were engaged in proper employment, as they should have been from day one, and their entitlements to holiday pay, illness benefits and other benefits.</p>  <p>  There are major issues here in terms of the State not doing what it should.  There are massive State contracts for housing, schools and other infrastructure projects, with massive amounts of money going to major developers who are forcing people to register as self-employed.  There have been instances where some companies have faced serious financial difficulty and ended up going into examinership, and the people who were forced into bogus self-employment arrangements have been stung for tens of thousands of euro, if not more, because when they go through the examiner procedure all they are ultimately offered is 3 cent in the euro.  If they had been employed properly, however, they would have received all their entitlements.  These are important issues.</p>  <p>  One of the fascinating, and probably more worrying, things to emerge from our first engagement with the Department's officials is that while they acknowledge that inspections are happening, which is welcome and no more than what we should expect, they do not keep records.  On the one hand, they say this is not an extensive practice but, on the other, the Department rolled out what has now proven to be a useless PR exercise during the summer.  Even the officials would say that they were disappointed with the level of engagement from people in these arrangements.  It certainly was not worth the money spent on it in terms of what the Department expected to get from it.  However, it is a serious problem that the Department does not keep records in this regard.  We know it happens in the construction sector but it also happens across the board, with even Ryanair pilots being forced into situations where they have to register as self-employed.  It will be a huge and very useful piece of work for the committee.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Department producing a report, I agree with Deputy Penrose that there are a lot of reports sought in the amendments.  Unfortunately, however, our hands are tied in that we cannot bring forward amendments that will have a financial impact on the State.  The Minister will be aware that People Before Profit has brought forward legislation to deal with bogus self-employment, so there is legislation available to tackle this serious problem immediately rather than us having to table amendments requesting reports on it.  On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister if she had examined that legislation.  Certainly, my party supports it fully.  If the Minister is serious about addressing this matter, she would not just examine that legislation but move it forward to ensure this practice is stamped out immediately, that people who have been forced into bogus self-employment will get their full entitlements and that the State will get the PRSI contributions it should receive to be put into the areas where they are badly needed.</p>  <p>  I support the amendment, although I would have preferred a six-month timeframe.</p></speech>

However, I support a number of the amendments tabled on Report Stage, particularly this one.  We know this practice has been ongoing since the late 1990s.  It particularly affects couriers, delivery van drivers and those in the construction industry.  A recent State project in Dolphin's Barn had subcontractors in self-employment.  The workers came forward and said it was bogus self-employment and that they were trying to get it dealt with.  It is occurring increasingly in the area of English language teaching where people are being forced to register as self-employed.  It is happening across the board.  Whether it is 1% or 15% of the workforce no employment of this nature should be allowed to seep into the workplace.  It is soul destroying for the workers.  They cannot plan for events such as birthdays, first communions, Christmas and so forth.  It has a huge impact on them because they do not get paid for the period they are off work.  They have no holiday pay.  The more the issue is raised and discussed in the House and the more we try to get to the bottom of it, the more employers might start thinking that they will have to change their practices in their workplaces.</p>  <p>  Another area where should be more investigation, and perhaps it can be done by the committee, is the number of decisions made by the Scope section that were in favour of workers, holding that they were directly employed, and how in the majority of cases the social welfare appeals office generally went against those decisions and overturned them.  That should be examined.  Workers have the wherewithal to come forward to the Department and go through the process, yet employers are able to use the social welfare appeals office to make their case that these workers are self-employed.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

Whatever they are now, the potential for the future is even more alarming, especially as the Department introduces auto-enrolment for pensions in which a worker will have to be clearly defined as an employee.  At this point, we do not know if the self-employed will be allowed into the scheme.  Leaving that aside, however, by not being an employee, a worker will not benefit from the employer's contribution and so forth.</p><p>As we move forward, it will become even more important than it is now.  This piece of work is very important.  The committee received an opening statement from the Department, which was quite informative.  It will help the committee to set out the terms of what it does.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Dea's amendment states:</p><blockquote>The Minister shall review the issue of bogus self-employment and its consequences, including the cost to the Exchequer and the implications for those who have been wrongly designated as self-employed and shall bring forward a report on the same within 3 months of this Bill being enacted.</blockquote><p>It specifically refers to people being wrongly designated as self-employed.  As far as I am concerned, that information resides with the Department.  I refer to the decisions of the scope section in this regard.  While the amendment calls for a report, it will not be a particularly comprehensive one.  We are looking for the raw data.  Those who have been through the scope section and, as Deputy Smith stated, dealt with the subsequent appeals-----</p></speech>

She referred to appeals.  Many decisions have been overturned by the appeals section.</p>  <p>  Another matter arose at the meeting of the joint committee from the Department's point of view.  I am of the view that the report should cover this because it sets out the efforts that the Department has gone to, whether it was through its relationship with Revenue via inspections or through publicity campaigns.  That would give a sense of the activity in which the Department was involved and the return this yielded.  Regardless of whether the Minister accepts the amendment, as Chairman of the joint committee, I am in a position to state that I and all the other members of the committee would really appreciate the provision of this information in a timely fashion.  We will be commencing hearings early in the new year and I do not believe the technical requirements of the amendment are very prohibitive.  I do not think that the information sought is particularly difficult to correlate.  It would be extremely useful.  I will not name any sectors or companies because I do not want to reveal the work the committee is going to do.  The factual information we receive is going to be very important.  It is not hearsay or innuendo and it is not the case that somebody said such and such.  We want to deal in facts and try to reach a determination.  I am quite clear in that.</p>  <p>  The officials from the Department indicated recently that the percentage of people who are classified as self-employed is diminishing.  However, I informed them that it is diminishing as a percentage but increasing as a number because the workforce is growing.  It is still a substantial number of people.  In the context of the information being sought, and regardless of whether she accepts the amendment, I appeal to the Minister to give a commitment to deliver the relevant information within the suggested timeframe.  It would be really helpful in the context of the work the committee has commenced..</p></speech>

I ask Deputy O'Dea to reflect on what he stated in respect of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I did not say - I hope to God that nobody told him I said - that I would not bring the Bill to the Seanad unless the section to which his amendment to that Bill gave rise was removed.  As I stated at the end of the summer when the amendment was accepted by the House, it is my view that I would not bring the Bill to the Seanad until I had completed comprehensive of work in respect of self-employment and bogus self-employment, particularly as these are issues I am very serious about tackling on a number of levels.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the Government has sought to equalise the offerings of the schemes that are available from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for people who are employed and those who are self-employed in order to provide equality of access across all of our schemes for employees and for the self-employed.  We have gone a long way towards doing that this year with the introduction of jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed.  The last outstanding measure is illness benefit for self-employed people.  I hope do something about that next year.  It is a testament to how much this section of society responds that when I come to the D&aacute;il next week with the Department's Revised Estimate, Members will be able to see - positively I hope - that the one area of my budget in which I am overspending is that relating to treatment benefits.  This is due to the tens of thousands of self-employed people who have come forward - over and above the numbers we thought would - in order to avail of the dental, aural and optical benefits we put in place in the budgets for last year and the previous year.</p>  <p>  We know these people are out there and we know that when we look after them and provide parity of access, they take it on board.  I also know that the industry is rife with people who are being maligned.  There is a cohort of people who qualify and who want to be self-employed, and that is great.  Yes there is a loss to the Exchequer but we can deal with that another day.  There are vulnerable people in certain sectors and industries, which we can all name, who are being manipulated and maligned.  They are losing employment rights.  They are losing wages for the days for which they are not being paid.  They are losing holiday entitlements and much of the time they are losing quality time with their families because they are being told when they have to work and they do not actually have the freedom that real self-employment should provide for people.  A huge body of work needs to be done and I will do it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked Deputy Brady to withdraw two of his amendments in the spirit of goodwill in order to give me six months to compile the reports.  However, Deputies O'Dea and Curran have added three requests for reports and included three-month timeframes for all of them.  Notwithstanding that I am privileged to work with an entirely professional body of civil servants, they are not infinite in number and they are the same people - in the main - who the Deputies ask to compile the same reports year in and year out.  I will tell the Deputies that I will compile this report, but there is not a snowball's chance in hell that it will be completed in three months.  I can accept the amendment today, which is no problem, but I am not going to adhere to the three-month period because it is just not physically possible.  I would end up giving the chairman of the committee a report that is not worth anything.  It would not be meaningful.  If we, as a Parliament, are to address this issue in a serious manner, the research has to be sound and we must have exact, measured data in order that we can implement the legislation to provide the protections for the people who are being made vulnerable and to ensure that tax is collected from those who are avoiding it otherwise.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of employers are good but the scope section of my Department recognised that there are some who are not.  This is why we changed our practices this year in order to have proactive inspections.  We are targeting specific industries including security, construction, deliveries and hairdressing.  There are so many sections of society that need to be inspected.</p>  <p>  I am happy to accept the amendment.  However, when we have this conversation - which has happened frequently in respect of this Bill and during the debate on the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill - people inform me that they have buckets of anecdotal evidence.  When I ask for referrals from the Members they never, ever arrive.  They do not make it into the scope section either.  I reiterate that if Members know of vulnerable people who they believe are being made to declare themselves as being self-employed, then they give the details to me and I will investigate.  Without factual evidence, however, I can do nothing except look at general data.  If we do not have tangible results in specific areas arising from inspections performed by my Department, then all we will ever have is anecdotal evidence and we will still be talking about this matter in ten years' time, when the world of work has changed completely and when precarious types of employment that we have not yet even thought of will have been created.  We will still be looking backwards and trying to reflect on how to make it better.</p></speech>

I have a number of cases that I can refer to her straight away.</p>  <p>  In the context of what was said to me, I was informed that the Bill could not be brought to the Seanad during this session.  I was also informed that it could not go to the Upper House unless we agreed to support the removal of the new section.  In order to alleviate the distress being suffered by countless people who are on short-term, precarious, if-and-when types of contract, I agreed to do that in the interests of getting this substantive legislation onto the Statute Book straight away.</p>  <p>  I thought that three months was a more appropriate timeframe for the report in order that its publication might coincide with emergence of the study being done by the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I take the  Minister's point and I fully understand that three months would not be sufficient time in which to compile a proper report.  Is the Minister giving an unequivocal commitment that she will compile such a report and that she intends to carry out this research?</p></speech>

I would like to make a brief point and I am not being smart about this.  The Minister indicated that some of the information could be got as handily from parliamentary questions.  However, now that she knows the questions, she can see they are simple.  They concern the numbers in terms of the scope section and appeals; details of the various campaigns and operations that have been run such as when the Minister worked with Revenue - she talked about hairdressing and whatever; and the number of inspections and what they yielded.  If that factual information could be sent to us in advance of the report it would be helpful to the committee's work.</p></speech>

We all know people who have lost their jobs or become redundant.  Their skills are no longer relevant in modern society and they are in their 50s and into their 60s.  They are simply rotting away, drawing social welfare, out walking trying to fill the day.  Several people in that position have been accommodated by the community employment schemes.  They give them a reason to get up in the morning and something to do.  They give them a goal.  It is done at very little cost to the State - &euro;20 per week on top of their social welfare payments.  It is doing an awful lot of good in that regard.</p>  <p>  There is a second good they are doing.  The results of the activities of community employment schemes are clearly visible all around us.  Certainly in my area they have done fantastic work which has enhanced the physical environment tremendously.  They also do wonderful work in building up and helping to run GAA clubs, soccer clubs and other local clubs, reinforcing the sense of community in their areas.  All I am asking is for the Minister to have a look at the current rules which I accept have been relaxed from what they were, to see if people over the age of 55 could avail of these schemes until they are at pension age.</p></speech>

That is why I say with sincerity that it fills me with sadness that the Deputy would have so little ambition for people who are only in their mid-fifties.  This morning at the Committee of Public Accounts the Government was being lashed because we are sending people for a second year on JobPath, yet some people are quite happy, week in, week out, to beg and plead for an extra six, seven, eight and nine years on CE schemes.  Now the Deputy wants 12 years.  These are activation tools, methods of training people to give them new skills because their old skills do not fit in the current economy, to pass them on to new careers and employment opportunities.  If we want to have a conversation about CE schemes as a valuable resource in communities and the public services they are providing in the gaps where the State is not providing them, I would gladly have that conversation with the Deputy because they are a very valuable resource.  My God, though, let us be more ambitious for those in their fifties and sixties.  The sixties are the new forties.  At any rate, I am happy to conduct both reports as provided for in amendments Nos. 11 and 12.</p></speech>

We are not suggesting for a second that just because someone can stay on such a scheme, we have no ambition for them.  I have discussed the T&uacute;s schemes with the Minister and her officials before.  The point is that after a year, they have to leave the T&uacute;s scheme and go onto JobPath.  They are on JobPath to help them find full-time employment but they can do JobPath for maybe two hours a week and still participate in their T&uacute;s scheme.  That was the whole principle behind this.  It was not about not having ambition for the person at all; it was completely the opposite.  We are asking for flexibility to allow people to go onto JobPath when they finish the T&uacute;s scheme after a year but, because they are only doing that for two or three hours a week, for the balance of 15 or 16 hours they could continue to do their T&uacute;s scheme.  This is of benefit to them, to the community and to the host.  That gap has always existed in society and probably always will.  Those people like making a contribution.  There is a social side to it and it is a good contribution to the community as well.</p>  <p>  Being allowed the flexibility to stay on the T&uacute;s scheme while engaging with JobPath would not make people any less ambitious than anybody else.  If they are offered or see full-time employment being advertised for which they are eligible to apply they will do so.  The Minister knows the notion that allowing people to stay on a T&uacute;s or CE scheme for longer than a year or X number of years makes them lacking in ambition and that they will stay there and will not bother seeking full-time employment is simply not true.  I have discussed it with her outside the Chamber.  She knows it is not fair to say because it is all individually driven.  If a person wants to seek full-time employment he or she will work day and night to do it.  While they are doing that they should have the support of JobPath and the flexibility to extend the T&uacute;s scheme beyond a year to benefit themselves and the community.</p>  <p>  There is nothing in that equation that cannot happen by allowing them that flexibility.  It is all benefit and all positively driven.  That is what Deputy O'Dea is asking the Minister to consider.  Because of the level of unemployment, which the Minister acknowledges to be at about 5.5%, there are fewer participants coming through the T&uacute;s schemes to fill posts.  We end up with a person doing JobPath for two or three hours a week and doing nothing the rest of the time.  They are looking for full-time work but they are not engaged in a community scheme such as T&uacute;s.  The host group, the local athletics club or whatever, is left without that position filled and there is a loss to the community and the individual.  This is about flexibility.  Everyone benefits and it is in no way holding back anyone's ambition or being negative at all.  It is completely the opposite.</p></speech>

There are a number of circumstances where contributions may be required to be paid to the scheme by the scheme member in order to be able to obtain entitlement to a spousal pension benefit.  The provisions of section 22 set out the procedures in this regard.</p><p>The need to pay contributions could arise, for instance, where contributions paid into the scheme in respect of pension benefits payable to spouses were refunded to the scheme member at the time of their retirement since they could not then or at any time qualify for the spousal benefits.</p><p>I am introducing a minor technical amendment to these provisions which simply clarifies that what is at issue in those circumstances relates solely to the scheme member's contributions.  In ordinary course where the Pensions Act 1990 refers to contributions, the words &quot;or in respect of&quot; are generally interpreted as meaning the employer's contributions.  The removal of that phrase just ensures there is no ambiguity in this regard.</p></speech>

We need to have safeguards against that.  It is only reasonable to allow the amendment to be made to ensure we have that safeguard.  It also ensures that children with disabilities are not discriminated against.  We have made great progress on inclusion in this State when we consider the Special Olympics and all the positivity associated with that.  It would be a shame to undo all that good progress by not agreeing to an amendment to ensure that no abortion is carried out based on disability or gender.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for termination of pregnancy to be carried out only in cases where there is a risk to the life or serious harm of the health of a pregnant woman; where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of a pregnant woman in an emergency; where a condition is present which is likely to lead to the death of a foetus either before or within 28 days of birth; and where the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks.  Terminating a pregnancy otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Bill is an offence which may be prosecuted.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendment is entirely unworkable in practice and is designed, in my view, only to stigmatise women in crisis pregnancies by allowing its proposers to suggest that these are their motives.  If it were to pass, its only possible intention would be to render termination services practically entirely inoperable requiring, as it does, a doctor to be able to determine a woman's thoughts which she may choose to keep private, and in fact be satisfied as to the absence of those described.  This would likely have the effect of creating substantial and unnecessary difficulty for doctors in providing certification.  It would make the entire premise of the early pregnancy section of the Bill inoperable.</p>  <p>  The strong advice of the Chief Medical Officer is that this amendment must be opposed on this basis and I fully support that medical opinion.  It is also my strong view that the proposed amendment is completely out of step with the decision of the people and the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  The legislation, as drafted, reflects the majority view that women in early pregnancy should be able to make their decisions in private with their doctor without being required to give a reason.</p>  <p>  This is a case of the political tactic of "let them deny it".  There is no ground in this Bill for termination of pregnancy in relation to disability, sex or race.  It is not allowed under the provisions of the Bill.  A suggestion to the contrary is not grounded in fact or in the medical advice offered to me by the Chief Medical Officer and is a serious deviation from the grounds we extensively debated during the referendum campaign.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to terminations on the grounds of disability.  As a party we debated the matter at our Ard-Fheis.  More than that, as political activists, we campaign day in and day out for the rights of persons with disability.  In our advice clinics at council level and at D&aacute;il level every day of the week we deal with cases involving parents who have children with disabilities.</p>  <p>  For our party the issue is a settled matter.  We abstained in Committee because we wanted to be certain that this legislation does not provide for terminations on the grounds of disability.  We abstained to give ourselves time to consider it and engage with the Minister.  We have engaged with the Minister and on the basis of the assurances we have been given which accord with our party policy, we will not be supporting this amendment.</p>  <p>  We stand up for the rights of persons with disabilities.  We stand up for their families.  We stand with them in our communities through our activism.  We are very clear on that.  We gave ourselves the time and we engaged with the Minister.  I thank him for his engagement and for his assurance that this legislation does not provide for terminations on the grounds of disability.  It does not and therefore we will be opposing the amendment.  However, we do so because the legislation is very clear as is our position.  We stand with people who have disabilities.  We stand with their families and we will continue to do so.</p></speech>

However, the wording of the amendment has nothing to do with that, but rather is, as the Minister said, an attempt to undermine the entire sentiment of the legislation and the referendum we had to repeal the eighth amendment of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  I am not a scientist or a medical person.  I read this and spoke to a doctor friend of mine.  This attempts to rule out abortion in the case of disability and gender where the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Until now at least, in the medical and scientific community, one could not determine the gender or the presence of disability until approximately 11 weeks.  An expensive, hard to attain test called a cell-free fetal DNA test is then required.  The chromosomal make-up in the foetal material is examined and if it has two X chromosomes, the foetus will be a female, or if has an XY chromosome, it will be male.  If anyone tried to have that test done at 11 weeks, there is no guarantee that they will get the result, and the result would not be available within a week, which would put them outside the 12-week limit this legislation has provided for.</p> <p> The reason most parents or pregnant people want to have that test is linked to genetic disorders rather than trying to eradicate all the Down's syndrome people on the planet.  That is why it is called a cell-free fetal DNA test.  It is carried out to identify certain diseases that are linked to the X chromosome, two of which are carried by the female gender.  Rather than this being about how China or Pakistan trying to eliminate females from their society, as it was put in what I consider racist terms, the test on the female, if it is carried out, is very much linked to whether there is a genetic disposition to conditions such as muscular dystrophy, haemophilia or Hunter's syndrome.  That is where a family is worried if they have a genetic disposition and want to see if it will be the case in their pregnancy.  It is a rare test to have carried out.  It is expensive and difficult to attain.  The amendment is a ruse to try to deny women and pregnant people access to what is rightfully theirs following the May referendum.</p> <p> The amendment also states: "... because of ... race".  There is only one race, and that is the human race.  Race is not determined by anything other than the fact that we are all human beings.  After that, ethnicity is determined by the combinations of different genetic make-ups.  It is shameful for anybody to try make out that race is a factor in this Bill because there is only one race.  A parent might take that decision because conditions and disabilities could be detected.  Is it not sad that they have to do that because they carry within the family the danger of genetic heredity factors that could limit the lives of their children?</p> <p> This is a ruse.  It is about trying to deny the reality that the people have voted to give women and pregnant people access to abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks.  I am sorry, but it will not work.  We have to vote against this amendment.</p></speech>

The Deputy was trying to say was there are people who come from cultures where abortion for sex selection is done.  I utterly object to that for a number of reasons.  First, I represent a constituency where one in four people was born outside Ireland, which includes people from India and Pakistan.  Second, it is just not true, and I did some research following last night's comments.  If we voted "Yes" to this amendment, ethnic profiling of pregnant women would be introduced.  If a woman from one of these cultures enters a GP's surgery, she will be asked if she is going to have an abortion because her child might be brown or black.  Can we imagine that interference in the consultation with the woman?  I have researched this and this is what happens.</p>  <p>  The other issue is sex selection.  I read studies of an imbalance in the ratio between men and women in societies.  The fact that sons are favoured in cultures is wrong and shameful, but it stems from the inferior position of girls and women in our world, whom the proposers of these amendments never show any interest in once the child is born.  Some of that imbalance can occur after girls are born.  When families are poor, girls can get less food, education and so on.  There can also be infanticide if the proposers would prefer that prospect.  Sex selection for abortion is horrendous, but the Deputies need to cop on.  We have a system where women are utterly inferior, taking the planet as a whole.  The proposers again care nothing about that.</p>  <p>  Mention was made of Pakistan.  I looked up a study that was only done in 2016 in which the author stated: "We do not find consistent and convincing evidence that sex ratios at birth (which indicate sex-selective abortion) are increasing."  That is important because people who are now Irish citizens could find themselves being affected by this amendment being accepted.  There is enough racism in society without people trotting this out in the national Parliament.  It is difficult enough for people to integrate into society without the stereotype being thrown out that they do not like girls.  The Deputies should cop themselves on.  That should be kept out of the debate and we should move on and deal with the main issues.</p></speech>

During the referendum campaign, when he sought to reassure the public that this Bill would not allow shockingly high levels of abortions on the ground of disability that occur annually in other countries, and knowing that most Irish people wanted to provide protection against discrimination of the most vulnerable among us, he repeatedly assured voters that it would not allow abortion on the ground of disability or on the basis of the undesired sex or race of the unborn baby.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the majority of the media also chose not to challenge the Minister on the spin that was put out.  He would like all of us to believe that if it is not specifically legal to abort on the ground of disability, it will somehow not happen in Ireland.  That view is very naive.</p><p>In Germany, it is not specifically legal to abort a baby on the grounds of disability, yet some 90% of babies with prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome are aborted there.  How does that happen?  These abortions are usually certified on the grounds of risk to the mental health of the mother.  Section 12 allows abortion until viability and until the birth on the grounds of risk of serious harm to the mental health of the mother, in line with Dr. Peter Boylan's assertion that if a woman says the matter is serious, it is serious.  It is hard to see how the German loophole will not also find its way to Ireland.  Deputy Coppinger tried to make the same point in the Chamber last night that a woman should get to decide how serious a serious risk to her health is.  What situation will the Bill lead to in Ireland?  Will disability be a specifically allowed ground for abortion?  No permission to abort is given based specifically on a disability.  It is not, however, "specifically excluded", to use the Minister's words.  The Bill is silent on the highly controversial matter of abortion on the grounds of disability, despite all the Minister's fine words before the referendum.  His promises are not worth the paper on which they were written.</p> <p> The Minister deliberately misled the public about what the Bill would permit or prohibit.  He remains defiant and determined to be the only lawmaker who can make any changes to the Bill.  My fellow Deputies and I were all elected to shape the legislation of this country, and we have the opportunity to ensure Ireland does not follow countries like the UK, Germany, Denmark and Iceland into the eugenic black hole into which they have fallen, where the lives of more than 90% of all babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome in the womb are intentionally ended.  We must not allow our unborn babies with disabilities to be discriminated against so callously.  </p> <p> We have made so much progress in recent years in how we treat every member of society with respect and dignity.  Who could forget the Special Olympics in Ireland, when we showed the world we valued every person regardless of his or her level of ability or disability or level of additional needs?  Many tourists and visitors to Ireland remark how many children and people with Down's syndrome there are.  They often make the mistake of thinking it is a condition that is more prevalent here than in other countries, but the truth dawns on them when they realise it is simply because we allow these children to be born and we allow them to live.  Children and adults living with Down's syndrome are nothing to be afraid of and, in many cases, bring much joy to their families and communities.  That is what makes us different.  A diagnosis of disability in Ireland is not an almost automatic death sentence.  </p> <p> Today, we will decide whether we will allow a prenatal diagnosis of a disability to put a target on a child's back or mark the child out for special protection.  To think that because it is not specifically legal means it will not happen is to bury one's head in the sand.  If Deputies want to ensure the people's desire to protect unborn babies with disabilities from discrimination, and if they want to protect baby girls from abortion simply because they are female, they need to support the amendment.  It is not about being pro-life, pro-choice or pro-abortion; rather, it is about human rights.</p></speech>

As far as I understand from what he and Deputy Donnelly said, it will be illegal to have an abortion beyond 12 weeks on the basis of race, sex or disability.  The Minister agrees with the principle, therefore, that it would be an unacceptable basis for having an abortion.  I welcome that because at least babies or foetuses of more than 12 weeks will have that protection in law, and because that fundamental right has been conceded.  I am told, however, the vast majority of abortions or terminations are likely to take place before the 12 weeks has elapsed.  The protection that the Minister so carefully inserted in the Bill, which I have not heard anyone saying should be removed, is moot.  The protection is not there and it cannot be there because, as the Minister said, no reason need be given and, as a result, no inquiry into the reason a person may have can be made.  I do not expect that to be changed in the Bill but nor do I expect anything in it to be changed. </p>  <p>  I wish to highlight, however, that a protection that is there after the period of 12 weeks will not be there before the 12 weeks has passed, and that the opposite impression was given strongly by those proposing the legislation during the referendum campaign.  I am delighted the amendment was tabled to highlight the inconsistency of the approach to this matter, an inconsistency that was obvious from the beginning to those who read the small print of the Bill but would not be obvious to those who did not.  As I understand it, the Minister, on the one hand, agrees that abortions of unborn children of more than 12 weeks should be utterly forbidden in law with severe penalties, and that the grounds to which everyone on my right takes exception are in the law, should remain in the law and will be in the new law when the composite law on this subject is taken into account.  On the other hand, however, he is saying there should be no such protection for that group of people who have not reached 12 weeks </p>  <p>  We make law not for today but for the future, if only for a five or ten-year span.  As technology advances, it will become much cheaper and much more accessible to test for disability.  The argument, therefore, that people will not test for Down's syndrome, to use an example that was mentioned, or that they will not avail of testing or that they will not be allowed to do so, is fallacious.</p></speech>

The issue of abortion and disability is difficult and complex.  In Britain, abortion is generally available up to 24 weeks of pregnancy but it is also legal for any detectable disability for all nine months of pregnancy.  There has been discussion about Down's syndrome.  Some parents do not like that debate and do not like talking about these various conditions but they are a part of the debate and need to be addressed.</p><p> We need to investigate further when such conditions can be diagnosed during pregnancy.  In Britain abortion is generally allowed up to 24 weeks, and these conditions can be diagnosed up to that time.  Pre-natal diagnosis is improving all the time.  3D ultrasound scans and cell-free DNA testing are now more readily available.  Diagnostic tests can now detect Down's syndrome at nine to 13 weeks, or the first trimester.  Even if these tests are only available privately the technology is improving all the time.  In Ireland we are proposing to allow for termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to the reason during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Anomaly scans usually take place at 20 weeks but we need to consider this issue much more carefully.</p> <p> The Minister can say over and over that this Bill does not allow for abortion on the grounds of disability but that does not make it true.</p></speech>

I have spoken before about embracing disability.  I, and many others in this House, have witnessed first-hand the great warmth, ability and talent of children with disabilities, and I have followed the career paths of many.  It is not being gospel greedy, but I believe that where there is life there is hope and that people can achieve what they want, whether they have a disability or not.</p>  <p>  I believe it is dealt with in the legislation and that, as the Minister said, the only way that an abortion can be sought beyond 12 weeks is in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities.  However, I share the concerns of the two previous Deputies in that I want the Minister&rsquo;s categorical assurance that in the case of technology which is continuously improving, that in the event of scans for disability being possible before the 12 week period, that it would not be allowed as grounds for an abortion.  Therefore, I cannot reconcile the 12 week period.  My conscientious view on abortion is widely known in my constituency and beyond.</p>  <p>  The public, unfortunately, voted to repeal the eighth amendment and mandated this House to legislate through the Health Regulation (Termination of Pregnancy) Bill to allow for abortion in certain circumstances.  I am not happy that we are not making this fool-proof in relation to advances in technology that may happen, therefore I want the Minister&rsquo;s reassurance that terminations will not be available on the grounds of disability, where it is identifiable prior to 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  While my conscientious view is in conflict with the majority of those who voted, it remains the same.  However, we all, I hope, in this House are democrats and accept the wish of the majority.  I like many others do not intend to stand in the way of any of this legislation but I reserve my right, in the final occasion, to decide what stance I will take.</p></speech>

They are starting to become aware of what they actually voted for in repealing the eighth amendment is completely different to what the Minister is now proceeding with.  It is completely different.  The Members who are seeking all these changes and to make the Bill one of the most liberal abortion laws in the world are doing a grave disservice to the people who voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  Those people voted for the repeal of the eighth amendment, not what is contained in many of the amendments before us now.</p></speech>

We know that these children bring many people much joy, especially their parents, siblings and extended families.  Many families love and cherish these children who in some people's eyes might not be 100% perfect although they are 100% perfect because they are who they are, which is themselves.</p>  <p>  We are all proud of the many local children who have performed in the Special Olympics in recent years.  We must ensure that something like this cannot be given as a reason for an abortion.  In the days before the referendum, the Minister promised that he would guarantee it would not be a reason but it is not in the Bill.  We are entitled to raise concern about that on behalf of many people out there.  I very much resent some Deputy here from Dublin, I will not acknowledge her by naming her, telling us to cop on.  We do not have to be told to cop on by anyone.

The Minister for Health said that disability, including Down's syndrome, would be excluded as a grounds for abortion in any legislation.  However, there is absolutely nothing in the Government's Bill to rule out abortion on these grounds.  He told the <i>Irish Independent</i>on 24 May, the day before the referendum, that the Government would specifically exclude disability as grounds for abortion in the legislation.  He also told the <i>Irish Independent</i>on 1 February that if the electorate voted to repeal the eighth amendment in a referendum that the proposed legislation would not include grounds for disability such as Down's syndrome but would be confined to cases of fatal foetal abnormality where the unborn baby would not live.  During the campaign, the Minister, Deputy Madigan, shared a graphic produced by Fine Gael Head Office on Twitter which explained the Government's abortion proposal.  This said that termination on grounds of disability was prohibited.  I ask the Minister to say whether both statements were totally false as there was no provision in the Bill to prohibit abortion on the grounds of disability.  Why did the Minister not include a clear provision to put that into effect in legislation?</p><p>As I said yesterday, the Minister is wrong.  He made a statement today that the Chief Medical Officer has given him advice that he can amend it.  Did he ask the Chief Medical Officer before he put these statements in the newspaper telling the people of Ireland that disability would not be allowed as a ground?  What is he telling me now?  One week he talks to the Chief Medical Officer and the other week he just goes away and does his own thing.  Did he or did he not ask the Chief Medical Officer's advice before he made these statements instead of leading the Irish people wrong?  He is the Minister for Health.  He is responsible for these people in Ireland.  He has given false statements.  He is totally and utterly wrong.  He is trying to blame the Chief Medical Officer for what is happening.</p></speech>

I ask everybody in this House and outside it to please understand the views of those of us who have some reservations in this regard.  Let me make it clear that I fully accept the result of the referendum.  I would never stand for damaging any woman's health in regard to this issue.  However, the facts are that there has been an issue with this in England, particularly in regard to Down's syndrome, and we do not want that to happen here.</p>  <p>  I believe the Minister was sincere when he gave those commitments prior to the referendum.  Like many of my colleagues, all I am looking for is assurances.  I do not want to go down this road.  We cannot, on the one hand, rush out to the gates of Leinster House every time the disabled are out there, and have our photograph taken with them, and then, on the other, not support the parents, brothers, sisters and many others who have come to people like me seeking that we would stand up here and make this case for them.</p>  <p>  That is my contribution.  I appeal to everybody in the House to think of the families who have people, particularly young people, with disabilities.  They bring such joy into homes.  They may on many occasions have very short lives but they bring a lot of joy into people's lives.</p></speech>

In the Second Reading of a Bill one can suggest what should be in the Bill, one can complain about what is not in the Bill and one can announce what one intends to do on Committee Stage.  However, we are gone past that.  We are now in a situation I have never seen before, where it has been suggested in an acrimonious way that the Minister did not keep his word.  That is not true.  The committee sat for three months.  One of the first things we did was to eliminate the disability area as a reason for accessing abortion.  There was no dissent and everybody agreed to it.  The reasons for this have already been put forward by my colleague across the House.  It would not be right.  I gave an interview to a well known journal at least 20 years ago and I held the same view, and I believe the reasons for that are still good.</p>  <p>  The suggestion that, because it is not specifically in the Bill, it is by default going to be in the Bill is not true.  People should not be saying things like that.  It is totally untrue.  The Bill is in line with what was committed to the public in the heads of the Bill published before the referendum, and that still stands.  In fact, if we did not follow that line, we could be accused of not remaining true to our word.</p>  <p>  The other thing we took out of the proposal at that time was the ability to seek an abortion on social or economic grounds.  We took that out without any question because we felt they were not grounds that should be considered and that they were way too frivolous.</p>  <p>  I come from a family that had many losses when my siblings were very young.  I would have first-hand knowledge of the little boxes some of the witnesses told us about when we heard the evidence this time last year.  Far from it being, as was portrayed, that women are callous and cold-blooded and would seek an abortion as if it were for their own satisfaction, in fact, the reverse was the case.  That was so in every single case, including the ones of fatal foetal abnormality, where the pregnant woman went out of her way to have her baby, but it was not to be and there was a disappointment because it was not going to happen.  From announcing it to their friends in the first instance, it was suddenly an appalling disappointment.  They still wanted that baby to be born.  They even wanted to have a decent funeral for the baby because it was theirs.  What really takes me to the fair at this stage, when I hear the begrudgery that we spent three months listening to, as well as listening to the reports from the people who were directly involved at the coalface, to be suggesting they were cold and callous-----</p></speech>

The only place to go was across the water, to leave the country or disappear into what were once the Magdalen laundries or the mother and baby homes.  It is time we grew up a little.  It is time we learned that women had lives as well, that they are entitled to due and fair consideration and that they do not find themselves, at this time, in the 21st century, isolated, alone and forlorn.</p>  <p>  We were there for three months.  We listened in great detail.  We were there all of the time and we missed none of the debate.  We did not read about it afterwards; we got it first-hand.  I compliment my colleagues, some of whom I did not always agree with, but we did what we had to do and what we were obliged to do, which was to take our responsibilities seriously and to recognise there was something that needed to be dealt with.  The people responded and they made it quite clear.</p>  <p>  Last night it was suggested that minorities have rights.  Yes, they do, and so do majorities.  The one has to be balanced against the other, and that is democracy; that is the way it has always been.  However, we should not exclude a group of people representative of 52% of the population, whether we like it or not - that is, women - and say, "In the future, as in the past, you are not really a first class citizen.  You are not equal because you do not control your own future."</p>  <p>  I will leave Members with this.  Let us assume one puts oneself in the shoes of a woman in those circumstances.

One of the reasons I oppose abortion is because of its effect on minorities.  Someone from a low-income family who is female and has a disability is far more likely to be aborted.  Abortion is an inequality.  People who do not believe that information should look at the Guttmacher Institute's website, which is a pro-choice site.  It shows that minorities suffer most from abortion.  I think it was Deputy Lisa Chambers who stated last night that gender selection abortion does not happen in this country or at all, which is patently untrue.  Deputy Donnelly stated that he is against abortion in the case of disability and that the Bill does not allow for this.  The Minister also stated that a few times.  A ten year old child studying a Venn diagram in school will know that if abortion is made available for every reason, it will be available for cases involving disability.  I cannot understand why the Minister and the people speaking on his side of the debate cannot understand the simple premise that if abortion is available without indication and on request and if it cannot be refused up to 12 weeks, then, by definition, it is available in respect of cases of disability.  It is that simple.</p></speech>

There is no need for the sideshows.  This is too serious an issue as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and others have stated.  We know what has happened around the world.  We know the experience in Finland, where they parade the fact that they will be Down's syndrome free by 2020.  That is a shocking indictment.  Deputy Durkan and others seem to think that we should trust the Minister in everything he says but he has changed his stance more times than it has rained in this country in recent years.  That is a fact.  How are we to live horse and get grass?  Unless something is written into the legislation, we cannot be expected to believe it.  That is true of any legislation, whether it be the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Regulation Bill 2018, which we discussed earlier, the Finance Bill 2018 or whatever.</p>  <p>  We often argue about the words "shall" and "may".  Unless what we are seeking is specifically mentioned in legislation, how can we be expected to believe and trust this Minister who was elected on the basis of his pro-life stance.  He wrote letters to his constituents in Wicklow, promised that he was pro-life and asked for their number one votes.  I have a copy of one of those letters and can read it out if necessary.  In fact, I will read it out later.</p>  <p>  How can we be expected to believe anything the Minister or the Government say in respect of this matter, particularly as many of those who are in government were elected on the basis of the same stance?  However, they have been on these so-called "journeys" in the interim.  They all made these famous journeys.  One of them was a journey across the River Lee in Cork and, as a result of it, we got the three days - the 72 hours.  The Minister used the word "disgusting" and other adjectives when referring to the T&aacute;naiste.  That is all fine if that is the way those opposite want to deal with it.  Some of us have credibility, accountability and consciences and we want to keep it that way.  We are not twisting and turning to suit the times or our political masters.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to speak in a dignified manner on this issue and not be silenced.</p></speech>

The debate in this regard began with references to race, sex and disability and ended up focused on disability because it is possible to tug at the heart strings of the population by consistently referring to people with Down's syndrome despite the fact that the Down Syndrome Ireland has asked people advocating what is proposed not to do so.  The reason the period is up to 12 weeks without restriction relates to the existence and widespread use of the abortion pill and to the evidence given to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and the Citizen's Assembly on the use of that pill.  The danger of letting women and girls take abortion pills in isolation without medical supervision is unconscionable.  We have a duty to ensure that when these pills are administered people have support, cover and medical supervision.  Deputies can table whatever amendments they like.  Even if those amendments are passed, that would not stop people accessing abortion pills on the Internet and putting their health and lives at risk.  It is nonsensical in the extreme for Deputies to use this to try to pull at the heartstrings of the population when they have been asked by the relevant representative organisations not to do so.  The case for using this amendment in the context of race and sex has been shown to be nonsensical and the only thing those advocating it have to go on is disability.  Their choice in that regard is immoral in the extreme.</p></speech>

As one of the proponents of the 12-week limit and as someone who was a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I think it is important to say why was proposed.  There were several specific reasons for putting the 12-week limit in place.  The backdrop is that the Citizens' Assembly proposed 22 weeks in most contexts.  The committee considered the evidence that was presented to it and we made our individual judgments on the basis of that evidence.  Having listened to much of the debate, particularly the medical evidence, most but not all members of the committee proposed that 12 weeks, the first trimester, would be a time limit in the gestational periods when terminations could take place without restriction.  In other words, if a woman or a girl requested a termination up to 12 weeks, it would be granted under medical supervision.  One aspect of the debate focused on the issue of rape and how defining a rape would require a conviction and so on.  We believe that we should trust a woman, which I expect all of us in this Chamber do.  That was one reason.  The other was that women find themselves in very difficult situations for many reasons, and we will not judge those reasons but they are many and varied, individual and personal.  We decided a termination should be granted, if a woman requested it, up to 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  The committee considered disability as well and went to great lengths to assess this as a grounds for termination, bearing in mind the Citizens' Assembly had recommended that a termination could be sought in respect of a disability.  What we said - this view was endorsed, regardless of whether people in this House or elsewhere accept it - was that it was central to the debate during the referendum campaign.  Those who opposed the referendum were very clear in bringing it to the fore in the debate.  Let us be honest about that.</p></speech>

Tests have been identified with the potential to identify disability in advance of the 12th week.  That is a fact.  However, we have said that a woman can have a termination without reason, or rather for her own reasons, up to 12 weeks.  It is disingenuous, therefore, to suggest that the issue of disability was not, first and foremost, central to the debate; it was.  I recall distinctly many people bringing it to the fore, rightly from their perspective.  It was a robust debate and the matter has been decided emphatically with the Irish people saying that up to 12 weeks, unrestricted termination should be available under medical supervision.  To introduce race and disability is against the wishes of the Irish people as expressed in the referendum in May.  We can talk about this and look at why it was proposed.  Those proposals were included in the heads of the Bill and adjudicated on by the Irish people.  This was central.  It was not put in covertly.  It was the kernel of the debate that termination would be available without restriction up to 12 weeks.</p></speech>

I have that genuine concern.  No Bill is ever perfect in its infancy.  We all know that.  There is no doubt that unintended consequences arise. I am looking today to the Minister for a clear commitment that any unborn foetus or baby will not be targeted for abortion because it has a disability when the law changes.  While the committee spent a great deal of time discussing this particular angle, it was all blown out of the water during the campaign when the Master of the Rotunda stated that a test existed which could determine at nine weeks whether some disability was there.  I was happy to go along with the notion that one could not determine a disability up to 12 weeks, but it was blown out of the water when we were told about that test.  It is a private test for which one must pay approximately &euro;1,000.  However, it is there if one can afford to have it and it can determine prior to 12 weeks whether a disability is present.  These are genuine concerns and we would appreciate the Minister addressing them and providing a clear commitment.  That is what I am looking for today.</p></speech>

That is obvious from listening to what they are saying.  They want assurances that babies with disability will not be aborted.  We have not been given those assurances other than verbally whereas we need it in writing in the Bill.  Otherwise, we will end up like Germany, Denmark, Iceland and the UK.  Every Deputy must think deeply about this.  If something is not in writing, a question arises as to why it is not.  The Minister is the person who told the electorate that he was opposed to abortion and we can see where those words have gone.  He has done a 350<sup>o</sup>turn on this completely and changed his mind.</p></speech>

The Minister can hang his head in shame in time, perhaps.  Currently, the Bill is silent on disability and other discriminatory grounds.  I ask Members to add the protections the Minister promised and failed to deliver.  Will they support the amendment or open the door to eugenics?  The choice is theirs but I urge that they accept this humane and compassionate amendment, which embodies equality and is in line with what the people expected when they voted in May.  It is also in line with human rights law and common decency.  If passed, it will be in line with our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable from discrimination.  I implore the House to vote in support of the amendment.</p></speech>

I ask Members to consider that ten people are leaving the country today or tonight.  Studies show that a further five people will take abortion pills which they have sourced online.  If we do not get through the debate tonight, so be it.  I will be here next Tuesday.  There is a reality, however, that people expected the legislation to be in place by January while some Members continue to regurgitate arguments that were rejected by two thirds of the population, including in Tipperary, Kerry and the other constituencies they represent.  It is not going to go down well among the people who vote for them to bring those topics up again and again.  People are paying &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,500 to travel and all the Members are doing is delaying the process.</p>  <p>  As to the request for assurances, people knew what they were voting on in respect of the 12-week provision.  Hopefully, someone will be able to go to the doctor and have an abortion without having to give a reason.  We cannot anticipate matters and provide Deputies with the assurances they seek.  It could be for any reason.  After 12 weeks, unfortunately, given that it should be the person's right, the person will have to go abroad.  That is the reality.  Can we move on, therefore, and let the Bill progress?</p></speech>

This section was front and centre of the entire debate.  The 12-week period was front and centre and whether one liked it or not, that is what one was voting on.  These issues were unbelievably well rehearsed during the referendum and arguments were made for and against.  The comfort I take is from Deputy Kelleher who I understand formulated the proposal at the committee with Deputy Chambers.  Deputy Kelleher is on record as saying he is not in favour of abortion for reasons of disability.  He set out the reasons for the 12-week period in the referendum, as did others while some people set out the reasons against it.  However, the public voted for this section.  If there is anything in the Bill that they voted for, it was this given the extent to which it was rehearsed.  The 12-week limit was the signature issue in the referendum.  People need to remember that.  There has been an effort here to rerun the referendum and to sow confusion in the minds of ordinary, decent pro-life voters that somehow Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and other colleagues are their heroes.  They are not their heroes and they know that.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is an utter hypocrite.</p></speech>

I respect Deputy Durkan because he has been in this Chamber a lot longer than I have, but when he asks me to trust the Minister without it being written into the Bill, it puts me in mind of selling sand in the Sahara desert because I do not trust it if it is not in the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Government has clearly not spoken to the doctors about this as they are complaining about it.  We were not on the committee that met for a number of months because we were not selected for it.  We did not have a vote at the Oireachtas committee we attended, so we are entitled to raise issues here and to put them to a vote.  That is what we will do because I respect every life - the life of the mother and that of the child.  It is absolutely terrible if a baby is aborted because it has Down's syndrome or has a disability.  It remains to be decided what a disability is and how serious it must be.  That is the problem for many of us, so it is not unreasonable of us to ask that this be written into the Bill.  That is all that we are doing.</p></speech>

I hear a lot about human rights and I have some breaking news.  Women's rights are human rights and we have been violating them in this country for about 35 years and the people have said "No more", including in County Kerry thankfully, and we will now move ahead and legislate.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelleher is entirely right and he is best placed to speak on this because of the work he did on this in the Oireachtas committee.  The 12 weeks proposal was debated the length and breadth of this country and the people voted on it.  The issue of disability was considered at length and I gave assurances and not one word has changed from the general scheme that was published in March and the Bill, as published, in relation to disability.</p>  <p>  This is a case of saying, "Let them deny it."  It is a case of trying to make the Minister vote against putting a clause in the Bill to protect people with a disability, or trying to make Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour, Party Fine Gael or whoever do so, but it will not work.  The Deputy said I should talk to doctors.  I did talk to doctors and I talked to the very top doctor, the Chief Medical Officer in the country, who says that this amendment would effectively render the 12 week provision in the Bill inoperable.  Perhaps that is what the Deputy would like to do but it is not what the people voted to do.</p>  <p>  The greatest protector of a pregnancy is not Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, it is a pregnant woman.  Women protect their pregnancies day in, day out and they will continue to do so long after the eighth amendment has been repealed.  This would make the legislation inoperable.  Perhaps that is the intention or perhaps it is not but it is the reality.  It cannot be accepted and we cannot continue to drag up the same issues that were debated the length and breadth of the country.  The people have spoken and I have no intention of accepting this amendment.</p></speech>

For this reason, I propose this amendment to section 14, which would allow a second medical practitioner to become involved following a three-day period should the first be unavailable.  The amendment keeps the safeguards and legal requirements that section 14 currently contains but aims to clarify the pathway for accessing the service and to avoid creating an additional barrier.  The effect of the amendment I have tabled is to provide that where a medical practitioner has formed the reasonable opinion, in good faith, that a woman's pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks, and certified that opinion, and the woman has fulfilled the three-day period, a second medical practitioner may carry out the procedure without a further time period needing to elapse where he or she has formed the reasonable opinion, in good faith, that the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks and has certified that opinion.  From a substantive point of view, we debated many of these issues last night.</p><p>Amendment No. 36 is a different version of that.  I propose my amendment, No. 35, for the reasons we discussed last night with regard to amendments Nos. 13 and 29.</p></speech>

If we cannot vote on that, we might vote on this.  Many of us made points on this earlier in the debate and on Committee Stage.  As is the way with these issues, many people are only now focusing on the details of it and there is a great deal of speculation on social media and in society about it.  Many people are pointing out that they rang their general practitioner, GP, and asked when their next appointment time would be.  Many women have posted on social media that they rang their GP and the next appointment time is next Monday.  They tested this.  This three-day waiting period will be problematic.  It will be much longer than a three-day wait.  I will not rehearse the argument again but I wanted to register that point with the Minister.</p></speech>

When I spoke on this on Committee Stage and we discussed it, I was taken aback by people's unwillingness to allow a baby the relief from pain that would definitely be endured during the course of an abortion.  I believe in compassion and not wanting to hurt anybody or anything purposely.  Who here can say that it is not true that when an abortion is taking place, a baby could feel pain?  I would consider it only human to say it would be right and proper to offer and give pain relief to somebody who cannot ask for it.</p><p>As legislators and human beings we should be willing to offer it.  I cannot see what harm this would do.  If anybody can stand up here right now and criticise me and say what I am saying is wrong and that I am not right in what I am saying I beg them to do so.  I beg them to tell me where am I wrong in looking for pain relief for an unborn baby.  How am I out of order in looking for that?</p> <p> The one thing that has been said to me by knowledgeable people is that the reason other people do not want to agree to this is because to do so would be to recognise this is a person we are talking about and that it is a baby.  They do not want to recognise this fact.  Surely after all we have gone through for people to stand up here today to ask the Minister and others to allow for this to go ahead and that pain relief would and could be given to stop an unborn baby feeling pain during an abortion is to make an ordinary request.  I plead with the Minister and others to allow the amendment to be passed.  If they will not do so and if they will fight against it I would love them to explain why.  I would love them to tell me why I am wrong and why it is not a proper human thing to do and to educate me if they are able.</p></speech>

Where the gestational age of the baby is 20 weeks or more the doctor must ensure the administration of an anaesthetic or analgesic to the foetus prior to carrying out a termination of pregnancy.  However, this obligation does not apply in an emergency case, which is quite obvious, where it is not practical or where it is believed the administration of either of these treatments to that baby might pose a risk to life or serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman.  This is not in any way our intention with this very reasonable amendment, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has said.</p>  <p>  Amending the Bill to provide pain relief where an unborn baby may otherwise experience pain is a matter of the most basic humanity.  The fact there is a dispute about whether to include such a provision in my opinion is appalling.  The amendment merely seeks to ensure that in most cases, not even in all cases, doctors ensure the unborn child is not subjected to pain.  The fact this is not already in the Bill and that it is actually necessary to propose an amendment to deal with it is gravely disturbing to me and to many young and old people who have spoken to me.</p>  <p>  Some abortion advocates claim the unborn child cannot feel pain until the third trimester but this claim is flatly contradicted by modern evidence.  There is increasing scientific evidence from around the world that babies in the womb feel pain before 20 weeks.  Anaesthetics and pain relief for babies undergoing surgery in the womb is generally recommended and has been called for in late-term abortions.  Some say it should be done from as early as 18 weeks gestation.  Surgeons recognise unborn babies as patients and anaesthetics are routinely used for babies undergoing surgery in the womb.  Surely the same should apply in the case of surgical abortions.  It is a no-brainer, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has said.  Members should just tell us why they feel it should not or would not be done.  Where are we going in humanity?  It would be horrific and unnecessary for unborn children to suffer needlessly during an abortion.  To prevent this, the amendment, which we have carefully considered, should be accepted without any difficulty.  It is clearly the duty of compassionate and humane doctors to act on the precautionary principle of prevention of pain where there is a risk that it may be experienced.  I am sure this is the way that all doctors operate under the Hippocratic oath on a daily basis to deal with a wide range of ailments and when patients present with any issue, whether young or old, from the cradle to the grave.</p>  <p>  The amendment would not prohibit abortion where the baby can feel pain.  It merely requires the administration of pain relief.  Who in his or her right mind would not accept the amendment?  As I said, we are appalled and aghast it is not included in the Bill in the first instance - appalled and aghast are mild words - and we feel it is totally necessary.  We appeal for support from any Member who thinks like us.  Many people of all denominations, including people who voted "Yes" in the referendum, have contacted me and others, including other Members, to appeal for this.  My goodness, we get emails on an hourly basis on anti-fur farming and anti-hare coursing.  Today there was opposition to a Bill on funding the horse and greyhound industries.  People are right to feel like this.  How can we have these and not want to administer pain relief to an unborn baby?  I cannot get that through my thought process.  It is unimaginable.  Anyone I have asked just shakes his or her head.  People have come to me and appealed on this.  Other Members have also received the emails.  The thought process is just unthinkable.  As I have said, doctors routinely do this, as do surgeons on a hourly basis for other procedures.  Why would they refuse to do it for an unborn baby before it will be killed?</p>  <p>  I appeal to people to listen and respect where we are coming from in the interest of basic humanity.  We should try to be as humane as possible.  We do not have many amendments in the overall scale of the Bill.  We are not delaying it.  We have 16 amendments in total, which is the same as on Committee Stage.  We listened to the people who voted.  Very few people voted for a baby to be destroyed in the womb without administering pain relief.  I cannot generalise but I cannot believe people voted for it.  This is why we have tabled these amendments.  I do not want to be repetitious but for the sake of anybody watching we are not delaying the Bill.  We are doing what we have been elected to do with regard to any legislation.  We had no pre-legislative scrutiny as the Minister waved it.  It is a very valuable tool that was independently reviewed recently.  We are trying to table amendments without being scoffed at and scorned and without laughter coming from the other side of the House.  This is the most serious issue I will ever deal with in the House.  If I am not here after the next election I will be happy to leave it to history to evaluate and see what we have been about here.  We are not anti-woman or anti-child.  We are pro-humanity.</p></speech>

It is a fairly reasonable request to ensure the little baby will not suffer any pain and that any avenues open to the medical profession are used to ensure these children will not suffer pain for the last few seconds of their lives in this world.  It is a minimal request.  We all have or have had people belonging to us who suffered pain.  It is terrible to see people suffering.  Many people in many families are suffering pain as we speak here.</p><p>We are talking about poor defenceless little babies in their last few seconds.  It has been proven beyond a shadow of doubt that they have feelings and that pain affects them.  Whether it is anaesthetic or some other avenue available to the medical profession, it is not unreasonable to ask that something be used to ensure that they do not suffer.</p> <p> Being a Member of the D&aacute;il is an honour.  However, if we did not do our best to ensure these infants would not suffer pain by asking for this on their behalf, we would not be worth anything and our lives would not mean anything.  I support the amendment.  It is not too much to ask.  The Minister is providing &euro;12 million for the abortion service.  Surely he can dedicate some of that money to ensure that the pain of these little babies, whom the medical profession has said can feel pain, be minimised so they are not hurt.  It is not much to ask the Minister to use some of the money, wherever he got it, to ensure that these babies would not be allowed to suffer pain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900043#TT00200"><p>It is hard to understand why anybody would be opposed to providing pain relief to a human being about to undergo a painful procedure.  I am not sure any Member is actively against pain relief in principle.  Sadly, however, many have spoken out against this amendment in recent weeks.  When this was raised at the recent health committee meeting, the Minister said this type of detail is best set out by clinicians in their clinical guidelines rather than by politicians in primary legislation, and that it was not for the Oireachtas to prescribe medication or treatments.  Although he said it is not for the Oireachtas to prescribe medication or treatments, this Bill does that in many cases by legalising a range of unspecified procedures or treatments to end the life of an unborn child, even though there is no medical condition in a mother where the intentional ending of her baby's life is a medically indicated treatment.</p>  <p>  We recognise that there are times when it is medically indicated to end a pregnancy early to protect the life or the health of the mother.  However, the Bill seeks to legalise a wide variety of procedures aimed at intentionally ending the life of the unborn baby.  Why is it so inconceivable that the Minister would also include a measure of legislative oversight to ensure that if any of these procedures could cause pain to a tiny human being, the medical personnel would be obliged to mitigate against that possibility?  People voted as they did out of compassion and for what they believed was best for the mother involved, be they "Yes" or "No" voters.  It was not a vote against babies.  However, the Minister appears to be interpreting it now.  It was not a vote to ensure babies would be treated as inhumanely as possible.  It was not a vote on any specific legislation, as he was at pains to remind us when he introduced his draft legislation in March, and as the Referendum Commission and the High Court have reminded us since.  It was a vote to allow the Oireachtas to legislate and that is what we are trying to do.</p>  <p>  The Minister seems to think that he is the only politician in the Chamber whose views on sections of the legislation should be considered.  That is not the case for any other legislative measure and it should not be the case for this one.  We are all elected to help shape legislation on behalf of the electorate and I believe there are few among the electorate who do not want unborn babies who are capable of feeling pain to be denied the most basic concessions to their human dignity and to be protected from unnecessary pain as far as practicable.  This legislation is the right place to enshrine the principle that the unborn baby who may be subjected to a painful procedure should be protected and given pain relief.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is clear that children deserve special safeguards and care before as well as after birth.  The convention, which Ireland ratified in 1992, states: "The child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth."  An amendment seeking to ensure that a pain capable human being would be guaranteed pain relief, where possible, is reasonable.  Special safeguards should be enshrined in our laws.</p>  <p>  The amendment also specifies that an analgesic or anaesthetic should be administered where the baby is determined to be at a gestation of 20 weeks or more.  Pain relief is typically given to unborn babies when they undergo prenatal surgery in the womb from 20 weeks on and, therefore, it does not seem unreasonable to seek that the same would be guaranteed for unborn babies about to undergo a painful procedure.  Nurses who have treated extremely premature babies have testified that these babies react to painful stimuli such as inserting needles and so forth.  Why would we not assume that babies of a similar gestation who are still in the womb would also feel pain?  Let us be very clear.  Dismemberment is painful and fatal poisoning is painful.  It would be a gross abuse of human rights not to ensure that tiny human beings were guaranteed pain relief before undergoing a painful procedure.</p>  <p>  The Minister said he does not wish to specify what doctors must do, but if he had done any international research on this, he would have quickly discovered that in other countries where this is not specified in legislation, pain relief is not considered for, or given to, unborn babies.  In recent weeks, a court case has been ongoing in Texas in the United States, where live dismemberment abortion procedures are routinely performed without pain relief.  The state of Texas is trying to outlaw live dismemberment because it causes intense distress to a foetus or unborn baby, but abortion providers are arguing that it would restrict access to abortion.  Does that sound familiar?  Do we want to have such a case here?  If this will happen anyway, there should be no objection in principle to the consideration of pain relief for an unborn baby where appropriate.  This legislative safeguard will not cause any harm.  However, if the amendment is opposed, it is likely that in future we will back to debate the issue in the type of detail in which people are being forced to debate it in Texas because "abortion doctors" there, and I use the term loosely, deemed that no pain relief was necessary before tearing a child apart.</p>  <p>  I apologise if this language is distressing for anybody present or anybody watching these proceedings, but that is the unpleasant and unsavoury reality of some choices being discussed in the Chamber.  This procedure is more commonly known as a D&amp;E procedure, which portrays the horror of what it involves.  It is not a rare procedure in the UK.  In 2017 alone, 13,000 babies died this way.  This included 1,800 at a gestation over 20 weeks when pain was likely to be felt.  Perhaps even today, as we speak, an Irish unborn baby is having its limbs taken apart in the UK.  Would that procedure be any more palatable if was being done in Letterkenny instead of London?  It is not easy to ask these questions or to mention these things here but they are facts in other countries.  We must prevent that from happening here.  I support the amendment to put those safeguards in place.</p></speech>

Most people would understand the scientific definition that an unborn child is an individual, living, human being.  Science will tell us there is a physical and biomedical response to injury and research shows us that pain and stress may affect the unborn child in its development.  What does it say about this country and this Chamber that anybody would have to fight for that?  It is dumbfounding that anybody would have to fight any government to seek for pain relief to be introduced in that regard.</p> <p> There is disbelief around the country with the stubbornness of the Government to move on this, even among those people who are solidly pro-choice, and that the humanity of this amendment is completely unrecognised by the Government.  The stubbornness of the Government is preventing it from putting this measure into the Bill.</p> <p> The nervous system develops at around six weeks.  Sensory receptors, which allow pain to be felt, start to develop at around seven weeks and are across the body at 18 weeks.  In 2010, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists report, Fetal Awareness, inferred that the unborn child has the capacity to feel pain from 24 weeks.  The further the research and investigation goes into this issue, that age understanding is falling.</p> <p> Even if a person was unsure about this, would the Minister not, on the precautionary principle alone, instinctually say, "Let us make sure this does not happen"?  On the precautionary principle alone, would the Minister's very nature not say, "I need to put this into the Bill"?  The Minister will state it is not up to him to do this and that somebody somewhere sometime will do something around this.  This Chamber of elected representatives of the South of Ireland are to stand back and say, "Okay, we trust you to do this" and to let it happen.  During the Committee Stage debate, we went back and forth a rake of times around the fact that a measure in primary legislation is far stronger than if it is in guidelines elsewhere.  I put it to the Minister that this is the place to put such a measure.  What would it cost the Minister to put it into the Bill?  Does he support the fact that there should be pain relief in all cases of abortion?  If so, what is the cost to the Minister to do that?</p> <p> I can think of absolutely no cost to any Member of this Chamber of including such a measure.  This amendment does not seek to reduce access in any fashion.  The only reason I can think of as to why the Minister would not want to include it in the Bill is that in some way it reflects a humanity to the unborn child in the womb.  This is the only reason I can see that the Minister would be cautious about introducing this into the Bill.</p> <p> I ask the Minister and the political parties in the Chamber to reconsider.  Even those who are instinctually pro-choice and who feel in their hearts and souls that access is the primary issue in this abortion debate, that access is supreme and that nobody should even think about denying access, should have no reason not show the humanity to make sure this goes into the legislation.</p></speech>

I was shocked to find that the Bill did not already cover such a provision.  It seems that we have totally lost our way as a society.  We have heard much about compassion and human rights.  I agree with that wholeheartedly; everyone needs compassion and human rights need to be respected.  The sanctity of life needs to be respected.  We are talking about the most vulnerable in our society - an unborn baby who is a weak, vulnerable human being.</p>  <p>  I am in disbelief that this is not already included in the Bill and I have been contacted by constituents who are on both sides.  Some voted "Yes" in the referendum but are stunned this is not provided for in the Bill as are the pro-life constituents, but that goes without saying.  I appeal to the Minister to please show compassion and humanity by including this amendment in the Bill.  Why would he not do that?  It is not good enough to pass the buck and say that it is up to clinical opinion.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is the Minister for Health and has spoken about compassion, human rights and healthcare.  Let us give those to the unborn baby who is the most vulnerable in our society.</p></speech>

It is a very reasonable request that the Minister should consider pain relief in this case, given that we are referring to babies over 20 weeks.  When one considers that a baby is viable at 22 weeks it is imperative that the baby is given pain relief.  There is no point in having the baby suffer needlessly.  I am sure it would also be of great benefit and cause less stress for the mother.  Even if he does not think about the baby in this case the Minister should definitely consider the mother and, hopefully, a reduction in the stress that she might be experiencing at that stage.  I ask that the Minister shows compassion with regard to this amendment.  It is a reasonable amendment and while the Minister has not accepted too many, perhaps this is one that should be accepted by every Member of the House.</p></speech>

The nervous system begins to develop at six weeks.  Sensory receptors that allow pain to be felt develop at seven weeks and they are present across the body by 18 weeks.  It is important that doctors who perform abortions must take all appropriate and practical steps to avoid causing pain to the foetus.  This does not apply in an emergency case where it may not be practicable or where the administration of an anaesthetic to the foetus might pose a risk to the life, or serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman.</p>  <p>  Irish people inherently recognise the humanity of unborn children.  We need to acknowledge this humanity by obliging the medical professionals to minimise the pain of abortion procedure.  Surgeons recognise unborn babies as patients and anaesthetic is routinely used for babies undergoing surgery in the womb.  Surely the same should apply in cases of surgical abortion.  The Bill envisages surgical abortions in certain circumstances beyond 12 weeks gestation.  Clearly, there is a possibility that some of these unborn children are capable of feeling pain, and yet the Bill as it stands has no requirement that unborn children are given appropriate protection from pain during an abortion.  It would be horrible and unnecessary for unborn Irish children to suffer needlessly during an abortion.  To prevent this the Government must accept amendments requiring that unborn children be given pain relief before an abortion procedure wherever there is a reasonable possibility of their experiencing pain.  As I said during the Committee Stage of the debate, abortion by its nature is very violent and invasive.  We must ensure that all unborn children are not subject to pain.</p></speech>

I approached this amendment from a compassionate and humane point of view.  The amendment proposed seeks to ensure that in most cases, not even in all cases, doctors would ensure that the unborn child is not subjected to pain.  It is after the gestational age of the foetus is 20 weeks or more.  This amendment does not prohibit abortion where the baby can feel pain, it merely requires the administration of pain relief.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister in respect of the medical guidelines on this.</p></speech>

Even if one was just to go on the precautionary principle, be the person young, middle aged or older, we never want to see or hear of anyone in pain.  This will go down and be remembered.  Knowledge in medicine is changing constantly.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I do not think we can risk not putting this in the Bill.  A few years down the road, if more evidence comes out proving that we neglected to do something here this evening it will not bode well for us.

Any of us who have been involved in motherhood or fatherhood and have been involved watching the birth of our children and as they grow up, particularly in the early days, even when we could not understand why they were crying, the one thing that would cross our minds is worry that the child was in pain.  I have checked this out medically in terms of what pain may apply to the baby in the womb and it is a fact that pain does apply.  I think a lot of people in this Chamber are thinking of not opposing this amendment.  I urge the Minister to try to support it out of all the amendments.</p></speech>

Around my county since the vote, this is one of the issues that has been discussed by a lot of people.  It is not unreasonable to require the administration of an anaesthetic to a foetus where the medical practitioner who is carrying out the termination is of the reasonable opinion, formed in good faith, that the gestational age of the foetus is 20 weeks or more. This is an advanced pregnancy and extra steps must be taken to ensure no pain is caused during the termination process.  This obligation would not apply in an emergency case where it is not practicable or where it is believed that the administration of an anaesthetic to the foetus might pose a risk to the life or to the health of the pregnant woman.  If there is no harm to the woman in this situation, there is no reason this cannot be administered.  Anaesthetic and pain relief for babies undergoing surgery in the womb is generally recommended and this is simply an extension of that medical practice.  I ask that the Government to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

One thing we all try to avoid is pain, as adults or in any walk of life.  We are speaking here for someone that cannot speak for itself, the foetus or baby, whatever you like to call it.  It is a medically proven fact that from 20 weeks onward, foetuses are affected and can feel pain.  The Minister should take this on board.  It will not affect the referendum in any way and it will protect against something that should not happen, namely pain, when abortions take place.</p></speech>

As previous speakers have said, it in no way hinders or jeopardises the movement of the legislation through the D&aacute;il whether we like it or not.  We are coming a long way.  At one stage we had the right to life and we are coming to the reverse stage.  I listened to some speakers in the last couple of days, yesterday in particular, and they were likening an unwanted pregnancy in terms of women's healthcare to that of women having cancer.  I feel very saddened about that kind of comparison being used.  We have come a long way from the right to life and maybe a person should have the right to a termination in an orderly and medically approved formula.  I would say that we support this amendment.</p></speech>

It is very reasonable and I do not know how anyone could have grounds to object to it.  I sincerely hope the Minister can accede to this amendment.  It is important from the point of view that everything is stressful enough, there is enough of pain and suffering in the termination process so the least that could be done is to try to ease the pain where possible and practicable.  I fully support the amendment.</p></speech>

I understand the points they are trying to raise but, as I did outline clearly on Committee Stage, I cannot accept the proposal to include a separate section in the Bill which would provide for the administration of an anaesthetic to a foetus where the gestational age of the foetus is 20 weeks or more because, as I explained on Committee Stage when the Deputies first submitted this amendment, the purpose of this legislation is not to regulate or dictate the practice of obstetrics. That is not what we do in this House.  There is a very thin line that we should not cross where we move from being policy makers to being doctors.  We have to be very conscious of that.</p>  <p>  Medical practitioners are bound through professional regulatory mechanisms to operate in accordance with best medical practice.  The requirements in sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 for medical practitioners to be of the reasonable opinion, formed in good faith, emphasise that doctors must maintain professional standards and must uphold medical ethics.  It is simply not appropriate to include detailed medical treatment, compulsory care pathways or treatment plans in legislation.  There are no such provisions in respect of the woman's health or care in this legislation because that would not be appropriate either.  It is not where we put a detailed care pathway.  It is not where we put information about medication.  This type of detail is set out by doctors as they go about their obstetric practice through clinical guidelines rather than in primary legislation.  I have previously assured colleagues in this House that in parallel with the service planning and expansion work, clinical guidelines for medical practitioners on termination of pregnancy are also in preparation.  It is right and proper that clinical guidelines are drawn up by clinicians and not by politicians.  My Department has provided a grant to support this work to enable the timely and efficient completion of the guidelines.</p></speech>

It is a bit rich for the Minister to say that he, as Minister and a legislator, thinks we should not be interfering with the medical profession.  It is a human right for somebody who might suffer pain to be offered pain relief.  I asked the Minister to give an intelligent and thoughtful response as to why he believes we are wrong.  I still have not heard that from him.  I would still dearly like to hear that from him.  He should give me a factual reason it is wrong to offer pain relief to an unborn child.  I want a straight answer to that.</p>  <p>  I saw the horror and shock.  I saw how the Minister tried to interfere with the Acting Cathaoirleach.  He tried to stop Deputy Mattie McGrath from reading out this letter.  Other people may not have noticed it.  In case anyone was not looking at the Minister, he badgered the Acting Cathaoirleach to try to stop Deputy Mattie McGrath from reading out this letter.  The Minister refused to accept a copy of the letter when it was given to him.  This happens to Ministers every day; they are handed letters.  The Minister did not want this letter because it contained the commitment and promise he gave to the electorate when he said he was pro-life.  He has gone a long way from that now, but he showed an awful lot when he showed how shocked and horrified he was at the idea of Deputy Mattie McGrath reading into the record of the D&aacute;il the letter the Minister sent to thousands of people saying, "Dear pro-life campaign" and signed "Kind regards, Simon".  Well Simon has changed an awful lot since then.</p>  <p>  Potassium chloride is an extremely corrosive and painful thing to have going into anybody.  All we are asking is to have pain relief for that.  My God, it does not get any simpler or more humane than that.</p></speech>

We can no longer bury our heads in the sand.  The Bill currently passing through the D&aacute;il would legalise the procedures I mentioned in my previous speech, with no regard for any human rights of the child, with no regard for any human dignity of that child and with no regard for any pain or suffering those procedures may cause to those children.  The intention of this amendment is to recognise that these procedures often cause suffering to unborn babies.  The very least we owe those babies is to protect them from pain.</p>  <p>  It is worth reminding ourselves that despite the misleading Title of the Bill as the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill, the definition of that phrase in the Bill makes it clear that the Bill is all about the termination of life.  Section 2 defines termination of pregnancy as a medical procedure which is intended to end the life of a baby.  The Minister would like us to believe that doctors who want to participate in the intentional ending of a child's life usually on the request of the mother, would then, of course, also consider the matter of pain relief for the baby, but this is just not logical.</p>  <p>  Surely that means it is up to us to ensure the child's interests are represented in some small way in the Bill.  These procedures are in stark contrast to procedures specifically intended to deliver a baby early to end a pregnancy that way.  We are speaking here of the only procedures regulating this Bill - those intended to end the life.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that he has not made it clear exactly which procedures to end the life of that defenceless baby would be legal.  Therefore, we can only assume that the most barbaric and inhumane ones would be legal unless the Minister outlaws them.  Up to now the Minister has neglected to put any protections for unborn babies in the Bill.  We will not hold our breaths on that one.</p>  <p>  It is already horrific enough that we are even discussing how we would end the life of an unborn child.  As Members will all know at this stage, I would always favour trying to help every unborn baby to live as well as helping the mother through whatever difficult situation she is in.</p></speech>

I was not going to say this, but over the past couple of weeks I spoke to the Minister privately about different parts of this legislation.  I like to be honest.  On every occasion I spoke to him, he gave me time.  He explained things to me as late as today.  We need to speak to the amendments.  We are all trying to get solutions here and do the right thing from the perspective of our own conscience.</p>  <p>  I would like the Minister to give us more clarification on the medical guidelines.  I reiterate that neither I nor any of my colleagues would do anything that would damage women's health.  We should all be honest and honourable.  I will not publicly run down the Minister because every time I approached him he tried to explain things to me.</p></speech>

Since the referendum, I have not met one person who would begrudge giving painkillers to a foetus.  I cannot understand what the Minister is doing.  Is he going by the recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer again?  I cannot understand it.  Anyone who has any kind of compassion whatsoever would agree.  If one saw a cat or dog in pain on the street, one would take them to the vet to help them out.  I cannot understand why a foetus that is in pain is not being allowed to have an anaesthetic.  I ask the Minister to stop blaming the Chief Medical Officer.</p></speech>

However, that is just my view of the world.</p>  <p>  This unearthing of a commitment I made in 2011, which obviously does not relate to the amendment, but which a number of people are referencing, is no unearthing.  The Deputy is right; that was my position in 2011.  It is my party's position; it echoes in it.  I have changed my view.  I am delighted I changed my view.  I am delighted I campaigned and voted to repeal the eighth amendment of the Constitution.</p></speech>

It is the job of the obstetric community.  Those pro-life Deputies in the House - and I think we all consider ourselves to be pro-life - who are against the legislation must agree with that also.  If they believed that a pain relief provision must be included in primary legislation, surely to God they would have included it for women as well.  They have not done so, however, because they know doctors will do that, just as doctors will also take every appropriate step to protect babies.  That is what they do.  To suggest anything else would be a slur on their profession.</p>  <p>  Deputies Butler, Aindrias Moynihan and Eugene Murphy asked for assurances.  I cannot write the clinical guidelines, nor would anybody want me to, but I can assure them that our clinicians know how to carry out procedures and operate in an ethical manner in accordance with the Medical Council.  I have absolutely no doubt about that.  Our doctors go into hospitals every day to ease pain and I have no doubt that all these issues will be considered when the clinical guidelines are being drawn up.  What we cannot do in this House is don the white coats and the stethoscopes and become obstetricians and gynaecologists.  We are policymakers.  Pain relief and care pathways come from doctors, not politicians.</p></speech>

We said all along - and I repeated it earlier - that we accept totally where an intervention has to be made in an emergency in terms of anything that would affect the health or the life of the mother.  The Minister does not have to pick up on that.  That is quite clear and understood by all of us.</p>  <p>  Some abortion advocates claim that the unborn child cannot feel pain until the third trimester.  However, that claim is contradicted by the modern evidence to which, increasingly, the Minister does not want to listen.  There is growing scientific evidence from around the world that babies in the womb feel pain before 20 weeks.  Anaesthetic and pain relief for babies undergoing surgery in the womb is generally recommended and has been called for in late-term abortions.  Some say that should be done from as early as 18 weeks' gestation.  Surgeons recognise unborn babies as patients, yet the Minister tells us that the reason he is refusing to accept this amendment is that we might be interfering with that.  Surgeons understand this issue.  All the people in labour wards understand it.  We are not trying to be cruel.  I did not want to say it but Deputy Fitzpatrick said that if there was a dog, a pup or a kitten lying on the street, we would lift it up and mind it by providing warmth, pain relief or whatever.  It would be horrific and unnecessary for unborn children to suffer needlessly during an abortion.</p>  <p>  To prevent that, this amendment should be accepted without any difficulty.  It is a clear duty of compassionate and humane doctors to act on the precautionary principle of prevention of pain where there is a risk that it may be experienced.  This amendment does not prohibit abortion where the baby can feel pain; it merely requires the administration of pain relief.  It is the most humane request in the world and the Minister has set his face against it.  I am shocked.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900048#YY00100"><p>I move amendment No. 38:</p><blockquote>In page 11, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following: <br /><br /><b>&ldquo;Protection of Infants born alive </b><br /><br /><b>16</b>. (1) In this section, &ldquo;born alive&rdquo; means the complete emergence of a foetus from the body of the woman, regardless of the state of gestational development, who, after emergence, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached, and regardless of whether the emergence occurs as a result of natural or induced labour, caesarean section, termination of pregnancy or otherwise, shows any evidence of life including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: (a) breathing; <br /><br />(b) a heartbeat; <br /><br />(c) umbilical cord pulsation; or <br /><br />(d) definite movement of voluntary muscles. (2) In this section, &ldquo;infant&rdquo; means a foetus who has been born alive as a result of the carrying out or attempted carrying out of a termination of pregnancy under this Act. <br /><br />(3) A medical practitioner shall take all steps as may be appropriate and practicable to preserve the life of an infant. <br /><br />(4) For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the infant has been born alive as a result of the carrying out or attempted carrying out of a termination of pregnancy under this Act shall not be a relevant consideration for a medical practitioner when determining what constitutes an appropriate and/or practicable step under <i>subsection (3)</i>.&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>The amendment requires that a doctor take all appropriate and practical steps to preserve the life of an infant who is born alive as a result of the carrying out, or attempted carrying out, of a termination of pregnancy.  It provides for a basic humanity that should have been included in the Bill from the outset, and it is strange and perverse that it was not.  It gives clarity and certainty to doctors on how to proceed where an abortion does not result in the death of a baby.  It makes clear that where there are indications of life after birth there is a duty to act to save that life.  It does not dictate to medical practitioners what steps are appropriate in any given case.</p><p>This will vary in the circumstances, particularly the stage of gestation.  Different considerations will apply, such as if the infant is born alive after the point of viability.  That will be a matter for clinicians at each delivery.</p> <p> Abortion survivors being left without care is not a theoretical problem  Official figures show in a ten year period starting in 2000, 491 babies who survived botched abortions were abandoned by medical staff and left to die alone without care in Canadian hospitals.  In the UK the confidential inquiry into maternal and child health revealed that in 2005, 66 babies in England and Wales were born alive and left, unaided, to die after failed abortions.  The amendment, if accepted by the Minister and his colleagues, would ensure that such a scandal will not happen here.  It will do nothing to prevent access to abortion but it will avoid the gross human rights abuse that happens when a law does not protect babies who survive abortions.  It is unimaginable and unthinkable that such a thing can happen in any right-thinking hospital or care situation where there are medics who have taken the Hippocratic oath and love what they do and do it well and where what they do 99% of the time is save lives.</p> <p> The Minister used the word "compassion" often during the referendum campaign and since.  The amendment is all about compassion and care to one of the most vulnerable in our society, the tiny vulnerable baby who just survived the trauma of an abortion.  There is no justification for a cold conclusion that the baby does not deserve compassion.</p> <p> Am&aacute;rach Research conducted polling in the wake of the referendum which showed that 69% of respondents believed that where an unborn baby survives an abortion procedure and is born alive that doctors should be obliged to give it medical care to preserve his or her life; only 9% disagreed and the others said they did not know.  These and the figures from Canada and the UK inquiry shine a light on the chilling reality of legalised abortion without protection against practices which are rarely discussed in public.  However, it is a conversation that we must have.</p> <p> It is no good for the Minister to say that this will not happen in Irish hospitals when we all know that abortion clinics will inevitably become the main providers.  It is happening across the water and in many other jurisdictions.  Any mealy-mouthed assurances from the Minister will cut no cloth with any of us or with most right-thinking people, including the 69% in the Am&aacute;rach poll.</p> <p> I have stood outside the gates of this House and heard a very brave woman in her 40s tell her story of her botched abortion.  Thankfully, she survived and is able to talk about it all over the world.  She has a family of her own and is expecting grandchildren.  As I said last night, I have heard about more than one case and I have heard many others give testimony.  We know there are countless numbers of people.  Anything can go wrong in a safe delivery but when one is out to destroy life, one might not always succeed.  I have seen the evidence.  It was a pity that when that woman came to Dublin during the summer and hotels were booked for her to tell her story, they were forced to cancel the bookings.  That was not the case in Cork, however, where we held the event in the hotel without a problem.  In Dublin, it had to be held in candlelight, where she gave her testimony on the street in front of a hotel.  We talk about democracy and about choice, but what of the choice adults might make to go and listen to this woman whose name, which I should have read into the record, eludes me?  I salute her telling her story about the trauma she went through for days, after saline material was injected into her.  A caring nurse was passing and heard her squeals for protection, like any infant born, or animal, for that matter, and had compassion and took her into her care and gave her heat and liquids.  Now she has life to tell the tale.  What a wonderful story.  To think that after meetings were booked, arranged and deposits paid, hotels in this city were bulldozed and intimidated and staff followed home to ensure that woman could not deliver her story in three different quasi-public places and that the meeting had to be held in candle light.  It was more powerful in candlelight by the Liffey in Dublin, where hundreds of people with compassion and humanity listened to the story.  We are asking for nothing more than some shred of humanity to be put into this barbaric legislation.  All we are asking with these amendments is for some shred of humanity.  We will not be ridiculed for doing so as we do so honestly and respectfully.</p></speech>

As the previous Deputy said, it is basic humanity that if a baby survives and is seen to be viable that there is an onus on everyone, obstetricians and all other medical personnel, to ensure they are given every chance to survive.  The Minister should take this on board.  It is only giving basic rights to an infant that was born and was breathing, that they should be given the opportunity to live.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900049#ZZ00300"><p>I emailed the Chairman of the committee on the eighth amendment during its hearings to ask if she would invite an abortion survivor to appear before the committee.  I had met one who had undergone practically the experience that is dealt with in the amendment.  She was a grown woman who wanted to tell her story and was happy to do so to the committee.  The Chairman said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I approached another member of that committee and asked if he might make representations to the rest of the committee that this abortion survivor would make a presentation.  He responded by asking whether there was such a thing.  That individual had sat through the whole debate at the committee, had formed a particular view on the amendment, and was unaware that there are actually individuals who have survived abortions.  That person made no effort to have that woman make her presentation.  I would have thought that a committee such as that would have inputs from both sides of the debate which would help the members make up their minds.  We have heard<i>ad nauseam</i>from Deputy Durkan that he was at the committee and he heard all the information and was strengthened by it to make the decisions he made around the issue, yet people such as abortion survivors were denied access to that committee.  It shocked me that would be the case but that is how politics works in this country.</p><p>Around the world, unborn children survive abortions.  I do not like to talk about it in much detail as it is something that is difficult to discuss, but they survive in a very injured state.  In most cases they are simply left to expire and they are not given comfort or medical treatment.  Many people will say that does not happen and that I am talking baloney.  It might make it easier for those people to have their opinions if they convince themselves that is the case.  However, the statistics mentioned, which were produced by the departments of health in Canada and Britain, illustrate that it does happen.  It happens in countries beside us and that have very similar values to us in many of these things.  When one goes down the route of a competition of rights, that the primary and untouchable right is the decision to end the life of the unborn child, then resuscitating an infant which is about to expire becomes less of an objective.</p><p> I had this debate with the Minister at the committee.  He stated that this would never happen here and how dare I even consider that a doctor would allow it to happen, as if to say that doctors in Ireland are somehow morally superior to their counterparts in Britain, Canada or anywhere else.  The truth is that we have had a pro-life culture within the society and within the health services for decades.  As a result, most doctors would find the type of situation we are discussion very difficult to deal with.  It is one they would not allow to arise in the first instance.  We know, however, that in countries where abortion is freely available, the culture changes.  If it happens elsewhere, it will happen here.  The Minister was vociferous on Committee Stage in stating that it would not happen here.  The question I would ask is what it would cost the Minister to simply codify it in law.  Again, why is there a difficulty in doing that?</p> <p> There are many with older heads than me in this D&aacute;il.  Many Members have fought the Government in bigger battles.  Everyone knows that sometimes, when a Minister just does not want to deal with an issue, he or she will think of a reason it cannot be done and why it is difficult to codify it in law.  The Minister will not say, "I do not want this to be done", but will just give an excuse as to why it cannot be done.  In that type of situation, most of us know it is transparently the fact the Minister does not want to codify it.  My view is that we have a responsibility to do that.</p> <p> This is one of those issues that resonates deeply with people.  This is another amendment that does not seek to reduce access in any way.  Even for people for whom access is the prime objective and ambition and those who are maximalist in the context of their wish for abortion to be made available on all occasions, this amendment does not interfere with their goals.  What it does is reflect the humanity of the unborn child.  I have spoken to many people who are pro-choice and who have similar views to some Deputies but they baulk at the refusal of the Government to codify this in primary legislation.  The excuse is that somebody somewhere will do something about it at some point.  They say that it is not our problem, not our responsibility.  They say medical care for that infant is not a policy decision in some way.  It is a policy decision; it is 100% a policy decision.</p> <p> Anybody who looks at law will say that comparative politics is very important.  We are not living in complete disconnect from the rest of the world.  Obviously, some of the laws we are implementing are part of trends that have happened in other parts of the world.  Logic will dictate that the way this legislation operates in Irish society is going to follow the general trends in other societies.</p> <p> I again appeal to the Minister.  This is a logical, humane response to a very difficult situation that does not seek to reduce access one iota.  All it seeks to do is give confidence to people that if that situation were to arise here and if a clinician who had worked in the British system and was acting with regard to the cultural understanding he or she had of that system was in any doubt, he or she would know that in Ireland he or she would have no choice but to intervene to protect the life, where possible.</p></speech>

However, they depend on us to legislate and put a sensible Bill together in which we would respect humanity.  It is difficult for me to stand here, hour after hour, talking about ending life because that is not what I was brought up to do.  From a very young age, I was taught to appreciate life, not to hurt anyone but to do anything that could be done to help anyone.  Even with cattle and other animals, I was told that if I wronged them, it would turn back on myself.  I refer, for example, to situations where I might neglect animals that could not talk for themselves or defend themselves when they were tied to a stall, needed feed and so on.  That is the way I was brought up by my parents and grandparents.  We are supposed to legislate and that is what we have tried to do.  We have tried to ensure that common sense applies in the context of this Bill.</p>  <p>  It can happen that babies who are aborted end up alive.  During my first year in the House, 2016, I met a woman downstairs in Buswells, as did other Deputies.  She was 39 years of age at the time, so she must be 41 now.  She told us of her experience.  She had been aborted and she was placed in some kind of a vessel - a bucket.  I am sure that is what she told us.  Some nurse-----</p></speech>

She told us clearly that her mother was forced into having an abortion.  That is what happened.  She ended up alive because some good nurse came back, took her out, saw to her and she survived.  She came to Buswells to tell us her story.  It frightened me to think that actually happened.  We have figures on this but they are not as real to me as that person telling me her story.  The figures indicate that, in 2005, 66 babies in England and Wales were born alive after failed abortions and then, breathing unaided, were left to die.  This amendment makes sure that such a scandal will not happen here.  Of course, the amendment will do nothing to prevent access to abortion but it will avoid the gross human rights abuse that happens when the law does not clearly protect babies who survive abortion.</p>  <p>  The breadth of the top of my nail is the difference between being dead and being alive.  A small bit of extra attention can ensure that the person is alive rather than dead, and it is likewise with a baby.  This amendment provides clarity and guidance for doctors by creating a duty to save the life of a child who is born alive after an attempted abortion.  The Minister said to us at the committee that this is what doctors would do in any event.  All we are asking for is to be sure about that.</p>  <p>  Heretofore, we did not have abortion in this country.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The doctors that we know were dedicated and trained, and the midwives, to ensure in the maternity ward that everything was done to ensure that they would live.  We know that is what they are doing and have been doing.  This is different.  This is an abortion clinic and all we are asking is that the same effort is put into ensuring that if the baby arrives out alive he or she gets every chance at life the same as the baby that was born in the maternity ward.  That is all we are asking.  It is not unreasonable.  The Minister should not criticise us or say that it is unfair of us to ask for this.  It is only a small thing in all of this Bill but to us it is a very big thing, to the little baby that might come out alive it would be a chance at life and that is all we all want, a chance to live as long as we can.  That is all we are asking.  Until the day I die, whether I win or lose the next election or the one after that, I will never be sorry for asking for this here in this Chamber because I may never again get the chance to do that.</p></speech>

It would be very cruel and wrong to allow an infant born alive simply to die when the medical professionals make every effort to save the lives of others.  In addition to the medical ethics there is a moral duty to fight for every person born, regardless of the circumstances of their birth.  This is a reasonable amendment.  I will not go into the cases that we have heard.  We have all heard and read about them and I do not want to see anything like that happening here in Ireland.  We respect the decision of the Irish people and this legislation will pass here in the D&aacute;il but we want to put a few safeguards in there that if a child is born alive and there is some hope that the child can be saved we would like to see it in this Bill that every effort will be made to save that infant.</p></speech>

However, the Minister seems to have forgotten that in this case the doctor was likely to be the doctor who had been tasked with ending the baby's life, therefore surely the Minister can appreciate that there may be a conflict as to what he or she should do at this point.  The doctor was asked to end that baby's life and now the baby is born alive, possibly unwanted by their mother.  This is not as cut and dried as the Minister likes to suggest.</p>  <p>  During the abortion debate I spent time speaking to everybody.  People would not have the same views as me but I have to respect their views.  As late as two weeks ago I had a lengthy debate in my constituency office with a person who would not agree with my views but we both shook hands when it was finished and we accepted that we were each entitled to our views.  I did listen with interest because I educated myself along this road.  There is a lot of discussion about the Canadian lady.  Did the Minister meet her?  Did he spend a little bit of time with her?  He has met with so many people who approve of his Bill and on Committee Stage he said something along the lines that he would meet and discuss with people who want to progress this Bill.  There was no harm in meeting and listening to the other side of the story.  It was an astonishing story.  I will not go into the details because others have done that.  There are others out there who have met different individuals.  She had an extraordinary story to tell.  She was an abortion that went wrong but she lived thanks to the nurse who saved her.  The one good point about all of this is that she and her mother are now inseparable.  That is the message for the whole of this island: sometimes abortion is not the answer; sometimes there is another answer.  That lady got that little twinkle of light and that little chance to live and she and her mother are inseparable now.  They have a great relationship.  I can see Deputy O'Connell behind the Minister nodding away mad against what I am saying but that is because she probably did not meet this lady either and hear the other side of the story.  It is necessary to talk to people, whether one agrees with them or not.  It is good to listen.  That is something the Minister does not want to do but that is his prerogative.</p>  <p>  I think we all, including the Minister, agree with the principle that if an infant is born alive during a failed abortion procedure they would be guaranteed to be given the same medical care that a premature baby of that same gestation would be given.  Why then can we not enshrine this principle in our legislation to ensure that no doctor will have any conflict in the area?</p>  <p>  It is reported that in the UK 66 babies were left to die in one year with no care after being born alive during failed medical procedures.  That is incredible.  Unfortunately, that is the road we are now travelling.  The Minister has an opportunity to turn that around and change that and at least have something enshrined in the Bill that protects the child that was born after an abortion.  I hope that the Minister might give more careful and considered time to accepting this amendment.  Like all the amendments we have put forward, we are fair and honest and we spent time putting them together to make sure that we did not flood the whole Bill with amendments that would not reflect the feelings of the public.  This is one that does reflect those feelings and I would appreciate if the Minister gave time to considering support for this amendment.</p></speech>

This evening we are talking about a baby who has just survived an abortion.  It would be unbelievable if the Minister was to reject an amendment that does nothing to prevent access to an abortion but is all about saving lives.  We cannot have a situation in Ireland where doctors in one part of the hospital are doing everything possible to save a premature baby born at say 23 weeks, while in another part of the same hospital a baby born at 24 weeks, after surviving an abortion, is left without life-saving care for whatever reason.  This amendment is sought to give clarity and certainty to doctors on how to proceed when abortion does not result in the death of the baby.</p>  <p>  It makes it clear that where there are indications of life like breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation or a definite movement of the voluntary muscles there is a duty to act to save that life.  Nothing can be more compassionate and clearer.  This amendment will significantly assist doctors in carrying out their duties.</p>  <p>  We must also be cognisant of the human rights abuse of children who survive an abortion and are left without care.  This is not a theoretical problem as we have plenty of evidence of such cases in England, Canada, Wales and elsewhere, where babies born alive after botched abortions are left alone in hospitals to die without the care of medical staff.  We cannot allow such human rights abuses to happen here.  Abortion in Ireland will be legal up to six months into a pregnancy in some cases.  We can only hope that the number of children who experience the cruel after-effects of failed abortion procedures will be few and far between.  At the same time, however, we must ensure that they are cared for and that is what this amendment is all about, clarity and certainty for doctors.</p></speech>

From the beginning, the amendment has sought to do exactly what the Constitution enjoins us to do.  I am surprised that the Minister did not accept the amendment in principle on Committee Stage.  He would have probably got a better wording from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  However, the spirit of the amendment is clear and it is very much in line with our constitutional obligations as legislators.</p> <p> We hear a great deal about how doctors care and I do not dispute that they do.  At least, I hope all doctors care.  We have had rogue doctors in the past, however, and we should not pretend otherwise.  There have been rogue individuals in every profession.  Despite the fact that we trust doctors, this land is full of laws, regulations and guidelines which doctors can be severely penalised for failing to follow.  The reason is that even though we trust all of these people - just as, I hope, we politicians are trusted by them - we must ensure that no professional can act in a way that does not conform with good standards.  A general question has been asked as to whether some allegation is being made here, but that is not so.  Every profession is subject to the law.  It is nothing new and there is no reason to make an exception in this case.</p></speech>

I am not in a position to accept this amendment which is indistinguishable from the amendment on the same subject put forward on Committee Stage.  We had a long discussion and vote on that amendment then.  While I can see that the amendment is proposed with the care of infants in mind -  and I do not question the Deputy's bona fides in that regard at all - the purpose of the legislation is not to regulate obstetric procedures which do not constitute the termination of pregnancy nor is it to dictate the practice of obstetrics or medicine more generally.  It should be borne in mind that the legislation bans termination of pregnancy once viability is reached, unlike other jurisdictions, including many referred to during the debate.  Medical practitioners are bound to maintain professional standards and uphold medical ethics at all times.  They are bound by their professional regulatory mechanisms to deliver medical services in accordance with best medical practice.  Any Deputy who wishes to read the transcripts from the health committee to which representatives of the Institute of the Obstetricians and Gynaecologists gave evidence will see that this is already the practice.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding our differences on this legislation, I am very concerned that word might go out from this House that there is some question or doubt as to what a doctor would actually do if a baby were born alive.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that there is an obligation on all of us once someone is born.  That is why we also have a ban on termination once viability is reached.  I heard a reference to the idea that these might be pregnancies which are unwanted.  However, in the situations we are discussing, there is a serious risk to the life of the woman or of serious harm to her health or there is a fatal fetal abnormality.  This is a situation where a pregnancy has gone wrong and the medical profession is intervening to protect and save the woman.  As Members have heard countless times, in doing so they will always endeavour, where possible, to protect the life of an unborn baby also.  There is absolutely no question about that.  It is also the case, I suggest, with the mother.  The idea that a baby would be born and left in a corner of a hospital is not in accordance with what happens in the Irish health service.  It is not what is allowed under Medical Council guidelines, regulatory guidelines and ethical standards.  We cannot get into regulating obstetric practice which does not relate to the termination of pregnancy in a Bill which is about access to abortion services.</p></speech>

How can we ensure that practice is incorporated?  We do not know exactly where these abortion clinics are going to be.  As such, how can we ensure the same regulations will move over to these practices?</p></speech>

This is about dignity in death and the protection of infants born alive.  It is reasonable to save a child who defies the object of what is trying to be achieved, namely his or her death.  If an infant is born alive, what we are seeking here is just basic humanity.  It is basic dignity for a person to have a fighting chance at life if he or she is born alive after what we term a "failed abortion."  I will not repeat the horror stories such as those Deputy Mattie McGrath highlighted whereby people survived abortion, but we have to cater for such cases.  The Minister would be the first to say that one has to allow for every eventuality.  This is an eventuality which could happen and we should legislate for it.  We should legislate for the protection of the baby who survives an abortion.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

Quite rightly, we hear in the House and at every committee people advocating strongly for support for the most vulnerable in society.  It is a basic tenet which we should all support.  There is no one more vulnerable than the baby catered for in this particular amendment.  The protection offered if this amendment were accepted would provide support to infants born alive as a result of the carrying out or attempted carrying out of termination of pregnancy under the Act.  It is important for the Minister to give favourable consideration to the very fair proposals put forward in this amendment.  There is a moral duty on everyone in the medical profession and among its support staff to fight for every person born regardless of the circumstances of his or her birth.  The amendment merits approval by the House.  In that context, I hope the Minister can revise what he has just said.</p></speech>

I had to go out to get a charger for my phone.  This is a most basic request regarding an abortion which goes wrong in the eyes of the unfortunate woman who wants it for whatever reason unfortunately and in those of the professional engaged to carry out the act.  We have cases and I have given them to the Minister.  I have provided him with figures from Canada and England.  Are we going to shut our eyes and ears to that evidence?  We have heard from the lady from Canada who also spoke to many thousands of people across the country and all over the world.  It is a wonderful story.  I forgot to mention that she and her mother - who was forced to go for an abortion by her own mother - have an eternal bond and are very close.  Her mother is now a grandmother.  These things happen and we are not leaving it up to whim.  We will be discussing conscientious objection later but no conscientious person could hear the squeaks and squalls of a little infant delivered in the middle of an abortion process.  That professional should be allowed the space and encouraged in the legislation to offer human aid and should see that there is nothing wrong or harmful in doing so.  It is basic humanity.  The animal world would kill a third person after giving birth.  I have had experiences with cows calving and sheep.  Those animals would kill a person to protect their young.  Are we, as a human race, going to be forced to allow our young to perish in this way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900053#DDD00100"><p>This is a difficult issue.  I am not sure about the circumstances where Deputy Mattie McGrath and others spoke about a baby surviving a termination of pregnancy but there are four areas in this legislation where a pregnancy can be terminated.</p>  <p>  One area is before 12 weeks, so that will not apply to this amendment.  The second area is when there is an emergency and it quite possible that a woman's health would be at risk and one is on the cusp of the baby being viable.  For instance, if it is at 30 weeks, the baby will be delivered as normal.  There will not be a termination of pregnancy but there will be a normal delivery and at 30 weeks that baby will most likely survive quite healthily.  If it is at 20 weeks, the baby is very unlikely to survive but it may be on the cusp of viability at 22, 23 or 24 weeks and there may be a possibility that it can survive.  Medical ethics will of course kick in and it will be ethically required of the medical profession to do what it can to continue the life of that baby.  The circumstance which is being described here is very unlikely to occur in this jurisdiction under this legislation.</p>  <p>  The other area where a baby would be born alive is with a fatal foetal abnormality, which will have been accurately diagnosed before the delivery and some of those children will continue to live for some time, be it a few hours, a few days or maybe a few weeks.  Of course, every effort will be made to help that baby to survive and for the family to interact with that baby.</p>  <p>  What is being proposed in this amendment is not possible within this legislation but if it was to be the case that a child was delivered and it was alive, medical ethics would kick in and would give every assistance to that baby, provided there was a possibility that the baby would have a time to survive and to live.  The amendment may be well intentioned but it will not arise as a practical situation in this legislation because if a baby is born alive and is viable, everything will be done to preserve the life of that child through medical ethics.  I do not know if medical ethics can be introduced into this legislation but the possibility of a baby being left to die at the side of a bed without any intervention is completely unlikely in the medical system that we have today.</p></speech>

Perhaps those Deputies who have spoken to these alleged survivors of botched abortions in other jurisdictions would take a trip to one of the special care units in one of our maternity hospitals where every day, every effort is made to preserve life.</p>  <p>  I have witnessed a case of a woman's life being at risk.  A very good friend of mine had a baby born at 25 weeks who is now in school and every effort was made and that child survived.  Instead of listening to anecdotes, fairy tales and stories that essentially have dubious sources, perhaps the Deputies could educate themselves by visiting those units and speaking to the consultants who save lives every day.</p>  <p>  In terms of viability-----</p></speech>

It is not up to us in these Houses to legislate on the point of viability because the experts tell us that it is not possible because hopefully with science, which we are heavy on here today, in time we will be able to assist early deliveries to survive from 22 weeks or so in the future.</p>  <p>  This amendment might be well intentioned but it is certainly ill informed.</p></speech>

It is clear that he is not listening to what we are saying or does not understand what we are saying.  We are simply asking for something basic and humane, which is that if a baby survives an abortion, he or she gets the same attention as a baby in a maternity ward.  We are talking about two different places because when a woman goes into the maternity ward, the ambition is to ensure that the baby is born and looked after.  We are not sure because we did not have abortion here in this country heretofore.</p>  <p>  A number of us, and I am sure a number of Deputies on the other side as well, definitely met this lady across the road in Buswells.  She told us what happened to her, we believe her and she gave us a firm account of what happened.  Herself and her mother are good friends now.  The mother was forced into having the abortion by another family member and gladly, she survived all that trauma.  We are simply asking that everything possible is done and every medical intervention available is utilised to ensure the baby gets a proper chance at life.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that he would reject an amendment that seeks to protect an infant born alive after an abortion.  That is astonishing to say the least but it is along the same lines on which he has been travelling with omissions from this Bill to protect a baby in what is an unlikely situation, albeit one that does happen and there is proof out there.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Keeffe said, what we are trying to put forward in this amendment is the same as what is in our Constitution and I fully agree with him.  The Minister says that this is not what we do in our hospitals but we do not perform abortions in our hospitals yet so how do we know what will happen?  There are some excellent hospitals which have brought infants into the world who have fought bravely.  I have been there myself and the aftercare for children in this country is astonishingly brilliant.  It is probably second to none to date, but going forward with a Bill that does not cover all aspects and leaves things wide open in our hospitals, we are now travelling on a different road because we have no protection in this Bill for infants born alive after an abortion.</p>  <p>  My colleague Deputy Harty said that after 20, 21 or 22 weeks, it is very unlikely that a baby would be viable.  There are situations where this happens and it might be very unlikely but if we can save one child in this country with this amendment, I would be very proud that it was brought forward and we have to make sure that such a protection is there.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Connell has left and she was going on about our fairy stories.  Of course she does not want to hear the other side because she has her mind made up.  I listened to the other side but she obviously did not, judging by her comments.  We did meet the woman who was left to die and we discussed that and it is not fair for Deputy O'Connell to say that unless she spoke to that woman herself and was not in the same mood as ourselves.  She also stated that it looks like we have not visited the special care unit but I have been there and we have all been there down through the years.</p><p>I have great respect for Deputy Harty and I find him to be a very decent man.  I want to believe that if a child survives an abortion, the doctors will do everything they can to save the child.  However, as I said earlier to the Minister, who is not in the Chamber at present, we want to give doctors clarity and certainty - that is all we want to do - to ensure they know what will happen.  As one of my colleagues on the opposite side of the House said earlier, who would ever think that 66 babies born alive in the United Kingdom were left unaided to die after failed abortions.  I would never think that would happen in the UK.  Also, officials figures show that over a ten year period in Canada, starting in 2000, 491 babies who survived abortions were abandoned by medical staff and left to die alone in the corner of a hospital.  I would not want to see that happen in this country, but it happens in the UK, in Wales and in Canada.  In terms of trying to save one life, I ask the Minister to provide clarity on this matter.  I cannot understand why he will not consider accepting any of the amendments.  This is a simple request.  As I said from day one, this is one of the safest countries in the world in which to have a child.  I have three children-----</p></speech>

It seems rather than debating the issues her approach was to attack motives and allege total ignorance with no examination of the issues.  I have great respect for Deputy Harty.  He strikes me as one of the most caring of people.  I bow to his knowledge.  I accept that, until now, the entire practise of medicine has been towards saving lives.</p>  <p>  It was gratuitous to say we had not thought about this issue.  Viability varies, as the Minister said, with the child, the mother, gestation and various other factors.  We have all experienced that with family members and we see that in everything to do with the human.  There are so many variables in that regard.  The idea that we did not understand that is wrong.  That is the reason viability is not defined in any specific term of time in the Bill, and all of us agreed on that last night.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Connell referred to intensive care units.  If one goes to Britain, one will find some of the greatest care units for born and unborn children that one could find anywhere in the world.  Twenty-five years ago, a lady in my parish went to England to have an in-the-womb operation, and that was the early days of such operations, and she now has a fully grown adult son.  We all collected money for the hospital.  It is also true to say that, side by side with that fantastic care, there is a very vibrant industry whose sole purpose is to take the lives of children.  I believe, therefore, that we need to vindicate in the law what the Constitution states, namely, the second one is born one is a citizen and one has a right under law to the vindication of one&rsquo;s life.</p></speech>

I listened to Deputy Harty with interest and he spoke very well.  What he said was that if, as the amendment seeks, it happens that a baby survives abortion, the baby will be looked after.  All this amendment would do is enshrine in law that this would happen.  It is not too much to ask that this can be done.</p></speech>

I respect what Deputy Harty said.  He is a member of my group and I respect his knowledge.  I too, thankfully, have a very healthy grandchild.  How dare Deputy O'Connell lecture us about fairy tales or anything else.  She shut me out of the committee.  I brought in a video of an animated abortion.  I asked the chairperson and everybody at the committee to look at it or examine it but, no, they all knew about it.  I asked that women hurt by abortion be brought before the committee.  They were shut out too.  The committee could not get a pro-life doctor.  I complimented RT&Eacute; on a national programme it broadcast one night and it was able to get one to participate in it, no problem.  The committee could not get one.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Connell suggested we should visit a special care unit in one of the maternity hospitals.  I have five daughters and thankfully four granddaughters and we are expecting two more grandchildren, thanks be to God.  My little Amy-Berry was born at 30 weeks.  Her mother, Tr&iacute;ona had suffered from pre-eclampsia.  The care she got in South Tipperary General Hospital, formerly St. Joseph's, in Cork University Hospital and from the neonatal team there was exceptional.  I accept that.</p>  <p>  It is ill-becoming of Dr. Harty to suggest we are imagining things.  We have the figures from England and Canada.  Is there some precious line of protection around Ireland such that this will not happen on the island of saints and scholar, that the abortion industry will not get its greedy claws in here and that this will not be done by private industry and private people?  We are putting our heads in the sand if we think that.  We are appealing for the most basic humane action be taken if an abortion goes wrong.</p>  <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, this practice is happening side by side with great care in hospitals in England, and it will happen side by side in our hospitals, according to the Minister, the messiah.  He is going to tell them all to do it, even though he will not meet or listen the doctors or the nurses who do not want to do it and there can be no conscientious objection.  It will be happening side by side in Ireland as well.</p>  <p>  All we want is that it would be enshrined in law, as stated in the Constitution, that every child once they are born, once they breathe their breath, would be protected, as they are supposed to be, but, no, the Minister, Deputy Harris, knows better.  He is better than the Constitution now all of a sudden since he went on his journey and changed his position from pro-life to being madly pro-abortion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900056#GGG00300"><p>I move amendment No. 41:</p><blockquote>In page 14, line 29, to delete &quot;or <i>section 14</i>certification&quot; and substitute &quot;, <i>section 14</i>certification or <i>section 23</i>certification&quot;.</blockquote><p>Amendment No. 41 relates to certification of the records that are kept and the fact that practitioners and people carrying out abortion procedures will be expected to keep records.  In the discussion on previous amendments, the Minister and many others set their faces against any compassion or intervention whereby the unfortunate unborn baby would be given medicine or an injection for pain relief.  Amendment No. 38 dealt with the most basic human right of all time.  I hate equating this with the animal world but many of us born and raised on farms, particularly on mixed farms, understand what is involved, as do people with pets.  More importantly, those involved in the equine industry understand the effort, the special funds, the special scanning machines and everything else necessary to ensure the safe delivery of prize foals.</p><p>The legislation will be passed and none of the amendments - reasonable and humane as they are and so badly needed for humanity's sake - to offer pain relief where an abortion goes wrong have been accepted.  We have given the figures from Canada, England and other jurisdictions where large numbers of babies have been born during abortions and survived.  Deputy O'Connell and others ridiculed us for moving the amendment and told us to visit a maternity hospital or a neonatal unit.  I have made such visits, as have most of my colleagues.  We are all proud parents and grandparents.  We also have constituents who, every day of the week, have the joy of bringing new life into this world.  This is especially important because t&aacute; M&iacute; na Nollag ag teacht D&eacute; Sathairn and that encourages to think about our Creator and the joy Christmas brings.  We have been lectured about visiting those places.  We have been told that we are insensitive and inhumane and that we listened to fairy stories and fiction about the woman we met.  Hundreds and thousands of other people also listened to her story.  Listening to what she has to say would bring tears from a stone.  She has now bonded with her mother, who was forced to have an abortion and there are now grandchildren.  We saw what was forced on that woman because of financial circumstances.  It was not fiction.  She survived the abortion and is now able to tell that tale all over world in her 42nd year.  She came here to talk about it.</p><p>The amendment makes a very small change regarding certification in order that there might be records kept and accountability and some transparency, albeit for the wrong reason as far as I am concerned, in the context of the taking of human life.  We do not have <i>carte blanche</i>.  It would not be for me anyway because I am a layperson.  Earlier, Deputy Harty spoke about situations whereby it would not happen in Ireland.  I will not question his medical expertise.  I would not even dream of doing so.  I would not be able to and it would be wrong of me to try to do so.  However I would question his judgment as to why it would never happen here.  He mentioned the legislation in the context of the 12-week gestation period, but we know that, in the reckless money-grabbing industry that abortion is throughout the world, there will be late-term and surgical abortions.  We know this.  Our eyes and ears are closed to the facts, to the information that is there, to the records worldwide and to the industry we are discussing.  It is a money-craving industry that involves the sale of body parts and everything else.  How can we be sure this will not happen here?  We cannot guarantee it.</p><p>The intended delivery of a baby can go wrong and unfortunately has gone wrong.  There is great grief.  Others have mentioned fatal foetal abnormality.  I do not want to be repetitive but I travelled to Geneva with a brave cohort of ladies from Ireland and other countries to testify at the United Nations in order to try to get that horrible criminal terminology removed from the vocabulary relating to healthcare and children. Despite the diagnosis, some of them live to be minutes, hours, days or weeks old.  I know of parishes that have had the most joyous celebrations of people with a life limiting diagnosis.  The HSE has adopted the phrase &quot;life-limiting conditions&quot; instead of &quot;fatal foetal abnormalities&quot;.</p><p>There have been celebrations of life.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The mother has the joyous experience of carrying the baby to full term, feeling the baby kick, the delivery, holding the baby, its first breath and giving it its first food and drink before having to part.  However, she has the fingerprints and the footprints, and she has had the joy of creation even if the baby is delivered not healthy and with a life-limiting condition.  She has the joy of having it for hours, days, weeks or months.  Then there is the sadness, grief and trauma but, importantly, there is a funeral and a marked grave that the parents can visit.  All the neighbours - n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile - and the meitheal of the community come to help at the wake.  That is what we do in Ireland, certainly in rural Ireland and, indeed, in urban Ireland as well.  I will not demonise urban Ireland.  That is what we are about.</p> <p> This amendment provides for certification of what happens in the delivery ward, which it should be, although in this case it is the destruction ward.  That is the sad thing for our hospitals.  I salute the midwives, nurses and the neonatal care, but the two will be side by side in small cubicles in hospitals that are overstretched, overutilised and under pressure.  That is the reason I am proposing the amendment.</p></speech>

Yesterday, I mentioned that a high percentage of women in the UK have had two abortions.  I do not wish to discuss that issue but the large percentage who have had up to eight abortions.  I believe, and the experts believe, that a high percentage of these women are being abused.  It is unknown and is not recorded.  They are simply left by themselves and after each abuse are dragged in and basically forced to abort.  The fact that there are no proper records of these events taking place is leaving the woman completely violated.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  It would provide another protection for the woman in this case, although that is true of many other parts of the Bill.  To date the Minister has not accepted any of our amendments no matter how passionate we were or how compassionate they were.  We have all been in hospitals where babies have been born.  Listening to Deputy O'Connell, it was as if she was the only person who ever went to one of these hospitals, but we have all been there.  Thousands of babies have been born in hospitals throughout the country that are second to none and have given them excellent care.  This is a new route we are travelling and, if we do not keep records of what is happening, it will be difficult for us to see the mistakes that will be made here, and it is certain they will be made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900057#HHH00300"><p>This is another amendment that does not seek to change access to abortion in this country.  All it seeks to do is collect information that is necessary to analyse how the service is being provided and to allow people to develop policy on how the service should perhaps change in time.  The amendment seeks to broaden the level of information collected.  In Britain, for example, a large amount of information is collected.  That enables the health service, the government and people who are interested in the subject to analyse what is happening in the system.  The development of proper certification and information would shine a light on how it is being delivered.  That should be neutral, regardless of what side of the debate one is on.  Whether one is pro-choice or pro-life, it is logical that we should have a good understanding of what is happening.  This amendment seeks to collect information that would be collected elsewhere.  It is hard to understand why the collection of information is a threat to anybody, so I ask the Government to consider supporting it.</p></speech>

Regarding the provision of ultrasound, again this is another issue that is difficult to understand.  The issue of abortion was dressed up by the Minister as a choice which was logical and beneficial and should be introduced into Irish law.  All this amendment regarding ultrasound desires is that a choice is given to a mother whereby she would be able to look at the ultrasound if she wishes.  It is a choice that also can be declined if the mother so wishes.  There is no effort here to force anybody to see information that the person does not wish to see.</p>  <p>  We know that informed choices are the best choices.  I have met a large number of individuals who have suffered from abortion regret.  It is one of the dirty little secrets that society does not wish to talk about, but a significant proportion of individuals suffer from abortion regret.  Abortion regret is a very serious issue.  People often suffer great pain and anguish for their entire lives as a result.  The provision of information allows people to be able to make informed decisions.  I have spoken to people who told me that they did not realise the heart was beating at such a young age or that the unborn child was so well formed at 12 weeks.  They did not realise the decision they were making.  Asking the person if she wishes to have this information would be the logical thing to do.  Ultrasound is not a threatening device in any way.  It is a medical device that is designed to help in healthcare.  I cannot understand why that choice is not being afforded to people.</p>  <p>  There is also great unease among doctors about this.  They are being asked to provide abortions in many cases without the technology to enable them to understand the exact health situation of the mother and unborn child.  There is significant worry and fear among doctors that if they do not have an ultrasound to make the necessary decision, first, they will not be doing the best for the mothers or the unborn children concerned and, second, they will put themselves in a very exposed situation because they will be making decisions without the best clinical diagnostic tools that are necessary.  It is beyond comprehension.  I had this debate with the Minister previously.  He admitted that in many, if not most, cases where these decisions are made, an ultrasound will probably be necessary, although he also said that he did not yet have clear information from his advisers that it would be necessary.  I am asking that this amendment be considered for the protection of the mothers, the unborn children and the doctors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1441" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900057#HHH02000"><p>The importance of ultrasound for determining the gestational age of the unborn child and for protecting the life or health of the woman who is undergoing an abortion cannot be overstated, particularly in circumstances where there are concerns about dating the pregnancy or where there is an ectopic pregnancy.  Dr. Peter Boylan, chairperson of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, explicitly informed the Joint Committee on Health on 19 September 2018, when it was discussing the clinical guidelines for the introduction of abortion services, that from nine to 12 weeks women will require hospital management which in turn raises the question of ultrasound as a dating mechanism.</p><p>According to Dr. Boylan&rsquo;s testimony at the committee, figures can vary but in Scotland, for example, approximately 30% of women will require a scan for uncertain dates and the figure here will probably be similar.  He also spoke about the risks of introducing a termination of pregnancy service without having adequate scanning facilities in place and noted current infrastructural deficits in the provision of access to ultrasound services during pregnancy in Ireland.  This deficit raises very serious concerns with respect to the intention of the Minister for Health to have abortion services rolled out nationally as early as January of next year.  These concerns were confirmed by Dr. John O&rsquo;Brien, speaking on behalf of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, in reply to a question from Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  Dr. Mary Favier of the ICGP also informed the committee that the evidence base on the need for ultrasound scanning is becoming clearer.  Dr. Favier added that if ultrasound is required, rapid access to this facility, including the expert provision and interpretation of sonographs, will be a critical element of the pathway.  In addition, a 24-hour helpline, staffed by appropriately trained clinical staff, will be required.  Dr. Favier further noted that GPs have expressed concern regarding capacity and resourcing challenges in areas such as staffing, facilities and training, the potential lack of appropriate specialist support, the possibility of medical complications for patients, and a fear of litigation.  All of these points underscore the necessity of introducing a legal obligation to perform an ultrasound for both the woman and her doctor.  The taking of mifepristone and misoprostol, the so-called abortion pills, in the absence of an ultrasound can lead to potentially catastrophic blood loss for the woman concerned.</p> <p> Confirmation of gestational age is also required for compliance with section 13 of the Bill, which deals with certification relating to early pregnancy, that is, prior to 12 weeks.  This underscores the fact that ultrasound will become a routine part of care in this area.</p> <p> In light of the experts' view of ultrasound as forming a key part of dating pregnancy and determining foetal age, it appears to be reckless in the extreme to even contemplate rolling out abortion services nationally in the face of such challenges in accessing ultrasound.  It was a key concern of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly in its ancillary recommendation that all pregnant women, regardless of geographical location or ability to pay, should have access to early scanning and testing.  Amendment No. 44 seeks to ensure there is a clear framework in place regarding the duties on medical personnel to use ultrasound in a manner that is clear in law.  The amendment offers clarity and certainty for medical personnel, which the Minister repeatedly insists he wants to be provided in the legislation.  It also provides clarity and certainty for women and in no way restricts their access to termination of pregnancy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900058#JJJ00200"><p>I will first address amendment No. 41.  Records are important to ensure that doctors are made aware when a woman who has already had an abortion is about to have a second or third abortion.  I am sure there are implications for the women in question and they need to be protected given the level of care they need.  It is very important that proper records are kept to determine if there is an external reason for a woman having more than one abortion.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 44, I have been asked a lot of questions about the issue of ultrasound and how a general practitioner would determine if the baby to be aborted is less than 12 weeks in gestation.  Will the Minister clarify if a doctor can determine the exact number of days or weeks of a pregnancy without having access to an ultrasound?  I am also aware that ultrasound scans are not available to every GP in rural areas.  We are lucky to have such a facility in Kenmare but that does not mean it is available to all the GPs in the town at the same time.  Will the Minister provide funding for ultrasound equipment for every GP?  If so, will GPs be able to operate this equipment?  This is an important issue.  A woman or girl is entitled to see the ultrasound of her baby.  Failure to support this amendment would mean we are not supporting a woman's entitlement to see an ultrasound of her baby if she wished to do so.  It is clear that we should support the amendment.  I ask Deputies to support the amendment and the important reason for tabling it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.645" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900058#JJJ00400"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  There was a bit of confusion because I did not realise that we were taking amendments Nos. 41 and 44 together.  I was neglectful in failing to spot that.  I am glad we are discussing the two amendments together and I am glad of the opportunity to speak to them.</p>  <p>  With regard to amendment No. 41, in my honest and humble opinion having all types of clarification and certification of records is terribly important.  It would be very remiss of us if we were not to make this important amendment to the Bill.  As I said earlier, I cannot understand why people would not want to have certification and clear records because it is in the interests of everybody concerned, including the lady and the medical practitioners.</p>  <p>  This leads me to amendment No. 44 and the use of ultrasound imaging.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide protection for the lady and doctor.  It is about facts and information and I believe the best clinical advice would be to have an ultrasound.  It is amazing to see the Minister for Health agreeing to fund ultrasound services.  This is great coming from a Minister who cannot fund hip operations or cataract removals.  He is now able to produce money all of a sudden.  That is fine.  We debated that issue last night and I will not repeat the arguments.  It is definitely best medical practice and it is also in the interests of everyone concerned to make provision for ultrasound imaging.  One aspect of our proposal to offer a person the right to see or hear an ultrasound has been misrepresented.  Nobody has said this would be compulsory, as some in the media like to portray it.  There was no such proposal.</p>  <p>  If the Minister is sincere in his wish to implement the will of the people, I see no reason to reject amendment No. 44.  On Committee Stage, I stated that the importance of ultrasound in determining the gestational age of the unborn child and protecting the life or health of the woman who is undergoing an abortion cannot be overstated, especially in circumstances where there are concerns about dating of the pregnancy or in cases of an ectopic pregnancy.  I cannot understand why people would be against this proposal.  That is all I want to say on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.646" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1440" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900058#JJJ00500"><p>Beidh m&eacute; ag labhairt ar leas&uacute; Uimh. 44.</p><p>I reiterate what has already been said.  This is a very reasonable amendment.  It is about giving choice and opportunity.  Nobody is forcing anything on anybody or on any woman in a distressed situation.  The woman who comes in in an emergency situation is exempt from this.  We simply wish to make the point that the importance of ultrasounds for determining the gestational age of the unborn child and for protecting the life or health of the woman who is undergoing an abortion cannot be overstated, particularly in circumstances where there are concerns about the dating in the pregnancy.  There was much discussion on that element through the committee and so on.  It seems very reasonable that we would have this amendment provided for.  It also would relate to cases of ectopic pregnancy, as has been pointed out.</p> <p> We have heard here already that the Am&aacute;rach survey findings published last month show that 79% of adults agree with offering this choice to women on seeing an ultrasound.  I do not think that survey result should be discarded or ignored.  The results of it need to be respected.  We cannot just decide to go with something as we please.  The results of that survey are plain to see.  Contrary to the false reporting that has taken place on this matter, the amendment does not oblige or force a pregnant woman to view any ultrasound image or to receive any other information relating to the imaging and monitoring performed.  The amendment in no way restricts women's access, as we have pointed out on a number of occasions.  I feel it is worthwhile repeating this point to ensure it is not misrepresented in the media.  That point has been made over and over tonight and hopefully it will be conveyed very clearly.  As we have stated, a woman is of course entitled to see the ultrasound and not supporting this amendment means not supporting a woman's entitlement.  We have heard so much about the right of a woman to information and all the rest of it and why not?  I cannot see why the Minister would go against such a reasonable amendment.  It is interesting that the only way to manufacture any controversy about this amendment was by false reporting, which I found very offensive as a woman.  It was mentioned that we were forcing women to view ultrasounds and I find that very offensive.</p></speech>

According to Dr. Boylan's testimony at the committee, figures vary.  In Scotland, for example, approximately 30% of women will require a scan for uncertain dates and it will probably be something similar here.  Why would we be any different from Scotland?  I think that is a good indication.  Dr. Boylan also spoke about the risks of introducing a termination of pregnancy service in this State without adequate scanning facilities and highlighted how at present there are infrastructural deficits in the provision of access to ultrasound in pregnancy in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, sin na pr&iacute;omhphoint&iacute;.</p></speech>

The people have made their decision.  As politicians, we all take passing interest to various degrees in opinion polls but the only one that matters is the ballot.  People made their decision in respect of this.</p>  <p>  This is not an amendment about choice, far from it.  This is an amendment about a bunch of politicians telling doctors what to do in terms of the diagnostic tools they use and, if they do not follow that mandate, offering them a prison sentence of up to a year.  To be clear, that is what Deputy Nolan's amendment does.  She is right that the woman has to have the ultrasound according to this amendment.  Deputy Nolan is not going to force her to look at the heartbeat or the screen but mandatorily, under her amendment, every single woman would have to have an ultrasound and every single doctor would have to carry one out.  This is about choice.  Of course there is a need for ultrasound in obstetrics; that is not really the question.  It is not for Deputy Nolan or me to tell our doctors when to use the ultrasound machine.  The idea that we must scan every woman to date her pregnancy is kind of bizarre.  Many thousands of women will have gone to their GP today in early pregnancy and with their doctor, based on their last menstrual period, LMP, will have worked out the stage of pregnancy they are at.</p>  <p>  I get frustrated, and we also had a bit of it last night, by this idea that until every other issue in the health service is sorted out and no one is waiting for any other procedure, we cannot invest any money whatsoever in crisis pregnancies and women's healthcare; that women's healthcare must come last.  Until every man has a new hip or every man has had his cataract done, we cannot invest in women's healthcare.  This is healthcare and just as the Deputies come in here and demand that I should do more in all the other things, they should be demanding we do more on this and it is worrying that they are not.  This amendment would force doctors, based on no medical reason but the views of politicians, to scan every women mandatorily, to face a prison sentence if they do not do it and to subject every woman to an ultrasound.  It would be a terrible use of what people rightly point out is a scarce resource in the health service. </p>  <p>  I can categorically state that Dr. Boylan would not be supporting this amendment as somebody offering me clinical advice on the implementation of this service.  I am sure he would not like to be quoted in any way suggesting he is supportive of it.  Dr. Boylan is absolutely to highlight, as many doctors have, that we absolutely do need to provide ultrasound for cases when our doctors believe we need to use them, not for when politicians do.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We make no apology for wanting to help people with cataracts or for the lads bussing them up to Belfast and getting them done under the European directive.  The Minister should be ashamed.  Meanwhile our medics are going out to Third World countries and doing this operation in field tents for people who are going blind out there.  They are doing it voluntarily all over the world.

It should be made available for doctors and offered to women to see the ultrasound.  In many abortion clinics it is used but women are often discouraged from looking at the screen or hearing their baby's heartbeat.</p><p>Sadly this is not to protect the women because they know if a woman sees or hears the baby's heartbeat, she often changes her mind, as within the abortion industry more abortions are good.  I recently attended a meeting in Bandon where this was discussed.  A lady had travelled 95 miles to the clinic and after seeing the ultrasound she changed her mind because that clinic provides the opportunity to hear the ultrasound which is great.  If compassion for the woman was at the heart of the vote in May, why would we not ensure women are offered information about their babies, information that has been shown to impact abortion decisions?</p> <p> The Minister mentioned putting women first.  He is dead right; we should put women first.  I ask him to come to west Cork or parts of Kerry tomorrow morning where they will be getting up at 5 a.m. to go for cataract operations because of the efforts of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and me.  If it were not for that, they would be going blind.  Those women were not put first by the Minister.  He has had ample time to resolve that mess.  They are going to have their hips attended to because they are in agony and cannot get a hip operation here.  The Minister talks about putting women first; I ask him to look at other areas where women could be put first and have been put last.  They were going blind and have got their sight back thanks to the people in Northern Ireland under the cross-Border health directive.  The Minister should not tell us that we would not put women first.  We certainly have, but he has failed to do so in the past few years and he will have failed to do so if he refuses to accept this amendment. </p></speech>

When the girl or woman goes to her GP and he does not have ultrasound equipment but her medical card only covers her for him, what will happen then?  We need an honest answer to that.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Michael Collins said, it is regrettable that the Minister is portraying us as if we have no care for pregnant women or women who just choose not to have their baby.  That is not true.  We have, as we have stated, high regard for life.  Where the Minister in his role has let them down, we are doing our best to get people looked after in the North.  A woman will need to leave Dingle tomorrow morning and travel all the way up to Belfast just to save her eye.  We are doing our best to ensure her eyesight is saved.  It is wrong for the Minister to say we have no care for women.</p>  <p>  We have care for men too because they are facing the same dilemma.  They are not being looked after and they are losing their sight as well, as we have told the Minister in this House several times over the past two years.  The Minister still has not made a difference or changed anything.  He is just not listening.  Maybe he will look after the people in urban areas, on the east coast or inside the Pale, but he is not looking after them where we come from.  We regret that he made that comparison.  I am very disappointed.</p></speech>

I will try to clarify it within the four parameters the legislation proposes.  Under the first parameter it is proposed that termination can occur if there is a risk to the life or health of the mother.  In that instance, that baby is a much-wanted baby.  Circumstances have overcome that pregnancy such that the life or health of that woman is at risk.  That woman will have had several ultrasounds because her pregnancy will be monitored.  There will be no necessity for her to have a compulsory ultrasound.  She will have ultrasound carried out during normal obstetric practice.  In the issue of the risk to the life or health of the mother, there will be ultrasounds to monitor that pregnancy.  It will be a much-wanted pregnancy and it will be devastating for that mother if that pregnancy has to be terminated to preserve her life or preserve her health.</p><p>In the case of risk to life in an emergency, there may or may not be an ultrasound, or there may or may not be time for an ultrasound.  It is not relevant in that situation.</p><p>When we come to the condition likely to lead to the death of a foetus or fatal foetal abnormality, again there will have been many ultrasounds in that circumstance.  There will be high-definition ultrasounds to identify accurately the fatal foetal abnormality.  Again it is not an issue regarding this amendment.</p><p>The fourth issue relates to early pregnancy.  Ultrasound may or may not be clinically indicated in such a pregnancy.  It may be necessary to have an ultrasound to date that pregnancy, but that will be a clinical decision.  This amendment contains the word &quot;shall&quot; which means it must take place at least 24 hours before termination of pregnancy.  I accept that people seeking a termination before 12 weeks gestation may from a clinical point of view need an ultrasound to date their pregnancy or possibly to identify an ectopic pregnancy.  Those are very reasonable reasons to seek an ultrasound.  However, enshrining that in legislation is not the way to go about it.  That will be a clinical decision.</p><p>I am reading one part of the amendment which may make the amendment invalid.  The proposed new section 23(9)(i) states: </p><blockquote>(i) in the case of a termination of pregnancy to be carried out in accordance with section 10 or 12, the obstetrician by whom the termination of pregnancy is to be carried out, and</blockquote><p>Those are the wrong sections because a new section was inserted on Committee Stage.  Therefore that should read section 11 or 14, I think.  In the proposed new section 23(9)(ii) I believe section 13 should be section 14.  Therefore there are technical issues with the amendment anyway.</p><p>Ultrasound is a complex issue, but for many of the circumstances in which women will seek a termination, ultrasounds will already have been carried out.  It is only in early pregnancy that there may be a need for an ultrasound to date the pregnancy or to rule out an ectopic pregnancy.</p></speech>

Wade in the United States.  We discussed this in Committee.  In discussing this amendment we need to consider to whom we are doing it.  This is placing a necessity on a woman to have an ultrasound in the most difficult of circumstances.  The amendment in its essence is designed to inflict pain and to attempt to impose some sort of guilt.  Deputy Harty outlined the scenarios, showing it is unnecessary.  This is a direct derivative of the carry-on in the United States that attempts to reverse Roe <i>v</i>. Wade.  People should be aware of where some of these notions come from.</p></speech>

This and many of the other amendments are designed to shame women and to make them feel bad about something that could be extremely traumatic such as a case of fatal foetal abnormality or other severe abnormality.</p><p>The Deputies want somebody to be forced to have an ultrasound and, as proposed in some of the other amendments, to watch a DVD or be shown images on a website.  A relative of mine recently had a fatal foetal abnormality with twins and when she read these amendments, she contacted me.  She was horrified and asked if those people had any idea about this entire situation.  I had not intended to speak but that should be put on the D&aacute;il record.

Two thirds of the population voted "Yes" and one third voted "No", therefore, we have to speak on behalf of more than 725,000.  We have to go back to our constituencies, as do the Deputies opposite.</p>  <p>  The Minister said a few minutes ago that he would like to start spending money.  He can start by buying ultrasound machines.</p>  <p>  He spoke about the amendment.  The amendment requires a doctor, nurse or midwife to perform an ultrasound and to detect a foetal heartbeat when present.  It also ensures that a woman who wishes to view the ultrasound and hear the heartbeat can do so.  The amendment also includes a requirement to certify that those steps have been taken as well as specifying that certain minimum standards for the monitoring are carried out.  That is to ensure clinical best practice as part of a routine monitoring procedure that ought to be carried out as a matter of course.  The amendment makes it clear that it is up to the woman concerned whether she wishes to view the ultrasound image and hear the heartbeat.  It is up to the woman to decide what she wants to do.</p></speech>

We have more of it here, a Cheann Comhairle.  Where is the democracy?  I appeal to the Ceann Comhairle.  An offer will be made to the woman to view the ultrasound image and to listen to the heartbeat.  If that is impossible for some people, we do not want to be cruel about that.  I was present when my wife gave birth to all my babies and it was wonderful to hear the heartbeat and see the movements.  It was the most delightful occasion I could ever experience.  To be told here by Deputies O'Connell and Coppinger that we have notions or that we are raving.  Thankfully, we are not all backward, as they like to portray us.

I will not go into any personal details but that implies compulsion.  If that does not happen, the amendment further states: "...the relevant medical practitioner shall obtain the signature of the pregnant woman on the certification referred to in subsection (5) verifying that it is factually correct".  Do the Deputies believe that is the appropriate time to ask an expectant mother who might going through a crisis pregnancy to do that?  Furthermore, if the practitioner does not do it, the amendment states that a person who is guilty of a criminal offence is liable to 12 months in prison or "on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 4 years, or both,".  That is for not carrying out an ultrasound.  The practitioner then may ask the woman if she wants to see the image.  Are they being serious?  There is compulsion implied in that amendment and we should be straight and honest with people about that.</p></speech>

It states: "...the relevant practitioner relevant medical practitioner or a qualified person assisting the relevant .... shall perform [an] ultrasound".</p><p>For the benefit of those who signed their names to the amendment, there is no version of ultrasound that does not involve the woman being present.  A pregnant woman cannot have an ultrasound in another room and, therefore, it is clear that she will be present and she will hear and see.  In case she does not, she must sign at the end anyway.</p> <p> I struggle with this because I am not sure what the point is.  Any pregnant woman can ask for an ultrasound.  Nobody in the Chamber has asked more questions about the provision of scanning facilities than me, which the Minister will know.</p></speech>

There is an element of shaming or judgment in it, and there is no version of this that does not involve causing distress for a pregnant woman.  Any pregnant woman can ask for an ultrasound if she feels she needs one or if she needs help making her decision and has not fully made up her mind.  It is the job of the Minister to ensure the facilities are there, and we will do all we can do make that happen.  To suggest, however, that somehow there must be an ultrasound is unfair and judgmental, and no good can come from it.</p>  <p>  There is no choice in the amendment because it states "the medical practitioner shall perform the ultrasound imaging of the foetus".  We must be clear about that.</p></speech>

This country has a dark and shameful history in its control of women, their health and their reproductive rights.  It all comes down to controlling women, their bodies and their reproductive health.  It has gone on for a long time and we are still finding out some dark things about our past.</p>  <p>  Whether or not it is the intention of those tabling it, the amendment feels like the foregoing.  The amendment provides that a woman who presents at her general practitioner, or as Deputy Harty - a doctor - said, a woman who gets in trouble and whose life or health is at serious risk, will be forced to travel to a hospital, undergo multiple diagnoses and, when she says that she does not want to see an ultrasound, she will be forced to sign a form confirming that she has refused to see these forced diagnoses.  If the doctor does not do all of that, he or she will go to jail, which is what the amendment states.  It is deeply regrettable that we must have a debate about treating women and trying to control them in this way during the debate about this legislation or any debate about legislation.</p></speech>

I cannot make an argument, nor can I see how anyone could, that a medical practitioner who contravenes the amendment shall be guilty of an offence.  The amendment is poorly thought out and I ask those who moved it to withdraw it because it significantly weakens other arguments which they and I may have.  It makes no sense to me.</p></speech>

Professor Boylan gave testimony to the Committee on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution to the effect that he felt it would be necessary for an ultrasound to be available to women in the provision of abortion services.  He also stated that it would be logical for an ultrasound to be a device used in the provision of the service.  An ultrasound is a medical device used to help people; it is not threatening in any way.  Many doctors have stated that, in cases of ectopic pregnancy or other situations where women may present at the surgery and may be provided with an abortion pill and so on, it is important for those doctors to have the diagnostic tools to ensure their care for the woman in those scenarios is care they can confidently stand over.  We had this conversation in the committee, which was a more reasonable debate on this.  There was not any suggestion that this would in some way be a threat to an individual-----</p></speech>

The amendment is faux concern for women and what it suggests is frightening, namely, mandating ultrasound.  There is no choice for women.  It is not about protecting women but rather judging, embarrassing and making them feel bad in the hope that if they are shamed, they might continue with the pregnancy because it suits the Deputies and their agenda.</p>  <p>  The amendment goes on to mandate prison sentences for doctors who do not comply with it.  It states "Before or during imaging" the woman will be asked whether she wants to look at the ultrasound.  In practice, is the doctor supposed to rock up, scan her stomach and ask if she would like to take a look at it?  It is utterly ridiculous.  If the screen is there, it is hard to avert one's eyes.  There is nothing in the amendment that speaks to consent, permission, bodily autonomy or the woman and what is best or right for her.</p>  <p>  Ultrasound is diagnostic tool and it is for the doctors to decide.  Many Deputies seem to believe they have acquired the expertise of medical professionals but they have not.  We have all discussed the issue for some time, but I am not a doctor and nor are most of the Deputies, although there are some.  The suggestion that the Deputies know what is best about how a diagnostic tool should and can be used is utterly ridiculous.  The concern for women is misplaced at best.</p></speech>

Workers, rightly, are very worried and fearful that the announcement has been made just weeks before Christmas.  In the past An Post often expressed an interest in closing one of the centres, but this time it has shown its hand early.  The information I have received in recent days backs this up.  Rumours are rife in Cork but also in the other mail centres in Dublin, Portlaoise and Athlone.  The rumour is that Cork mail centre is to be targeted for closure or that there is to be a drastic downsizing of operations in the south.  I seek confirmation as to whether that is true.  I have been told that new equipment has been placed in two or three centres.  Will the Minister also confirm if that is true?  Nothing new has been placed in Cork mail centre, except the possibility of bad news.    </p>  <p>  Recently I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minster about the status of plans for Cork mail centre and its continued use in letter processing and other relevant roles, including investment in new equipment and staffing plans, in view of its importance to the region.  To my surprise, the reply was not encouraging.  I was told that the Ceann Comhairle had to disallow the question because the Minister had no official responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the matter which was an operational one for An Post.  My view is that communications are at the heart of this issue and that the possibility of losing 200 jobs just after Christmas in Cork unquestionably matters.  The staff are very hard working.  Surely their loyalty to An Post matters.  In recent months we have seen the closure of many rural post offices, pubs and Garda stations which has left rural communities feeling very isolated.  On many occasions I have raised in this House the issue of rural depopulation.  Now there is the possibility of urban depopulation as the next phase.  Surely we cannot allow that to happen.  </p>  <p>  Only recently in this Chamber the Minister spoke about the need for An Post to be commercially viable.  I accept that, but surely after it has turned the corner and given that it is now profitable, we are trying to fix something that is no longer broken.  The fear is that a decision will be made to close this regional mail centre which will leave a very bitter taste in the mouths of loyal employees and their families for a long time.  They are taxpayers and also voters in every constituency in County Cork.  They have worked in tandem with An Post, with very modest wage increases in the last decade.  It must remember that it has benefited greatly from its employees' good will.  They now face the possibility of the closure of the only regional mail centre in Cork.  Christmas is a short few weeks away.  Will the Minister, please, not let this centre close?  On behalf of the staff of Cork mail centre at Little Island, I appeal to him to support the retention of the services provided.</p></speech>

He also knows that An Post has been through an extremely difficult period in the last couple of years.  It suffered a 40% loss in mail volumes which brought it to a really precarious point last year when the outlook was very bleak for the 9,000 employed in it.  The company has had to take some difficult decisions, including to increase significantly the cost of postage and restructure with voluntary redundancies.  It has also been working to expand, find new business and pursue exciting new opportunities.</p>  <p>  Some time ago, when An Post was in discussions in the Labour Court with the unions, it confirmed that, as part of its restructuring, one of its mail centres would close in 2019.  However, it has been confirmed in the House previously that no decision has been made on which centre will close.  Consideration of this issue is still ongoing.  It will be a decision for the board and management of the company.  It is a commercial company with a mandate to deliver postal delivery services and a viable post office and mail centre network.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, when the Labour Court issued a recommendation for a 2% pay increase in An Post from 1 July that year, payment was conditional on necessary cost savings being achieved.  One of the requirements was conclusion of discussions on An Post's proposal that the size of its mail processing network be reduced.  The recommendation provides that 50% of the savings arising from the closure of a mail processing centre will contribute to the cost of the pay award.  </p>  <p>  A lot of time and effort have been spent in the last two years in working on restructuring An Post which has found itself in a very serious financial position.  This work was critical in order to save it and protect thousands of jobs and the post office network across the country.  Postal services have been expanded from five days to six for parcel deliveries and collections in several areas.  There is no doubt that continued transformation of the postal business will be difficult and require tough decisions to be made, but the new changes will be designed to make An Post fit for a future in which the organisation can be confident, robust and grow again. </p>  <p>  I understand what the Deputy is saying about there being great concern when it has been flagged that one of the mail centres is to be closed.  However, An Post has a strong reputation for working closely with the unions and worker representatives and handling such decisions in as sensitive a manner as is possible and sought to do so in its dealings.  When the company introduced a voluntary redundancy scheme last year, the terms were generous and fair.  Ultimately, we have to see An Post develop a trajectory for its business that will be sustainable in the long term.</p><p>That is why it is expanding into financial services with the recent decision in regard to Avantcard and it is developing mortgage packages and facilitating one-stop-shop locations for non-digital transactions.  It is trying to develop its services.</p></speech>

As I said, however, there are rumours in Cork.  There are three centres at Athlone, Portlaoise and Dublin, and one will possibly be taken out of Cork - that is the possibility for Ireland south.  Cork is a huge county.  It beggars belief, if we are to have a sustainable model that covers the four parts of the country, that we would not have a centre in each part of the country.</p>  <p>  Another worrying thing I have been told by staff in the other centres, and I have no problem saying this, is that those other centres have been actively lobbying their politicians for a number of months, whereas Cork only received the news last week.  My fear is that the unions would have known about this months ago.  Why cannot all their members get a fair crack at lobbying and standing up for what they believe is right, fair and just?  One of the quotes from the CWU was that it would write to representatives in Cork not to engage with politicians at the present time, which is worrying.</p>  <p>  This is 200 jobs in County Cork.  It is a very big county and we actually have our own passport, whether the Minister knows it or not.  I am disappointed.  Maybe it is not the Minister's fault but I am trying to get answers for employees and families just before Christmas.  Nobody is giving me an answer as to what is going to happen with regard to 200 jobs in this centre, plus the knock-on jobs.  The Minister is saying he does not know what is happening.  I would appreciate if we could get a concrete answer and some assurance for the staff before Christmas.</p></speech>

This is not something that has been sprung.</p>  <p>  I am assured that An Post will not take this decision on political grounds.  This will be a decision taken in the best interests of An Post.  It is trying to rebuild for the future against a backdrop where the volume of standard mail has dropped by 40%, and even this year it dropped by 8%.  It has a real problem with the mail service.  It is supplementing that by developing its parcel package service, which has grown by 20%, so it has been successful.  It has negotiated a reorganisation of that service with its trade unions so it could grow in the way it is growing.</p>  <p>  At the end of the day, An Post and its unions have to work together to build a restructuring plan that carves out the sort of future we all want for the company.  That is what is happening.  All I can assure the Deputy of is that this decision will not be taken by me or other politicians.  It will be taken in the interests of the company and its workers by An Post, and it will go to the board in due course.  The date for a decision is 2019, not 2018.  That is all the assurance I can give the Deputy.  I can understand his concern and that of his constituents but we have to allow the company and its workers to deal with this in the traditional way.</p></speech>

Louth County Council currently has 91 vacant council houses that cannot be brought back into use due to the lack of maintenance funding.  I call on the Minister to provide additional funding to ensure that existing houses in need of refurbishment can be brought back on stream as this can happen in a much faster time than providing new builds.</p>  <p>  Under measures announced in budget 2019, the Government is allocating Exchequer funding of almost &euro;2.3 billion to housing programmes.  In addition, local authorities will fund a range of housing services to the value of almost &euro;93 million from surplus local property tax receipts, bringing the total housing budget in 2019 to &euro;2.4 billion.  None of this matters if the hands of the local authorities, such as Louth County Council, are tied in regard to refurbishing existing stock to bring it back into use.  I ask that a portion of the funding announced in the budget be ring-fenced by the Department for local authorities for refurbishment works.</p>  <p>  My local authority, Louth County Council, has been lauded in this House in many debates for its achievements in acquiring vacant houses under compulsory purchase orders, having purchased approximately 180 houses.  It has been very successful in the use of those powers under the Housing Act to acquire non-derelict homes that are vacant as part of the local authorities' obligation to provide housing.  However, it is regrettable that this success cannot follow through to refurbishment of council-owned voids and result in the provision of extra housing to service the ever-growing housing list due to lack of funding.</p>  <p>  The housing department of Louth County Council has assured me it has a great working relationship with the Minister of State and his Department and it is working to the best of its ability to find solutions to the housing problem.  Louth County Council, like every local authority, is grappling with significant outgoings from the housing department in terms of housing maintenance costs, which are not covered by grants, and the servicing of land loans, which in Louth total &euro;65.3 million, with a cost of over &euro;1 million annually to service the interest.</p>  <p>  In regard to the scheme for refurbishment of voids that have been vacant for a longer period and need significant works, the amount of funding grant-aided runs to just &euro;30,000, which is not enough.  In Louth, additional works have been carried out on 15 properties this year, with an average cost of &euro;15,000 per unit.  This additional funding comes out of the housing maintenance budget.  When we talk of casual vacancies, there can be a cost of between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 to bring these houses back to a standard as they often have not been maintained for a number of decades, other than reactive maintenance.  These costs are also incurred to facilitate transfers and may not even result in additional families being housed from the waiting list.  Other costs that are eating into the budget for refurbishment of newly acquired vacant units relate to funding the use of direct labour on properties that the council has purchased to bring the home up to an appropriate standard.  This includes upgrading electrical and plumbing systems, installing smoke alarms and so on, which is different to works on a casual basis.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to make additional funds available to the local authorities from the budget measures announced to speed up the refurbishment of these vacant units.  It is a disgrace 91 houses are sitting empty when people could be occupying them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.813" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900064#PPP01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I agree with him that there is no excuse for 90 houses to be lying idle.  If that is the case, I urge Louth County Council to discuss funding options with us.</p>  <p>  To be clear, we have a voids programme which provides funding to refurbish housing.  I understand that, this year, Louth County Council applied for 16 and was granted 15, and a claim was recently put in to draw down &euro;166,000, which was paid out.  We wrote to every local authority in October this year to ask them again if they had any vacant properties or voids, to bring them forward, and we told them that if these could be completed and tenanted before 14 December, we would be in a position to fund them.  I am not aware of any additional application by Louth County Council for 90 units or anything close to that.</p>  <p>  If 90 units are lying vacant that the council believes it cannot fund, we have a voids programme that has funded nearly 10,000 voids in recent years.  Like many other councils, Louth County Council has brought forward many voids and I congratulate it on that.  There is a great pipeline of projects and great work is being done in that regard.  If Louth County Council has 90 properties, as the Deputy said, the voids programme is there to be used.  We wrote to all the councils in October to tell them to use it and to draw down funding.  Other counties have come forward with an additional 30, 40 or 50 units and we have provided the funding for that.  There might be some confusion in this regard but there are funding options.</p><p> We do not have a timeframe for voids.  There is some confusion.  I have followed some of the debate about long-term and short-term in Louth.  We do not specify a term because, if we did, people might be encouraged to leave houses vacant for a long time.  We provide the funding to fix them.  We are open to discussing that.  We have a very good relationship with the Louth County Council.  I have met representatives of it on numerous occasions.  In this case some clarity may be required but the funding is there.  I am not aware that there are 92 vacant council properties.  I reckon from our research that maybe there are 40 and, if that is the case, we certainly would like to bring them back into use and fund them.</p> <p> We are aware that there are other vacant properties that Louth County Council has purchased and we have used them as best example because it has done great work under the purchase and renew scheme, which is fully funded by our Department.  There will be no issue of costs left if a council has purchased vacant properties, Louth being one of the leaders in this, and we cover the costs to purchase and repair them and bring them back into use.  Louth has looked for 32 which were approved successfully and work is being carried out.  It applied this week or last week for a further 36 under that scheme.  I have no doubt that we will process them very quickly because it has done great work.</p> <p> It is not the case that the council is left carrying the bill.  The Department funds that scheme under purchase and renew and I am very clear about that because it is a scheme we want to encourage more local authorities to do.  Louth has been the leading one in this and has done great work.  We certainly would not leave it hanging for money, as it were, because we want vacancy tackled and the Deputy's local authority has been one of the best at doing that.  It has been used at many of our housing summits as the best example of the purchase and renew scheme.  We would encourage more of that.  If there are several voids lying idle, we would ask it to bring them forward.</p> <p> In general, maintenance historically has been carried out by Louth County Council, as by every other local authority.  We fund the voids programme of houses that are left empty and need work done on them.  We encourage local authorities to do their own maintenance.  I understand the council is in the middle of budget discussions.  I believe councillors should vote to have some money set aside for general routine maintenance but we do fund putting vacant properties back into use.  The taxpayer, through our Department, has funded more than 10,000 this year.  We had money and we wrote to everybody to do that this year.  There is still time if they have vacant properties that they want to bring back into use.  We have not started the month of December.  They can give us a shout and we will see if we can sort this out.</p></speech>

I welcome that.  I tabled this Topical Issue matter early last week.  There may have been an application that the Minister of State referred to and I take his word that it has come in, but that still leaves approximately half the number I referred to.  I think the Minister of State indicated 46 houses, which subtracted from 91 leaves approximately 45 more houses, if my maths are correct.  I stand over that.</p>  <p>  I will be speaking to the department of housing in Louth County Council on Monday morning to make sure a further application is submitted to the Department on which I hope the Minister of State will look favourably.  Louth County Council has also been advocating for the design of social housing schemes to be in line with a universal design for the past year and I have been told that the Minister of State has committed to changing the policy to do this, but the Department is indicating that it is unlikely to fund that element of works, for example, on a new housing scheme in Mount Avenue where special moneys were allocated.  It is a no-brainer that standards should improve in new builds.  Can this be considered again in view of the funding announced in the budget?</p>  <p>  Louth County Council is also seeking the introduction of an asset management strategy for the local authority housing sections that we have funded centrally.  I may be stretching this a bit but, as a result of Garda activity and the bulldozing of some of the sites that were causing problems in Drogheda, Cement Road had considerable works.  Will the Department provide funding in the order of &euro;50,000 to sort out that problem, which I am sure the Minister of State is aware of, arising from anti-social behaviour?</p></speech>

Then we can process the application.</p>  <p>  In general we encourage a top-class quality and high design in all our local authority housing and there is a massive spend on retrofitting, but any new housing is high specification and most of the houses that I have seen being opened are at A2+, which is a high specification and certainly above what most people are providing.  We are clear on this.  While there is an urgency in respect of social housing, we are not reneging on quality or design.  If there is some issue there, I would be happy to have that examined too.</p>  <p>  I am not sure what Louth's proposal is for asset management.  I have sat with the council but have not heard that mentioned.  I am happy to consider it.  We want to encourage the management of our assets, which is our housing stock, to a high order and for rents to be used to refurbish them in general in short-term re-lets.  They would not need to enter the voids programme.  That is something we would do well to encourage.  The Deputy mentioned Louth having a landbank on which it is paying interest.  I am aware of this.  We have said in this House and in the council's office that the best way to reduce the cost of that land is to use it and to put forward a pipeline of projects.  If it owns quite a lot of land, it could build more than a few thousand houses which would not all be needed for social housing.  The landbank should be used for affordable and social housing and for some private element.  That is the best way to return the money.  We are very happy to work with it on proposals to use that land, bring down its debt, and provide much-needed social, affordable and private housing for Louth.  I have mentioned that to the council in our meetings and will do so again.</p>  <p>  In the voids programme and the money we provide for vacant properties, Louth applied for 16, we granted 15, and it has drawn down money for 13, of 166,000.  It has also looked for 36 properties under purchase and renew, which were approved and dealt with, and this week it came back for 32 more.  There are no outstanding applications for voids of which I am aware.  The Deputy mentioned 92 and 40 but they are not on our desk.</p></speech>

He was here five minutes ago and he has just walked away, even though this Topical Issue Matter was down.</p>  <p>  I demand that the Minister for Health provide immediate clarification regarding the future of St. Brigid's Hospital, Carrick-on-Suir.  It is a wonderful institution and I salute the matron and staff there.  It has a wonderful hospice suite.  Only a few weeks ago a Fine Gael colleague of the Minister of State, former councillor John Fahey, spent his final weeks there.  He was a decent fine public representative all his life.  I offer sympathies to his wife and family.  I have been trying to get clarification on rumours about this institution since I was contacted last Sunday.  There is a new hospice suite and step-down beds.  We know how hard it is to get a step-down place anywhere today in the country and the chronic problem that is making for our acute hospitals in south Tipperary, Westmeath and the region of Limerick.  St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital is like its sister hospital, St. Theresa's Hospital in Clogheen, which is a fabulous institution with a wonderful matron, Anne Walsh.  The hospital in Cashel is a step-down facility as well.  It is a tremendous institution.</p>  <p>  We are beyond cuts.  We cannot afford to lose one more bed.  We have lost mental health beds and all kinds of beds, and the pressure that is putting on the acute service is silly.  There is &euro;17 billion annually going to into the HSE, with worse outcomes for respite and step-downs and convalescents.  People go back there after having a hip done, if we have to send them up to Belfast or Ardkeen or Kilkenny, Cill Chainnigh.  Serious concerns have been raised that the HSE may be considering closing the vitally important facility in Carrick-on Suir.  Will the Minister of State clarify that for the sake of the staff, the patients, the matron and the community?  Councillor Kieran Bourke and many others down there are asking that this facility be kept.  Many people have contacted me.</p><p>I also ask the Minister to explain why the redevelopment of St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel is not now expected to be complete until 2022.  It is a wonderful institution and I pay tribute to its former manager, Mary Prendergast, and sympathise on her recent bereavement and the untimely loss of her husband.  I pay tribute also the staff.</p> <p> In June 2018, nurses at the hospital voted overwhelming for some form of industrial action to highlight the chronic staff shortage.  The ballot for action was approved by 98% of them, citing growing fears for patient safety as their key concern.  The nurses, care assistants and doctor we have thankfully found for the positions there do a tremendous job.  However, they are not being supported.  They are short-staffed and under pressure.  Wards are being closed and cutbacks imposed.  A massive redevelopment was announced there by the Minister, Deputy Harris, and by Deputy Kelly when he was in office.  Indeed, Deputy Lowry has also made announcements.  However nothing has happened.  Planning permission has not even been applied for.  There is no joined-up thinking.  Beds are being closed yet they are vital to keep pressure off acute hospitals to allow people to convalesce or get physiotherapy.</p> <p> St. Patrick's is an excellent institution in Cashel.  There is a rehabilitation ward.  My late mother was there and I know first-hand how many more patients there are.  We need clarity and to have the building commence.  Planning permission is not even applied for.  We are going around in schemes and rhymes.  Across the road, 400 yards away, Our Lady's Hospital is lying idle.  That is why I was so adamant about the Minister being present tonight.  I took him to the hospital to see it with other colleagues a year and a half ago and he was aghast to see that &euro;21.5 million had been spent on that wonderful institution in which my appendix was removed years ago but it was lying idle but for offices.  The top floor is splendidly redecorated and redeveloped but there are no step-down beds.  It is a bed-free zone and a disgrace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-29a.822" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112900066#RRR00200"><p>I am taking this matter on behalf of my ministerial colleague, Deputy Jim Daly.  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what older people want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route.  The standard of care delivered to residents in public units is generally high, but we recognise that many of our community hospitals are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  Without them, though, many older people would not have access to the care that they need.  It is important, therefore, that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the five-year capital investment programme for community nursing units announced in 2016.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health information and Quality Authority, HIQA.</p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel and St. Brigid's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary.  St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, and its associated facility at St. Anthony's unit in Clonmel, have an excellent reputation as care facilities.  The hospital provides residential, rehabilitation and respite care to older adults in the south Tipperary area.  The hospital is registered with the HIQA and the maximum number of persons that can be accommodated at the designated centre is 102 residents.  Under the five-year investment programme, it is proposed to deliver a new community nursing unit at St. Patrick's to replace existing beds where the physical environment requires significant improvement.  The challenges associated with the redevelopment of St Patrick's must be viewed in the context of the presence of a listed building on the site and its status as a working hospital.  These challenges will be managed by the HSE as with other developments where such challenges present and the HSE now propose to progress this project via the traditional capital process and not through a PPP as originally planned.  The project is currently at appraisal stage and is proceeding according to capital planning guidelines with construction projected to begin in 2020.</p>  <p>  St. Brigid's Hospital provides convalescent, respite and palliative care and is registered with HIQA to accommodate 16 residents.  In the latest inspection report published by the authority, the inspector found that residents healthcare and nursing needs were met to a good standard.  The feedback received from residents was generally positive and indicated that they were satisfied with the staff and care provided.  The Deputy will be aware that the hospital is not included in the five-year plan for refurbishment and upgrading.  However, I confirm that the HSE has advised the Department today that there are no plans to close St Brigid's.</p></speech>

However, I wrote to them and they did not reply in writing.  That is why there are worries.  I want to allay fears; not create them.  I thank the people who contacted me.  They have the interests of the people of Carrick-on-Suir and the surrounding area in County Waterford and into County Kilkenny at heart.  I thank them for contacting me and I praise the staff.  Thankfully, the HIQA report was good.  It is a wonderful institution but it is flat on the ground.  I did not mention St. Anthony's, which is linked to St. Patrick&rsquo;s.  It is also a wonderful institution that deals with dementia care, people with Alzheimer's and acute cases.  Cashel is not moving fast enough, however.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to the 2016 capital plan but it is almost 2019 and no planning has been applied for.  She said works will start in 2020 or next year.  We want to see that work start.  It is not fair to the nursing staff, care staff and the doctor who are all dedicated.  Dr. Willie Ryan has retired and we have a new doctor whom I wish well.  We were lucky to get him and there were worries about that as well.  There should not be scares on this.  We should have the plan and proceed with it.</p>  <p>  For that matter, St. Theresa's Hospital, Clogheen is short approximately &euro;70,000 from the Department for its extension.  I appeal to the Minister of State to allow the hospital to finish that extension.  We need step-down facilities to take pressure off St. Joseph's in Clonmel, South Tipperary General Hospital, Waterford and all the other acute regional hospitals.  We need the step-down facilities and not to have fears around them.  I am, therefore, thankful that the Minister of State has said on the record that the HSE has informed her that it will not close St. Brigid's Hospital but I am disappointed it is not included in the five-year capital programme while the hospice suite is relatively new.  A lot of funding was provided locally for that.  St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, St. Brigid's Hospital, Carrick-on-Suir and St. Theresa's Hospital, Clogheen, are badly needed and I pay tribute to the staff in them.  They do tremendous work.  However, people are crying out when they get their hips done.  The Government calls them bed blockers but they have no place to go for physiotherapy or respite care before or after operations.  We need certainty around these facilities.  There is no point talking about &euro;17 billion in the HSE when there are issues like this.  Above all is the madness of keeping Our Lady's in Cashel closed when other hospitals are under pressure.  It is a state-of-the-art facility in which &euro;21.5 million has been invested.  It is a concern.</p></speech>

Many people have taken up the role of carer in hospitals and become a central part of units, in particular units for older people.  Public nursing units are central to our infrastructure.  Without them, many older people would not have access to the care they need.  These units will continue to be very necessary over the coming years.  As the Minister has said, the number of older people is increasing in line with demographic trends.  However, we must strive constantly to modernise and improve infrastructure and the settings in which these beds are being delivered by Government.  It is, therefore, essential that these beds be put on a sustainable footing and that the fabric of the buildings in which they operate be modernised and improved.  Having said that, it is expected that 4,500 additional short and long-term beds will be required across the public system and in community nursing units and other step-down faculties, as the Deputy said, and as identified by the health capacity review.  Health capacity programmes under way include the planned investment in community nursing homes which will continue.  I have been assured by Deputy Jim Daly that as Minister of State with responsibility for older people he is conscious of the work being done in many hospitals nationally.  He realises the buildings may have become outdated but the staff have not.  I thank Deputy McGrath.</p></speech>

I was contacted by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, this afternoon to say he could not be here due to a political engagement to which he committed some time ago.  He asked if I wanted to leave the matter until Tuesday and said he would come in and reply at that point.  However, I felt time was of the essence and decided to go ahead tonight.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister got back to me, however.</p>  <p>  Today is 29 November.</p><p>It is a significant day and that is why I wanted to address this issue in the D&aacute;il.  We have had an ongoing situation with the lack of secondary school places for young people in Newbridge.  This has been going on over the last four to five years.  There are many different Topical Issue matters that Deputies could raise but it is a shocking indictment on the education situation in Kildare that the last number of such matters that I have submitted have all been on education.  They have been on autism spectrum disorder, ASD, places, the delays in St. Paul's in Monasterevin and this issue of absolutely needing to have a second level school in the Newbridge-Kildare area.</p> <p> The reason 29 November is a significant date is that five months ago, the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, said that an announcement would be imminent on the possibility of the provision of a new secondary school in the Newbridge-Kildare area.  There was some talk, which was welcomed, about the possibility of amalgamating the education and training board, ETB, school on the Curragh site and a new second level school, more than likely from Educate Together given that we have two Educate Together primary schools, one in Kildare and one in Newbridge, which are very well subscribed.</p> <p> When I pressed the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, a few months later, he said that a decision would be made by the end of October.  At the end of October I visited the Department of Education and Skills unit in Tullamore, together with the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and I was told by the officials that because of the issues around the buildings it would be pushed out for a month but a decision would definitely be made before the end of November and possibly in mid-November.</p> <p> In fairness, I understood that there were issues with 42 schools around the country which placed a lot of demands on them, but here we are with one day left in the month of November and we are hanging on for a decision.  Parents have been contacting my office all this week because they have not got places for their children in the three schools in Newbridge for September next.  I have contacted the three schools and every one of them has a long waiting list for next September.  This is simply not good enough.</p> <p> As a country, we revere education and we put much investment into it and we say that we want all of our students to have an equal opportunity to learn, to develop themselves and to prepare themselves for life and for work.  How can we do so when we have a situation where children are being turned away from schools?  I am absolutely not blaming the schools.  We have excellent schools in Newbridge but they simply do not have the capacity.  When we look at the available figures, Kildare is one of the areas with the fastest population growth in the country and between 2011 and 2016, the number of children between the ages of 13 and 18 grew at a rate of 205% of the State's growth rate.  That certainly has to indicate the absolute need for a new second level school.</p></speech>

As the Deputy has already mentioned, the Minister, Deputy McHugh, could not be present and he apologises.  It is due to a prior commitment between an T&aacute;naiste and himself.  I will set out for the D&aacute;il the position with regard to post-primary provision in Newbridge and the surrounding areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Education and Skills is currently advancing building projects in a number of post-primary schools in the south Kildare school planning area, including Newbridge, and these projects, when completed, will provide additional capacity in the region of 1,700 school places.</p>  <p>  In Newbridge, the projects include St. Conleth's community college, Newbridge and the Patrician College, Newbridge.  In surrounding areas, the projects include: Athy community college, Athy; Cross and Passion secondary school, Kilcullen; and St. Paul's secondary school, Monasterevin.</p>  <p>  The Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.</p>  <p>  While the new schools announcement did not include a new post-primary school in Newbridge, a review of provision at post-primary school level across the school planning areas in south Kildare is well advanced and nearing completion.  The outcome of the review will be finalised and made available as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  This review will include an assessment of the extent to which projected needs in the area will be met from the additional capacity being provided by the projects already approved and how any specific additional needs will be best catered for, recognising the importance of maintaining a balance between existing and any additional school provision.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects, including those in Newbridge and surrounding areas, being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on the Department's website, and this information is updated regularly.</p>  <p>  In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  I do not have any further information to give the Deputy at this time but I will pass her concerns on to the Minister.</p></speech>

The ink on that paper is not worth anything and I would be tempted to tear it up, but I have too much respect for the Minister of State.  I will put it in as a Topical Issue matter for the Minister again next week.</p>  <p>  That answer is absolutely disgraceful.  It does not give any sense of the priority the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, put on this issue five months ago.  It does not mention anything about the commitment that was made for the end of October and for the end of November and here we are with 24 hours to go before the end of November.</p>  <p>  Telling a Deputy in this House to check the website is an absolute insult.  I check the website every day but surely I would expect that with a Topical Issue debate in this House, which God knows it is hard enough to get, there would at least be some sort of response.  How am I expected to respond to the concerns of those traumatised parents who have been contacting me this week about their children not having a place to go to school?  This issue will get worse and worse.  The only change over the past five months, between the time the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, committed to making an imminent decision and the present, is that the situation has become worse.</p>  <p>  What will we do in September when there are children with no school place because of the lack of foresight from the Minister and the Department?  This is an urgent issue.  I would not have put it down as a Topical Issue matter if it was not and I will continue to table it as such.  The Government is letting down the young people of the Newbridge area and their families.  The campaign that was started by South Kildare Educate Together more than five years ago to try to provide choice and diversity for our young people also has been let down.  Shame on the Department and shame on the Minister.</p></speech>

However, I will express the frustration, anger and concerns that she has raised to the Minister by telephone tomorrow.  I do not have any further information to add to what is in the reply.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy in many ways.  In times when parents are anxious about getting children into schools and looking for places, it can become very difficult when the proper, meaningful answers are not given to a parliamentary question or a Topical Issue debate.  I know that there is concern because I have spoken to somebody who I know who lives in the area and have listened to that person's concerns.  Throughout the country and the city, including in my constituency, there is a need for secondary schools to be built, particularly in towns and urban areas.</p>  <p>  I will relate the Deputy's concerns and frustration to the Minister by telephone and when she puts back in her Topical Issue matter, I will ask him if he might contact the Deputy.  I apologise.</p></speech>
