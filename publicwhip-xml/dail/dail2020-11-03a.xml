He wanted to talk to me about the terrible experience of his wife, Patricia, and his family.  I want to share it with the House.</p>  <p>  In 1994, almost 30 years ago, Patricia and Damien Carrick were married.  They started a life together in Galway, where over the following years they had four children.  They made a home for those children that was filled with music and filled with love.  They lived a quiet life focused on their family and their community.  Their first three children were getting on well with their lives and they were focused on making sure their youngest, Eoin, who has special needs, was comfortable.  They were happy and were looking forward to life.  Then on 29 July 2019, Trish took a call at work telling her it was likely she had cancer.  A formal diagnosis, radiation treatment and chemotherapy followed, but two months ago, in September 2020, Trish and Damien were told that the cancer was terminal.</p>  <p>  It did not have to be this way.  In May 2016, Trish went for her scheduled smear test, a health procedure that she always took very seriously and never missed.  If there had been an accurate reading of this sample, Trish's cancer would have been identified in good time.  The appropriate treatment would have been given and the chances are that she and Damien would now be reflecting on a worrying time in their lives with the illness well behind them.  However, there was not an accurate reading.  Instead, the HSE and MedLab Pathology have now acknowledged that the sample of 31 May 2016 was read in a manner that was negligent and in breach of duty.  The cancer was missed, it spread and it is now terminal.</p>  <p>  While Trish was not able to travel to court to hear it, the HSE and MedLab Pathology have apologised to the Carrick family for what they have been put through.  They have subsequently repeated that apology in writing.  The National Screening Service has also apologised.  Our President, Michael D. Higgins, has spoken to both the Carrick family and Trish's family, the O'Sullivans, in recent days.  The President knew both families personally in Galway and he offered his sympathy for what they have gone through.</p>  <p>  Last Friday I spoke to Damien by phone and apologised.</p> <p>On that call, he said that Trish and he and their family would appreciate it if I would apologise in public and on the record of this House.  I have absolutely no hesitation in doing so.</p> <p> Trish is going through a very challenging time in her illness at the moment.  Damien told me that he wanted to be with her today to listen in to the D&aacute;il.  I hope they have been able to manage to do so.  I hope they are together now, listening when I say that on behalf of the Government and the nation I offer my genuine and heartfelt apologies to Trish, Damien, their son Ciaran, their daughters Rioghna and Sorcha, and to Eoin.  They have been failed.</p> <p> Last month, Damien publicly shared his family's terrible experience.  Speaking to a journalist, he stated, "It's been awful, such a rotten hand we've been dealt."  That is the truth.  Trish was badly let down and their family is going through the very worst of times because of the mistakes of others.  In spite of this, Trish and Damien have carried themselves with great dignity.  Nothing that I say or anyone else says can change the situation they find themselves in, but I hope the genuine and heartfelt apology I offer today will bring them and their family some small measure of solace.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Members of the House for facilitating this statement.</p></speech>

I join the Taoiseach in extending words of solidarity, compassion and great sorrow to Patricia and Damien and their family.  I am conscious that an apology from the Head of Government and an apology from the laboratories, as well as the attention of &Uacute;chtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Michael D. Higgins, will bring some level of comfort to the family but, of course, it is no substitute or real comfort for the Carrick family as they face into the most unimaginable trauma.  I wish to say to them and to this House that we need to learn from this because apologies have to translate into concrete action.  Anything less than that fails Patricia, fails the women of Ireland and fails their families.  We wish Patricia and Damien solidarity.  We have heard their story.</p></speech>

It is very appropriate.  This is not the first time we have been here, but I acknowledge the fact that it absolutely needed to be done today.  I offer my solidarity and that of my party to Damien and Patricia for what has happened to them and their family.  They should never have gone through this.  All Deputies know that.  We must learn from these events, but I worry that we are not learning from them.  My good friend, Vicky Phelan, announced a couple of days ago that her cancer is back.  I have known about that for a considerable period of time.  We owe it to her, Stephen Teap from the Taoiseach's county, Lorraine Walsh, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and everyone else affected by this issue that we do our best for the women of Ireland.  Later today, I will raise with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the issue of the CervicalCheck tribunal.  It needs to be sorted out in the coming days.  It is through that action that we can honour the apologies that have been made in this House.  I send my solidarity to Trish and Damien and their children.</p></speech>

I am pleased that he has made it in this public forum and on the record.  It is so important that there is some meaning in these kinds of statements.  We cannot continue to see these failures.  We must put the systems in place to make sure they are eliminated to the extent that they can be eliminated.</p> <p>I send our good wishes to this family.</p></speech>

He informed me that the President, Paul Reid and the Taoiseach had called him to express their support to him.  The Taoiseach told him that he would read into the record of the D&aacute;il today an apology from him and the State, which meant a lot to him.  He said the eight-minute phone call he had with the Taoiseach was a very important phone call, and he asked me to say that to the Taoiseach.  I know this is a thing he would not want.  He would love to have Trish with him to be a mother to his children, but unfortunately that is not to be.  I know he is listening in today.  On behalf of Damien, I thank the Taoiseach for doing that today.</p></speech>

It is truly shocking to listen to Vicky Phelan, who spoke on the radio yesterday, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, Stephen Teap and others, but have we learned anything?  I do not believe we have.  Since the first lockdown in March, all procedures have been backed up, with people not attending, not being called or unable to get in.  Damage is being done with all kinds of cancer, including cervical, breast and prostate cancer.  Doctors and other people are telling us of the damage to physical and mental health, but the Government is not listening and has not learned anything.</p>  <p>  I do not think the HSE in its present format and the Department of Health are fit to learn.  They do not want to learn.  The HSE is a conglomerate that is out of control.  The Taoiseach set it up.  I hate to be negative on this issue, but I am partly negative.  I am pleading for us to have a testing regime that is fit for purpose, which we do not have.  I am pleading for the people to be seen.  Some have died since they have been diagnosed.  Doctors say this and they are sacked.  What is going on is a travesty and a total injustice to those who have life sentences and to the rest of our country.  The people are bigger eejits to listen to it and accept it.</p></speech>

While that is important, we need to ensure that no other apology has to be given in this House again.  That will make a real difference to that family and many others.</p></speech>

The document was a confidential draft copy of the 2019 GP services contract, a contract with a value of &euro;210 million.  The contract was negotiated between the State and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  Deputy Varadkar's friend was president of a rival organisation, the National Association of General Practitioners.</p>  <p>  The facts of what happened are not in dispute.  Deputy Varadkar has confirmed that, as Taoiseach, he leaked this document to his friend on a date between 11 and 16 April 2019.  The document was a draft.  As his own handwritten notes on the leaked document confirmed, it was subject to amendment and change.  The grateful appreciation of his friend to Deputy Varadkar, as Taoiseach, was expressed as follows, "To be fair, Leo always delivers."  That his friend, Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail, was eager to protect Deputy Varadkar, then Taoiseach, is evident in the published exchanges and little wonder given that he had campaigned for Deputy Varadkar to become the leader of Fine Gael.</p> <p>The leaking of this document was not motivated by public interest: it was giving a dig out to a friend, it is as crude as that, a friend whose organisation was in competition with the IMO for members, subscriptions and influence.  It was an organisation that subsequently collapsed and was liquidated in July 2019.  So it is clear that Deputy Varadkar abused his position as Taoiseach.  He will give an account of himself later today.</p> <p> The Taoiseach is now head of Government and Deputy Varadkar serves as T&aacute;naiste.  The Taoiseach has stated publicly that while these events were not best practice that no law has been broken and, further, that he has confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p> Given his stated position, can the Taoiseach tell us when the T&aacute;naiste informed him that he had leaked this document?  Did he wake up to the news on Saturday morning?  Who gave Deputy Leo Varadkar the GP contract document in the first place?  When did this matter come to Cabinet?  Was that when Deputy Leo Varadkar was furnished with the document?  Did every member of Cabinet receive the same document?  Did Deputy Varadkar inform any other member of Cabinet or any official that he intended to, or had, leaked the document?  Was the IMO informed of his course of action before or after he had sent the document to his friend?  How has the Taoiseach established that this was a one off event and not a pattern of behaviour?  Has Deputy Varadkar leaked other documents?  What was meant by "to be fair, Leo always delivers"?  Has the Taoiseach asked him that?  The Taoiseach has been categoric that no law has been broken.  Is that the position of the Attorney General?  Is it the position of the Attorney General that Deputy Leo Varadkar has not broken the law?  Finally, has the Taoiseach seen all the correspondence, documents and notes of conversations between the National Association of General Practitioners, the Department of Health, the Minister of Health and the Department of An Taoiseach?  Has he scrutinised all those?  Why is it that he refuses to publish all this correspondence, documents and notes of conversations for public scrutiny?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300006#D00200"><p>I have made it very clear that what the T&aacute;naiste did on the GP contract when he was Taoiseach in the last Government was not best practice.  It was inappropriate and the wrong way to do things.  I have said that and the T&aacute;naiste has acknowledged that and has agreed to come to the House to address the issue and answer any questions that Members have on it.</p>  <p>  The GP contract was a positive development and welcomed by all Members of the House.  Members had been pushing for a conclusion to long negotiations around a new GP contract.  It was welcome because it involved the reversal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, worth about &euro;120 million and the chronic disease management programme at primary care level which was worth about &euro;80 million.  It was a deal which everyone welcomes.  It received a lot of publicity at the time by all media outlets when it was announced by the IMO on 5 April.  I have the IMO's press release here.  It includes quite considerable detail on items including capitation fees, &euro;2 million per annum investment in practices in deprived communities, chronic disease management, maternity and paternity payments for GPs including the contribution to locum costs.  It is all there in the IMO press release from 5 April.  On 6 April, the HSE announced the details of the deal and the Government did so.  I understand Cabinet approved it on 9 April and then it went to IMO members.  The essentials of the deal were out there.  As I said yesterday, deals of this sort involving such a significant degree of public expenditure and improvements and investment in the health services, at community care and primary care levels, should be published as early as possible.</p> <p>That is my view.  As I said, the IMO had reached agreement with the Government in this matter.</p> <p> Deputy McDonald made a comment that I refused to publish something.  I would like her to withdraw that comment because I have not refused to publish anything.  I will publish anything that is of relevance to this matter.  I have asked my Secretary General to have a preliminary look at what is in my Department, following the Deputy's letter that arrived late yesterday evening.  The only thing that has been found so far is a letter from Chris Goodey of the NAGP, dated 9 April, to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The letter was sent to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on 5 April and was copied to the then Taoiseach and the then Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Fleming.  It relates to the NAGP's concern regarding the removal of medical cards from patients by the primary care reimbursement service.  I can read out the letter if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

This is the letter I received from the Secretary General this morning.  It is the only letter and I felt obliged to bring it in because I know the Deputy was very concerned about what she perceives to be numerous pieces of correspondence in my Department on this issue.  I have to inform her, from a preliminary examination of this issue, that there are not numerous notes or items of correspondence within the Department of An Taoiseach.  Obviously, it would have been the Department of Health and the HSE that primarily dealt with the negotiations with the IMO on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should withdraw the comment that I am refusing somehow to provide information.  She should not create the impression that I am trying to hide something.  I am not.  The Department of An Taoiseach is an open door in resect of any correspondence the Deputy wants to access on this issue or on health.  It is important to say that.  The Taoiseach is going to address this issue comprehensively later today and answer any questions people have.  My apologies, I meant to say the T&aacute;naiste will address any questions.</p></speech>

However, the questions I asked were not for the T&aacute;naiste but for the Taoiseach.  When was he informed that this document had been leaked, when did the T&aacute;naiste tell him about it, when did the T&aacute;naiste get the GP document, had he informed other members of Cabinet about it, and so on?  I am assuming that the Taoiseach has explored all of these matters with the T&aacute;naiste and others because he has essentially given him a clean bill of health.  He has said that these are matters of not best practice.  Weasel words if ever I heard them.  What I was trying to elicit from the Taoiseach is some sense of how he arrived at the conclusion that there was no criminality involved and that there is really nothing to see here bar a failure to reach best practice.

On the issue around when he first found out, obviously there was a Cabinet meeting, as I said, which approved this matter.  The T&aacute;naiste is going to address all those issues but my understanding is that he would have got the document from the Department of Health.  That is a matter for the T&aacute;naiste and he will deal with all those questions.  That is why he is coming into the House in the first instance.</p><p>I was not a member of the previous Government.</p></speech>

That is where the Government is going on this.</p>  <p>  I have given nobody any clean bill of health.

It is a very significant issue.  Given the large-scale problems in this country including Covid, job losses, the CervicalCheck tribunal, which I have referenced, and a range of others, that is not good.  This issue needs to be dealt with quickly.  The public is now drawn back to the time of golden circles, the Galway tent, friends in high places and so on.  We had thought we had moved on.</p>  <p>  We in the Labour Party are in a slightly different position from that of others in here as we are the only party of the Opposition that has actually served in government.  I grant that individual Members of this House have served in government, but we are the only such party.  My party colleague, Deputy Howlin, introduced the lobbying legislation which was meant to manage all of these issues.  Obviously, it is being ignored.</p>  <p>  There is a bit of time before the T&aacute;naiste addresses the House.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is the Taoiseach now.  Will he ask the T&aacute;naiste not to use the lame excuse that he leaked this document to ensure the maximum number of GPs took up the contract, because it does not wash?  The Taoiseach has time to ask this of the T&aacute;naiste.</p>  <p>  This is not just about the T&aacute;naiste, however.  This is also about Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's role as Taoiseach and how he is going to deal with it.  It is about competence and how the Taoiseach will deal with this issue over the coming hours and days.  I have two real issues.  The Taoiseach has said that he had a number of phone calls with the T&aacute;naiste.  Will he confirm to the House that he asked the T&aacute;naiste whether he, or anybody who worked for him, had ever done this before?  Will the Taoiseach please tell the House whether he asked that question and what the answer was?  If he did not ask that question, why not?  He is the Taoiseach.  I ask him to please tell me that he has asked that question.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will have answered "No" because, if he has not, the Taoiseach has a fairly significant problem.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach has acknowledged, what the T&aacute;naiste did was wrong.  It was inappropriate.  Whatever happens today, that will not change.  It was inappropriate.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that, because of this, he will sanction the T&aacute;naiste at some level?</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, the most important thing when something like this emerges is that there is full accountability to the House.  That was my main concern on Saturday.  To be fair to the T&aacute;naiste, he had no issue whatsoever with coming before the House to address the issue and to answer any questions that people may have in this regard.  It is of a different order to other incidents.  I do not know why the T&aacute;naiste sent the GP contract to the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, in the way that he did.  I do not think that was best practice.  It was not appropriate and it was the wrong way to do things.  That said, everybody was engaging with the NAGP at some level.  Even in this House, the NAGP was lobbying Opposition parties.  It wanted to hear what was going on and to be consulted on the GP contract.</p> <p>Commitments were made that the group would be consulted on this.  From what I can gather, that does not appear to have happened in a comprehensive way once the agreement was published.  It was published by the IMO in a very detailed way to present to its members.  The essentials of it were out there in early April.</p> <p> Of course, in accordance with the Competition Act 2002, the GPs, as self-employed contractors, would have to decide individually whether to sign up to the agreement that was essentially being offered by the HSE or the Government to the tune of approximately &euro;210 million.  Each practice would benefit from additional payments relating to reversal of financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and the chronic disease management programme, on which we have all actively campaigned for quite some time, as well as various items in the agreement that were published by the IMO.  Generally speaking, all GPs are now operating under this and most people would accept it represents an improvement in primary care services.  That remains the position.</p></speech>

Has the Taoiseach spoken to the other members of the Government on this matter to see if any pressure was put on them to provide this contract, which the IMO indicated would only be provided to its members?  Was pressure put on anybody in the Government and who is now sitting with the Taoiseach in government to provide this contract to the NAGP?  Has the Taoiseach asked that question?  There are members of the previous Government sitting at the Cabinet table with the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has not answered my question about the T&aacute;naiste.  I asked if he or anybody who worked for him - his advisers - ever did anything like this before or since.  It is not just about him but the people who work for him.</p>  <p>  We all understand this was wrong and inappropriate.  It is accepted by the Taoiseach and it is even accepted by the T&aacute;naiste, to be fair.  What level of sanction is the Taoiseach considering, irrespective of what happens later today?  Is the Taoiseach considering a sanction now?  At least tell us that.</p></speech>

We take it from this that this applies to his advisers as well.  He did not authorise any other type of action like this one relating to the GP contract.</p>  <p>  I was not a member of the previous Government.  It is an important point to make.  I am not answerable for the previous Government's behaviour.  We had many policy differences and we fought those in an election.  As a result of that election, a new Government was formed involving three parties.  That demarcation is very real and important.  It would be quite a new precedent if future governments-----</p></speech>

The decisions taken by any government must be accountable to the people in a subsequent election, and indeed that is the way it works.  That is a general point I have to make.</p></speech>

While they do contain the spread of a virus, they also impose huge costs on communities, businesses and, most important, individuals.  The costs imposed by the recent move to level 5, including a major increase in unemployment, the removal of social outlets for most of us, and the possible permanent closure of many businesses, were insisted upon by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.</p> <p>Each of these measures is having a direct impact on the mental health of everyone in this country.  We are all seeing this in our dealings with the public.  Based on the Covid-19 wave model research developed by Dr. Philipp Hoevel and his team in UCC, and presented to the HSE last June, we will have entered our third wave of infection by February 2021 if we do not have proper systems in place.  As a result, we could have another lockdown on St. Valentine's Day and our fourth lockdown over the June bank holiday weekend.</p> <p> This is a stark situation and the only way to avert that happening is to do what we failed to do last summer and put in place a proper Covid-19 system with the capacity and capability to test, trace, isolate and investigate the sources of infection.  The public will not accept another excuse from the HSE next February that the surge in infections could not have been predicted and that it was overwhelmed by the number of positive cases.  The HSE has got fair warning and it must get this right.  The public will also not accept the excuse from the Government that this is an operational matter for the HSE.</p> <p> There is also an urgent need to use Irish-specific data regarding coronavirus trends and patterns to redesign the type of restrictions that should be imposed to manage and control this virus.  As Dr. Paddy Mallon pointed out, we are collecting huge amounts of data from contact tracing, laboratories, hospitalisations and digital data.  If academics and Government health experts work together to analyse those data, we could find a way that would enable our people to live safely alongside the virus, rather than just surviving from lockdown to lockdown.  </p> <p> Research into Irish Covid-19 patterns could lead to informed controls, rather than the quite blunt policies we have now.  We have circumstances unique to Ireland.  There is a big difference between dispersed rural populations, which make up 37% of our population, and tightly-knit urban communities.  A concerted effort must be made to analyse the data we have available in the hope of preventing the need for further lockdowns.  Will the Taoiseach commit this Government to act immediately and prioritise such research to help us all find solutions?</p></speech>

I accept fully his broad thesis regarding the need for Irish-specific research.  I read the article to which Deputy Naughten referred regarding Dr. Paddy Mallon.  I think it was in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>on Sunday, and concerned the need to do some more work on the specific data emanating from Irish sources.  That work is under way in my Department in respect of doing more detailed statistical analysis of a range of variables concerning the virus.</p><p>We are learning all along the way.  This lockdown is not the same as the first lockdown.  The schools are open, and we pay tribute to all those involved in the school communities for the work they are doing.  We will continue to work with the school communities to keep our schools open in the best interests of our children and students, so that they do not become long-term victims of this virus.  The construction sector is also operating, given the necessity, from a social perspective, to continue to build homes to address homelessness and to deal with the needs of those needing affordable and social housing.  Those are areas with long waiting lists.  The first lockdown had a major impact on construction and resulted in the country not being able to fulfil the targets on the housing front that we had at the beginning of the year.</p><p>What we want to do now is get the figures for the virus down really low, and we should maintain a real collective national effort to do that.  That will give us more flexibility at the end of November to see how we will manage the following months.  We must learn lessons and use the research to adjust our behaviours, as a country and a people, in a way that is consistent with trying to keep the economy open for as long as we possibly can to protect livelihoods, but above all protect public health.</p><p>Turning to the testing situation, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, shows Ireland among the highest ranked countries in Europe for processing high volumes of tests.</p> <p>The capacity per week is 120,000.  More than 112,000 were swabbed last week and to date more than 1.4 million tests have been carried out in laboratories across Ireland.</p> <p> On the test and trace systems we do need more personnel.  We are recruiting very actively now for contact tracing.  There are some 650 people now working in contact tracing centres across the country, of whom 344 are new recruits and the rest are redeployed staff.  A further 450 will be recruited so there will be a dedicated, separate workforce of approximately 800 people working in contact tracing centres.  Currently, more than 1,000 staff are working on swabbing and this is also made up of redeployed and new staff.  There is continued new recruitment for swabbing purposes.</p> <p> A total of &euro;650 million has been allocated for testing and tracing next year.  It is no small sum of money but it is vital in our battle against Covid-19.</p></speech>

Managing the virus in France and Germany is very different to a rural island in western Europe.  The tools used by EU colleagues to tackle the virus may also be very different to the tools that would be used in Ireland that could allow our economy to survive and, more importantly, our people to live.  The World Health Organization has made it clear that a strategy of rolling lockdowns is not recommended and we need to take this on board.  We need public buy-in to whatever measures we take in this country to battle against Covid-19.  There is a genuine concern that lockdown fatigue is beginning to set in.  Would the Taoiseach agree that we need to take the time now to analyse the data and find and Irish solution that fits with our unique circumstances and avoids the need for a repeat of future level-5 restrictions?</p></speech>

With regard to the tools and what is being done in Europe, in many ways we have been ahead of what many European countries have been doing in dealing with the second wave.  When I met with EU Heads of State and other Prime Ministers, what they were calling lockdown was our level 3, which was the closure of the hospitality sector.  Some countries are just about doing that now, whereas four or five weeks ago we were dealing with that in the hospitality sector.  The hospitality, aviation and travel sectors have been the hardest hit with regard to employment and the people in those industries.  I am conscious of that.  Equally, there are no magic solutions to this.  The basics stay the same.  I was reminded recently by someone who had seen advertisements around the 1918 flu that they were quite similar to the basic advice being given to people in 2020 for this pandemic: social distancing, avoiding congregation and cough and sneeze etiquette.  Fundamentally, it is about human behaviour in prevention of this virus.  Our geographical location is a bit more problematic than New Zealand for stopping the spread of the virus.  We have a border, we have a very close relationship with the UK with travel, and with the rest of the EU, and this is problematic also in containing and having a zero-Covid approach, which would be very difficult indeed.</p></speech>

The cable will connect 23 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe, and at 37,000 km long Facebook claims that the cable will be nearly equal to the circumference of the Earth.  Compare this to our own dire situation where, almost a decade on from 2011, we still have to raise basic issues about the lack of a vital service such as rural broadband, which puts many counties and regions on the back foot.  I want to discuss this issue with the Taoiseach.  Every rural Deputy in this House knows this is a serious problem.  The National Competitiveness Council also knows it is a serous problem.</p> <p>In its recent report, the council makes it absolutely clear that the shift to remote working by a significant proportion of the workforce has highlighted the absence of quality, high-speed broadband across this State.  Indeed, recent events have reinforced the view that the challenges and frustrations for individuals and businesses working in areas of very low or non-existent connectivity remain stubbornly high.  Despite almost a decade of talk about a national broadband plan, there has been relatively little action.  The Taoiseach will also be aware that this issue has generated significant concern in rural Ireland in particular.  Over the past two weeks, 19 of the 68 marts across this State have been affected by almost total broadband failure.  Edenderry and Birr cattle marts continue to operate with speeds of less than 30 Mbps, while Ballinakill livestock mart in County Laois is operating with speeds barely above 30 Mbps.  I wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, about the matter of the marts but I am still waiting for a substantive reply.  The level 5 restrictions at marts are having a very serious and significant impact on farming families and rural communities.  I have been inundated with calls to my offices about the situation.  It does not make sense, given that food production is deemed to be an essential activity, that farmers are not allowed to go in along the ringside considering the absence of broadband.  It is also affecting the prices farmers are getting and I have been told it is having a significant impact on the prices received.  This is unfair and unjust for farming families.  The marts in this State have been managed very efficiently and have been compliant with Covid-19 protocols.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene in this matter because it is unfair and this situation is simply not good enough.  We need a solution. </p></speech>

The first relates to the overall issue of connectivity in rural Ireland and the roll-out of the national broadband contract.  It is no longer a plan.  The contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, in November last year and a copy of the contract between the Government and NBI was recently published in line with a previous commitment by the Government.  The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, indicated as far back as 4 September that design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 20 counties, with more than 83,000 premises surveyed to date.  The laying of fibre should start shortly with the first fibre to home connection in Carrigaline, County Cork, expected around December 2020.  The Minister is working with NBI to look at the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this roll-out to support remote working and connect communities to approximately 300 broadband connection points, identified by local authorities, to high-speed broadband this year.  That will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high-speed broadband in advance of the main deployment under the national broadband plan.  Those broadband connection points would include schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places.  That project is well under way and 136 of those sites have been installed to date.  Increasing and enhancing that level of connectivity is central to regional development.</p>  <p>  The mart situation right now exactly mirrors what happened from April to 8 June during the first phase of Covid-19 restrictions.  The overall objective of moving to level 5 was to reduce gatherings and congregations and enable people to reduce their social contacts and the opportunity for social gatherings.  That is essentially it.  It is a blunt and crude instrument but it is necessary.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, has advised strongly that this is the course of action we should take for six weeks.  We are in the second week now and the objective to the end of November is to get the numbers down.  We have had submissions from many different Members of the House and the public more generally about different sectors, including gyms, marts, non-essential retail and pheasant shooting.</p> <p>People have raised all sorts of issues, which I understand, and it is difficult for people.  The purpose of level 5 is to work in our collective interest, to reduce the movement of people, gatherings and our social contacts, with a view to getting the numbers of cases down.  We are in a downward trajectory compared with where we were two weeks ago.  Level 3 was having an impact.  The restrictions on interactions between households to one household only was having an impact.  Level 5 will have an impact too.  If we all work together, we can get the numbers down and get back to a reasonable position in December.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.62" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300013#L00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I understand that it is important to protect the lives and safety of the public.  However, some of the restrictions do not make any sense.  One that I am challenging is the restriction on the marts.  Food production is an essential activity and I would like the restrictions on the marts to be questioned and challenged.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated at the start of October that the first tranche of 7,900 rural homes in the national broadband plan will be passed and ready for high speed fibre within the next ten weeks.  While this is great for these homes, it is manifestly insufficient because not a single midland county was included in that announcement.  We are undergoing a just transition in the midlands and it is totally unfair with regard to job creation and everything else.  We are on the back foot because of the lack of broadband infrastructure.  Will the Taoiseach direct the Ministers, Deputies McConalogue and Ryan, to brief rural Deputies on the outstanding issues that I have raised here?  Many people are worried, especially businesses.  It appears at times that the cart has been put before the horse with the actions taken by Government.  We have an online trading voucher of &euro;19.8 million for businesses but many of those businesses do not have adequate broadband, so there is no point in introducing measures such as that or the click and collect method or approach.  We need to ensure that those businesses have adequate broadband.</p></speech>

While it posed challenges, people managed to get through that.  We are saying that for the six weeks of level 5 restrictions, it is important that we work to try to get through them, notwithstanding the challenges that they present.  I do not understate those challenges but it is important that we work collectively to get the case numbers down, and this is the most effective way to do it across the board in terms of a societal response to this.  We can concede to each sector as we go along, and before we know it, we are back at some other level that will not be effective.  That is the issue for us as a society.  I know the Ministers, Deputies Ryan and McConalogue, have been talking to Deputies from all parties, including Members from their own parties, who have engaged strongly with them, especially on issues relating to rural Ireland.  Our own Deputies and Senators have been very strong and assertive on these issues.  I have no doubt that the Ministers will come before the House and talk to Deputies from all parties, as well the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p></speech>

It is a special day.  There have been 101 years and 1,000 bound volumes of the Official Report of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, sin Tuairisc Oifigi&uacute;il Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann - 1,000 imleabhar.  I have received correspondence from the Editor of Debates informing me that today's sitting marks a particular milestone in the history of this House as it will commence the 1,000th bound volume of Tuairisc Oifigi&uacute;il Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Official Report of debates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  &Oacute;n t&uacute;s, mheas Teachta&iacute; go raibh s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach imeachta&iacute; na D&aacute;la a thaifead agus a fhoilsi&uacute; go comhuaineach.  Under Standing Orders, all debates in this House are published in the Official Report which is produced by the staff of the Debates Office.  Is &iacute; teanga na D&aacute;la, b&iacute;odh s&iacute; i nGaeilge n&oacute; i mB&eacute;arla, an teanga a tuairisc&iacute;tear.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Tuairisce Oifigi&uacute;la le haghaidh an 21 Ean&aacute;ir 1919.</p> <p>These practices date back to the first sitting of the First D&aacute;il on 21 January 1919, which we commemorated last year.  For more than 70 years the Official Report was published in hard copy format as daily books for each sitting day, which were then compiled into bound volumes.  The numbering system of these daily books and bound volumes was the basis of the reference classification of debates.  Since the 1990s, the Official Report is now almost exclusively accessed via the Oireachtas website.  However, under copyright legislation, bound volumes of the debates are still printed and deposited with the copyright libraries and, indeed, can still be purchased from the Government Publications Office.  The reference classification of each sitting day by volume number and book number continues into the electronic era, and so today&rsquo;s sitting will be referenced as Tuairisc Oifigi&uacute;il Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Imleabhar 1,000, Leabhar Uimh. 1 - Volume 1,000, Book No. 1.  Is ceart d&uacute;inn an &oacute;c&aacute;id a cheili&uacute;radh agus a chom&oacute;radh.  It is only right that we celebrate and remember.</p></speech>

Sometimes, perhaps, generations of people do not realise that the cornerstone of our democracy is the written record of the D&aacute;il.  It is fantastic that we have such a lengthy record in bound volumes of what has been said in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann &oacute; thosach.  It is something we should celebrate.  The concept of something said on the record has been important, almost sacrosanct.  It is an essential ingredient of a parliamentary democracy, and our parliamentary democracy is one of the oldest in the world.  We should celebrate that fact, given the growing authoritarianism all over the world.  I salute all involved in putting the Official Report together over the years.  I availed of it as a young student many years ago and got great joy from reading it.  When one reads the Official Report of the D&aacute;il, sometimes one wanders and one reads stuff that one is not meant to be reading or that is not pertinent to one's research, but it is highly entertaining.  I put that on the record and note the significance of what you have articulated, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Government circulated a proposal that each party and group in the Opposition would have ten minutes to question the T&aacute;naiste about matters of profound importance.  As was seen on Leaders' Questions, there was a range of questions that the Taoiseach could not answer, but which he says the T&aacute;naiste will answer later.  However, he has only allocated ten minutes.  I ask the Taoiseach again to make more time available.  Yesterday, an email was sent to the Chief Whip with a proposal from Sinn F&eacute;in for extra time to be allocated to all Opposition parties and groups for what is an important matter in the interests of the people.  I understand all the Opposition groups have supported that proposal, so I await the Taoiseach's response to it.  I expect him to allocate more time for this important debate later.</p></speech>

For the sake of a minute, will the Government just do the ten and the five which was originally proposed.  The time difference is so small and we would be wasting it with a vote.</p></speech>

The Solidarity-People Before Profit group wrote to the Business Committee to state our view that time should have been made available this week to discuss the significant concerns regarding health and safety in schools, particularly in the context of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland ballot.  It expressed concerns about the failure to apply the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control close contact protocols when it comes to positive Covid cases and raised other issues pertaining in particular to the health and safety of 800 teachers with underlying conditions.  The Taoiseach may have seen the principal and deputy principal of a school in Luttrellstown who featured on a news programme last night.  They pointed out that they did not understand the way in which the Covid-19 contact tracing and testing regime in schools was operating.  These are serious matters to do with the public health effort and the health and safety of teachers, pupils, their families and the wider community which need to be discussed in detail and debated in the House.</p></speech>

For instance, yesterday evening it was announced that the House will sit an hour and a half later than planned tonight.  This is a continuing trend.  I am speaking on behalf of people who work in this House and have voiced concerns.  These hard-working staff will be in Leinster House until 12.30 a.m., 1.30 a.m. or 2 a.m., locking up the premises when the House has finished sitting tonight.  It makes no sense in the world that the D&aacute;il could not start until 2 p.m. today but will keep going until 12.30 a.m.  It does not make common sense.  Why can D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann not function like any normal place of work where people start at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. and finish at a normal time in the evening?  I do not care if Deputies have to stay here until 12 midnight, 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.  That is my business.  I am speaking on behalf of the permanent Oireachtas staff who will be here when the Taoiseach and I will be long gone from the House.  It is their job.  I think it is wrong because it is unnecessary.  Why can the House not start its business at a normal time of the day?</p></speech>

The best way to do that is to have an enhanced learning environment.  Obviously, schools must be safe for all those working in them.  Public health teams, working with education bodies and the Government, have been established to try to enhance that protection and engagement in order that there is a proper mutual understanding of the criteria the public health teams will be setting down in that regard.</p>  <p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I fully understand and empathise with him regarding the impact on staff of the late sitting hours into the early hours of the morning.</p> <p>I believe a good ten hours are scheduled today, about an hour of which is strictly Government time.  If Deputies keep looking for a debate on this and a debate on that, the logical outcome will be sitting until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.</p></speech>

I want to raise the issue of the tribunal on CervicalCheck.  I understand that today the 221+ group has written to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, a detailed letter setting out again the asks of this group, which I think are entirely reasonable, for a tribunal process that is non-adversarial, for the State to settle rather than contest claims where matters are clear-cut and for the labs to be pursued separately by the State rather than using the survivors to do that work for it.  We also need to ensure that no survivor is statute barred from making a claim due to the delays in setting up the tribunal.</p></speech>

The specifics of the Bill were to help all the women who have been impacted by CervicalCheck to have their claims heard and determined in the most timely and sensitive way possible.  It is a far better alternative than the courts in the collective view of the House.  There have been meetings with the 221+ group and its issues are being considered in great detail by the Minister for Health and his Department.  Many issues have been raised over the workings of the tribunal.  The Minister remains committed to addressing those concerns.  It was due to start earlier this year but was delayed due to the Covid pandemic.  The Minister was contacted during the summer urging him to proceed.  To be fair to him, he moved very quickly to try to get things developed.  There will be continuing engagement to get this right.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach knows John Wall.  He knows that the report on the provision of a medical card for those who are terminally ill will be brought to a meeting tomorrow.  That report will not recommend such a card.  The Taoiseach is on record as supporting this on 4 February.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, did so on 12 December last year and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, God knows how many times.  This is a policy decision and not about the clinical group.  Will the Taoiseach in the next 24 hours sit down with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to ensure that when they meet John Wall tomorrow via Zoom the medical card will be made available to all those who are terminally ill?  I believe everybody in the House and the country supports this.  The Taoiseach should not let this report see the light of day.</p></speech>

Recent weeks have been very difficult for the group.  It was not consulted at all during the preparation of the mother and baby home legislation.  It has written to all Members of the D&aacute;il today to express its frustration and anger at that.  Survivors have said that they feel that trust has completely broken down with officials.  They say that someone in the office of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, pointed them to Twitter to find out what was happening with that legislation.  I certainly feel that is unacceptable.  Does the Taoiseach accept there were major failings when it came to consultation on that legislation with the survivor groups?  They have also asked for the forum to be reconvened.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that forum is reconvened as soon as possible?</p></speech>

The Government has issued a very comprehensive statement on its approach to the mother and baby homes issue more generally.  The Minister has received the report from the commission of inquiry.  There is the idea of creating more than just an archival repository centre, but a centre that would tell the story of what happened, revealing dark chapters of our past in terms of not just mother and baby homes but the wider issues.</p>  <p>  Despite what some are saying, it is very clear that the records would have been destroyed if the legislation that was passed two weeks ago had not been passed and vital records would have been made redundant, which would have been in nobody's interest.  Therefore, it was important that the legislation was passed.  That said, I accept consultation should happen.  I will talk to the Minister about the consultation forum.  The idea of consulting with as many groups as possible is one I will work with.</p></speech>

It is outrageous to threaten them with deportation in the middle of a pandemic.  I am particularly concerned that a number of them are care workers.  Today I spoke to one who worked right through the pandemic, looking after elderly people in a care home in Kildare.</p> <p>Her boss spoke of how she gowned up, was at the front line, entered rooms in which people were Covid-positive and barried up with nursing like the rest of them.  We are threatening to deport this woman, other care workers and a slew of other immigrants in the middle of a pandemic.  How outrageous is that?  The Minister has powers under the Immigration Act to revoke those deportation orders.  I am asking that the Taoiseach instruct her to do so, that we do not deport anyone during the pandemic and in particular that we do not throw out people who have worked hard to save our lives and protect us.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago the coursing industry received a hammer blow which stopped coursing even though clubs were in the middle of it.  Today I raise a diktat issued last Thursday evening in relation to the pheasant shooting season, which was due to open on 1 November.  People are not allowed go out with their guns and dogs, out into the wilds.  Many clubs, such as my own club, the Ardfinnan, Ballybacon, Grange and Newcastle Gun Club, and huntsmen do huge work for preservation.  They are only interested in going out for a day's exercise with their guns and dogs, but they are not allowed.  What Department or Minister issued this diktat that they cannot go out to do their game shooting on 1 November, like every other year?</p></speech>

How could anyone say that there is anything prejudicial to anyone's health or safety by going out shooting?  Perhaps that might be true if a person goes out with somebody else but in most cases, one person goes out with a dog, predominantly shooting land that person has been shooting on for many years.  The date of 1 November is a very special day for those people.  They do it in a responsible way.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300021#U02100"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make further provision in relation to restrictions on the post-term employment of certain persons as lobbyists, for that purpose to amend the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>It is a case of better late than never for me in introducing this Bill today.  Sometimes we need reminding that this is a legislative assembly.</p><p>Legislation governing the conduct of politics and the point at which politics, business and other vested interests intersect and interact requires updating.  We have seen the corrupting influence that big money and cronyism can have on decision-making and on trust in politics, politicians and institutions.  This week, there has been a renewed public focus on how politics are conducted in this State.  We will presently have a debate on that very question.  I have no difficulty with lobbying.  One person's lobbyist is another person's advocate, and lobbying and advocacy are part of an open, democratic society.  It is how we choose to regulate and limit such activity and how transparent we choose to make it that defines our decision-making processes.</p><p>Section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 imposes restrictions on post-term employment as a lobbyist, which apply to persons who have served in certain sensitive positions.  The legislation provides for a one-year cooling-off period for Ministers and Ministers of State, special advisers and senior civil servants.  This means that for one year from ceasing to hold such a position, an individual may not, except with the formal consent of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, carry out lobbying activities, or be employed by a person carrying out lobbying activities, that involve the Department or body in which that individual served during his or her last year of office or employment.  We know that in a recent high-profile case, no such permission was sought from SIPO by a recent office holder who moved seamlessly into a job in the industry in which, until recently, he had ministerial responsibility.  This and other cases have brought into stark relief that the 2015 Act does not contain any enforcement powers, under section 22, and that contravention of that section is not an offence.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill I have brought to the D&aacute;il is to regularise the situation by enabling section 22 to be properly enforced as the public would expect.  The Bill clearly defines contraventions and the power of SIPO to authorise an investigation.  Anyone found to have contravened the section would be guilty of an offence.  The proposed amendments would use the punishments already set out in the Act providing for a class C fine of up to &euro;2,500 on summary conviction in the District Court.  If a case were to proceed to a jury trial in the Circuit Court, the punishment applicable on conviction would include a fine or imprisonment for up to two years, depending on the severity of the offence.</p><p>While the Government has committed to a review of SIPO legislation in respect of this and other matters, it is absolutely essential that it acts quickly.  Confidence in politics depends on it.  My Bill deals with just one issue, as colleagues will be aware.  In my view and that of the Labour Party, we need a top-to-bottom review of our ethics legislation.  This requirement was made clear by the events that were revealed this week.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300021#U02800"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Housing Act 1988 to provide a legal definition of persons at risk of homelessness and to give the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities the power to provide such persons with supports to prevent them from becoming homeless. </blockquote>  <p>As Deputies know, the number of adults and children in emergency accommodation and homelessness remains unacceptably high.  The two bans on evictions arising out of the Covid-19 crisis have brought the numbers down but they are still at unacceptable levels.  Figures released by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on Friday show that, as of that date, 8,702 adults and children were residing in Department-funded emergency accommodation, including 2,583 children.  We know this is not the full picture.  There are, in addition, more than 700 adults and children who were formerly asylum applicants, and now have leave to remain, who are using direct provision as a form of emergency accommodation because they cannot secure private rental accommodation.  On any one night, there could be as many as 500 adults - predominantly women - and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges.  There are 700 adults and children residing in hostels run by religious charities in Dublin, which are not funded by any State agency.  Therefore, the real figure for the number of adults and children living in emergency accommodation remains at more than 10,000.</p><p>Last Friday, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage also released the quarterly homeless report, which showed some very worrying figures in terms of family presentations, particularly since April of this year.  We are now back at the same level of new family presentations in Dublin as we had prior to Covid-19.  Meanwhile, the number of families leaving emergency accommodation is much lower than it was at that time.</p><p>Budget 2020 includes the largest allocation in the history of State for homelessness.  However, the overwhelming majority of that allocation, at 95%, is for emergency responses, with a paltry 5% going on prevention.  While emergency responses are vital, they are also ultimately an admission of Government failure in other areas.  In 2021, we need to see a greater focus on prevention, a key part of which would see Government and State agencies intervening much earlier in the process, before single people and families become homeless, to ensure they have an adequate roof over their heads.</p><p>The Bill I am bringing before the House is based on legislation that was introduced in England and Wales a number of years ago.  That legislation sought to place a legal obligation on local authorities and state agencies to put in place a homeless prevention plan before a family becomes homeless.  We know that when somebody is due to leave care, prison or a detoxification programme, for example, or when somebody has a notice to quit, he or she is likely to become homeless further down the line.  We have the very unfortunate situation at this time where the vast majority of people who are at risk of homelessness are told by local authorities and State agencies to come back at the point at which they no longer have a roof over their heads.  There are some good exceptions to this practice, such as the Threshold tenancy sustainment programme introduced by the last Government, which has proved very successful, and the introduction of the homeless rate of the housing assistance payment, HAP, although that is only available four weeks before a family with a notice to quit becomes homeless.</p><p>We need to have a system in place whereby, well before people are losing the roof over their heads, the State will step in to provide the supports necessary to ensure those families do not become homeless.  The Bill I am introducing imposes a 60-day obligation for a comprehensive homeless prevention plan to be put in place.  This would be available not only to those with notice to quit but also to care leavers, people leaving prison, survivors of domestic abuse, people leaving hospital, people exiting psychiatric care, people with addiction problems coming out of detoxification, and so on.  Unless we impose this kind of obligation, those people will, in the main, be left to their own devices.  On that basis, I am recommending the Bill to the House.</p><p>On a related matter, last week it was reported that another five people who were accessing homeless services had lost their lives in very tragic circumstances throughout the State.  There have been more than 50 such cases this year, compared with 30 or so last year.  We could see a doubling this year of the number of tragic and unnecessary deaths of people experiencing homelessness.  I have asked the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to undertake an urgent review of this matter.  We need an emergency policy response by the Government.</p> <p>We need to move away from congregated settings for emergency accommodation and we need greater supports, particularly for people with mental health and addiction problems.  We need an increase in the number of Housing First tenancies.  We also need to introduce another good practice present in Britain, that of adult safeguarding reviews, to learn lessons from those deaths.  This is a matter to which we will be returning in the House in the near future.</p></speech>

My Department continues to play a central role in co-ordinating the State's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  To date this work has been carried out from within my existing staff cohort, although this has involved significant reallocation and re-prioritisation of work within the Department.</p>  <p>  This work is co-ordinated through the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 and the associated senior officials' group established to assess the social and economic impacts of the potential spread of Covid-19 and oversee the cross-government response, which includes communicating public information.  However, within my Department, staff from every division contribute strongly to the work on Covid-19, including staff in the social policy and public service reform division; the economic division; the Government Information Service; the European Union, international and Northern Ireland division; and the protocol and corporate support services.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, a team of approximately 20 staff of my Department who were not directly involved in the work on Covid-19 were temporarily assigned to assist with HSE contact tracing in Dublin.  My Department also continues to deliver a range of other core functions and critical business including supporting the executive functions of the Taoiseach and Government and advancing Government's priorities and policy development through the Cabinet committee structure, and planning for the future with regard to Ireland's economy, Brexit, climate change and the work of the new shared island unit.  The Department's structure and resourcing levels will continue to be reviewed in light of the work assigned to the Department.</p></reply>

That is quite a substantial amount of money so the Taoiseach might outline what this increase is for.  Will he break it down for us?  I am sure he has the detail.  A large number of extra special advisers have been added in the Department.  We have been down this road before with regard to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party.  What proportion of that &euro;1.2 million relates to these new special advisers?  What proportion relates to other things?  I ask the Taoiseach to break that down for us.</p>  <p>  With regard to the pandemic, will the Taoiseach outline what expertise or additional staffing has been acquired by his Department to assist in dealing with Covid.

In written replies, the Taoiseach has said that the increased spending will continue throughout the whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including in the area of communicating public information.  The advertising spend of the Department of the Taoiseach has increased by millions of euro.  Are there extra people to deal with that?  If so, what are they doing?  Have any experts in this area been hired?  The spend on advertising seems to be mostly at a national level.  I and others have asked the Taoiseach to reconsider this approach and to channel this spend through local newspapers and radio stations, where it would have a bigger impact, particularly across different age groups.  The Taoiseach might consider that in the allocation of his Department's spend on advertising and communications in respect of Covid-19.  I would appreciate it if he would respond on that point.</p>  <p>  I will ask a question on a topical matter.  With regard to those who have been brought in as advisers, has protocol been renewed with regard to how they manage documentation and emails and ensure that everything goes through official channels?  Has anything changed or have any instructions been given in the Department of the Taoiseach as a result of the controversy about which we have all been speaking over the last five days?</p></speech>

I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach a few times but the more I raise it, the more shocking and extensive are the emails and contacts I get from people.  For example, a number of weeks ago I raised the widespread issuing of zero-hour contracts to contact tracers by CPL.  I have got a slew of emails since I highlighted that scandal, which was apparently a mistake although I will tell the Taoiseach in a minute why it was not.</p>  <p>  I will give the Taoiseach a flavour of what I have been told by the people who are becoming contact tracers, nearly all of whom are science graduates, it is important to say.  The issues they have include not being told if they were to be paid for training, which had so far taken 11 hours for one person when they contacted me; being asked to work before being issued contracts; being treated as if in employment while without pay or contracts; being directed to spend their own time practising and learning at home; being given zero-hour contracts; a lack of a human resources presence or anyone to whom to address queries; poor pay at &euro;24,000 per annum; and a lack of sick pay and supports despite the potential for mental health issues for contact tracers highlighted by the training.  These are taken from one email from one person.</p>  <p>  I also get emails from people who work in testing who are also on zero-hour contracts.  All the phrases that were in the mistaken contract are also in contracts issued to people working as medical scientists in laboratories who have been carrying out testing since March.  These are also highly qualified people who are on the most rubbish contracts one could imagine.  I have also been contacted by other medical scientists telling me that they are applying for jobs but cannot get them at a time when we are saying that such people are needed in the laboratories.  They are having to sign on for social welfare even though the testing system was unable to function for two weekends because there was not enough staff.  Despite this, qualified people looking for these jobs cannot get them.</p>  <p>  There is also the matter of student nurses, to which the response has been most unbelievable.  I brought up with the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago the matter of student nurses not being paid for working on the front line in hospitals.  Does the Taoiseach know how many people watched the video of our engagement on that matter?  It was 250,000.  There were a slew of comments thanking God that somebody had raised these student nurses' plight because they are working for nothing.  This is how we are treating those on the front line.  This is how we are addressing the issue of building up the permanent capacity we need to deal with Covid-19.</p> <p>They have rubbish contracts and student nurses are being exploited, and we are not even employing qualified people who are desperate to work in the testing and tracing area.<br/><br/>What is going on?  Is there any sense of awareness of these matters in the Taoiseach's Department or the Cabinet subgroup?  Will the Taoiseach address this as a matter of urgency?  I do not see how we can deal with Covid-19 with such a state of affairs.</p></speech>

There are currently more than 100 key promotional front line nursing and midwifery posts vacant in Cork city alone.  There are a further 50 staff nursing vacancies in Cork University Hospital alone.  To use a phrase that has been bandied about this week, that is not best practice at the best of times and certainly not in the middle of a pandemic.</p>  <p>  We have a bureaucratic centralisation of recruitment within the HSE and that is a big factor in the problem.  The common-sense solution is for the directors of nursing and midwifery in hospitals to be given the power to recruit where it is necessary on the ground.  The questions that arise are when the 150 posts will be filled and whether the Government is prepared to delegate power to the directors of nursing in that regard.</p>  <p>  I ask about Covid staffing in the context of a vaccine if, as we all hope, we have a vaccine in the new year.  It will take many staff to administer the vaccine and not everyone is qualified to administer such a vaccine.  A person must be a nurse or a pharmacist with certain qualifications, for example.  There will be an incredible level of demand for it, so surely the Taoiseach does not envisage that it could be administered on the basis of current staffing levels.  Special provisions and recruitment will need to be put in place.  Has the Government begun to put in place options for that?  It is very important that the administration of the vaccine is done through the public health system.  We cannot have a position where the administration of the vaccine is less than 100% of what it could and should be through the public health system while private operators charge for vaccines.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</p></speech>

I also raise the matter of student nurses.  It is not so long ago we were praising all and sundry on the front line and calling them heroes without capes, which is quite correct.  This is a terrible abuse of young professionals, and as Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, the sheer unfairness of their treatment is felt very keenly.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and what will he do about it?</p>  <p>  There has been evidence of zero-hour contracts being issued.  CPL is the recruitment agency named, but if it or any other recruitment agency is engaging in that kind of sharp practice and issuing poor contracts that fall short of what the Taoiseach, as Head of the Government, expects, what will he do about it?  Has there been an intervention?</p>  <p>  On the matter of testing and tracing staff, we know there are 581 staff working on routine contact tracing.  We know 214 of these are seconded from within the HSE and will have to return to their contracted positions.  We have confirmation that the HSE is targeting a total complement of 800 contact tracers by the end of the year.  It is pure madness that the recruitment campaign was not revved up during the summer months and it only began in August and got serious in September.  We have raised this matter endlessly with the Taoiseach because it is a critical ingredient in keeping ahead of this virus and allowing society to function to some acceptable level.  Where are we now in the recruitment of 800 contact tracers?  By the way, we will need more, but we should start with the 800.</p></speech>

It has reprioritised and reallocated work within the Department, as senior members of the Department have been dealing with it on a consistent basis since the outbreak of the pandemic early in the year.  The judgment call was that it was better to have senior members of the Department and officials dealing with this matter rather than recruiting freshly into the Department.  There is a requirement for experience and co-ordination in the wider Civil Service effort, working with the Department of Health and through the Covid co-ordination Cabinet subcommittee.</p>  <p>  There has been fairly extensive work by the officials and I put on the record of the House that, despite all the argy-bargy, we need to reflect from time to time on the extraordinary work that senior public servants have put into the management of Covid-19 on behalf of this country.  It speaks to the importance of a strong, highly resourced and high-calibre public service to deal and intervene as a State when something of the order of this global pandemic arises.</p>  <p>  I can give Deputies a breakdown later of the posts in the different divisions of the Department.  On the wider issue of staffing and public service pay in general, obviously the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform plays a stronger role there.  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry spoke about how the HSE recruits staff.  Since the new Government took office at the end of June, I have been constantly in touch with the HSE, and from the get-go I have been working on the idea of a separate workforce for contact tracing and testing.  The chief executive of the HSE and the Minister for Health have been pushing very strongly for this and we have one of the highest rates and volumes of testing in Europe.  Denmark is ahead of us when it comes countries of more than 2 million people.  The contact tracing side is improving, and while extensive, can be more extensive and we will work on it.</p>  <p>  The vaccine will be a major logistical exercise and work is already under way on that.  I said on previous occasions in the House that the European Union Commission has signed three agreements so far with Oxford-AstraZeneca, Janssen and Sanofi, and GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.  They are exploring the options and I hope they will be in a position to sign off with three other companies, so that by the end of the year, we might have some indication as to the feasibility of those vaccine research projects and when we will have a vaccine ready.  It will take some long period in 2021 before it can be rolled out.  It will be a major logistical exercise in itself.</p></speech>

When he was asked if he felt there was sufficient communication and co-operation between the two states in Ireland, he went further and said absolutely not.  In his view:</p> <blockquote> 	If this was an animal disease in sheep or chickens or cattle, you can bet your life that there would be an integrated effort North and South, and a huge amount of joint working and joint testing, and it would be seamless. </blockquote>  <p>That is a scandalous thing for a person of the eminence of Dr. Scally to say about the Taoiseach's Government.  It is a direct critique of the Government's handling of this situation, and it is no small thing.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has said that there have been 950 excess deaths this year, most likely as a result of Covid-19.  Half the country is closed, families are being pushed into poverty, a great many people are suffering poor mental health and people are losing their lives not just to Covid-19 but due to the lack of capacity in the health service.  One of the great weaknesses in the fight against Covid-19 is the lack of co-operation between North and South.  That is something in the gift of the Taoiseach and there would be no real cost to the people of Ireland if that were achieved successfully.</p><p>In many ways, the Government has put the responsibility for the front line of the battle against Covid on the shoulders of ordinary people in Ireland, when it could exist elsewhere.  I have asked the Taoiseach and other Ministers on many occasions where the locus of co-operation exists within the Government.  Does it exist within the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Health?  To date, there has been no answer to that question because no central location has primary responsibility for co-operation between North and South and no secretariat or staff are employed full-time to deal with co-operation between North and South.</p><p>The Taoiseach has given me examples of conversations that have happened, but those have been nebulous, <i>ad hoc</i>and not structured.  Does the Taoiseach not think a structured response is required in light of the island-wide nature of this illness?  Does he not think it is beyond time that we created a structure to deal with it on that basis?  This is not just my critique or that of Aont&uacute;; it is the critique coming from people of the eminence of Dr. Scally.</p><p>I note sometimes when I raise this issue that the Taoiseach can get defensive, and I do not think we should seek to get defensive on this issue.  We must work as an Oireachtas and a D&aacute;il in total co-operation with the people of the North of Ireland.  Can the Taoiseach show me a plan of action that consists of more than six meetings between the head of this State and head of the northern state since February?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach and the Government in Dublin can certainly have a major bearing on delivering it, however.  I have raised these issues with the Taoiseach before and I have told him that the systems, North and South, have been anaemic, quite frankly, in delivering the necessary all-island approach.  We all know that for the purposes of epidemiology we are a single unit, and the only way to keep any of us safe is to keep all of us safe.  We cannot have a reservoir of this virus anywhere on the island because it will imperil all of us.</p>  <p>  We have the memorandum of understanding, as the Taoiseach is aware.  The job of work North to South and South to North is to give that memorandum much more dynamic effect.  The issues we need to address include, for example, testing and tracing on a cross-Border basis.  It is insane to have the tracing element falling down between Strabane and Lifford, for example.  We also need an all-Ireland approach in respect of travel and coming onto the island.  In fact, if we must explore that matter as a construct of the common travel area and have a two-island approach, so be it.  As the Taoiseach knows, we proposed that be considered in the British-Irish Council.  In any event, we must have an agreed set of standards for self-isolation, restriction of movement and quarantine.</p>  <p>  Unless we have these all-island harmonised platforms, and delivery on them regarding testing and tracing and regulation of travel onto and off the island, we will be doomed for the foreseeable future to yo-yo in and out of very restrictive and massively damaging lockdowns and heavy restrictions.  They are damaging economically, but also devastating socially for our citizens.  As uachtar&aacute;n Shinn F&eacute;in, I state that we stand ready to play our part in the delivery of that all-Ireland approach.  I emphasise, however, that it is simply not going to happen in the absence of a dynamic from Dublin, and a real intent to deliver this all-Ireland approach.  I know the chief medical officers are in regular contact and there is some contact between the health ministers, but it should not be overstated.  There are complaints north of the Border that the southern system is not playing ball in providing all of the information.  That is what I am told from the health minister north of the Border.</p>  <p>  Be that as it may, however, whatever difficulties exist need to be ironed out.  We are coming into the Christmas period, and hopefully community transmission will be much suppressed.  I hope people can expect a decent Christmas.  We need to set the bar higher and resolve, as an island, that we will do everything within our grasp to avoid another very hard lockdown.  I think we can do that, but we are only going to do it on a cross-Border and all-island basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300024#X00300"><p>I have also raised this issue repeatedly with the Taoiseach.  I go so far as to say that the failure to have an all-Ireland integrated strategy to deal with Covid-19 amounts to sabotage of the efforts necessary to deal with the virus.  That is how high the stakes are, and all the public health experts, infectious disease experts and epidemiologists understand that point.  It is simple to understand that we have a serious problem if we are operating two different strategies, two different timescales and two different approaches.  Nothing is more important than addressing this issue.</p>  <p>  During our earlier debate on staff involved in testing and tracing - I hope to God they are not on agency contracts in the North - I should have concluded my reference to an email I received from a contact tracer by saying she finished off by stating "the bad treatment and lack of pay are making me seriously reconsider undertaking the role, or, if I do, I will almost certainly jump ship as soon as I am offered employment where I am actually valued".  That was on foot of one of these CPL contracts.  If that is the attitude of the contact tracers we are recruiting, it does not bode well for when things really get serious.</p>  <p>  We need, therefore, an integrated approach.  What tangible moves has the Taoiseach made to achieve that and what responses is he getting?  I am also curious about what is going on in the Northern Ireland Executive regarding this situation.  We will have a serious problem on 14 November when restrictions are lifted in the North, given that the situation is worse up there.  It will be a serious problem for the efforts we are making down here to drive down the infection rate.  It is a matter of urgency that we renew our efforts to have a co-ordinated, aligned and integrated strategy in our public health efforts.  Has the Taoiseach contacted the authorities in the UK concerning the value and imperative of having an all-Ireland strategy to deal with Covid-19?</p></speech>

They are simply wrong and overly simplistic.  There has been very regular contact at multiple levels.  That is the way it has to be.  I am engaged with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister.  At the first North-South Ministerial Council in three and a half years, which was due to the Executive being collapsed, an assembly was held on 31 July.  We brought the two Chief Medical Officers along to that, the Northern Ireland CMO and our acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn.  Covid-19 was a central agenda item of the North-South Ministerial Council.  There was very good engagement on Donegal, Derry and Strabane at a practical level.  The more this is hyped politically, the less it is going to happen.  I will be straight up.  Members can do all the grandstanding they like in the House, but the more grandstanding they do the less effective it will be in trying to get on the ground pragmatic engagement and co-ordination.  That is my read of it and I will be straight up about it.</p>  <p>  There are two jurisdictions, two health Ministers, two health systems and a CMO in the North and a CMO in the Republic.  They meet and engage.  The shared island unit is working more broadly.  We have created a new unit for ongoing engagement across the board and Covid-19 is seen as an area that should transcend borders given the implications for everybody on the island.  There is structured clinical engagement.  I am surprised at Deputy McDonald's comment that the Minister for Health in the North has said that the Republic is not playing ball or is short changing them.  I do not believe that is accurate.  I know this from my conversations with the HSE.  These matters should be left at the clinical level in terms of hospitals to hospitals.  I do not want to engage in any way in the politicisation of that.  It should be practical, pragmatic, clinical engagement on both sides of the Border.  That is happening and it will continue.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, had a recent conversation with the Northern Ireland Minister of Health, Robin Swann.  It was a constructive engagement.  That is the reality of that.  Deputy McDonald will be aware of how difficult it is within the Executive.  Sinn F&eacute;in found itself supporting the closure of schools in the North and supporting the opening of schools in the Republic.  Different approaches are being adopted.  Sinn F&eacute;in will know full well the difficulties within the Executive.  In this House, we have rows every day, including today, because people want exemptions for this and that.  The same applies in the North.  Some people in the North, politically, want certain sectors open and other sectors closed.  There are different rows about that and it is the same in the Republic.  As soon as restrictions are brought in people start to ask, "Can I get an exemption from that restriction or an exemption from another restriction?"  This has happened in the Executive.  It is my genuine view that the next agenda item is to try to see how things evolve in the North in the coming fortnight with incidences, level of cases, their position on the ending of their current phase of restrictions and the review of that and what they intend to do.  This is important from our perspective.  Our level 5 is to the end of the month and we want to get the numbers very low.  I have also spoken to the British Government and to Boris Johnson seeking to make sure he would underpin and support the Northern Ireland Executive with the funding that might be required to help it support businesses as a result of the restrictions it brought in.</p></speech>

What appears to be happening is that in the context of a Tory Brexit, immigration rules in Britain are becoming increasingly racist, and nakedly so, and increasingly restrictive.  The rules are being applied,<i>de facto</i>, in Ireland in the way the common travel area is being applied.  People are being excluded entry into Ireland on the basis of Britain's increasingly restrictive rules.  Why on earth are the Irish Government and Irish officials acting as enforcers of a Brexit-inspired crackdown?  Are British immigration officials operating in Irish airports or are Irish officials implementing these British regulations?  Why is the Irish Government going along with this crackdown on immigration?</p></speech>

What is their response to that?  Are they indifferent or dismissive?  From an infectious disease point of view, it is an irrefutable fact that to operate on an all-Ireland basis in dealing with Covid-19 would by far be the best and most effective way to deal with it.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate a little bit more on what the response has been, if the Taoiseach is making the case which he says he is?  As the Taoiseach said, it is not about grandstanding, it is a practical imperative.  I believe him, as that is what he said, but what response are we getting other than, as the Taoiseach said, it is two different jurisdictions?  Is that code for the Taoiseach being told that they do not care about the need for an integrated approach on an all-Ireland basis because these are two different jurisdictions and they are not co-operating on that basis.  What is the block?</p></speech>

I thank the Taoiseach for the response given.  I tabled the question specifically in relation to Northern Ireland and Covid-19 because they are the most pertinent issues of the day.  I think it absolutely exposes something of a gap, going forward post-Brexit, of the Anglo-Irish relationship and of the Dublin-London relationship.  There needs to be a formalisation of that relationship.  We are very lucky that we are the only EU member state in a position to have that direct bilateral relationship with the Government in London through the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  What efforts are being made to formalise not just the North-South Ministerial Council, which the Taoiseach attended and on which I appreciated the briefing, but also the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the British-Irish Council and so much more?</p></speech>

I will state it so that it is clearly understood.  The Taoiseach raised the issue of schools North and South.</p> <p>The Taoiseach is right.  On one side of the Border schools are closing and on the other they are remaining open.  That is not so much due to the vagaries of Sinn F&eacute;in policy but to the reality that we have two different sets of public health advice which are in this instance contradictory.  Not alone is that a very awkward situation, it is actually dangerous.  We need to work harder to ensure the systems are joined up.  Of course there is merit to, and a necessity for, a healthy Anglo-Irish relationship and we must ensure that.  The real moment the health of that relationship will crystalise is when we no longer have a British border on our island.  That relationship is an important one but the Dublin-Belfast relationship is critical to all of this for now.  Has the Taoiseach addressed this issue in respect of Covid with Boris Johnson?  Has he put it to him directly that it is an imperative and a matter of national importance and interest for us to have a single approach?  If so, what was his response?</p></speech>

That will remain the position.  I will follow up on the specific assertions the Deputy makes, but the work and role of Irish officials in relation to migration policy generally is certainly not as he has portrayed it.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised issues about the all-island approach to Covid-19.  The most recent announcements by the British Government about more severe restrictions in Britain and the United Kingdom should give an opportunity in how Northern Ireland responds.  The Republic, the North and the UK have an opportunity in the next number of weeks to be at a similar level for a period of time.  The UK Government has moved to very high levels of restrictions because of advice it has received from public health authorities, on which it is now acting.  There are different perspectives in the Executive and across the political spectrum in the North about the level at which restrictions should be and the length of time for which those restrictions should apply.  In my discussions with both the First Minister and the deputy First Minister I identified early on the very high levels of Covid infections in Donegal and along the Border in Cavan and the need for common-sense, pragmatic levels of co-operation.  We will continue to work with the Northern authorities in that regard over the next while.  It is important to work in a constructive spirit of engagement.</p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond made a very important point.  One of the key outcomes of my meeting with the British Prime Minister last August was that we instructed our officials to work on developing proposals around structures for a post-Brexit British-Irish relationship and how the relationship would evolve structurally post Brexit.  We have both been members of the European Union since the early 1970s, and during that period a significant degree of familiarity has developed through meeting regularly at European Union meetings, both at an official and a political level.  In many ways, that has helped improve and enhance the relationships between successive British and Irish Governments over decades, leading to very significant and strong bilateral relationships which have underpinned the Downing Street declaration and the Good Friday Agreement itself.</p>  <p>  The importance of the British-Irish dimension and relationship cannot be understated and it is something on which we have to work very hard post Brexit.  I would worry about this issue if we do not move to recognise the realities of Brexit, the fact the UK will be outside the European Union, and the necessity therefore, on a host of bilateral issues and in terms of the issues on the island of Ireland, for Britain and Ireland to continue that key relationship and develop structures and a stronger relationship post Brexit to deal with those issues and work harmoniously together on issues of mutual concern.  The next meeting of the British-Irish Council is on 6 November and will be hosted by the Scottish Government.  It will be a virtual meeting.  On the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, it is my intention to accelerate that forum and create new momentum within it on the wider issue of British-Irish relations.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the UK's response to Covid-19.  It has evolved.  When we introduced level 3 restrictions, I am not sure the British Government was ready to go to level 3 or to the level it is going to now.  We then moved a notch higher than level 3 to level 5, having gone to level 4 in Donegal.  The British Government has now moved as well.</p>  <p>  As regards travel and the common travel area, I am not opposed to the idea to which Deputy McDonald alluded of the possibility of the two islands having a common approach to travel.  All areas are nearly red at the moment for travel, and while that is problematic now, the aviation industry needs some signals for the future and next summer, for example.  That is why Ireland has decided to opt in to the European Commission's travel proposals.  Equally, there is a need to see if we can develop a common approach on the British-Irish side.  There is work going on at the moment to validate antigen testing clinically and see whether that will be applicable.  There are different perspectives within our health community on the value of antigen testing or the degree to which it can be used.  Other countries are using antigen testing as part of their responses to Covid-19 and the UK Government is looking at a pilot project in Liverpool regarding the utilisation and application of antigen testing.  That is something we are going to watch very carefully indeed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300027#BB00200"><p>I welcome this opportunity to give an account to the D&aacute;il of my actions in April 2019 in relation to the contract negotiated between the Government and general practitioners, GPs, represented by the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight, to refute some of the allegations against me and to apologise for my errors of judgment.</p>  <p>  I want to share with the House my motivations throughout this.  I am a doctor by training and a qualified general practitioner.  So is my father.  I grew up over the shop which was his surgery in Blanchardstown.  I believe the solution to many of the shortcomings in our health service lies in developing primary care and community care.  At the heart of this are general practitioners, hard-working, committed, dedicated people, rooted in their community, who already provide high quality, easily accessible medical care with no waiting lists, 24-7, 365 days a year.  They are willing to do more and all that they ask is that they are properly resourced and supported and it is the role of the Government to enable this.  For most of the last decade, as a consequence of the financial crisis, we were forced to do the opposite and resources were taken away from general practice and community care.  This had a detrimental impact on our health service as a whole and led to many newly-qualified GPs, including many I knew personally, losing heart and deciding to emigrate.</p>  <p>  Only from 2016 onwards did it become possible to change this.  As Minister for Health, alongside the then Minister for State, Kathleen Lynch, I was able to secure agreement on a new contract with GPs to manage diabetes in the community rather than in hospitals.  It was a major step forward that has improved care for tens of thousands of patients.  We also made implanted contraceptive devices, first-line investigations such as 24 hour blood pressure monitors and other services more available than before.</p> <p>This was just a prelude of what could be achieved through a wider contract, if we had had the budget to do so.<br/><br/>We also negotiated a new contract with the IMO to extend free GP care to all children under six years old and all seniors over 70 years old.  While the latter was well received, free GP care for children under six years of age was not.  It was controversial and caused division among GPs and the medical community.  It was broadly supported by the IMO which represents all doctors, including GPs, but not by another organisation representing GPs only, the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, which actively campaigned against it.  Rivalry between the organisations was often bitter; it made agreement harder to achieve and held back progress.  The NAGP wanted to be at the table.  Some GPs were members of both organisations and some were members of neither.  Ultimately, the Government decided to deal with the IMO alone, as its long-standing negotiating partner and Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, affiliate.  The Opposition was very critical of this at the time.<br/><br/>We committed, however, to keep the NAGP engaged, involved and informed as to the progress and outcome of negotiations.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health in February 2019 that while negotiations were with the IMO, &quot;there was a role for the NAGP to play in terms of being consulted and involved&quot;.  In fact, in a Government memorandum at the start of the talks process in March 2018 the Cabinet was informed that there would be &quot;formal consultation&quot; with the NAGP.  It is important to understand that general practitioners are not employees.  They are contractors and self-employed, and have an individual entitlement to accept or reject any contract, regardless of any ballot.  Any agreement made by their representatives is not a collective agreement in the normal sense.  In fact, such negotiations are more correctly termed consultations.  Each GP has to be convinced individually to sign up.<br/><br/>In 2015, the campaign led by the NAGP against the Government-backed contract for children under six years old was very disruptive and resulted in the service not being available universally across the country for some time.  I wanted to avoid a repeat of that in 2019.  When I became Taoiseach in 2017, I said that I had unfinished business in health.  I meant it, and I still mean it.  Among my priorities was to finish off some of the work I had left in the Department of Health.  I wanted to use the influence of the Taoiseach's office to secure a new contract with GPs and to reverse the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act cuts in return for a commitment to provide new and better services in the community for more patients free at the point of use.  It would be a big step forward towards achieving universal healthcare in Ireland, which I believe in, and while we might disagree on the model, almost every Member of the House agrees on that too.  It would also make general practice financially viable again.<br/><br/>As Taoiseach, I was fortunate to have an active and energetic Minister for Health in Deputy Harris, who shared that vision, and a Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, who knew this was a political priority for me and was willing to find the funding to make it possible, even if his officials would have preferred otherwise.  I took an active and personal interest in the talks, was frustrated at times when they were not progressing quickly enough and kept in personal contact with a number of GPs whom I felt were opinion leaders during all this.  I was determined to get the deal done and ensure it secured universal acceptance across the GP community.  I wanted to get it implemented and then move on to the next items on the agenda, such as GP care for children under 12 years old as well as further services being moved from the hospital system to the community, for example, minor surgery and antenatal maternity care.  This was my sole motivation all along.  I wanted what was best for general practice, patients and the public.  The suggestion that in any of my actions I had anything to gain personally in any way is false, without foundation and deeply offensive.<br/><br/>The facts are as follows.  Following lengthy negotiations, an agreement was reached on 3 April 2019 and in the words of RT&Eacute; health editor, Fergal Bowers, the &quot;fine details&quot; were publicly announced on Friday, 5 April 2019, by the IMO.  The details of it were extensively described in a press release issued on that day.  There was also a five-page document issued by the IMO, entitled &quot;Summary Information&quot;.  This set out the financial details as well as anything that could be considered commercially sensitive - &euro;120 million extra in fees, a 10% pension contribution increase, enhanced maternity and paternity leave, &euro;80 million for chronic disease management and a detailed revised fee schedule.  The IMO had struck a very good deal for its members and publicised that fact.  I am placing this document on the record of the House this evening.  The following are the words of Dr. Padraig McGarry, chairman of the IMO GP committee, on 5 April 2019:</p><blockquote>	The Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) has announced details of a negotiated agreement with Government which secures &euro;210 million in increased funding for General Practice over the coming years.  This is an important step towards investing in General Practice and valuing it as a vital part of the health service.  It will do two things: restore the draconian cuts imposed on GPs and bring new and much needed funding to deliver new services to patients in the community. </blockquote> <p>I am also placing the following full statement on the record of to the House.  On Saturday, 6 April 2019 the HSE issued a statement entitled: &quot;GP Contract Launch&quot;.  &quot;Launch&quot; was the term used by the HSE.  Anne O&rsquo;Connor, interim director general, publicly welcomed the agreement on GP contractual reforms.  I am putting her statement on the record of the House as well.  In addition, at a public event in a primary care centre on the Navan Road on the same day the agreement was welcomed and endorsed by me, as Taoiseach, and the Minister for Health.  I am placing that statement on the record of the House.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, 9 April, a memorandum was brought to Cabinet by the Minister for Health informing the Cabinet that &quot;engagement had concluded&quot; with the IMO.  The matter did not return to Cabinet as no significant changes were made between then and its formal publication on 17 May, although there were minor ones.  The fact is that an agreement had been reached and the nature of that agreement was not something that was an official secret, highly confidential or commercially sensitive after 6 April.  On the contrary, all the salient information was in the public domain and was being discussed at public meetings that GPs were attending.  There were calls in the D&aacute;il at the time for the full text of the agreement to be published.  Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly said: &quot;we should have had it the day after it was agreed by the IMO&quot;.  Deputies Alan Kelly, Stephen Donnelly and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall were all critical of the fact that it had been agreed but not published in full.  Another Deputy mentioned the possibility that GPs who were members of the IMO might see it before those who were not and pointed out that some GPs who were not members of either organisation might be at an unfair disadvantage.<br/><br/>In the normal course of events, agreements are published within days if not on the night they are made.  As the Taoiseach said the other day, on reflection it would have been better if that practice had been followed here.  I fully respect, however, that the IMO wanted to do it differently and wanted to hold meetings around the country to consult and engage with its members before doing so.  For my part, as Taoiseach and in my capacity as Head of Government, I was keen that the agreement should be well received by the general practitioner community as a whole and not just those who were members of the IMO.  It was a good deal and I wanted it to be universally accepted.  In particular, I wanted to avoid a repeat of the problems we had getting the agreement on children under six years of age implemented.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, GPs are not employees.  They are self-employed contractors and they had an individual entitlement to accept or reject it.  Indeed, there are some who are still operating on very old contracts to this day, having chosen not to accept those negotiated in recent decades.  At this time, Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail was president of the National Association of General Practitioners.  It claimed to have 1,200 GPs among its members.  I posted a copy of the agreement to Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail between 11 and 16 April 2019, most likely on 15 or 16 April.  I did so on a confidential basis, believing publication was imminent anyway.  I wanted his opinion on it and hoped that in seeing how favourable it was, it would remove or mollify any opposition from that organisation.  I wanted him to see that there was nothing in the terms of the agreement that was contrary to what was publicly announced and that there was nothing in it worth opposing or agitating against.<br/><br/>In the end, the deal made by the IMO was demonstrably good for general practice.  The NAGP did not oppose it and, in any case, the organisation fell into decline very soon after due to internal issues.  Providing it with the information did not confer any advantage over the IMO on anyone else.  Indeed, arguably, anyone affected by it should have been given access to it as soon as agreement was reached or shortly thereafter.  This is the normal practice.  The Government had publicly committed on multiple occasions to keep the NAGP informed as to the progress and outcome of negotiations.  Indeed, the Opposition went further and argued that we should have included it in the talks from the start.  In providing a copy of the agreed and publicly announced terms of the agreement, I was honouring a political commitment made by the Government which I led, including commitments given here in the D&aacute;il.  The agreement having been made, the question at that point was different - how to get GPs to sign up to it quickly and <i>en masse.  </i>This was my objective.<br/><br/>It has been alleged that there was something improper, perhaps even criminal, in my connection with Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail.  This is not the case.  It has been reported that he is &quot;a Varadkar cheerleader&quot;.</p> <p>Yes, there are many examples of his public support for me, but there are also plenty of the opposite.  For example, on 13 April 2019, in the middle of this timeline, he publicly attacked the Government for providing more GP visit cards, calling it a shameful &quot;vote-getting exercise&quot;.  He went on to describe the policy of the Government that I led as &quot;the biggest con job in the history of the health service&quot;.  That was not exactly cheerleading.  This was someone who was president of the NAGP, who I wanted to be in support of the agreement and not vehemently opposed to it, as it had been in 2015.<br/><br/>It will not surprise you to hear, a Cheann Comhairle, that Ministers have lots of people's numbers in their phones.  Prime Ministers have each other's phone numbers and speak informally in between official meetings.  Occasionally, we even exchange what are termed &quot;non-papers&quot;.  In fact, any party involved in the talks relating to Northern Ireland would be very familiar with all of this.  The same goes for informal contacts between Ministers and union leaders, business leaders and indeed Deputies and Senators.  There is nothing inappropriate about informal contacts of this nature <i>per se</i>.  In fact, little would get done without them, and we all know it.<br/><br/>Sometimes people like to exaggerate the nature of their relationships, to inflate their own influence or to claim to speak for a person when they do not - to claim to have greater access than they really have.  Friends, acquaintances and supporters may claim to be closer than they really are.  This is clearly a big part of this story.  If we are honest, most of us in this House are familiar with that phenomenon too.  I am always willing to help people, those whom I know and those whom I do not know, just as I am willing to help a constituent in need, but I never do so in a way that confers on them any sort of special treatment or advantage.  This is never something I have been accused of before.<br/><br/>Having said that, I do accept that the provision of the agreement by an informal communication channel to the president of the NAGP, in the way that I did, was not good practice.  I regret that I did not ensure that it was provided in a more appropriately formal manner.  It was an error and one I accept sole responsibility for.  I know it has caused people to question my judgement, but I hope, having heard my explanation, no fair-minded person will question my motivation or integrity.  I do regret it and I am sorry for the controversy and annoyance that my actions have caused, including to members of the medical profession, members of the IMO, my colleagues in government and to the House.<br/><br/>I know I have made mistakes as a Minister and when I was Taoiseach.  I have tried to learn from them.  There are things I wanted to do and failed.  Even with the things we did achieve, I wonder if we could have done more.  Over my career I have been guilty of errors of judgment, but I have never been motivated by a desire for selfish financial gain or motives corrupt; not for a minute.  My guiding principle today is the same as it was when I entered political life.  That is, to serve my country to the best of my ability, to make a difference while I have an opportunity and to reward the enormous privilege of being elected to this House by helping to improve the lives of all our citizens.  I knew the new GP contract would make a difference and help some of the most vulnerable in our society who needed it the most.  I made an error of judgement in trying to achieve that result, motivated by the best reasons, but there was nothing selfish or dishonest, let alone corrupt or illegal, in what I did.<br/><br/>I have been asked to give a full and detailed account of my actions to the D&aacute;il.  I have done so.  I have been asked to set out the timelines.  I have done so too.  I have also been asked about the &quot;full impact&quot; of my actions.  There was no impact, certainly no negative one.  The deal was done.  It was well received and was accepted almost universally by GPs.  It is now a reality and is being implemented and providing better, more accessible care to more patients in the community and that is what really matters.  I am happy to answers the Deputies' questions.</p></speech>

There had been engagement with the NAGP throughout the negotiations.

The NAGP, in its statement the other day, said that it had monthly meetings with the HSE and the Department of Health.  The Department of Health says otherwise - that there were not meetings in 2018 or 2019, so we will have to get to the bottom of that obviously, but none of the meetings would have involved me.  Again, the commitment was there in the Government memo in 2018, and in the commitments of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris to the joint Oireachtas committee that we would keep the NAGP informed and involved.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste regurgitated that statement about the commitment again in his statement to the D&aacute;il today.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste has been making a lot of inquiries in recent days.  There was no engagement between the Department of Health and the NAGP from October 2018, on the resumption of the talks, to the time the talks were completed.  If the T&aacute;naiste disputes that he should publish the records within the Department of Health.</p></speech>

The NAGP in its statement say there were monthly meetings on the chronic disease package.  The Department of Health says that there was a prolonged period where there were no meetings.  I am not sure what the HSE is saying.</p> <p>What I can say is that there was a public commitment given by the Minister for Health and by me that the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, would be informed, involved and consulted.  If it was not, then it should have been.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is telling me that the Department of Health said there was no engagement.  That is the problem.  We have asked for these documents which are all covered by freedom of information to be released in order that there would not be any confusion on this matter.  There was no engagement with the NAGP and the Department of Health.  The T&aacute;naiste, however, is relying on that defence in some way to suggest that this was an ongoing process and it was not about doing a trick or a favour or pulling strings or a dig-out for a friend.  Is that not the case?  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that there was no engagement with the Department of Health and the NAGP throughout this process?

It would not be fair to expect her to know everything about it or to be aware of all the details.  That is not a fair proposition that the Deputy is putting forward.</p>  <p>  My defence is not about how many meetings were held between the NAGP, the HSE and the Department of Health.  My defence is that there was a Government decision to formally consult and involve the NAGP and to keep it informed and up to date.  We committed to doing that here in this House.  The Minister committed to doing it.  The Government decided to do it.  If the NAGP had not been informed all along, it should have been.</p></speech>

Does he accept that this document that he gave to his friend, the rival group to the IMO, which the Department of Health and the HSE were in engagement for a long period, could have been amended and changed at the time he decided to post it to his friend?</p></speech>

We all know that.  Agreements can be made and one can come back, amend them subsequently and they can be subject to change.</p>  <p>  I have put the records out there for the information of the House tonight.  Engagement was concluded - it says that in the Government memo - on 3 April.  The details were publicly announced on 4 April.  It was launched by the HSE on 6 April, publicly announced and endorsed by me and the then Minister, Deputy Harris, on the same day.  This was a week or two after all of that.  Yes, any document can be subject to change or amendment.  That is a simple fact.  However, in this case, any changes that were made were minor because they did not go back to Cabinet.</p></speech>

I presume it was changed through ongoing discussion after this date between the IMO and the Department.  If the T&aacute;naiste wants to suggest that it was not changed - I do not think that is the T&aacute;naiste's defence anymore - that is what one of his Ministers suggested yesterday, however.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, out to bat for the T&aacute;naiste on national radio, told RT&Eacute; that no other amendments were made to agreement, subject to the T&aacute;naiste providing the confidential copy to his friend, Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail.  That simply is not true.  The T&aacute;naiste has confirmed that now.  Why would he give a document where it was not completely tied down to a friend, who belonged to a rival organisation to the IMO?  The IMO was engaged in good faith in negotiations with the Department of Health and the HSE.  It was a rival organisation which was dependent on GP membership retention and signing up to it.  It was dependent on the financial subscriptions paid to it.  Why would the T&aacute;naiste do that, knowing that the document had on its front cover the words "Confidential" and "Not for Circulation" and in the T&aacute;naiste's handwriting an acknowledgement that the document was not finalised but subject to amendment or changes?  What was the T&aacute;naiste's motivation?</p></speech>

I explained why I did earlier, that I wanted to see if we could get the NAGP on side and make sure it did not oppose this agreement like it had in 2015.  It was an attempt to get it on board.</p>  <p>  I know the Deputy will keep going back to the point that Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail was my friend.

There is a lot of information to be put out there.  We heard from the then Minister for Health yesterday.  He went on national radio but he did not tell one single person he was also requested for this document.  He did not tell one single person he also said, thanks Maiti&uacute;, let us make inquiries on that and let us grab a coffee soon.

First, the confidential document, the draft agreement, was not complete.  There were changes to it afterwards.  We can establish that the T&aacute;naiste's friend requested that document and that he told nobody in the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Health, in the HSE or in the IMO.  He did not send it to the head office which is across the street.  Instead, he decided to get the home address of his friend and post it in an envelope to him.  He had a number of text messages and engagements with him.  The T&aacute;naiste knew that the organisation was a rival organisation to the IMO with which the discussions were being had.  However, he decided to do that.  Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail has made claims to others in the past that his intention was to undermine or destroy the IMO.  Seriously, this is not as simple as a junior official.  The T&aacute;naiste was the Head of Government.  This is insiders.  This is old boys' club.  This is not something that one just apologises for and try to make excuses that this was a part of an ongoing engagement.  We now know there was no engagement.</p> <p>This was a matter of favours for friends.  It is simply unacceptable and I do not buy the T&aacute;naiste's analysis.</p></speech>

This was an agreement that had been concluded.  It had been published in substance, or at least the salient details had, including all the financial and commercially sensitive information.  This agreement had been launched by the HSE and welcomed publicly by me and by the Minister for Health.  It had gone to the Cabinet.  The Cabinet memo very clearly says that engagement had concluded.  The head of the NAGP requested it.  I gave it to him because he was the president of the NAGP, not because he was a friend of mine.  He is not as close a friend as he has made out, which I can come to later.

I was hoping that today he would stop treating those in the political system and the people of Ireland like fools.  He has chosen not to stop.  His explanation is just not credible.  He waltzed in here this evening and to the cheers of his party colleagues equated giving this document to his friend to exchanging documentation as part of the Northern Ireland peace process.  He seems to want to paint himself as a victim.  He said there is nothing inappropriate about informal contacts of this nature <i>per se</i>.  He said that friends, acquaintances and supporters may claim to be closer to him than they really are, and that this is clearly a big part of the story.  Of course it is a big part of the story.  It is the entirety of the story.  As Taoiseach, with the immense responsibility placed on him, the T&aacute;naiste handed a document stamped &quot;CONFIDENTIAL&quot; to a friend of his who asked for it and who was the head of a rival organisation to the Irish Medical Organisation.  The T&aacute;naiste has said with a straight face that he was trying to enhance the possibility of this deal getting over the line.  I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about the nature of his relationship with Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail.  Has he communicated with him since the story broke on Saturday or since he became aware of it?</p></speech>

The first occasion was when I heard the story was breaking, to find out what it was about.  The second occasion was when I was preparing my statement, to check the date on which I sent him the document.  On the third occasion he contacted me, wanting to know if the NAGP should issue a statement.  I said that was up to him and I did not want to direct or advise him.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste sent out his statement after a full day of putting it together.  Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail sent out his statement the next day.

I was not chatting.  I wanted to make sure I pieced together everything in my recollection so that I could share all of these facts with the House.  One of the things published in <i>Village</i>was a WhatsApp message from me to him looking for his home address.  I did not have that WhatsApp message any more and I wanted to check the exact date on which I sent the document.  I knew that was one of the questions I would be asked.  It was being put about on Twitter by one of the Deputies here that I sent it on 2 April, which would have been before it was agreed.  I wanted to make sure that was not true.  In my recollection it was not true.  I recalled the date as being closer to 17 April, and that was something I wanted to check.</p><p>Yes, we are friends.  However, there are friends and there are friends.  We are not close friends.  Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail is the kind of friend I would meet two or three times a year, probably at a drinks reception or through overlapping social circles.  Otherwise he would have been in touch with me about medical matters such as Safetynet, the charity he works for through which GPs provide medical care to the homeless.  I have had some involvement in that.  We are not best mates or anything like that.  I know some people are trying to create that impression, or perhaps the impression that we are more than that.  That is not the case at all.</p></speech>

He is over-egging it.  That is clearly a big part of this story.  Someone who is known to me, who is a friend but not a close friend, made out to various people that he was closer to me than he was and that he had special access.

If this had been a traditional pay agreement, we would have published the agreement that night or within a day or two.  If it had been a dispute settlement, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the Labour Court would have released the document that evening.  If it had been a commercial contract, I would not have had it because of the rules around commercial contracts.</p></speech>

I think it is evident from all of this affair that Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail, for his own reasons, made out to be closer to me than he was.  On this occasion, I shared that document with him in confidence for two reasons.  First, the agreement had been done and announced and it had been approved by the Cabinet and I wanted to ensure it would get maximum support from the GP community and was trying to avoid a repeat of what we had in 2015.  That was my motivation.  We had moved from the point where the deal was done to the point where we were trying to canvass maximum support for it.  That was the reason.</p></speech>

The NAGP was a basket case.  It was not a credible organisation at that stage.  The previous year, its entire council had resigned.  Within weeks of the T&aacute;naiste giving it this document, it had collapsed in on top of itself.  Its motivation in getting this document was not to promote the document.  That is obvious because it did not promote the document.  In the words of Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail himself, "no doubt it will take the wind from the IMO's sails... I would love to destroy IMO too."  Is it not really the case that the NAGP was falling apart?  There were all sorts of questions about its corporate governance, its dealings and how it managed its affairs.  It was getting desperate.  As the T&aacute;naiste has acknowledged, it began to threaten him and members of his party.  The T&aacute;naiste helped his pal who asked for the document.  Either the T&aacute;naiste is complicit or he is a stooge.  Which is it?</p></speech>

I provided the document for two reasons: first, because there was a Government commitment to inform, consult and engage it on these talks; and, second, because I wanted to mollify or reduce any opposition to the agreement.  I wished to demonstrate to Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail that it was a good agreement and the NAGP should not try to oppose it.</p></speech>

There are references in the text messages to what it was going to do with the 17 roadshows the IMO had planned.  The T&aacute;naiste stepped outside his area of responsibility.  He stepped into a negotiated deal between the Minister for Health, the IMO and the HSE.  It was a sensible enough agreement which was not signed off on for another month when it came to the acceptance of the members.  The T&aacute;naiste's buddy or pal, the guy with the Leo t-shirt, asked him for a copy of it and he said "Yes".  Does the T&aacute;naiste not feel that either he was reckless in his behaviour, considering the organisation with which he was involved, or that his explanation to the House this evening has no credibility whatsoever?</p></speech>

I should have done it differently.  I should have brought Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail in and given a full briefing, even if it was line by line or page by page.  That is the way it should have been done.  I did not do it that way because I knew him and, almost as a shortcut, I did it in the way I did it.  I should not have done it that way.  I should have set aside an hour or two to do it in a more formal and proper way.  I absolutely accept that was an error of judgment.  It was a mistake on my part not to do it in that way.  Had I done it that way, I think we would not be here today.</p>  <p>  In the text exchanges to which the Deputy referred - again, I do not know if they are real as they are not from me - I believe I am also accused of being an IMO head, being a former member of the IMO.  On one level, the Deputy is using the texts as evidence to accuse me of helping out the NAGP but on another level the texts accuse me of being an IMO head and somebody who is trying to help out the IMO.  It cannot be the two.  Yes, of course my motivation was to get the agreement ratified.  I put a lot of work into the agreement.  I do not think it would have happened had it not been for the fact that I was Taoiseach and prioritised it.  The Department of Health wanted to do a whole new contract, starting from scratch, which would have taken far longer to negotiate.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had real concerns that this would kick off demands from other unions and sectors for FEMPI reversal.  I pushed to get the agreement across the line.  I wanted it done.</p></speech>

If Deputies are going to ask questions of the T&aacute;naiste, they must allow him time to answer them.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is now over time.

The T&aacute;naiste stated it was a legitimate objective and that he had worked on the agreement for some years and wanted to encourage its acceptance by a broad number of GPs.  If that was the case, then why was the document not disseminated through official channels and the line Minister?</p></speech>

I would perhaps bring Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail in and do a page by page or line by line briefing.  What I wanted to do was to share the document with him on a confidential basis to get his opinion on it and see whether he thought it was a good deal.  I believed that in sharing it with him, he would come to the conclusion that it was a good agreement and that the NAGP should not campaign or agitate against it or try to undermine it, as it did back in 2015.  The objective was to try to, at least, mollify any opposition to the agreement.</p></speech>

Obviously, the IMO was party to the agreement.  I am sure it would have wanted to know what was happening to the document.  It presumably would have expected that the document would remain confidential.  This document was clearly marked as being confidential and not for circulation.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's understanding of that instruction in this context?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300032#GG01700"><p>The document was not made public.  It was not circulated among the NAGP membership or shared widely.  It is a document I gave to a person in confidence for the reasons I explained, namely, to try to demonstrate that what had been announced was exactly what was in the document and that there was no reason to oppose it.  That was the basis on which I gave it to him.  It was not published or put into the public domain.  What was happening at the same time, as an IMO council member confirmed recently, was that there were meetings and briefings around the country being led by the IMO at which people were being informed of the detail of the agreement.  It was reported on in <i>The Medical Independent</i>and all the medical papers.</p></speech>

What is his understanding of the instructions "confidential" and "not for circulation"?  That is what was written on the front of the document.  I would have thought it plain that it was not for circulation and certainly not for circulation to a rival organisation.  Is it not the case that it was not actually finally agreed until approximately 16 April and, as such, the T&aacute;naiste breached the confidentiality of the negotiation process?  One of the screenshots of the exchanges between Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail and the T&aacute;naiste refers to any luck getting the contract and the T&aacute;naiste replies that it should be in the post.  He then goes on to say that there may be some changes made to it, so it should not be taken as gospel.</p> <p>The date of that is 15 April 2019, which is before it was finally signed off on 16 April.  It was in the post at that stage.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that he breached the confidentiality of the negotiation process, because it was subject to change even at that stage?</p></speech>

That is on 15 April.  It was still not concluded at that stage.  It was still confidential at that stage.  What does the T&aacute;naiste believe the consequences would be for an official in his Department?  He has just told us that an official put this in the post and was aware of what was going in the post.  What does he think the consequences would be if a document was going to be disseminated or leaked to a rival association while the Government was still in the process and had not concluded it, as has been said by his words on 15 April in that screenshot to Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail?</p></speech>

That is not the way our lives work.  It is certainly not the way Government works.  One is not able to tell everyone of everything one does on every given day.  It is a fair question that people have asked as to why I did not discuss it with the Minister for Health at the time.  The truth is that, like many things, it is probably because events were moving on.  This was done.  This deal was going to be ratified and it was going to be going through.  I was looking at the other things that were happening in health at the time.  What were we talking about?  In that same period, we had the issue of the 80,000 smear test backlog and we had the PwC report on the national children's hospital.  They were the kinds of things I was discussing with the Minister for Health.  This was a done deal.  This was going to be ratified.  This was something that we were glad we had done.  It was not an active live issue in the way it is now.</p></speech>

Certainly, I did not know it was going to have the difficulties it had subsequently - the financial irregularity and so on.  I did recall that for a long period, even up to then, it was a relatively large organisation.  Notwithstanding all that, it had well over 1,000 members.  We all remember during the period of the medical cards for the under six-year-olds, the instances it had in places like south Tipperary, south Dublin and other places where it actively encouraged and succeeded in getting GPs not to sign up to medical cards for the under six-year-olds.  It had many members.  It does happen sometimes that organisations turn out not to be so good.  The Deputy will be aware of charities, GOAL, for example, that we all thought to be good organisations but were not.</p></speech>

He has outlined that to us.  He would obviously pay attention to an organisation that he was going to use in trying to sell a document.  He would surely know that this was a basket case at this stage.  That will not come as a surprise to the vast majority of people.  I think it was in the public domain that there had been resignations and a range of other problems.  What could possibly have been gained in an organisation that was publicly known to be in such difficulty?  In the field that the T&aacute;naiste has a particular expertise, surely he would be more than paying attention to that area.  Given that he would have friends and acquaintances in those organisations, surely he would have known that it was in such difficulty.</p></speech>

The HSE launch was on 6 April when there was an event attended by myself and the Minister, Deputy Harris.  All that had taken place before I shared the document.</p></speech>

One is that the ambit of the Act is limited to persons holding public office, which is a term defined in section 2 of the Act.  The definition of public access expressly excludes Members of either House of the Oireachtas.  In addition to that, the Official Secrets Act makes clear that the persons who are authorised to release official information are Ministers.  The power to authorise the release of official information is one of the powers Ministers have.  If the Taoiseach does not have the power to authorise the release of official information, I do not quite know who does.  I do not think anyone honestly believes this was some of sort of official or State secret.</p></speech>

Could he explain why this was the case?  Presumably the T&aacute;naiste knew, if Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail was contacting him, that he could not get the document through other channels.  He was coming to the T&aacute;naiste and the T&aacute;naiste did not check with the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Department of Health or the IMO whether this would be a problem for them.  It must have occurred to the T&aacute;naiste that it might indeed be a problem, because if it was easily accessible, Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail would have got it.

I only gave it to this particular person, Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail, because he was president of the NAGP and for no other reason.  I did so because we had made a Government commitment, announced many times by the Minister for Health in a Government memo, that we would consult, inform and engage with the NAGP.  I thought it was appropriate.  I took a decision, and it was my judgment as Taoiseach, as Head of Government, that it was appropriate to share this document with that particular group because it represented perhaps 1,200 GPs and I wanted to see whether I could mollify and negate any potential opposition to the agreement being ratified.</p></speech>

I know some people may see that as going over the head of a Minister but when one is Taoiseach, one is the head.  When I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, there would have been occasions when the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, got personally involved in and intervened on particular issues.  Every Tuesday and Wednesday in the D&aacute;il,  Opposition Members call on the Taoiseach to intervene in specific matters.  They will often ask why the Taoiseach cannot just pick up the phone, and sometimes the Taoiseach does and gets personally involved and engaged.

I am amazed that he is even seeking to create confusion here because the facts are obviously clear that this is a confidential document that was not for putting about the place.  He leaked it to a friend, who stated, "Leo always delivers."  It shows that Ireland in 2020 is not about what one knows but about who one knows.  That is key to what happened here.

Equally, however, there have been other people in the IMO who have said that they believe this is a non-story, that the document was far from confidential, that it was being discussed at public meetings, that GPs knew about the contents of it, that there were telephone calls about it, and that it was not a sensitive or highly confidential document in the sense the Deputy is trying to make out.</p></speech>

If it had been before that, we would be talking about a very different situation.  The negotiations were concluded on 3 April.  That is what it says in the memorandum the then Minister for Health brought to Cabinet on 9 April.  The salient details, including the financial information and the commercially sensitive aspects, were all announced on 4 April.  I will give the Deputy the view of one member of the IMO council.  He said that in the week the document was shared, he was submitting articles on the deep details to two medical newspapers, presenting on the deal to two GP groups-----</p></speech>

He never told anybody about it.  That is startling.  Nobody was told about this particular action.  Did the T&aacute;naiste include a cover letter with the document that was posted?</p></speech>

If we had got into a real battle about trying to get GPs to sign up, a repeat of 2015, the then Minister, Deputy Harris, and I would have many conversations about it.  The fact, however, is that things had moved on.  Things move on very quickly in politics, particularly in the Department of Health.  There is never a time in the Department of Health when there are not at least two other houses on fire.  The kind of thing we were talking about that week and the next was not this because it was agreed and it was a success.  We were talking about the backlog of 80,000 smear tests and the PwC report on the children's hospital.</p></speech>

There was no cover letter and he told absolutely nobody.  He sent the document, breaching the confidence of those participants in the contract, to a friend.  He said that there was no material benefit involved, but of course there was; knowledge is power.  When an individual gives confidential information to someone, it increases his or her influence with that individual or group.  In addition, Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail's organisation was a competitor to the IMO which actively sought to take members from the IMO.  There was absolutely material benefit to be achieved by different organisations.</p>  <p>  I asked the T&aacute;naiste a question.  What was his motivation, at that time, for doing this in secret?  Why did he do so?  I am not asking whether he would do differently on another occasion.  Why, on the occasion about which we are now talking, did he do this in secret?</p></speech>

I wanted to keep it confidential.  We had an informal communications channel.

This is a very serious issue.  The reason it is so serious and important is that if the very head of a government is involved in actions of this kind, it gives license to everybody else in government to act in the same way.  It gives license to everybody else, at all levels of the public service and the Civil Service, to act in this way.  It is critical that the Taoiseach leads from the top.  The truth of the matter is that if this action goes uncensured by this Chamber, by the T&aacute;naiste's party, and by his colleagues in government, there will be license to deliver in this manner in future.</p>  <p>  With regard to Fianna F&aacute;il's involvement in this, many will feel that the T&aacute;naiste and the former Minister for Health have kicked the political shins of Fianna F&aacute;il in this Government for a long time.  They will be surprised at the manner in which the Taoiseach has ridden to his rescue in this instance.  Many people in Fianna F&aacute;il will see how Ministers and Fine Gael have circled the wagons around him when Deputies Cowen and Calleary were left out in the cold.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Green Party, there comes a tipping point when any small party involved in government has to make a decision as to whether continuing on with an underhanded, deceitful process is best for it and for the country.  There may be a cost to calling it out now but it will be a short-term cost.  If it does not call it out now and allows it to proceed, it will be locked into this type of governance for the coming years.  The cost of that will, in the long term, far outweigh any short-term cost in this regard.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are not involved in this.  It happened in 2019, during the term of the previous Government.  I do not believe they should be held to account for this in any way.  This is something I did and for which I take responsibility.</p></speech>

This contract was worth more than &euro;210 million and I would have thought that Cabinet confidentiality and the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 would have prevented him from sharing confidential documents.  Has the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, made any demands of the T&aacute;naiste in exchange for his continued support and that of his party?</p></speech>

That is not the way we operate.  We are getting to know each other well and are working well together.  I make no demands of him and he makes no demands of me.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Regulation of Lobbying Act, under that Act the person carrying out the lobbying is responsible for registering that activity.  As a Deputy, Deputy Mattie McGrath is lobbied all the time but he has no responsibility to register it.  I imagine he never does or never has.  The responsibility for doing so is on the person carrying out the lobbying.</p></speech>

First, I do not.  Second, the premise of the Deputy's question seems to suggest that in some way I sought the head of Deputy Cowen or Deputy Calleary but I absolutely did not.  The case of Deputy Cowen was handled by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in the way he thought best.  I found out the former Minister, Deputy Calleary, had resigned one morning when I woke up in bed at 8 a.m.  The suggestion I had any role in seeking their resignations is just not correct, if it is going around.  That is absolutely untrue.</p></speech>

Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail used the T&aacute;naiste as a puppet and the T&aacute;naiste did not even know he was being used as a puppet.  The amount of money involved makes one think about the children's hospital, and the T&aacute;naiste's Government signed off on that site.  We might also think about broadband contracts and how Deputy Naughten was forced to resign.  I am very concerned.

He also complimented the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.</p>  <p>  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to bear with me for a moment.  On 15 October, I asked him about a Supreme Court judgment concerning assessments of disability.  He told me that he did not know the question was coming up and that he would come back to me with a full report.  I waited for the report but I got a reply from the HSE indicating that my parliamentary question had gone from the Department of Health to the HSE.  The HSE replied to me on 23 October.  There has been talk of Ministers and friends but I must not be the T&aacute;naiste's friend because he did not reply to me yet.  The HSE replied and told me that after the Supreme Court judgment, the Minister for Finance met the Minister for Health at the time, who told him to discontinue the assessments.  The GPs were never told.  If the GPs were the T&aacute;naiste's friends, they would have heard it from him but they did not.  I have not yet had a reply from him either.</p>  <p>  We are going in circles and such a process, with no responsibility for actions, predates this Government.

It is clear to all of us that the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, the Taoiseach of the country and the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies will bail out the T&aacute;naiste.  He will be saved by Fianna F&aacute;il tonight.  Deputies Cowen and Calleary and the former Commissioner, Phil Hogan, were not saved.  The people of Ireland are wondering how there are different standards for different people.</p>  <p>  Many people would like to know who leaked the story and whether it was the T&aacute;naiste or Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail.  There is no difference now between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  They have been together for the past five years.  They brought in abortion together.  They brought in the Bill championed by Shane Ross.  They closed down Bord na M&oacute;na together.  They are both trying to shoot down Shannon LNG.  They brought in the carbon tax together.</p>  <p>  The GP service in many parts of rural Ireland, including rural Kerry, has a serious problem.  When a doctor retires, it is a serious effort to get a replacement.  Tonight, people cannot visit their GPs and the GPs cannot visit the people who are sick.  I am sad about that and I only wish we could do something positive about it tonight.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael now have no separate identity and are joined at the hip.  They have been in bed together for five years and neither will get out of that bed.  The question is when will they tie the knot because they cannot fool the people for much longer.  They do not have separate identities and they are the same party now in every sense of the word.  It is only a matter of a short space of time before they are one party because they cannot fool the people of this country for much longer.  They are backing each other up day in and day out and they do not have a different notion about anything.  It is clear it will only be a short space of time before the two parties are one.  The question is what they will name themselves.  Will it be Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or a conglomeration?  What kind of baptism will there be?  Their identities are gone.</p>  <p>  It is sad that there are different standards for different people.  Deputies Cowen and Calleary, as well as the former Commissioner, Phil Hogan, got no chance but the T&aacute;naiste will be saved tonight by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Taoiseach of this country.</p>  <p>All I am sorry about is that we are not dealing with the real issues in the area of health, because people are suffering and in pain tonight.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is passing off this saga as if it was some sort of informal contact.  This was a confidential document about a &euro;210 million agreement.  The rules and regulations that the T&aacute;naiste has apparently broken were there for a reason.  One of those reasons was to maintain confidence in the political system.  Is this confidence now broken?  People negotiating should be able to do so without feeling they are being stabbed in the back by the leaking of their positions, which is exactly what the T&aacute;naiste did.</p>  <p>  I believe the actions of the T&aacute;naiste undermine all future negotiations between groups and Government.  This in turn causes major damage to the State.  Whether the T&aacute;naiste gained personally is totally and absolutely irrelevant; it does not actually matter.  Can the T&aacute;naiste be trusted in the future?  I return to a question the T&aacute;naiste was asked earlier.  Is it a practice of the T&aacute;naiste when he is at a meeting, whether that is Cabinet or an agreement like he was dealing with in these negotiations, to be on his phone sending out messages from a meeting divulging the positions of the people negotiating?</p>  <p>  To be honest, I remember a certain time going back to 2016 when the T&aacute;naiste could not be kept off his phone and when people would leave a negotiating table and go outside and we would learn more about what went on during those negotiations then we did from being inside the room.  That is a fact and I do not get pleasure out of saying it.  I believe that is unacceptable.  It is not a way for a Taoiseach, a T&aacute;naiste or a Minister to conduct themselves.  The T&aacute;naiste knows I get no satisfaction whatsoever from what has happened or what is going on here this evening.  I am sorry that we are where we are, but it is the T&aacute;naiste who brought us here.</p></speech>

Some minor changes were made prior to publication, but none that required a return to Cabinet.  It is in the Cabinet memo of 9 April that engagement had concluded with the IMO at that stage.  The figure the Deputy used, regarding the potentially sensitive piece of information in respect of &euro;210 million, was in the press release of 4 April.  In fact, there was a detailed breakdown of the financial aspects of this agreement.  There was &euro;120 million for fees, a 10% increase in pension contributions, and &euro;80 million for chronic disease management.  Down to the last &euro;1 or &euro;2 million was published in the statement on 4 April long before any of this happened and it was all publicly announced.</p>  <p>  Can I be trusted?  I have been a Minister for nearly ten years now.  I have dealt with bus and train disputes and all sorts of potential strikes at the airports as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There were also issues in regard to social welfare offices when I was the Minister for Social Protection.  There were also difficult issues to deal with, such as a nurses strike, for example, when I was the Taoiseach.  I do not think anyone involved in those events would be critical of my performance or behaviour in any way.  This was different, it was a particular set of circumstances and very different to those.</p>  <p>  Regarding my phone, that is not my practice.  The Deputy may not believe that, but at the time of those negotiations I was the Minister for Health and I was keeping in touch with the office.  Those talks went on for 12 to 16 hours a day.  I was the Minister for Health then, I had to keep in touch with the office and that was what I was doing.  I know that during those talks that the Deputy actually took phone calls at the table, which was something I did not do.  I do not believe he was leaking.  I am sure he was just taking calls from his constituents.</p></speech>

However, he did not do that.  Was that because the T&aacute;naiste did not want anyone to know about this, and that is why he did not do it?  Regarding his previous answer, it is only because it is coming up now that he wants to put this on the record.  It is a case of the T&aacute;naiste not wanting anyone to know about it and that is why he did not put it.  Is that right?</p></speech>

If it had been at issue at the time and had I been asked about it, I would have put it on the record.  I would of course have told the truth and given an honest answer to any question had it arisen at the time.  I have heard the term "leak" being used, and I will not dispute anyone who wants to use that term in regard to this issue.  Generally, however, a leak involves putting something into the public domain.  Somebody, for example, gives something to a journalist and that then ends up in a newspaper or on a website.  WikiLeaks, for example, is where things are published publicly.  This was a document I shared on a confidential basis.  It was my judgment as Taoiseach, having made a commitment to the NAGP, that it was appropriate that we would engage with, inform and keep in touch with that group regarding the progress and outcome of talks.  I absolutely accept that the way I went about doing it was not appropriate.</p></speech>

So, only if we can ask the right questions will the T&aacute;naiste answer them and put anything on the record.  That is basically what he is saying.</p></speech>

He said that if he had been asked about this issue he would have put it on the record.  That shows, therefore, the way he feels about it.  Earlier, the T&aacute;naiste said there was no personal gain for him in this, and I accept that there probably was not any personal gain for him.  In reality, however, this leak took place a month before the local elections and the elections to the European Parliament, which was the first challenge the T&aacute;naiste faced as the Fine Gael leader.  There was motivation, therefore, to stop the NAGP campaigning and canvassing against Fine Gael candidates around the country.  Would that have been enough motivation for the T&aacute;naiste to do this?</p></speech>

When one is in government, a long list of people threaten to campaign against you.  I guarantee the Deputy that.  There is a very long list of people.  If there is a live issue about which people feel passionate, national or local, one meets groups which will say that if they do not get their way and if what they want is not done, they will campaign against the Government.  Sometimes they even put up candidates, and that is just was part of the experience.  I hope that Deputy Pringle will have the opportunity to serve in government some time and he will come to understand that.  Everyone who has served in government knows that we are constantly being threatened by people who say that if X or Y demand is not delivered upon, then they will campaign against the Government or possibly even run candidates against the Government.  Sometimes they do.</p>  <p>  How does one deal with that?  It is dealt with by addressing the underlying issue, the reason for the grievance.  Many GPs had a grievance with us, not just in the NAGP but also in the IMO.  What did we do about that?  We tried to deal with the underlying problem, which was to come to a deal to reverse the FEMPI cuts and make general practice viable again.  More importantly, however, was trying to ensure we had a chronic disease programme.  That included an extra &euro;80 million to ensure that those with chronic diseases could be treated better in the community, instead of having to go to hospital.  That is what all this was about.  This was something I really wanted to get done and I used my office as Taoiseach and my personal contacts to try to get it done.  That is where my judgment slipped.</p></speech>

In reality, in 2019, Fine Gael got 20 extra councillors in the local elections and one extra MEP in the European elections.</p> <p>What the T&aacute;naiste did actually paid off and the NAGP did not campaign against him.  To my mind, that is where the pay off came.  I believe it is no coincidence that these leaks happened in April and the local elections happened in May.  To me, it is no coincidence.</p></speech>

With regard to gaining an additional 20 council seats, people look at their local councillor and that is one of the reasons they vote the way they do, or they vote based on their attitude towards the Government in general, not based on a GP contract.  I really do not think, quite frankly, that this is material to those elections.  I really do not.</p></speech>

Let me put this into context for him.  When all this was happening and the T&aacute;naiste was leaking a confidential document to an organisation for GPs that did not come within the framework under which the T&aacute;naiste was negotiating in private, the homeless figures passed 10,000 in Ireland for the first time in February 2019 and continued to rise, Social Justice Ireland had reported that one in six, or 760,000, people lived in Ireland with an income below the poverty line and so on, and with the help of children we were on the streets desperately forcing the Government to declare a climate emergency.  That was the background.  The T&aacute;naiste takes a hands-on approach.  I welcome his apology and his acknowledgement but I have asked the T&aacute;naiste when he learnt about that.  He said that he did not think about it and therefore he did not learn about it.  Then there was<i>Village</i>magazine.  I have serious questions on how a whistleblower is telling all he knows now, but I only have a few minutes and will not go into it.  There is certainly a context there.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste when did he learn.  He clearly did not think about it until <i>Village</i>magazine rang him or contacted his office, presumably in relation to what it was going to print.  Did I understand the T&aacute;naiste to say he did not reply to that?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste said, "Rivalry between the organisations was often bitter, and it made agreement harder to achieve and held back progress."  The T&aacute;naiste then went to the rival organisation that was not provided for under the framework and he gave it a confidential document.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think that was right?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has described it as "rivalry", which I read out.  The T&aacute;naiste knew that at the time and then gave it a confidential document.  The T&aacute;naiste has gone to great pains to say that a lot of it was in the public domain.  That is not accurate because the T&aacute;naiste's friend at the time and his friends, the chairperson of the organisation and the CEO, were texting each other at the end of April, or certainly very late in April, that they could not hold onto membership because they did not have the details of the contract.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

That is what we are being informed, when we read emails.  Can the T&aacute;naiste imagine we are now in a situation like this where we have to question the T&aacute;naiste on emails, some of which are absolutely deplorable.  A doctor is asking a business person if they would like to get involved in direct provision.  Of course, we know the then Taoiseach's views on that at the time.  They were deplorable texts.  The T&aacute;naiste has seen them because we have all seen them and they have been published.  I do not expect the T&aacute;naiste to answer any of that but this is the context of how this has come out.  These friends told each other they had to keep this confidential because otherwise they would know where it came from.

I can be accountable for my actions, my messages and what I say, but I cannot be accountable for other people.</p>  <p>  The Deputy was right to say they were rival organisations but that is not the full context.

I have heard the T&aacute;naiste say that and he does not need to keep repeating it.  I am more concerned with the T&aacute;naiste's informal way of doing things and looking after his friends.  He must accept that to any person looking on that it is insiders and outsiders.  Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail was an insider with the T&aacute;naiste.  To put that in context, the T&aacute;naiste actually said in relation to golfgate in Clifden that one has to lead by example.  Various members of the Fine Gael Party resigned their positions because what they did and their error of judgement was so serious, and so as to lead by example.  Did the T&aacute;naiste lead by example here?</p><p>I will go back to the planning matter where the T&aacute;naiste phoned the county council and which was covered in <i>Time</i>magazine.  Trump did not want a wind farm or a windmill going up.  The T&aacute;naiste said he endeavoured to do what he could do about it.  He said he rang the county council and inquired about the planning permission and that it was subsequently declined.  It was very good of the T&aacute;naiste to say that it probably had nothing to do with him but he got the praise for it and so on.  In relation to Trump, who was not President at the time, the T&aacute;naiste said, &ldquo;In many ways, I actually like that approach because you know traditional civil service and diplomatic approaches can be all about hierarchies, and sometimes the principals just need to talk and sort it out.&rdquo;  The principals at that stage being the T&aacute;naiste, then the Minister, and Mr. Trump, before he was President.  That is the informal way the T&aacute;naiste did business.  I am running out of time for the T&aacute;naiste to give me an answer, but I am telling the House that this is the way he continues to do it.  There was certainly a political gain because he bought off the threatened massive political campaign by that organisation, of which Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail was a member, and who threatened to put posters everywhere and to go to all candidates and GPs, but T&aacute;naiste bought it off.</p></speech>

The reason we concluded that agreement with the IMO not the NAGP, at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;210 million, was because we wanted to.  We thought it was the right thing to restore funding to general practice to reverse FEMPI, to make it viable again, to stop the haemorrhage of young doctors from our country, and especially to bring in a chromic disease management programme at a cost of &euro;80 million.  That is why we did it.  It was the right thing to do.  It was not about buying off any campaign, not at all.</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with having lunch or a coffee with anyone, but for the record I did not.  On the date he referenced, 12 April, I was at an East Coast FM charity event right throughout my constituency and many hundreds of my constituents would have seen exactly where I was that day.</p> <p>I want to clarify that for the record of the House.  Second, on the message I received, I afforded someone the courtesy of a response to that message but I think it is very clear that I did not take further action as regards providing the contract.

Members may gather already that we are dealing with quite a technical issue.  In October 2019, the draft Data Protection Act 2018 (section 60(6))(Central Bank of Ireland) Regulations 2019, SI 537 of 2019, known as the 2019 regulations, were agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, due to the incorrect formatting of the agreed text at printing stage, regulations 3, 7(1) and 7(2) were formatted and indented incorrectly.  The incorrect indentation change in respect of the Roman numerals below regulation 3(c) meant that the qualification set out in the Roman numerals applied only to subparagraph (c) and not to subparagraphs (a) and (b).</p><p>I will conclude soon.  I have a long script but, essentially, there was an error at the printing stage only and everything came through this House before that.  The regulation was agreed by the Central Bank, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Department of Finance after full consultation, was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and was signed by the Minister.  Everything was correct, but when it came off the printing press, there was a mistake in the indentation of three of the subparagraphs which meant it may have been possible to come to a different legal interpretation of those paragraphs because of the way the regulation was printed, not because of how it was when passed by the House and signed by the Minister.  In simple English, it is necessary to seek a motion through the House to correct this mistake because the regulation relates to data protection.  Normally, when there are errors in a statutory instrument, a Minister would have the authority to re-sign it, but because of the data protection issue, it is necessary to bring it back to the House to correct what is essentially a printing error.</p><p>This came to our attention early this year.  The Department of Finance got legal advice and felt it was necessary to clarify the regulation and redo the statutory instrument.  That involved a full consultation between the Central Bank, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Department of Finance.  All of that has been done and a motion is now required in the House to approve the regulation.</p><p>We have checked if any adverse effects might have occurred due to the error in the printing since the original statutory instrument was signed, and the Department of Finance has absolutely confirmed with the Central Bank, whose data protection regulation this relates to, that in no case was there any untoward or unforeseen circumstances as a result of the printing error.  People would have relied on the printed document, which was not quite the version that passed through the House.  I will conclude a very long technical speech by giving it to Members in straightforward English.  We are here to correct a printing error.  We have redone the entire process and we are back here seeking the approval of the House.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Act 2018 (Central Bank of Ireland) Regulations 2019 were introduced to permit the rights of data subjects under Articles 12 through 22 and 34 and controllers' obligations under Article 5 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to be restricted to the extent necessary and proportionate to allow the Central Bank to perform certain functions.  The motion before us today does nothing to change the substance of these regulations whatsoever.  In fact, it does nothing more than correct an indentation error which was made in the printing process of the regulations which came into effect in October of last year.</p>  <p>  The regulations themselves apply to personal data, in respect of which the Central Bank is a controller and which are processed by the Central Bank, in pursuit of what is defined as a "relevant objective" and pursued by the Central Bank in carrying out a "relevant function".  This is defined as an important objective of general public interest, as referred to in the Data Protection Act 2018.  These relevant objectives include avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry, investigating or prosecuting breaches of ethics for regulated professions, and taking any action for the purposes of investigating a complaint made to a regulatory body.  Under the regulations, the restriction of data subjects' rights or controllers' obligations must be necessary and proportionate.  As we all know, the restriction of data is a serious issue which must be justified and justifiable.  Are these regulations, which permit the restriction of data access in prescribed circumstances, monitored to ensure the restriction is both necessary and proportionate?</p>  <p>  The regulations also provide that where data subjects' rights or controllers' obligations are restricted, the Central Bank must notify them in writing, except in very limited circumstances.  It also gives the data subject the right to submit a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner.  Will the Minister of State provide an update on the number of such complaints lodged with the Data Protection Commissioner since these regulations came into force last year?</p>  <p>  The motion before us today is not one of substance but rather a technicality.  It is a formatting issue.  Having spoken to the Central Bank policy unit in the Department of Finance, I understand that there was an indentation in regulations 3 and 7 of the regulations published last year.  The effect of the indentation is quite significant.  For example, due to the indentation error, financial services legislation would not relate to the operation of the Central Credit Register.  This is the error which the regulations before us today seek to address, specifically by reformatting regulations 3 and 7.  I see no issue with these changes but I have some questions for the Minister of State.  Has the Central Bank, as a result of this indentation error, restricted data subjects' rights in a way that is in contravention of the regulations published last year?  As a consequence, could the Central Bank be open to legal challenge?</p>  <p>  While I have the opportunity to speak about issues relating to the Central Bank, I also raise the second private motor insurance report, published as part of the national claims information database.  Its findings are clear and lay bare the price-gouging activities of the insurance industry.  Since 2009, insurance premiums have risen by 35%, despite the cost of claims falling by 9% and the number of claims made falling by 45%.  Today's report confirms what we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been saying for some time.  Premium costs for consumers have gone up while the cost of claims for insurance companies has fallen.  Last year alone, the insurance industry recorded profits of &euro;142 million.  The Government has failed to rein in the industry and consumers cannot afford inaction any longer.</p> <p>In the next months, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, will introduce legislation to ban the practice of dual pricing by the industry.  What will the Minister of State do about this?</p></speech>

The Minister of State is welcome this evening and, on behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome this move.  I thank the Minister of State's officials for the briefing afforded to my colleague and I on the matter yesterday.  We understand that these measures are required, and certain identified restrictions on GDPR rights may be imposed with the approval of these Houses to safeguard important Central Bank-related objectives of public interest.</p>  <p>  The draft regulations cannot and should not impose blanket restrictions.  That would be problematic and go against the letter, intention and spirit of laws about the right of access to information.  Any approach to the issues at hand today has to be proportionate.  That is a word that peppers much of the commentary about these kinds of issues.  When deciding on restrictions of this nature, account must be taken of the extent to which the exercise of the right or compliance with the obligation would prejudice the achievement by the bank of a relevant objective, the essence of the right to data protection of the data subject and the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subject which might result from such a restriction.  I note that data subjects in the context of these regulations more generally are to be notified of restrictions arising from this and of their right to complain to the Data Protection Commissioner in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.  It is important that data subjects know where they stand.  Their rights and entitlements in this complex area must be made crystal clear and obvious to them at all times.</p>  <p>  I am by no means an expert on data law or data matters but I believe, from the advice I have received, that the right balance has been struck and that once used responsibly and proportionately, these measures can serve as another important protection for the State and the taxpayer against the scourge of white-collar crime.  We have seen, on too many occasions over the years, many cases where powerful individuals take refuge behind such instruments as the recent GDPR to delay and deny the course of justice.  We must guard against that.  These particular restrictions are balanced and proportionate, and we are happy to support the Minister of State's approach and proposition this evening.</p></speech>

I understand the complexity here is that the Minister of State has to come back before the House for its approval before the statutory instrument can be enacted.  It would be useful if the same mechanism could be used regarding some of the Covid-19 regulations, some of which have contradicted themselves and the comments and information on the Government's own websites.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the responsibility of the Central Bank with regard to this matter.  The briefing note provided to us assures us that this is about getting the right balance between the protection of consumers and accessing the information from the banks.  My difficulty is that I believe there is a fundamental bias within the Central Bank.  That fundamental bias is inherent in every interpretation by the bank on regulating and policing commercial banks in this country.  While the Central Bank has a responsibility to protect the rights of consumers, its primary focus is on the stability of the financial system.  It is important that we protect the stability of the financial system but the difficulty is that, at times, a call has to be made between the stability of the banks and protecting the rights of consumers.  Unfortunately, when push comes to shove, the banks win out.  I believe that this has to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Up until the last decade, the consumer regulatory arm for financial services was separate to the Central Bank.  They were amalgamated a number of years ago and I believe they need to be separated again.  The assurances that the Minister of State will provide are undermined by having the consumer protection and banking regulatory aspects within the same organisation.  The regulator, which is the Central Bank, stated in March of this year, before Covid-19 broke out, that the banks still lacked a consumer-focused culture.  I believe that the culture is lacking not just within the banks, but within the Central Bank itself.</p>  <p>  On 8 July, I outlined to the Minister for Finance an example of where consumers are being ignored by the Central Bank.  I pointed out to him that a family with a mortgage of &euro;300,000 that took a six-month break as a result of Covid-19 would face an interest bill of &euro;4,300.  The commercial banks were telling that particular family, which was struggling as a result of Covid-19, that they had no other choice but to continue to apply the interest rate to their mortgage, when the European Central Bank had said the opposite in that regard.  The Central Bank here was behind in enforcing that.</p>  <p>  We have seen the same with the headlines this morning with regard to motor insurers making profits of &euro;142 million last year despite the fall in costs of settling claims.  Premiums are going up but so are the profits of the insurance industry.  We saw the same thing with the tracker mortgage, where the banks have effectively given the two fingers to the regulator.  I fundamentally believe that we must separate the consumer protection aspect from the Central Bank and have it with a separate authority, whatever that authority is, so that the Central Bank is not making a judgment call about whether it supports and shores up the banks or protects consumers, because that should be a primary focus of the regulator.</p></speech>

To provide some information, since the 2019 regulations were made, the Central Bank has received 28 subject rights requests.  The regulations were applied in five of these responses.  In only one case were the regulations invoked to withhold the entirety of the data request.  This was a focused request for three or four specific documents and after a robust evaluation of these few documents, the bank was satisfied that the decision to withhold these data would not result in any disproportionate detriment to the individual concerned.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a defined evaluation process for dealing with all cases where the regulations are invoked.  These processes ensure that the necessity and proportionality requirements are robustly applied.  The process also includes engagement with the Central Bank's data protection officer.  To date, no complaints have been submitted through the Central Bank, nor is the bank aware of any complaints submitted to the Data Protection Commissioner about these regulations since they were originally passed.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for taking the time to address this motion.  The issue of motor insurance was mentioned.  It is a topic that I will be happy to discuss separately.  I concur with Deputies about the profit level in the area.  We will come back to that.  The Government has a clear action plan for dealing with insurance.  Today's report was on private motor insurance.  I understand Deputy Naughten's remarks about the rights of customers.</p> <p>However, the most important right of a customer is that the Central Bank ensures the financial stability of the bank.  It is all well and good to have rights, but if the bank has gone bust one has no rights.  The first function of the Central Bank is to regulate and protect the stability of the banks.  That is the main thing customers want; they do not want to lose their money.  I accept the point that there is an issue regarding the same institution having a role in consumer protection.</p></speech>

These draft regulations allow the Central Bank to use that exemption.  Most importantly, they also contain safeguards to ensure the banks apply the restrictions only where necessary and proportionate to the need to safeguard specified important objectives of the general public interest pursued by the Central Bank.  This has been accepted by all sides of the House.  They also provide that the individual has a right of complaint to the Data Protection Commission.  Section 6(5)(a) of the Act provides that regulations may be made only if a draft of the proposed regulations is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I ask the D&aacute;il to approve this today, and I thank the Deputies for their time.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by a number of pharmacies and GPs and they say that demand has certainly exceeded supply.  I discussed this issue with the Minister personally in recent days.  It is important, and I take this opportunity to encourage people to get the vaccine if they can, especially for children.  However, there is a concern that we do not have enough vaccines to meet the demand.  Can the Minister outline exactly how many doses were ordered for both adults and children?  Is it the case that, this year, there is more demand than supply?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300042#RR01100"><p>I acknowledge the Deputy's and his party's support in encouraging people to take up the vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  The expanded flu vaccination campaign is a substantial advance on the campaigns of previous years.  Some 1.95 million doses of vaccine, about twice as much as was administered last year, have been made available for those in at-risk groups and children aged from two to 12 years old.  The total amount includes 600,000 doses of the vaccine delivered via nasal drops to children aged from two to 12 years old.  This is the first time this vaccine, which is easier to administer, has been made available to children in Ireland.  It is also the first year that children in this age group, who represent a risk group in their own right, have had access to vaccination without charge, which is welcome.</p>  <p>  Some 1.35 million doses of the injected vaccine are being made available for those in the HSE-defined at-risk groups, including healthcare workers.  For comparison purposes, just under 1 million doses - 950,000 - were administered last winter.  Notwithstanding the large increase in available vaccine this year, it is likely that the full supply will be used.  This will represent an increase of 35% in uptake in the adult population over last year.  This is expected to increase the population health benefit from the vaccination campaign, as well as help to reduce the pressure on the health service, particularly when combined with the uptake among children.</p>  <p>  Deliveries of the vaccine from the manufacturer have not been as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines and given the global context of Covid-19.  However, I can confirm that the HSE has now received all 1.35 million doses.  A total of 950,000 have already been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination locations and the remaining 400,000 doses are being distributed for use.  The introduction of an effective and safe vaccine against Covid-19 will assist in curbing the pandemic&rsquo;s spread and may facilitate the return of normal social and economic activity.</p></speech>

Some 950,000 doses were available last year for adults and it is 1.35 million this year.  However, the anecdotal evidence, and the Minister has just confirmed that it is not only anecdotal but a fact, is that we simply will not have enough for those who need it.  I read the ministerial brief in detail and it referred to a very ambitious programme this year and ensuring, insofar as possible, we have a general roll-out of this vaccine in the population.  I imagine it was hoped that whatever number of people wanted the vaccine would get it.  What was the target and ambition?  How is it that we are left in a situation in which, unfortunately, there will not be enough for those who need it?  Is it possible to order more now?  We are hearing there is a worldwide shortage.  Is there a process ongoing in which the Minister and the Government are trying to get more doses of this vaccine to meet demand?</p></speech>

I believe the orders for this winter were made in January or February.  The HSE took a new approach.  It identified the at-risk groups, and it was calculated that totalled 1.35 million people.  Children aged from two to 12 years were added to that and the 600,000 doses were procured.  I believe, and the figures confirm, that there is very high demand, which is positive.  It appears that almost all 1.95 million doses will be administered.  As to whether there will be enough vaccine for those in the at-risk groups, the demand for the vaccine remains strong and the vaccine is being distributed.  As a consequence, however, for the next round of distribution, which is the 400,000, GPs and pharmacists are being asked that priority be given among the remaining patients in the at-risk group to those over 65 years old and healthcare workers with direct patient contact.</p></speech>

Of course, those who are at risk should be protected.  I wish to make a final point about vaccines and it relates to the possibility of a vaccine for Covid-19.  My party supports the Right to Cure campaign, an EU-wide campaign that calls for all treatments, therapies and vaccines related to Covid-19 to be universally and freely available.  Can the Minister inform the House what orders have been made for any of the trial Covid vaccines?  How will they be rolled out and will we have sufficient stock, given that there will be worldwide demand, to ensure we can vaccinate people as much as possible against Covid-19?  There is no vaccine at present.  The Taoiseach has talked up the possibility of it being available in early 2021, and the T&aacute;naiste spoke about it being a possibility before the end of this year.  If and when one becomes available, what preparations has the State put in place to ensure there is free and universal access?</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy has seen that we are involved with the WHO and the Gavi global response, which is in a spirit with which the Deputy would agree.  It has a global justice view to make sure that the vaccine is distributed globally.</p>  <p>  The arrangements are intended to ensure co-ordinated action at European level to vaccinate the EU population.  As part of the exercise, Ireland has already opted into two advance purchase agreements with the British-Swedish drug maker AstraZenica, which is partnering with the University of Oxford and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.  Ireland will also be opting into another agreement reached by the Commission with Sanofi Pasteur, but is not required to do so formally until late December or early January.  The short answer is that there are three so far and, in line with the Commission, we are keeping that under careful watch.</p></speech>

On 26 October the Minister said he would postpone the tribunal when he met the 221+ group on Zoom.  However, it was commenced the following day.  The Minister signed the order on 23 October.  Vicky Phelan, has announced, unfortunately, that her cancer is back.</p> <p>Lorraine, Stephen and all the members of the 221+ group are watching the Minister tonight for his answer.  The Minister thinks he has more time than he has.  We need all of these issues to be solved.  They are very solvable.  I presented some of the solutions myself.  I urge the Minister, please, to give them confidence that these issues will be resolved this week.</p></reply>

Both Deputy Kelly and I voted for the Act to set that up, and we debated some of the various parts of it in this House.  The establishment was delayed due to Covid and then a further delay arose, as Deputy Kelly is aware, due to issues concerning membership when two of the judges were called on to do other jobs.  The 221+ group has consistently raised its concerns over the delay in establishing the tribunal and its members have stressed to me the importance of establishing it without further delay.  The group wrote to me in July, very shortly after I was <i>in situ</i>to ask that the tribunal would be set up immediately and with no further delay.  In September, the group sought confirmation of an imminent start date.  I have always made clear that I accepted the urgency of setting up the tribunal and my focus has been on its establishment as soon as possible.  In July, I announced two new tribunal members and I also progressed work to make the tribunal facilities as safe as possible, or as Covid-proofed as possible, in the current environment.</p><p>There has been very in-depth and ongoing interaction between the 221+ group, me and the Department.  The group has raised a number of concerns in respect of the tribunal, and progress was made in addressing these at our meeting at the beginning of September.  I committed to consulting the Attorney General on some of these issues and to responding to the group before the establishment of the tribunal.  I wrote to the group on 20 October, with the benefit of the Attorney General's advice, and informed the group of my intention to proceed with the tribunal's establishment on 27 October.</p><p>To effect the establishment of the tribunal, a number of steps were then taken, including the signing of the establishment orders, as Deputy Kelly referenced.  I met with the group on 23 October and 26 October and further progress was made on its concerns.  The most substantive of the concerns is one Deputy Kelly and I debated with the then Minister in this House and related to recurrence.  I believe Deputy Kelly tabled an amendment at that time.  The second concern, which Deputy Kelly and I discussed previously, was in respect of the Supreme Court judgement in the Morrissey case.  I have more to say, which I might come back to in the next response.</p></speech>

Second, he did meet with the group, but he did not take on board what was said.  Two months passed, and he did not take on board what was said.  He just commenced the tribunal without addressing the main issues.  One or two of the smaller issues have been addressed since.</p>  <p>  I do not know why the Minister made a commitment on 26 October, having signed an order on 23 October, without rescinding it, for the tribunal to commence on 27 October.  The Minister's excuse here is just not believable.  It just does not help for a Minister to sign an order on the 23rd for the tribunal to commence on the 27th but to meet a group and tell it on the 26th that it was being postponed.</p>  <p>  The Minister knows the main issues.  They relate to the State Claims Agency joining as defendants and the Statute of Limitations.  The most significant issue that the 221+ group wants sorted is the provision whereby a woman can return to the tribunal if she suffers a recurrence of cancer.  They are the three outstanding issues.  They have always been the three outstanding issues.  I have discussed them with the Minister.  There are solutions.  I have even produced a Bill and sent it to the Minister, which, amazingly, his private secretary asked me for again last week even though I had sent it to her with a briefing note.  When, this week, will the Minister give the assurances the 221+ group needs?  Otherwise, the members of the group are going to ask publicly that people do not engage with the tribunal.  The Minister and I do not want that.</p></speech>

He will not solve this issue with that attitude.  He got a letter today explaining to him why that will not work.  He obviously has not read it, or else he is choosing to ignore it.  He is being quite ignorant on these issues.  At this stage I have gone in-depth on all these issues for many years, specifically in relation to the tribunal.  I know exactly what is needed.  I have even supplied legislation to the Minister in regard to it, which he has ignored.  I do not mind if he even takes the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill on board, amends it and uses it as Government legislation.  It does not bother me, but it sorts out the issue that we know we have to sort out regarding the re-occurrence of cancer for these women.</p>  <p>  The Minister has very little time.  I do not think he gets that.  Vicky Phelan is watching this now as we speak.  She has put her heart and soul into solving these issues in recent months.  It is one of the last things she wants done.  I urge the Minister, please, to honour that.  There are comprehensive solutions here regarding the three issues that I believe everyone in this House would support.  The Minister should just do it.  He should not adopt an attitude like that.  It is not appreciated and it will not work, with me or with them.</p></speech>

The answer may be a bit long but I will supply the Deputy with the full text if we do not get through it.</p>  <p>  On the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, the HSE developed the capacity to conduct 100,000 tests per week.  I subsequently met the HSE and requested that it look at increasing the capacity.  This is now in place and the HSE currently has standing capacity to test 120,000 people every week and progress is being made on looking at going higher than that should we need it.  The testing and tracing regime compares very favourably internationally in terms of tests per size of population.  Ireland ranks eighth highest out of 24 EU countries and the UK in terms of the number of tests being completed at the moment.</p> <p>The median time it takes from a swab being taken to the communication of a laboratory result is now 29 hours in community testing, 28 hours in serial testing and 28 hours in acute settings.  In the week to 27 October, the median time to complete all calls for contact tracing was 1.8 days.<br/><br/>A significant number of staff from other areas of the HSE were deployed to assist in the testing and tracing programme.  The HSE is now moving these professionals back and redeploying them to their front-line posts, which is important.<br/><br/>My focus is on what must be done to minimise the risks of future large increases in positive cases.  One of the really important tools is an effective testing and contact tracing programme.  The HSE is currently running a nationwide recruitment campaign for swabbers and contact tracers.  Some 180 additional swabbers have been appointed to date, while additional candidates are currently going through the process.  Some 500 additional contact tracers are being hired to provide sufficient capacity for contact tracing with 280 already in place and a further 60 to 70 being appointed every week.  By way of comparison, by mid-September, there were 292 people deployed to contact tracing.  By 30 October, this had gone up to 683 people deployed to contact tracing and it is rising.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>At the request of NPHET, HIQA recently undertook a rapid health technology assessment, HTA, on the use of alternatives to laboratory-based real-time RT-PCR to detect cases of current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19 disease.  HIQA&rsquo;s report was published 21 October.  HIQA advised that adoption of alternative approaches to testing requires consideration of factors including clinical performance, sensitivity and specificity, turnaround time, and ease of use.  However, while rapid antigen detection tests have the potential to expand test capacity, reduce test turnaround times and improve access, the antigen tests available or currently in development show lower sensitivity than that observed with the rRT-PCR Test, the current gold standard.<br/><br/>I have asked the HSE to put in place a systematic and robust process for the rollout of a series of clinical validation exercises across a range of targeted settings and population cohorts.  The HSE has established a group to review the antigen tests currently available and how they might be deployed in clinical and non-clinical settings.<br/><br/>The HSE has worked intensively over the past number of months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation.  We will continue to pursue a robust testing strategy.  This will include continuation of my Department&rsquo;s work with the HSE to improve turnaround times, consistency and our end-to-end testing pathway.  This ensures the system is responsive to nature of the current and expected future demand for testing and tracing.  Testing and contact tracing continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic.</p></speech>

On the testing side, we need to increase lab capacity.  We can have more swabbers but if we end up with a bottleneck in the labs to do the testing, then we have a problem.  With regard to tracing, the problem is the system collapsed for a couple of days and more than 1,900 patients, unfortunately, became contact tracers themselves.  When the head of testing and tracing was before the health committee, she said that the metric used to ascertain how many tracers are actually needed in this State showed the figure is 800.  However, on the day she was at the committee, and when we are in the middle of a second wave, she said we only had 581 tracers.</p>  <p>  This proved the point that many of us had been making for some time, namely, that we wasted the summer months by not putting in that capacity.  The temporary collapse of the tracing system was due to lack of capacity and that it became overwhelmed.  The Minister should not waste the next number of weeks in the way the summer was wasted.  He must ensure the numbers are brought up to the levels to which the Government committed.</p></speech>

I do not accept the system collapsed.  I absolutely accept that what happened should not have happened.  Many people were asked to contact their own close contacts.  That is not what we want.  I would not see that as the system collapsing, however.  In some European countries where cases rose, one essentially saw contact tracing stopping.  We did not see it stop, however.  It was a one-off event.</p>  <p>  It now has the capacity to rapidly contact trace up to 1,500 new cases per day.  In the current situation, the highest number was just short of 1,200.  It is falling now thanks to the work of people across the country.</p>  <p>  I absolutely agree with the Deputy.  What needs to happen now, as the numbers come down and when we come out of level 5, is that we must make sure the contact tracing system in place is quick and comprehensive, as well as doing both forward and backward contact tracing for the very reasons the Deputy laid out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.683" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300044#TT00400"><p>Several Members here attended the committee hearing with the head of testing and tracing.  There was much spin beforehand in terms of the public commentary from Ministers and even the press statements from the Government that we would see an additional 800 tracers.  As it turns out, it was to bring us to 800.  We were going to go from 581 to 800.</p>  <p>  We were told by the head of testing and tracing at the committee that the number needed to ensure we had a safe service, according to the metric used, was 800.  At that point, we were in the middle of a second wave with 1,200 cases a day at its height.  We were left only with 581 tracers, however.  How did that happen?  It happened on the Minister's watch because he did not use the summer months to recruit the staff necessary to ensure we had at least sufficient capacity.</p>  <p>  I do not buy it even that 800 would be enough.  The Minister must not leave us exposed again.  When we get the numbers down, we must have a testing and tracing system that we can use to hunt down Covid, to keep ahead of it and that we do not lose control in the way we lost control this time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.684" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300044#TT00500"><p>We will just have to agree to disagree on the system collapsing.  As I said, obviously one does not want people having to contact their own close contacts.  As a one-off event in nine months or so of a global pandemic, I certainly do not believe that constitutes a collapse at all.</p>  <p>  I cannot speak to people saying an additional 800.  I am pretty sure what I have been saying is that it is scaling up to 800.  It will have gone from 231 in mid-September to 800, a significant increase.  What is important now is that the capacity is there to rapidly contact and trace 1,500 cases a day.  We all need to make sure we never get close to 1,500 cases a day.  While we do not know what the future will hold, the cases are certainly coming down now.  The focus for the short term, but, hopefully, for the medium and longer term as well, will be less on having to do the high numbers and more around speed, getting to people, getting to their close contacts, going deep and doing both the backwards and forwards contact tracing.</p></speech>

Since Covid, many of them have been occupied entirely with critical Covid work.  At the same time, they have been treated as the poor relation of medicine.  It is now time to address that and to fund this critical service properly.  Does the Minister accept that?</p></reply>

There are many different things going on.  The first of two of the big ones, of which the Deputy will be aware, is moving the public health doctors to consultant status, which is important.  The Department is currently in preliminary talks with the IMO about how that might work.  I am meeting with public health doctors this Friday.  The second is an expansion of the workforce.  I have sanctioned a doubling of the workforce.  We are working through exactly how that might be deployed.  There are public health doctors, public health nurses, data specialists and scientists.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, is looking for them as well.</p>  <p>  Like the Deputy, I want to pay tribute to our public health doctors.  They have worked incredibly hard.  We have a small number of them but they are doing a huge amount of work in the community with testing and in the national response with the schools.  They have been working damn hard and they are tired.  They most definitely deserve our thanks and respect.  More importantly, they deserve an investment in public health.</p>  <p>  There are currently 72 public health doctors permanently employed as specialists and-or directors in public health medicine in the HSE.  I have committed to the early introduction of a new framework for public health, as provided for in the programme for Government, as well as the establishment of a consultant-led public health model.  Budget 2021 provides for recruitment of up to 250 additional permanent staff.  The HSE is looking at hiring up to 400 temporary staff during the pandemic response.  They will support the public health teams.</p>  <p>  The public health doctors have been advocating for many years for consultant status, which we are moving on.  They have also said they need support staff around them.  They are having to do a huge amount themselves that support staff should be doing.  We are looking to hire and deploy, first on a temporary basis around the pandemic, but also on a permanent basis to support them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300044#TT00800"><p>That all sounds fine.  The reality, however, is that the discussions with the Department have not been successful.  The Minister is talking about a framework which is all fine.  We need commitments on this, however.  Ireland is an outlier.  There are 72 public health doctors who are specialists.  They have the same qualifications as all other consultants and yet they are the only specialty that does not have consultant grade.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister give a commitment tonight that those 72 specialists, with all the qualifications to become consultants, will be upgraded to consultant level?  Will he agree that this is part of his plan?  It is critical, as well as introducing the additional support staff but also other doctors and consultants.</p>  <p>  We are an outlier also in terms of having such a low number of public health doctors, 72.  The number is double or nearly treble that in other countries of comparable size such as Scotland or New Zealand.  Will the Minister give that commitment tonight?</p> <p>I thank the Deputy.  I share her views.  The 72 doctors she has mentioned include 15 public health specialists and 17 directors of public health, who obviously have wider remits.  The public health doctors we have on the ground are even more stretched.</p></speech>

Discussions are ongoing between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  With the greatest respect, I cannot get into the detail of those negotiations because they are ongoing.  As the Deputy noted, various statements have been made.  The public health doctors are considering a ballot, which I fully appreciate is their right.  However, given the situation I am not in a position to get into details that are being worked out through these conversations in the House.  I am sorry about that.  It would not be fair to the IMO or to the process that is taking place.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept that these 72 doctors, who are specialists with full consultant qualifications, should be upgraded to a consultant grade?  That is a straightforward question.  Is there any justification for continuing to treat them less favourably than their colleagues in all other specialties?  Is it not an absolutely shocking comment on the very valuable work of public health doctors to tell them that the Government is not prepared to upgrade them to the level of their colleagues in other specialties?  There is no justification for not doing that.  There have been umpteen reports recommending that since 2002.  This is the way to deal with the issue.  Let us not get to a point where industrial action is threatened and possibly taken by public health consultants in the midst of a pandemic while the Minister is making up his mind on whether to do the right thing by these doctors.  Will the Minister make that commitment and agree to provide the additional posts and support staff?  It is the least those doctors can expect.</p></speech>

I can commit to a doubling of the public health workforce in consultation with the public health doctors, and to the creation of the public health consultant contract.  The Deputy is quite right.  This is something they have been seeking for decades.  There is a process under way between the Department and the IMO.  For me to make the definitive statements the Deputy is looking for would not be respectful of the process which the doctors' representative group is going through with the Department.  With respect, I will leave it to the IMO, the Department and the Government to continue those conversations.  I want to see those doctors respected and recognised as specialists.  I want to see consultant-level contracts established for public health doctors as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I recognise the importance of student nurses and midwives completing their essential clinical placements in a safe environment.  I also recognise the potential hardship that might arise due to Covid-19 for students on placement, such as maintaining part-time employment, increased travel and additional accommodation costs.</p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives are not paid for clinical placements in the first three years of their studies and this supernumerary status is critical for learning in complex environments.  Financial supports for non-intern student nurses and midwives are governed by circular 9/2004, which provides an accommodation allowance of up to &euro;50.79 per week, to be paid where it is necessary for a student to obtain accommodation away from their normal place of residence, and a refund of travel expenses.  Both are paid as refunds on production of receipts.</p>  <p>  In the immediate term my Department is reviewing the current accommodation and travel allowances that apply to this year's first, second and third year students on clinical placements, taking into account the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on such placements.  The revision is expected to conclude shortly and I look forward to bringing proposals forward thereafter.</p>  <p>  Regarding fourth year nursing and midwifery students, the HSE continues to fund the internship employment of these students who are on rostered work placements.  It is very important to me that the training element is protected for students.  This includes those scheduled to commence in the coming weeks and those due to commence rostered work placements in 2021.  These fourth year student nurses and midwives on rostered work placements are paid at the approved rate, that is, &euro;22,229 on an annual basis for psychiatric nursing specialism and &euro;21,749 for all other nursing disciplines.</p></speech>

It is simply not good enough.  In the early stages of the pandemic, many of those student nurses were getting a rate equivalent to that of a health care assistant, HCA.  That was discontinued.  The Minister must reinstate that rate.  He needs to deal with this very urgently.  As I said, these people are doing a first-class job on the front line.  They should be rewarded and respected and they should get paid for it.</p>  <p>  I also wish to ask the Minister about a separate issue to do with a previous negotiation between the State and the IMO.  I refer to the IMO contract which was the subject of discussion earlier this evening.  When he spoke in the D&aacute;il on 16 April 2019, he made it very clear that it was his understanding that the document which we have been told was agreed was not widely known or shared with GPs.  Is that the Minister's position?  Can he also confirm to the House that the Department of Health will make all communications between the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, the HSE and the Department between April and May 2019 available to Deputies who seek it?  We have sought it and we have not yet got it.</p></speech>

I fully agree that nursing students need support.  He refers to the HCA wage which was paid during the first wave of the pandemic.  The Deputy should bear in mind that when that happened the student nurses were essentially asked to move from education to work.  They were working full-time.  They stepped up when they were needed and did a fantastic job in a crisis.  They were paid the HCA wage.  That meant they were working as HCAs and their line managers in the hospitals deployed them as HCAs.  It is very important to remember that these are educational training placements.  We do not want these students working as HCAs.  That is not the point.  These educational placements are a really important aspect of the nursing degree which was set up in 2004.  I want to make very clear that they are fundamentally different.  We are not asking the nurses to work as HCAs.  We are asking them to do their educational training placements.  We are looking at the current stipend and considering what can be done in the short term, in the context of Covid-19.</p></speech>

Covid-19 has greatly increased pressures on the health service and staff have shown incredible strength and care in their duties.  Several initiatives were undertaken to staff the necessary expansion of the workforce and these have facilitated an expansion of 4,292 whole-time equivalents from the end of February to the end of September of this year.  </p>  <p>  While this increase was necessary to deal with the pandemic immediately, a larger and more permanent expansion of the workforce is necessary and is under way.  This expansion will support the resilience of the services but also ensure our healthcare system is resourced to meet the longer-term healthcare needs of the population.</p> <p>Shortages exist across disciplines, including at consultant, nursing, midwifery and allied health professional levels.</p> <p> Budget 2021 has provided funding for up to 15,738 additional posts in the HSE, above what was funded for 2020.  That is inclusive of the posts identified in the winter plan.  The funding will provide for a permanent increase in the size of the public health workforce, with a focus on front-line staff.  The Government is committed to the ongoing roll-out of the framework on safe staffing and skill mix for nursing by the HSE in hospitals and has committed to further funding for the initiative in 2021.  Specific increases in supports for general practitioners in rural practices and practices in urban areas of deprivation will help make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors.</p> <p> This level of recruitment is ambitious, as Deputy Kelly pointed out to me previously in the Chamber, and there will be challenges faced by the HSE.  Irish graduates are attractive in the global market.  They are very well trained and highly sought after.  The HSE is working to develop a recruitment plan that will ensure the Irish public health service is recognised as one of the places in which people wish to work.  However, there are always challenges in recruitment.  I am committed to supporting the HSE to find solutions to these challenges and to ensure our health service is adequately staffed to manage the pressures we will face in the coming months and years.</p></speech>

Is he satisfied that progress to date is sufficient to reassure him that there will be adequate resources available to his Department to meet future challenges, including the normal challenges as well as the Covid challenges?  Is he satisfied that the recruitments sought already have been taken up by the HSE to the extent necessary?</p></speech>

That would hold true even if one stripped out the Covid funding.  What we are funding next year is very ambitious.  We are funding the biggest increase in acute beds, ICU beds, community beds and workforce in a single year.  I think we are pushing the limits of implementation, to be honest.  We have sufficient resources in terms of funding in the budget.  The real challenge now is that I, the Government, the Department of Health and the HSE work together on implementation.  What has been laid out in the budget is very ambitious but, given the waiting lists and the needs of patients, we must be ambitious and try to push the implementation as far as we can.  Step 1 was the formulation of the plan, much of which was informed by Sl&aacute;intecare.  Step 2 was to get the budget in place and step 3 will be implementation.</p></speech>

I understand there are logistical issues.  Will the Minister assure the House that these offers will be taken up at the earliest possible date?  In the event of there being an inability in the early stages to appoint people to full-time positions, will they be appointed to part-time positions while awaiting approval for the posts in question?  Has the Minister examined the extent to which such a measure could and would augment the staffing levels in the first instance and, second, prepare for any challenges in the future?</p></speech>

I have discussed the matter with the HSE and heard its chief executive explaining on the record that when it moved through all of those steps in the process, it ended up with a far smaller number than all Deputies had hoped for, given the very high number of people who applied.</p>  <p>  On the recruitment process, I do not think the current recruitment process works.  It is too centralised, bureaucratic and slow.  It is probably too expensive as well.  It means that people who are ready, willing and able to take up some of these 16,000 jobs are being asked to jump through too many hoops.  Some of them walk away because they get better offers.  One of the things I wish to do is to work with the HSE to improve and speed up that process while maintaining the quality controls because it is clear that we need a better and more responsive recruitment process.</p></speech>

When it is anticipated that the hospital will open for patients?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.715" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="20:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300046#VV00800"><p>I will give the Deputy the short answer first.  As of now, I am not aware of additional cost overruns, but that is not to say that there will not be any such overruns.  With Covid, it is inevitable there will be some overruns but none have been agreed, arbitrated on and reported to the Department by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB.  In fairness to the NPHDB, Members will remember there were quite significant additional asks by the contractor of which all Members became very aware.  Mr. Fred Barry was asked to go in as chairman of the board.  I apologise for not having the figures to hand.  The board seems to have been very successful in fighting the claims that have been put in.  I am happy to furnish the Deputy with the relevant numbers.  To date, the board has been very successful in those challenges.</p>  <p>  Like many other sectors of society, the construction sector was impacted by Covid.  This resulted in construction-related work on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital stopping on 31 March.  Following the easing of restrictions in May, the NPHDB engaged with the main contractor to ensure the earliest possible reopening of the sites.  The main contractor of the project returned to the site in Tallaght on 29 June and to the main site at St. James's Hospital on 13 July.</p>  <p>  There will be delays associated with Covid, but it is too early to assess fully the impact on the children&rsquo;s hospital project and the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght.  The board continues to engage with the contractor and is monitoring progress on site in the interests of completing the project as quickly and economically as possible.  On that note, I wish to state that I am acutely aware of how urgently the new children&rsquo;s hospital is needed and I wish to see it delivered as quickly as possible on behalf of children, young people and their families.  I have no doubt the Deputy shares that view.</p>  <p>  Under the contract, the children&rsquo;s hospital is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to open in 2023 after commissioning.  I am advised that the NPHDB was of the view in March 2020, when the site closed due to Covid-19, that the main contractor was behind schedule on the construction works.</p></speech>

He expressed a hope that it will be possible to open it in 2023 but stated there was no guarantee of that.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to additional claims.  It is important for him to furnish such information to all Members.  I am looking for his view on any additional claims that arose in 2019 or 2020.  Members are aware that even before Covid struck, claims were being dealt with and there was a dispute between the main contractor and the board.  Covid then came along and delayed the project even further.  The current estimated cost is &euro;2.5 billion.  The cost has repeatedly escalated.  People wish to know what the final price will be and whether the taxpayer will be on the hook for more expense.  I ask the Minister to furnish me with a detailed note on the issue, which would be very beneficial.</p></speech>

I will arrange for that information to be provided to the Deputy.</p><p>On the issue of timing, the board is continuing to engage with the main contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments.</p> <p>As any delivery outside of the timelines agreed under the contract could potentially be a matter for dispute resolution, I want to be careful in respect of what I say here.  However, I reiterate that it is a priority for me and the Government that the hospital be completed as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

What is his understanding of the nature of the confidential GP contract, as we know it was, on 16 April 2019 when he spoke in the D&aacute;il Chamber?  Was it his view that that contract was widely available and known among GPs?  As the current Minister for Health, does he think it was acceptable that the then Head of Government would have leaked that document to a rival organisation?  Can he confirm to Members of this House that documents which are being sought by many parties, including mine, regarding any discussion involving the HSE, the Department of Health and the NAGP between April 2019 and May 2019, will be furnished to Opposition Members or any Member of the D&aacute;il who seeks them?</p></speech>

I think it would be ruled out of order by the Chair, but I have no problem answering the question at all.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that it was not available and hence I was looking for it.  It was a critical contract because it was moving away from what is still the existing GP contract.  It was essentially adding to the existing GP contract but in an important way - in ways that were identified by Sl&aacute;intecare.  One of the most critical was to have GPs lead the chronic disease management within the community.  Essentially as it was explained to me, they were adding chunks the GPs could opt into.  I do not believe the exact details were available and hence I raised it-----</p></speech>

I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the development of five new primary care centres in County Clare is being progressed and, when completed, will add to the existing centre at Westbury.  I acknowledge the Deputy's work in continuing to advocate to ensure these critical projects happen as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The development at Station Road, Ennis is expected to be completed late in 2021 and to be operational in early 2022, while a planning application has been submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for another centre in Ennis on the Tulla Road.</p>  <p>  Planning permission has now been granted following an appeal for the centre at Sixmilebridge, and the developer is currently working to conclude outstanding matters.  It is hoped to commence construction works in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Priced offers from potential developers are currently under review for Ennistymon, while several potential sites have been shortlisted in the Kilrush area and a review of accommodation requirements for that area is being undertaken. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is not possible at this stage to provide an estimated operational date for these centres, other than for Station Road.  I am determined that these projects progress as quickly as possible as part of our efforts to enhance primary care capacity.  I look forward to working with the Deputy on these issues.</p>  <p>  A total of 135 primary care centres are now operational across the country, and these modern, well-equipped and accessible premises are key to the development of primary care services in line with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear of the progress with the five new centres which are greatly needed in our county.  When the primary care centre model was developed by the Department of Health it was to provide modern purpose-designed buildings for a wide catchment area with care by a multidisciplinary primary care team.  I live quite close to the Westbury primary care centre.  I have brought my children there for developmental check-ups.  It is fantastic to have a state-of-the-art facility on my doorstep.  The other parts of our county also need them, and I am glad to hear they are progressing.  Without a 24-hour accident and emergency department, County Clare has a higher dependency on community-level healthcare and also the out-of-hours service provided by Shannondoc.  This is good news.  I would like to hear a bit more about Kilrush and Ennistymon which are further back in the county and have a more pressing need for primary care centres.</p></speech>

There is not much more to say until those offers come in at which point, they will be evaluated.</p>  <p>  In Ennistymon a site was advertised in May 2019 for a primary care centre development and priced offer applications from potential developers are currently under review.  I am aware that an agreement for lease was issued for this site before being withdrawn.  That the proposed centre has been re-advertised shows that the commitment remains to progress with this project.  I am happy to reassure the Deputy of my commitment to work with him on behalf of the people he represents to ensure this critical project gets over the line and opens.</p></speech>

As with everything, rumours circulate on social media these days, including the rumour over the summer that these projects would not happen and that funding for them was questionable.  I am glad to hear tonight in the D&aacute;il that they are progressing.  Ennis is the largest town in Munster that is not a city and it needs the two new primary care centres on the Tulla Road and the Station Road.  Sixmilebridge was once a small village and is now a large town.  As Kilrush and Ennistymon are more peripheral in the county, their need for primary care is more acute.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to confirm that the money remains allocated to these and has not been pulled as was rumoured.  I hope these new primary care centres will have the capacity to fully deal with developmental check-ups for the young, the elderly and also mental health.  As I have often discussed with the Minister, there is considerable focus on physical health because of Covid, but mental health is also suffering.  Primary care needs to have the capacity to cater for that also.</p></speech>

Rumours that they have been pulled or shelved are unsubstantiated.  The services to go in is a matter that will be discussed with the HSE.  Any input the Deputy may have would be very welcome.  We try to have GPs in the primary care centres.  Obviously, GPs are independent contractors and do not have to come in.  There are generally ongoing negotiations to get local GPs to move in and then we put in primary healthcare teams as well.  The exact configuration of what is needed in the community is different for urban versus rural, for younger versus older populations and so forth, as the Deputy said.  I would welcome any feedback the Deputy has on what would be suitable for community-based services.</p></speech>

What actions has it taken and will it take over the next three years?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.744" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="20:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300047#WW02700"><p>I was delighted to see this question come in.  I share the Deputy's view that this is a priority.  Progressing women&rsquo;s health is a priority for me and for this Government.  We made a strong commitment to promoting women&rsquo;s health in the programme for Government.  I am pleased that budget 2021 provides a very significant investment to deliver on this commitment, something I have been pushing very hard for.</p> <p>I have allocated funding of &euro;12 million to ensure a renewed impetus in the implementation of the national maternity strategy and the new model of maternity care and to improve gynaecology services as well.  I have allocated funding of &euro;10 million to strengthen screening services including BreastCheck and CervicalCheck.  Building on the work of the women's health task force, I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million to improve outcomes.</p> <p> Women have specific physical, mental and social health needs and experience poorer health outcomes relating to certain conditions including some chronic diseases, cancers and mental health conditions.  Women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences are also affected by their roles in the family and society and their wider circumstances.  For example, more than 60% of unpaid carers are women which means they often access services on behalf of others.</p> <p> The women's health task force was established in September 2019 to improve both health outcomes and experiences of healthcare for women and girls.  It builds on recent progress in women&rsquo;s health, including the implementation of the national maternity strategy, the implementation of the sexual health strategy, the establishment of a national mesh specialist centre, improvements in screening services, improvements in sexual assault services, the introduction of termination of pregnancy services, the roll-out of the maternal and newborn clinical management system and the development of new models of care for ambulatory gynaecology and infertility.</p></speech>

It has let down women many times and women's healthcare in Ireland must be addressed.  It is ironic that the task force was established because it was recommended in the scoping inquiry on the cervical screening programme after women had been completely let down.  That should be remembered in the tribunal that will take place soon.</p>  <p>  What areas will be developed around gynaecological health?  Will it address endometriosis, something that one in ten women suffers from?  It can take up to nine years for a diagnosis.</p></speech>

It must be pushed and funded.  I might be wrong, but I do not believe that if men had babies that Holles Street, the Coombe or the Rotunda or other maternity services around the country would have the same level of investment as they have now.  They would be state-of-the-art, brand new, custom-built, beautiful buildings.  They are not and that is not good enough.  It is not good enough that when we discuss crisis after crisis here on women's health and women's reproductive health - be it mother and baby homes, CervicalCheck or symphysiotomy - it is always the same.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of new funding in place.  The Deputy asked what exactly the task force has been doing and what it intends to do.  I will provide the Deputy with the rest of the written answer as I am out of time but there is a lot of really good work going on.  The task force has done a huge amount of work and hopefully some exciting things will come through in the next year.</p></speech>

That is welcome.  Women should be at the heart of women's health and they should be listened to, where not doing so was a problem in the past.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had a huge effect on everyone, regardless of gender, but I raise its impact on women's mental health.  Covid has done a huge amount of social, physical and mental damage.  How will the task force address that?</p></speech>

There was funding in parallel with the winter plan and a wellness initiative was launched last week.  There has been a huge increase in calls and in texts to the support lines.  We do not have very up-to-date data, but the figures we have for suicide and self-harm have not gone up.  That may change in more recent data.  The numbers asking for help have increased across the country.  The task force is engaged with over 1,000 people and organisations representing women and girls across the country.  It did the listening exercise and I might share some of its findings in writing with the Deputy.</p></speech>

Concerning fourth year nursing and midwifery students, the HSE continues to fund the internship employment of those students who are on rostered work placements.  This includes those scheduled to commence in the coming weeks and those due to commence rostered work placements in 2021.  These fourth year student nurses on rostered work placement are paid at the approved rate of &euro;22,229 on an annualised basis for the psychiatric nursing specialism and &euro;21,749 for all other nursing disciplines.  I am open to examining what other measures can be put in place to protect and support student nurse and midwife education and welfare at the present time.  My priority is to ensure that placements continue so long as it is safe to do so.  In that regard, my Department is engaging with the HSE and the higher education bodies on an ongoing basis.  Separately, and for the longer term, my Department is reviewing the accommodation and travel allowances for students on clinical placements that should apply from the academic year commencing in autumn 2021.  This review is expected to conclude at the end of this month, and I look forward to examining the outcome of this review in due course.  Regarding the testing of students when they are assigned to a placement, the testing regime follows the national system that the HSE has in place.</p></reply>

The INMO's submission was extraordinary.  It said that 3,400 students are on placements in Irish hospitals.  Covid means they are in a vulnerable position.  The failure by the HSE "to remunerate them amounts to exploitation".  That is awful.  The statement also notes that 50 nurses are infected by Covid each week.  Student nurses feel very let down, unrecognised for their work but also financially.  The Minister has to address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.758" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300048#XX01400"><p>To follow up on that, the Minister said earlier on this that it was education not work so we should not pay them.  We should be clear that this departs from what the Government was forced to do in March and April when it had to acknowledge they were actually working and pay them at the healthcare assistant level.</p> <p>The idea that the student nurses who are on placement at this time are not working is a nonsense, when there are 500 to 600 healthcare workers out for more than 14 weeks with long-tail Covid, of whom the biggest cohort comprises nurses and midwives.  Nurses and HCAs make up the largest cohort of workers being hit with Covid infection and they are working in a highly dangerous environment from an infection point of view.  There is no question that the student nurses are working.  In fact, they are being exploited and our hospitals would not be operating without them.  The idea that they are exclusively on some sort of educational placement is not accurate.  Their placements are part of their education but they are working.  Indeed, they are being exploited because they are not being paid as they were earlier this year.</p></speech>

I have one additional point to make.  Unless there is some capacity to distinguish between the risk of getting Covid for a nurse who is working full time and a nurse who is a fourth-year student, then this is an utterly disgraceful action and the Minister is putting students at risk as they strive to complete their education.  The Minister cannot distinguish what he is doing now from what was done earlier this year.  This is blatant exploitation and it is completely and utterly wrong.  The Minister is underestimating this as an issue and he needs to do the right thing.  These are front-line workers who are saving lives and putting themselves at risk the same as every other front-line worker.  They deserve to be treated appropriately.</p></speech>

To pick up on the wider point, Deputy Boyd Barrett is absolutely right that nurses, midwives and HCAs throughout the system are doing extraordinary work.  We often, rightly, talk about the amazing work teachers have done to make our schools safe places for children to be.  There is not enough talk about the equivalent work nurses and midwives are doing to make hospitals safe places for patients.  The Deputy is right that there have been a lot of Covid cases among healthcare professionals right across the board.  I agree that nurses make up the biggest group of those who have been infected.  That needs to be recognised.</p>  <p>  Where I have a different view is in emphasising that for student nurses in the first, second and third year of their training who go out on placements, those placements are educational and make up part of their degree.  This aspect of training was one of the components of moving the nursing qualification to a professional degree and it is a critical part of their education.  I have a concern I wish to articulate in this regard but my time is up.  I will return to it in my final reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.762" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1565" speakername="Gino Kenny" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300049#YY00400"><p>The world we used to live in prior to Covid-19 seems like a very different world from the one we are living in now.  In former times, many student nurses could take up other jobs in nursing homes and so on, but they can no longer do so for all sorts of reasons.  Financially, this has left them out of pocket.  Living on an allowance of &euro;50 a week, with the responsibility that is entailed in their roles, is having a hugely detrimental effect on their well-being.  Nursing is a very hard job and the people working in the profession are extremely dedicated.  However, some are fearful of the nature of the business they are in.  It is very important that the Minister for Health should recognise the contribution of student nurses, whether in first, second of third year.  Of course their placements are part of their education.  I know that because I used to work alongside them.  However, it is really important that they are recognised, financially as well as educationally, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.</p></speech>

It might be of interest to the Minister to know that the video of that engagement has been watched 250,000 times, which is very rare for any video of proceedings in this House in which I am involved.  That was the scale of the response from student nurses.  In that engagement, the Taoiseach said the following:</p> <blockquote> 	...I will engage with the HSE and the Minister for Health on student nurses working on the wards in the current context.  As they were earlier, they should be paid in accordance with the agreement arrived at earlier in the year.  I will follow up on that. </blockquote>  <p>When we put the points to him regarding the situation of the student nurses, he agreed that they should be paid at the previous rate.  For the reasons Deputy Gino Kenny outlined, they cannot get other jobs.  There is no question that they are working, in a context where they are replacing the hundreds of nurses who are down with Covid.  That is why they are working.  The Minister can call what they are doing an educational placement - it is, in a certain sense, education - but he cannot deny that they are also working.  They cannot engage in any other work and they must be paid, not exploited, for the work they are doing.</p></speech>

Many of us have had student nurses and their parents contact us to tell their stories.  Their health is at risk when colleagues go out sick with Covid and they have been thrown in at the deep end, being told to go into situations they did not expect to go into, sometimes with only a day's notice and certainly no more than a week's notice.  The Minister needs to put them back on the HCA rate.  It is completely and utterly unfair not to do so.  I have spoken to two student nurses who are finishing their training and who told me, quite bluntly, that they intend to leave this jurisdiction because of the way they are being treated.  They do not have any other means of getting an income and they have loans and other borrowings.  Like many others did in the past, they are making the decision to leave.  This is happening because the Minister is not making the right decisions.  We know that the competition for staff nurses is extreme throughout the world.  The last thing we should be doing is creating circumstances that lead to our student nurses deciding to leave the country when they graduate.</p></speech>

We all recognise the work of our qualified nursing and midwifery professionals throughout the country, in community healthcare and in the hospital system.  Do students nurses make a valuable contribution while they are on their educational placements?  Damn right they do and they work extremely hard.  Those students are part of a clinical group whose members are funded for their educational placements.  Are we looking at increasing that funding in a time of Covid?  We absolutely are and we are engaged in doing that.  However, I have a genuine concern that if we were to replicate what happened in the first wave, it could come at a risk to the educational element of those placements for nursing students in their first, second and third years of training.  The placements are, first and foremost, part of their degree.  Can we and must we do more for them?  Absolutely.  At the same time, we must protect their education.  We are engaged in ensuring that we do both those things at the same time.</p></speech>

The winter plan was launched by the HSE on 24 September.  It targets approximately 12,522 additional posts over the period of the plan, to the end of April next year.  Budget 2021 provides for the retention of these posts on a permanent basis, plus an additional 3,426 whole-time equivalent posts, funding a total increase of approximately 15,738 positions.  To date in 2020, the health workforce has increased by a net 4,292.  </p>  <p>  The number of staff employed by the HSE is identified through the staff census which is collected monthly.</p> <p>The HSE staff census for October will not be reported until mid-November and the first progress report regarding the achievement of the winter plan targets will be available at this point.  In short, the data for the first month of the winter plan have not come in yet.  It is, however, collected on a monthly basis and I will be more than happy to share it with the Deputy.  What he is doing is exactly right.  Very ambitious targets and goals have been set and he is pushing to make sure they are achieved.  I will work with him in that regard.  I will be working very hard to ensure those targets and goals are achieved to the extent that is possible.  I hope that will mean they are fully achieved.</p> <p> Recruitment in the HSE has been ongoing at an accelerated pace throughout this year.  Current increases were due to a number of measures, including the expedited recruitment from all existing recruitment pools, hiring student nurses as healthcare assistants, as we have just discussed, increasing the hours of part-time staff and rehiring retired clinicians.  In recent weeks, the HSE has conducted a successful campaign to retain additional swabbers and contact tracers.  It is envisaged that the equivalent of an additional 2,200 whole-time staff in this area will be funded by the end of the year.</p></speech>

There is a commitment to hire 8,500 staff by the end of next month, 12,500 by the end of April, and 16,000 by December of next year.  Again, that is 8,500 by the end of December.  I am really looking forward to getting that document on 15 November because massive progress must obviously have been made over recent months.  We know there are issues in respect of recruitment.  We have seen this in the area of contact tracing.  What really brought this home to me, however, was when I asked a parliamentary question, the answer to which told me that we had 200 fewer permanent nurses in August than we did in December of last year.  How could that happen?  The Minister told me that we have nearly 2,000 extra contract staff.  That is even more concerning.  Does the Minister's management consultant experience not tell him that 2,000 whole-time equivalent staff not being offered permanent contracts represents a systems failure?</p></speech>

The Deputy raised a report of the total number of staff being lower, which I looked into because I was very perplexed by it myself.  It turns out that the total number of hours being worked when expressed as whole-time equivalent staff had, in fact, increased quite significantly.</p></speech>

As I said in the House earlier, there is a lot of opportunity to improve recruitment processes.  When the Deputy and I joined nurses and midwives on the picket line last year, they were not talking about pay increases but about safe staffing levels.  I hope that, as the number of staff increases in accordance with the safe staffing agreement, the HSE across the board becomes a place where our own graduates and clinicians want to stay and work, as it already is in some areas.  I hope it becomes a place where people from across the world also want to work.</p></speech>

We have been over the issue of whole-time equivalents before.  I actually gave him the figures the last time as well.  It is perplexing and wrong that these are not full-time positions.  It would be helpful it the Minister could listen to me.  It is perplexing and wrong.  Will the Minister please explain to the House why these 1,800 people are not on full-time contracts?  Will he please explain how that is not a systems failure?  In the limited time we have, will he also please update the House on what he has done to bring in more consultants?  He is really out on a limb on that question.</p>  <p>  I have heard the Minister speak about changing the way in which recruitment is carried out, decentralising it and giving more hiring power locally.  I actually agree with him 100% on that, but what has he done to achieve it?  Will the Minister also inform the House of the percentage of those who have been recruited when he gives us the figures in a week and a half's time?  We also need to be careful about the process of recruitment.  We may have real issues in other healthcare areas because recruitment will be from a smaller pool, that is to say, we may be taking people from nursing homes and so on.</p></speech>

The HSE has explicitly stated that it is not targeting healthcare professionals in nursing homes.  It has, however, stated that it has its own ambitious hiring targets and that it cannot stop people from nursing homes applying.  To refer to something I believe I have heard the Deputy mention, one way to keep healthcare professionals in nursing homes would be to carry out a review of that sector and of the pay and conditions within it.  One of the reasons people are moving is that they see better pay and conditions elsewhere.  That is one of the things I want to see.</p>  <p>  With regard to the figures the Deputy is looking for, I take note of the time but I am happy to answer in writing and also to discuss the matter further with him.</p></speech>

There were 24,141 inpatients in LUH in 2019 and 9,731 inpatients in the first two quarters of this year.  The budget allocation for Letterkenny University Hospital is &euro;145.9 million.  This is the 12th highest annual budget allocation for a public hospital in 2020.  The Deputy will be happy to know that it is also the second highest budget for a model 3 hospital anywhere in Ireland.  Data provided by the HSE on staffing levels indicate that 1,745 whole-time equivalent staff are working in Letterkenny University Hospital, which is the fourth highest number in a model 3 hospital nationally.</p>  <p>  There have been significant investments in services in the hospital in recent years.  These include the completion of the radiology rebuild, including a second CT and interventional radiology suite, and of a 20-bed short-stay ward; the construction of two new wards, Medical 6 and Medical 7; the commissioning of a new mammography machine in the symptomatic breast disease unit; and the appointment of consultants in paediatrics, gastroenterology and urology as well as advanced nurse practitioners.  The HSE also advises that a new acute stroke unit will commence operation before the end of the year.  I know this news will be very welcome to the local community.</p>  <p>  Plans for further investment in Letterkenny University Hospital in 2021 include plans for the commissioning of a new maternity theatre, the commissioning of a second CT scanner, the expansion of the colposcopy service with additional clinic rooms, and the replacement of the haematology oncology day ward aseptic unit.  I hope the Deputy agrees that the extent of recent and upcoming developments illustrates the Government's commitment to Letterkenny University Hospital and to patients in the north west.</p></speech>

This is the first chance the Minister and I have had for an engagement about Letterkenny University Hospital but I assure him it will be the first of many.  What the Minister's colleagues who wrote this response did not tell him is that the 24,141 inpatients seen in the hospital last year make it the sixth largest hospital in the State.  They have admitted that it has the 12th highest budget.  We have the sixth greatest number of inpatients but only the 12th largest budget.  I love that somebody decided to change the hospital's name from Letterkenny General Hospital to Letterkenny University Hospital.  It was given a big fancy name but, whenever anyone is challenged about the budget allocation given to it, we are told that it is a model 3 hospital and that it is doing great for a model 3.  It is a university hospital and part of the Saolta University Health Care Group.  I will provide the Minister with additional figures after tonight that show the hospital is heavily discriminated against, which cannot be allowed to continue.</p></speech>

I asked the very same question, which is if the hospital has the sixth highest level of inpatients but the 12th highest budget, what is the rationale?  Is it that patients are being short-changed?  The simple answer is "No".</p>  <p>  The Deputy knows well that in comparing budgets for hospitals, we must look at many different elements.  For example, we must consider case mix, complexity, average length of stay and many other factors.  There is no easy way to do that but we can use the proxy of model 3 versus model 4.  It is not a perfect comparison but it gives a reasonable adjustment to the complexity of cases.  If the Deputy is of the view that it should be a level 4 hospital, I am happy to have that conversation.  Doing a proxy for case mix adjusting, we can see the hospital has the second-highest budget for that level of hospital.  That goes a long way to explaining the discrepancy pointed out by the Deputy.</p></speech>

That is accepted.  Let us look at one comparison.  In Letterkenny we had more inpatients in 2019 than St. James's Hospital, with Letterkenny having the sixth largest number and St. James's having the seventh largest number.  Look at the budgets, with Letterkenny having &euro;145.237 million and St. James's having &euro;396 million.  That is almost three times the budget of Letterkenny, despite having fewer inpatients.  That cannot be explained other than to be labelled as discrimination.  I can provide the Minister with the statistics.  I assure him that when he looks at them, he will have to admit that this must change.</p></speech>

We both know St. James's and nearly every other hospital are different.  The work going on at St. James's per patient is highly complex and really expensive in all the ways we know.  The right comparison would be activity-based costing.  I am more than happy to discuss with the Deputy how much Letterkenny hospital is getting for the procedures it performs and the service it provides.  Is it being short-changed, for example, and is it getting less money for a given procedure?  That would be a concern and it should not be the case.  Rather than comparing Letterkenny with highly specialised centres like St. James's, we could look at the volume of known procedures, and if there is a discrepancy, I would be more than happy to take a look with the Deputy.  That is definitely something we could look at rectifying.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.790" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300052#CCC00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I note the Government's proposed amendment, and I will address it in greater detail in my closing statement.  It is welcome, however, that the Government agrees with the merit of this Bill.  People living along the River Shannon, from Cavan to Clare, are sick and tired.  They are sick of being hit with recurring floods and they are tired of politicians in wellies turning up, wringing their hands, paying lip service to flood defences and mumbling about multi-agency approaches before heading back to their own nice dry homes.  It was expected that we would experience a 1% chance of severe flooding every year.  That prediction has now changed.  There has been an increase in the prevalence of flooding and categorical evidence that the floods are getting bigger.  These flood events threaten homes, farming lands and businesses and erode the quality of rural Ireland, jeopardising its very existence.</p><p>This year alone, there have been two flooding events in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  There was one in February and another in July.  Some areas are now under water and more are under threat.  There is a real danger of complacency creeping in.  Every winter we watch people isolated by rising waters and battling with pumps and sandbags to keep their homes, belongings and animals safe and dry.  Despite the best efforts of volunteers, emergency responders, local authority staff and members of the Defence Forces, the water still finds its way through.</p><p>We have no comprehension of how it feels to look at weather reports with genuine fear and trepidation, like those affected by the flooding of River Shannon do, and only too well.  Since 2016, 40 families have applied for humanitarian assistance to relocate because there is simply no alternative.  Let us think about that for a moment.  Let us think about the heartbreak behind those decisions to leave the only home many of those people have known, often for generations, because of the risk of flooding.  It is time we all said enough is enough.  Enough with this <i>ad hoc</i>approach to the River Shannon, enough with disappointing the people most affected by the failure of legislators to get to grips with this issue.  It is well past time that a single agency was tasked with management of the River Shannon.</p><p>There are genuine fears that without a single agency having responsibility, the necessary changes and works will not happen in a reasonable and necessary timeline, or even in the lifetimes of those most affected today.  Twenty State agencies, from the ESB and Waterways Ireland to the local authorities, are involved in management along the River Shannon.  Each of those agencies has responsibility for protecting its own prospects.  While their open, informal, if-and-when relationship is to be welcomed and is effective in most scenarios, in this specific case it is not working, is not effective and is not producing the results needed.  The previous Government established the Shannon flood risk management State agency co-ordination working group to support existing plans and enhance co-operation.  While this was a good first step, a working group that meets twice a year is clearly insufficient, as evidenced by the flooding that has occurred this year alone.</p><p>This Bill seeks to establish a River Shannon management agency on a statutory footing and provides for statutory powers for the agency to manage and co-ordinate necessary works along the length of the River Shannon.  The Bill also requires the agency to produce a strategic plan for management of the River Shannon within three months of its establishment.  No works can be carried out on any river without potentially having an effect further downstream, including fast currents, erosion of banks and bridges being put under pressure, and that outcome requires appropriate strategic planning.</p><p>The concept of a single agency has been endorsed by stakeholders, such as the Save our Shannon group, and Fianna F&aacute;il supported the proposal when in opposition.  As recently as September, the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy from Offaly said just that in this Chamber.  The River Shannon is a complex system and includes elements of built infrastructure, areas of conservation, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, electricity generation and tourism.  Equally complex will be the solutions that must be put in place to ensure coherent and effective management of the river.  It is time to advance the River Shannon Management Agency Bill 2020 and remind people living along this magnificent river that this House does not only think about flooding when they are reaching for the sandbags.</p></speech>

I live in County Leitrim, and if we were there tonight, it would be possible to see that Lough Allen is full to the brim with water because it has rained for the past couple of weeks.  A dam there can be raised and lowered, and that regularly happens.  There is always pressure on the Office of Public Works, OPW, to do that, and the OPW and other bodies are engaged in doing that.  The reality is that if that dam had been lowered six to eight weeks ago when navigation stopped on the Shannon - there are no boats on the river at this time of the year - and the lake was now practically empty, Carrick-on-Shannon would not be facing a threat of flooding.  That is the problem.</p>  <p>  Every time we see a situation such as this coming into the winter months, the River Shannon must be lowered to the lowest possible level.  Up and down the length of the Shannon each year, however, community groups, including the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and other farm organisations, contact the ESB and the OPW to request them to lower the level of the river before the water comes, so that it can then take more water from the flood.  The flooding does not last forever.  Most times there are two to three weeks of rain, and then it subsides again.  If the level of water is not low to start with in the River Shannon, however, there will be a problem because it will not be able to take the extra flood water.  I am just referring to the management of the river now.</p>  <p>  There is a separate aspect to this matter concerning the prevention of flooding.  Some of that involves putting up walls and barriers in towns to prevent urban areas from being flooded, but much of what needs to happen involves drainage measures.  I refer to removing pinch points and doing appropriate works at different places along the length of the Shannon and ensuring they are done in co-ordinated fashion.</p> <p>There is a problem, and the Minister of State knows this, as does everybody involved, including the other Deputies here who live in the area and understand it and talk to the people on the ground.  If one talks to elderly people who have lived all of their lives in that region they will tell one that they know what is going to happen.  They know that when the river is at a certain height and there is a certain amount of rainfall, they are in trouble.  Every one of them will say to do the right thing because a pinch in time saves nine, but that continually fails to happen and has continued to fail to happen time after time through the years.  It still is the case.</p> <p> I was contacted last week by a woman in Leitrim village whose house was practically flooded last February when they had to put sandbags around it.  They are very fearful at the moment that the same thing is going to happen.  It is the same everywhere we go along the length of the Shannon.  A big problem is that the agencies do not work together.  They tell us that they do and they tell us that they meet, but all of them come to it with their own separate individual agendas.  We need the power to be taken away from them and put into one agency which has overall power over the river, and which can actually make sure everything is done to relieve the entire situation along the full length of the river.  That needs to happen as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> I welcome that the Minister of State's confirmation that he supports the merit of the Bill from that point of view, and his proposal that the Bill will be read a Second Time in nine months.  That is somewhat positive but the problem is that people in houses that will be flooded in the coming weeks will see this as the Government pushing this further out from them again.  I do not think that is a wise thing to do.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, should embrace every opportunity to do everything possible to put every agency to work to resolve the situation.  They are not doing that and they have never done that because they all work to their own separate individual agendas.  That has been the problem here.</p> <p> The issue we must bring to bear is around the power that currently rests with the ESB in particular.  I pick the ESB out because the ESB is the main problem here.  The ESB continually blocks and does everything to act as an obstacle to getting a result for the people who live in these regions.  The power needs to be taken from the ESB so that it can no longer decide who it floods and who it does not, which is what it actually does.  That is the power it has got.  This power has to be taken away from the ESB and it needs to happen now, not in nine months, two years or three years.  That power needs to be taken away and put into an agency that will have responsibility and will be accountable to this House and to the Minister to make sure the work is done properly.  It has not been done and there has been no accountability.  That is the problem we have had down the years and we have all been whistling in the dark.  As my colleague Deputy Clarke has said, when the pumps are on and the sandbags come out, everyone runs around in wellingtons looking at it.  That does not solve the problem.  It is today and over the summer months, in the dry spells and the dry times of year that we need to come up with solutions.</p> <p> I implore the Minister of State to try to look at this again, not to push it out for nine months as he has proposed in his amendment, and to actually embrace this right now to do something that will be proactive to resolve the situation.</p></speech>

I acknowledge former Deputy Gerry Adams and Deputy Brian Stanley who introduced a similar Bill back in 2016.  At that time, the then Taoiseach warned that the establishment of a single authority was not possible and I welcome that Fine Gael has moved away from that position.  Indeed, 20 years ago it was Fine Gael arguing for a single authority and promising to deliver on it when next in government.  Fine Gael has gone from promising a single authority, to it not being possible, to today needing another nine months to consider the matter, never mind whose homes, businesses and farmlands will be destroyed in the meantime as we come into the winter months.  It is absolute rubbish to suggest that another nine months is needed to look at this matter.</p><p>There is not a party in government that has not called for a single authority to co-ordinate flood risk and management along the River Shannon.  In 2016, Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward legislation to establish a single authority and on introducing that Bill criticised the slow response of Government to deal with the flooding then.  Now they are putting forward a proposal that will lead to a nine-month delay.  This Government consistently references the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group, established in 2016.  It is mentioned in the Minister of State's amendment but it has done little or nothing to address flooding along the River Shannon.</p><p>Of the so-called significant decisions made by the group since it was established, as stated by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, in the D&aacute;il last month, three of the five decisions involve carrying out studies, reports and assessments when we are gone far beyond more reports and more studies.  One decision includes:</p> <blockquote> 	A study to examine the removal of constrictions resulting in lower summer water levels through the Shannon Callows, to help address the summer flooding in this area while maintaining the appropriate navigation requirements. </blockquote>  <p>The Shannon Callows, however, are under water tonight.  Some 200 farms have been affected by the now annual flooding of the Shannon Callows.  Most of these farms have been under water since July.</p><p>I remind the House that it has been said that we need &quot;a single agency to be introduced to bring the separate conflicting interests of the various stakeholders together&quot;.  These are not my words of concern for the Shannon Callows but those of the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, who said this in the local media just six weeks ago.  It is disgraceful that after all of the debates, reports and working groups, and all of the talk from Government Deputies over the decades when they have said one thing locally and come to Dublin to do the opposite, we are still arguing for something so practical and sensible.  This is now the fifth Bill introduced in this House seeking action on a single authority to manage and maintain the River Shannon.  I doubt there is a Government Deputy in this House who has not been out to flooding in his or her constituency to show concern, to say how awful it is and to get his or her photograph taken.  Yet after all of that, the Minister of State's message to all the people in the Government Deputies' own communities who are devastated by flooding is to let us wait nine months until next August, and see then.  There is no excuse for this delay.</p><p>I will conclude by commending the Save our Shannon organisation and all those the length and breadth of the River Shannon who have battled against flooding in their own communities and their own homes, farmlands and businesses for generations.  They will not be fooled by the Minister of State's delaying tactic here tonight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.794" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1520" speakername="Violet Wynne" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300053#DDD00300"><p>I am pleased to co-sponsor such an important and relevant Bill with my colleagues today.  Flooding is not an uncommon phenomenon.  Instead, due to a lack of action and joined-up thinking it has become a common experience for many.  The issue at hand is how we deal with our waterways and how we work to prevent the flooding of our towns, villages, farmlands and businesses.  As we continue to fight the issue of climate change, all the while hearing about the effects of rising sea levels and how flooding will only become a bigger issue, it must be met with nothing short of action, and timely action, rather than more kicking the can further down the road.</p>  <p>   In my home county of Clare, as recently as February we have seen many households and farmlands destroyed or severely impacted due to flooding.  One man in Clonlara was quoted as saying "I am living in hell".  For him it has become a very common life event.  While many people have commented on the ways we can tackle flooding along the River Shannon, I believe that one of the most glaringly obvious issues facing us is the lack of a river management agency for the river.  Each time we hear of flooding we hear how blame should be apportioned across Waterways Ireland, the OPW, the local authorities and the ESB - the list goes on and on.  That is where the problem lies.  No one is truly accountable or responsible.  If this does not show clearly that we have a problem, I do not know what will.</p>  <p>  The River Shannon is Ireland's longest river.  It passes through 11 counties, which means 11 different local authorities have responsibilities.  There are 20 agencies in total, some of which I mentioned already, with responsibilities with regard to the river.  Does this make sense?  All of them are trying to work towards a common goal but are working independently of each other.  All the agencies request funding but not all are quite sure what the end goal is.  We need a River Shannon management agency within the Office of Public Works.  We need to ensure we have a collective of the right people from across the relevant State bodies to properly implement a strategy for the River Shannon.</p>  <p>  During my discussions with those people who are affected by flooding, they have made it quite clear that the lack of proper engagement with communities is striking and has not gone unnoticed.  One lady made it quite clear to me that people find the lack of public representation on the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group as being glaring.  She spoke about the fact that this body meets just twice per year, and only once so far in 2020, discussing issues but not engaging with the local people who are directly affected and who have the most knowledge of the area and the impact flooding has on them.</p>  <p>  Has the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, met with this co-ordination group since taking up his new role?  Does the group have a winter plan for 2020?  We are just coming into the most at-risk time of year and we are not sure if we have a plan.</p> <p>While it is welcome that the group is in place, it shows why we need a strong State agency with a statutory footing to take control of the river and effectively plan to ensure we battle this flooding now.  These people are living in fear.  They are not sure when a heavy rainfall will lead to the next flood, whether they will be able to get to work the following morning if the roads are flooded, or whether their SNAs can approach their houses to continue with their work.  They cannot insure their homes as they are considered at risk.  Can the Minister of State imagine being in that situation and not being able to get home insurance because of something that is completely outside his control?  These people are facing the winter knowing there is a great chance that they and their families will spend weeks on end separated into different hotel rooms, stripped of any autonomy to even make a meal for themselves or their children.  These families are traumatised by the experience of flooding and the ordeal and the stress they have had to endure.  It would take some time to relay all that information to the Minister of State because it is quite extensive.</p> <p> We need to ensure the work undertaken to mitigate flooding is done on a collective basis and that any work undertaken upstream does not adversely affect areas further down the river basin.  I strongly encourage the Government to support this Bill, not to put a nine-month delay on it, and to see that a River Shannon management agency is set up without delay.  We need a commitment to ensure this flooding does not happen again and we must offer the people affected some decent standard of living.  They should not be constantly living in fear of flooding or having their livelihoods literally washed away.  These people have spoken extensively to me and have informed me of the damage their properties have endured, for which they get no support.  People in this particular area have not been approved for the home relief scheme.  They are left on their own and it is an absolutely horrible situation for them.</p></speech>

Over the coming months I will examine the complexities and legal issues arising from it in the context of the creation of a single agency.  I am well aware of the devastation that can be caused by flooding for individual homeowners, businesses, landowners and communities.  Since being appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW and flood relief, I have visited a number of areas, including Kilmallock, Kenmare, Clifden, Bantry, Bandon, Dunmanway and Cork city, which have been affected by recent storms and flooding, witnessed at first hand the damage caused and met and spoken with the people and business owners directly affected.</p><p>The River Shannon is a valuable natural resource that is important to Ireland&rsquo;s economy, society, culture and environment.  It serves an important purpose for electricity generation, navigation for tourism, fishing and creates employment to support these activities.  Given its importance, the Government has completed an assessment of the flood risk along the Shannon, published the flood maps and is implementing the plan to manage the flood risk along the Shannon river.  One of the six catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study areas included a dedicated study of the flood risk of the Shannon river basin district.  This Shannon study has a catchment area of 17,800 sq. km and a population of some 670,000 people living in 17 local authority areas.  It assessed, mapped and provided the flood risk management plans for the Shannon including for 67 communities.  To date, 11 of these towns have a flood relief scheme providing protection against a one in 100-year flood event and in May 2018 the Government announced 34 new flood relief schemes for Shannon river communities.  These form part of the plans announced by the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion investment in flood relief measures over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  Work on 25 schemes is currently under way.</p><p>Outside of the major flood relief schemes, local flooding issues are being addressed by local authorities with the support of the OPW under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  This scheme provides funding for minor flood mitigation works or studies, costing less than &euro;750,000 each, to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems.  To date, the OPW has approved funding of &euro;34 million to over 600 projects for the Shannon river basin district.  Two thirds of these projects are outside of the areas covered by the CFRAM.</p><p>The OPW is also responsible for the 11,500 km of river channels, including approximately 800 km of embankments, which form part of the arterial drainage schemes completed since 1945.  These are kept under proper repair and in an effective condition through the OPW's annual maintenance programme.  In this year alone, maintenance work has been undertaken on approximately 595 km of channels and embankments on the Boyle, Inny, Brosna, Killimor-Cappagh, Carrigahorig, Nenagh-Clareen, Mulkear, Groody, Maigue, Deel and Feale catchment schemes and the Shannon embankments north and south. </p><p>The Government established the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group in 2016 to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon and to support the work planned by the flood risk management plans.  Deputies will recall that the group was established at that time following severe flooding arising from a series of storms and a period of sustained rainfall between December 2015 and January 2016.  On its establishment, a priority for the group was to develop a work programme within its first two months.  This programme highlighted the existing and extensive range of activities and co-ordination by all State agencies in 2016 to jointly and proactively address flood risk along the Shannon.  These works are categorised across maintenance, flood relief works, water management, regulation and policy areas.  Every year since then, the group has produced an annual work programme that highlights the ongoing diverse and broad scale of activity and the proactive co-ordination between the State agencies to manage the flood risk along the River Shannon.</p><p>Having met the group in the last fortnight, it is my intention to refocus it to look at short, medium and long-term measures that need to be taken.  The group has representation from the CEOs of all State agencies with a role on the Shannon, including the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  It is chaired by the OPW chairman and has met on 13 occasions.  It has established a work programme subgroup, which has identified some additional measures that can help further mitigate and manage the flood risk along the Shannon.  This subgroup has addressed all of the necessary environmental, technical and other considerations that arise in bringing forward both short-term and long-term proposals which I am anxious to see progressed and have identified as the greatest issues to be advanced.</p><p>The public have also been consulted during this process to develop the flood risk management plans for the Shannon.  This involved 144 public consultation days where members of the public had opportunities to engage with the process and discuss at first hand the accuracy of the maps.  Some 156 submissions were received by the OPW from stakeholders comprising members of the public, elected representatives, local authorities and various organisations.  Observations were considered and the plans were amended accordingly.  In addition, the Shannon working group has held public consultation days on its work programme and has met with representative groups, including the IFA.  It is my intention to meet the farming organisations shortly and I have starting meeting all members of the Shannon flood co-ordination group on a bilateral basis.</p><p>The Shannon working group has completed targeted maintenance activities along the river at Meelick Weir, the new cut at Muckinish, Shannon Grove at Kilnaborris and the new cut at Illaunacalliagh.  Works at these locations involved tree cutting and the removal of silt and emergent vegetation which helped to improve the conveyancing of the river at these locations.  These works required consents which had to be obtained from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which none of the previous speakers addressed.</p><p>Lowering the water levels on Lough Allen has been trialled for the past three years.  While this issue is weather related, reaching the lower targeted levels agreed with the ESB will provide additional storage capacity during flood events to help to alleviate any significant flooding that may occur.  The group has agreed to continue with this trial on a temporary basis pending the completion of a flood relief scheme for Carrick-on-Shannon.</p><p>In December 2019, the Government noted the studies by the Shannon working group that support a programme of strategic maintenance to mitigate flooding along the Shannon and the removal of the pinch points in the Shannon Callows that will address the summer flooding in the area and benefit navigation.  The Government has agreed that the OPW will provide &euro;7 million for these works, which will progress following environmental assessment and planning permission.  Waterways Ireland is the implementing body for these works and it has advised the OPW that it is advancing the various interventions, such as tree cutting and silt removal, to commence strategic maintenance measures at 12 locations commencing in 2021.</p><p>The group has recently completed a study of the cause, rate and degree of restrictions over time downstream of Parteen Weir in the lower Shannon that can now inform the options to help to manage the flood risk in this part of the Shannon.  All of these measures and activities have been or will be carried out within the existing powers and responsibilities of State agencies.  Where necessary, agreements and protocols have been established and agreed for delivering new initiatives.</p><p>The Shannon State agency co-ordination working group is working well but it is my intention to sharpen its focus by working collectively with its members.  It has identified and delivered activities that are already providing flood relief in the area and it is focused on providing additional flood relief measures to protect properties in the area.  These activities are being delivered within the current statutory roles and functions co-ordinated by the State agencies.  I recognise that progress is slow.  The current regulatory framework is such that progress in advancing its programme of activities is significantly impacted by a broad range of regulatory requirements which must be addressed and complied with.  Like all individuals, agencies and companies, we have to comply with the requirements of environmental and planning legislation.</p> <p>The Office of Public Works and I are actively engaged with the key Departments to ensure that required flood measures are delivered to communities in the shortest possible timeframe.  To that end, it is my intention to bring to Government a memorandum detailing the progress of the roll-out of flood relief schemes and the policy areas where we believe further interdepartmental work is needed.  There will be a particular emphasis on the areas of planning and environmental compliance.</p> <p> The Shannon working group is carrying out functions envisaged in the Bill, albeit on a non-statutory basis.  As I understand this may not be enough for Deputies and people outside the House, I request the co-operation of the House to take this Bill, together with my own reflections, and the memorandum that I intend to take to Government, and to come back to the Dail at a later date.  With the co-operation of the Opposition, I would like to chart a way forward that keeps open all avenues including either amending or new legislation.  I give that commitment as Minister of State.  I ask the Opposition to work with me, co-operate with me and engage with me on the advancement of this aim.</p> <p> I propose not to oppose the Bill and that the Bill be read in approximately nine months, allowing the time to introduce legislation, if appropriate, on the matter.  I want to work with Deputies on protecting properties from flooding.  I have personal family experience of what it does to properties and I am open to reforms that Members wish to bring forward, particularly in the area of planning and environmental compliance that might make delivery to people and communities faster.  However, we must be honest.  People who are affected by flooding need to be told the truth and the establishment of an agency tonight would not prevent a single litre of water from entering their property.  By working together I hope that we can make a positive change for communities across the country that continue to be ravaged by floods.  If Members have suggestions on amending existing legislation that they believe will help, I certainly will work with them.</p> <p> I wish to conclude by assuring Members that I and the Government are working extremely hard to ensure that the greatest possible progress is being made to deliver on a very ambitious programme of investment in flood defence along the Shannon and nationally.  The commitment of &euro;1 billion in the national development plan is a clear sign of how high a priority this is for the Government.  However, being able to spend this money with depend on the processes we and those contracting authorities, such as the city and county councils, have to work with.  Our climate is changing, which we have witnessed with the increased storm frequency and weather events, and we must adapt accordingly.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is from the same county as me.  He remembers the flood last year which destroyed a few houses in Coonagh and Na Piarsaigh GAA club.  If we had one statutory authority, that would not have happened.  In December 2015, there was a flood in Richmond Park, Corbally, in which 14 houses were destroyed.  If we had one statutory authority, that would not have happened either.  Both of those floods were man-made and were caused by errors due to not having one statutory authority, as the Minister of State knows.  We need to set up one statutory agency with the authority, power and accountability to tackle the flooding on the River Shannon.  As Deputy Kerrane mentioned, in 2016, Gerry Adams introduced the River Shannon Management Agency Bill 2016.  Unfortunately, it was not progressed.</p>  <p>  I represent a city that has suffered cruelly from flooding over the last 20 years.  Some of this flooding is due to localised rainfall, burst sewerage and water pipes and failures to clean drains, and has flooded homes in my locality.  Other floods unfortunately happen due to mismanagement.  I referred to Richmond Park, Corbally, and to Coonagh and to Na Piarsaigh GAA Club.  Most of the floods have been caused by rising water levels on the River Shannon itself.  The village of Castleconnell is highly vulnerable to high tides.  The River Shannon itself is a resource that we must protect.  However, it is a resource that we must manage properly.  The river is the spine of Limerick city.  It runs through the city and is a key geographic divide in the city.  Some of the most scenic spots in the city are adjacent to the river.  Unfortunately, more often than not, these are the areas most impacted by the nearly annual flooding events.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State and Members from Limerick will remember the flooding in King's Island in February 2014.  I was a local councillor at the time.  Shortly after that, we started to plan for work which has not started yet.  I spoke to the council today and it hopes to be on the ground in July 2021.  That will be six and a half years after the floods started.  They are talking about the possibility of it taking longer than that.  It could be eight or nine years after the flood, when the then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW came to Limerick City and County Council and told us that money would be no problem and that flood defences would be put in.  Here we are, eight or nine years later, and the people of King's Island do not have a flood defence.  It is an elderly community where people will have a note on their fridges about the time the tide will come in.  They are well aware of the tides.  People should not have to live like this.  I am not saying the Minister of State does not know this, because he does.  I have seen him do a good job in some situations in calling for help for people whose homes have been flooded.  Seeing people's faces when it happens is depressing.  The worst thing is that one frequently sees people who know it will happen again next year and the year after that.</p>  <p>  I genuinely believe that we need one statutory authority to manage the River Shannon and to make sure that everyone works together.  The crazy stuff that I referred to happening in Limerick would not have happened if there was a single authority.  It has been spoken about for a number of years.  The Minister of State's party supported it years ago.  The Minister of State's amendment of nine months is something that the Government does with everything we have ever brought forward.  If the Government thinks it is a good idea, it delays for nine months and unfortunately it does not happen.</p></speech>

Nearly every year, we see images of flooding and we look on with shock and horror at the damage it has caused to homes, businesses, land and livestock.  It is especially acute along the Shannon, as well as in Cork, Galway and along the River Barrow.  If one speaks to the victims of flooding, they will speak of their initial shock but following from that are long-lasting and lingering impacts to one's home and business.  It is never the same after one's home has been flooded.  The damage lingers for a long time.  The damp and the smell take a long time to leave.</p>  <p>  The flooding along the Shannon often elicits a strong feeling from people in my constituency.  These areas have strong solidarity with those affected along the Shannon, because people in Donabate and Portrane are affected, not by flooding but by coastal erosion.  I gave them a commitment that I would use the opportunity this evening to raise their concerns.  These communities see their families, friends, neighbours, homes and gardens all fall into the sea.  Across Portrane and Donabate, the sea is eating into the coastline.  It is dragging homes into the sea.  The reason this is so infuriating to those affected communities is because, just like those who are victims of flooding along the Shannon, this is entirely preventable.  We have engaged and battled with Fingal County Council to get a resolution to this.  We have engaged with Ministers.  Every time, it is batted back.  The Government needs to take some action on this.  It needs to instruct Fingal County Council to protect these homes.  One family described to me the protection available to them.  It is like the fire brigade turning up when one's house is on fire and telling that person that they will not put it out.</p>  <p>  The people along the Shannon deserve to have their homes and businesses protected, and the people along the coast in Portrane and Donabate deserve no less.  I implore the Government to start taking flooding and coastal erosion more seriously.  We cannot escape the fact that much of the damage caused is a result of the climate crisis.  Let us start protecting people, their homes and businesses, as well as tackling the climate crisis.</p></speech>

Year after year, families and farmers across west Offaly have had to deal with the devastating effects of flooding along the Shannon.  This is having a significant impact on residents in west Offaly and those trying to farm on the Shannon Callows.  People from Clonmacnoise to Lusmagh have raised this issue with me.  In 2020 alone, there have been floods in February and July, and as we speak, areas have flooded and are under threat of flooding along the Shannon.  We see that this will continue, especially due to climate change, and that will be a pattern.  This is a serious issue.  I have made repeated representations to the relevant bodies and to the Minister of State.  He recently sent me a reply in this regard.  I am frustrated by the lack of progress and disappointed that we do not have a single authority.  In September 2020, I received a reply from the Minister of State and OPW, following representations that I made on behalf of farmers and residents in that area.  I was informed about the ongoing work of the co-ordination group and the budget of &euro;7 million for the area from Athlone to Lusmagh.</p> <p>I welcome that, if that is happening.  It is some progress.  Unfortunately, however, it is not enough because it is not a single body with authority.  This group has only met twice in some years.  There is a total of 20 agencies, including local authorities, involved in the management and maintenance of the river.  There are clear conflicts and divisions there in respect of the various interests.  The one thing I have learned in life is that if too many people and bodies are responsible, nobody is responsible.  Every public representative knows this.  If one is dealing with an issue and the buck can be passed from one body to another, it is hard to nail the issue down.  It is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.</p> <p> There must be a single body.  The absence of a single body with authority, power and finance has held back progress, not just under this Government but since the foundation of the State.  This has been an issue for decades.  The Bill has been brought forward by Deputy Clarke and Sinn F&eacute;in to resolve this.  Bringing forward legislation to establish a single river management agency on a statutory footing will provide it with powers to manage, carry out drainage works and to construct flood defences and other mitigation works on the River Shannon.</p> <p> There was a suggestion in the past regarding flooding on the Shannon and trying to reduce water levels.  The issue of cutaway bogs is something the Minister of State and his officials might look at again.  That suggestion has been made, and I refer to it in a constructive way.  There might be opportunities to use some cutaway bogs for flood mitigation during periods of heavy rainfall.  We know that in some cases the water cannot get away quickly enough, regardless of what one does, and it could reduce the water levels during periods of high rainfall.  Bord na M&oacute;na has substantial land banks close to the river and in some cases along the river bank.  It might be an option.  I believe it is a real possibility that some of the cutaway bogs could mitigate some of this.</p> <p> It is time we dealt with the devastating impact flooding of the River Shannon is having on farmlands and villages, particularly in places such as Shannon Harbour and other communities in west Offaly.  It is causing severe hardship for residents and farmers.  It is a serious issue that requires a substantial effort.  The Government said it will not knock down this legislation completely.  I urge it not to kick the can down the road for another nine months.  We must do this now, particularly for the people of west Offaly and other communities affected by this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.802" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="21:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300056#GGG00200"><p>I support the Bill.  It is not the first time we have seen a Bill of this nature.  I was doing research earlier and discovered that my former colleague, Willie Penrose, brought forward a similar Bill in 2000.  The issue has been ongoing for a long time.  With due respect to our colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, they are not the first to the party on this matter.  There were attempts as late as 2016 by Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Troy, who is now a Minister of State, to publish a Bill on this.  Up until last March, Deputy Troy gave a commitment to his constituents that he supported the establishment of a single Shannon authority with statutory powers.  March is not very long ago.  In fact, a former Taoiseach, John Bruton, gave a commitment on the issue as well, fad&oacute; fad&oacute;.  This is not new and every party and none has supported the principle of the establishment of a single authority.</p>  <p>  I did not receive a copy of the Minister of State's speech, but I listened carefully to what he said.  My understanding of the Government amendment is that the Bill is deemed to be read "a second time this day nine months, to allow for an examination on the legislative landscape including a review of the current regulatory environment".  One could take that at face value, but I believe the Minister of State qualified his words later in the debate when he said "if appropriate", so Members should forgive me if I am a little jaundiced in my view of whether we will ever see the establishment of a single Shannon authority with statutory powers.  What the Minister of State is telling us in a coded way, if I am interpreting him correctly, is that there are too many regulatory issues and requirements in each of the statutory bodies that are involved in the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group, which is an awful mouthful, to bring them together to form one agency.  The amount of legislation that would be required to do that would probably have the House dealing with it until kingdom come.</p>  <p>  However, we should try, because the problems continue.  I have evidence of the work of the OPW in my constituency of Cork East.  Towns such as Mallow and Fermoy were always top of the news headlines whenever there was a flooding incident.  These towns have benefited from excellent work carried out by the OPW on flood alleviation.  However, there is still the perennial problem of the Shannon.  I represent a Cork constituency, but I recognise the fact that the good people who live in the hinterland of the River Shannon are still encountering problems.  Notwithstanding the facts that there are flood risk management plans, annual work programmes and the Minister of State has set up a short- and medium-term working group, and I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State in this regard, there are still issues in respect of having a view of where we want to go and what the policy is from a high-level perspective with regard to statutory powers, so money can start to flow into each of the problems that affect the people who live on or near the River Shannon.  The best way to do this is through a statutory agency.</p>  <p>  I will repeat the point that was made earlier in respect of the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group.  It has not met regularly.  It does not have statutory powers as a co-ordination group.  I know from past experience - I have been where the Minister of State is now - that there will always be competing agencies in which egos are large, there are turf wars taking place and there is a non-acceptance of responsibility.  The evidence of that is on the River Blackwater at present.  There is a weir that is in such a woeful state of repair that when all the State agencies appeared before the petitions committee of this House last year, each one of them disavowed any responsibility for the repair of said weir.  People's experience has been, and it is hard not to be cynical about this, that they have been led up the hill on too many occasions in the past and promised much, but very little has been delivered.</p>  <p>  I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State, but I do not accept the response from the Government to this issue.  There is a significant majority view on this.  Certainly in Fianna F&aacute;il it was evidenced by its Bill and statements as late as last March, while there is a history in Fine Gael of supporting the principle of setting up a State agency.  Sinn F&eacute;in is now proposing it and we are supporting it.  We brought forward legislation previously on this issue.  I do not believe we should be cowed by the challenge it entails.  One should be honest with people about what one is trying to do and tell them that it could take a number of years to establish.</p> <p>If the Minister is honest and forthright with people about the fact that it will take time to put in place alleviation measures, I think they will accept that.  What they do not accept is being promised something in March and then, in November, for one of the three parties in power to come in to stand over a Government amendment which says that on this day in nine months' time Second Stage will be read.  That is not the way to do business here.  We saw it with the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill and the sick pay scheme.  I appreciate the fact that when there is a tripartite Government, everybody has to be kept on board and happy.  However, that does not answer the questions posed by people have live within the Shannon region and who, as it were, are served by the Shannon.</p> <p> I ask that the Government accept the Second Reading of the Bill tonight and that we would, through the various line committees of the Oireachtas, grapple with what is a serious and laudable aim of every party in this House, namely, to have one agency responsible for dealing this issue.  If there are challenges from a regulatory point of view in terms of aligning and legislating for that, then let us just do it and manage the expectations around what it is that is trying to be achieved.  It is not an insurmountable challenge.  Ireland is a small country.  People know each other.  By and large, relationships are informal.  If a couple of heads have to be knocked together to make it happen in the State agencies, let it be so, but let us try to be progressive about dealing with this issue.  Let us get on with the business.  It has been going on for donkey's years at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.804" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="21:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300057#HHH00200"><p>I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing forward this well-considered and timely Bill.  I am delighted to note as well that it is many of my fellow rural, female Deputies who are taking the lead on it.</p>  <p>  Flooding continues to cause irreparable damage to communities and businesses across Ireland regularly.  We desperately need a proactive, whole-of-government and sustainable response to this issue.  Ministers of State in previous Governments made progress in this area and the programme for Government outlines aspirations in respect of it.  Deputy Sherlock went into the history of the matter in sufficient detail.  It is essential that our response to flooding be more comprehensive.  To properly deal with flooding, we have to consider the broader landscape.  We need to see the end of bad planning and piecemeal interventions.  Flood relief needs to come with afforestation and a watershed approach to flood management.  We also need to play our part to address climate change by reducing our national emissions and fulfilling all of our other climate commitments.</p>  <p>  The Bill represents the type of holistic approach that is needed by creating a single competent authority to co-ordinate flood risk and management along the River Shannon.  A single body clearly responsible for flood management would enable a watershed approach.  This would consider the whole river system as one unit and take an integrated perspective.</p>  <p>  Changes in land use upstream leads to more sedimentation down river.  Building on floodplains increases the risk of flooding and results in more run-off water.  Developments of wetlands reduce their capacity to hold water.  Flooding has so many different interlinked causes and to deal with it we must consider each and every one of the causes together and see how they can be addressed.</p>  <p>  Watershed programmes provide integrated flood management and protections.  We must address the planting of forestry along watercourses.  We must also engage in wetland and habitat restoration activities, fish passage and water quality improvements.  There is also a need for greater co-ordination of planning and developments along rivers.</p>  <p>  We should be working with the landscape, using and enhancing natural defences.  We are familiar with the phrase "flattening the curve" in the context of the pandemic, but it also applies to river flooding.  Measures to strengthen storage upstream, better agricultural land management and sustainable urban drainage systems, are proven methods of addressing flooding with less of an impact on landscapes and towns.  Instead of economically and environmentally costly projects focused on towns, we need to solve the problem by looking at the whole river system.  The single authority this Bill proposes could facilitate this approach.  The current practice of flood management in Ireland prioritises expensive hard engineering works, such as massive, permanent walls and embankments which significantly impact on the natural and cultural landscape.  I hope the proposed agency would take a more nuanced look at understanding the issues involved and propose more proportionate responses.</p>  <p>  A related issue is the level of public involvement in flood management planning and implementation.  Morally and legally, under the Aarhus Convention and related agreements, members of the public have a right to participate in a range of decisions where there may be an environmental impact.  Local knowledge is so important.  Too often, the communities most affected by flooding feel overlooked because their voices are largely disregarded or frustrated by bureaucratic and technical systems.  The creation of a new agency would be an opportunity to avoid such past mistakes and to outline a new partnership model with families, farmers, and businesses along the river.  We should have proactive processes to draw up certain plans and programmes relating to the environment.</p>  <p>  We cannot talk about flooding and not refer to climate change.  The latter is a driving force behind the increased scale and occurrence of flood events in recent years and if we do not take it seriously ,even the OPW's walls will not save us.  Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target is to achieve a 20% reduction of emissions on 2005 levels, but projections indicate it will be in the range of 5% to 6%.  The Government's annual transition statement was released during the summer and its catalogue of our current policy inadequacies should have been a wake-up call.  Action is required immediately.  The past five years, since the signing of the Paris Agreement, have been squandered on shallow gestures and a focus on efficiencies over achievements.  We need action, not only because of the inevitable fines, but because of the moral obligation we have to the next generation.</p>  <p>  The proposed Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is most welcome.  However, its deficiencies are already being highlighted.  It is severely lacking in terms of climate governance, accountability, and target ambition.  We need real climate action, backed up by robust legislation if we are to address flooding.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, and I thank Deputies for highlighting flooding and for speaking up for their communities.  I look forward to contributing more to the Bill on Committee Stage.  I hope that there is scope for amendments that increase public participation mechanisms and seek sustainable flooding solutions.</p></speech>

Having worked with the then Ministers of State, Deputy Canney and Kevin Boxer Moran, regarding the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group, as some of the State agencies in the group came under my responsibility when I was Minister, I know at first hand the challenges that exist and exactly what the Minister has elaborated and pointed out in his contribution.  When I was Minister, we tried to amalgamate Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte and that had to be abandoned because of the legal complexities involved in bringing two relatively young State agencies together.  If a new agency is to be established, it will take at least five years to produce legislation and this will then be challenged the whole way to Europe.  I can safely say that it will be a decade from now at the earliest before it becomes operational.  We need to be honest with people in that regard.</p>  <p>  The reality is that we do not have ten years.  We need to see action now to address summer flooding and the scale of winter flooding, which families in my community are experiencing as we speak.  I accept the core argument for the Bill, that is, that we do need a single, accountable authority that has the legal authority, first, to manage the water levels on the lakes and at weirs; second, to remove the pinch points south of Athlone, which will ultimately lead within the next five years to the removal of Meelick Weir; third, to remove the pinch points north of Lough Ree and; fourth, to carry out an ongoing maintenance programme on the Shannon and its tributaries.</p> <p>I believe that legal responsibility should be given to the OPW to achieve those four objectives, as well as a legal responsibility to address flooding in general.  This should be put in place now.  I agree with the core argument behind this Bill that there is a lack of co-ordination.<br/><br/>In a reply to a parliamentary question on 13 October, the Minister of State stated:</p><blockquote>	The ESB is responsible for managing the water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg.  The levels in between the lakes are managed by Waterways Ireland for navigation purposes.  Both organisations are members of the [co-ordination] group and communicate on a daily basis to ensure a co-ordinated approach to managing water levels. </blockquote> <p>On 3 July last, Waterways Ireland had half of its 30 sluice gates at Meelick weir open.  The protocol stipulated that on that day it should open all of the gates as the water levels were continuing to rise.  Between 3 July and 7 July, just five of the 15 gates were opened.  On 3 July, however, as Waterways Ireland opened the gates at Meelick to reduce the rising waters - at far too slow a rate I must add - the ESB decided to open two additional sluice gates in Athlone, bringing it to six gates opened in Athlone.  All six gates were left open for the next five days until the lands of farmers north of Meelick were flooded.  For five days, there was no co-ordination between the ESB in Athlone and Waterways Ireland in Meelick.  In between, the people within the Shannon Callows were flooded.  That was the fundamental problem that led to the flooding that took place last July and during summer.  It was because of a lack of co-ordination.<br/><br/>I have been consistently told here from meetings that I had with the ESB down through the years that we could not address the water levels on Lough Ree, Lough Allen and Lough Derg.  These all need to be reduced to provide additional capacity.  When Brian Hayes was in the Minister of State's position, however, the operational level of Lough Ree was reduced by a full metre on a pilot basis.  When Kevin Boxer Moran was Minister of State, Lough Allen's level was reduced by 0.7 m.  It can and has been done despite what the ESB has said in the past.  It is clear that there is a lack of co-ordination.<br/><br/>In a reply to a parliamentary question on 1 October, the Minister of State indicated that a decision was taken last year to allocate &euro;7 million to carry out a programme of maintenance between Athlone and Meelick in order to remove the pinch points.  That money was secured by the OPW, which handed over &euro;500,000 to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to allow Waterways Ireland to carry out the various implementation programmes that need to be done in advance of works starting.  That has not happened, however.  Again, a decision was taken 12 months ago and funding was provided to Waterways Ireland by the OPW but we will not see action until sometime next year.  That is why I believe we need a short Bill to give the OPW legal responsibility for this, hold it accountable for it and let it drive the change that clearly is not happening as I have identified.<br/><br/>I have raised the problems relating to turloughs in Roscommon and Galway privately with the Minister of State and with the chair of the OPW.  There are problems with Lough Funshinagh and Correal turlough outside of Roscommon town.  There are also problems with Castleplunket, Bushfield and Lisserdrea turloughs.  For the first three of those, we have a practical solution.  What we need to see, however, is action.<br/><br/>We also need to see the cost-benefit analysis.  A commitment was given that the cost-benefit analysis would clearly reflect the impact that flooding of turloughs has where water remains for a considerable time, unlike the flash flooding that would take place in other parts of the country.  That cost-benefit analysis has yet to be introduced.  Will the Minister of State introduce a specific cost-benefit analysis of turloughs in order that we have a fair assessment of projects that can be carried out to alleviate problems within their catchment areas?<br/><br/>At Lough Funshinagh, in the past five years some 300 acres of land that historically never flooded have been permanently underwater.  As a result of that, farmers recently received threatening letters from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I raised this issue directly with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and informed him that what is happening was unacceptable.  These letters contain threats to penalise farmers because, through no fault of their own, 300 acres of land that would historically have been available for farming are not now available.  We need to see a flexible approach being taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the basic payment scheme and with areas of natural constraints payments.  Practical short-term solutions must be brought in to protect homes and farms within the catchment areas of these turloughs with long-term solutions brought forward as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

The arguments being made now were being made then.  In the Galway East constituency, we started the Dunkellin flood relief scheme in 2016.  The Official Report will show it was discussed in the House in the 1940s between Members from the constituency who knew how to do it.  However, it did not get done until 2016.  Sometimes things move a lot slower than we would like.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to speak on this Bill.  It brings into focus an issue on which I worked when I was in the OPW, namely, trying to get this co-ordination group focused.  There is a great team involved.  However, sometimes it gets distracted by other matters.  Accordingly, there has to be strong leadership if we are going to get the results we need.</p>  <p>  When I was Minister of State, I met many people who suffered as a result of the Shannon flooding.  What is forgotten is that there are legacy issues with the Shannon.  A huge amount of silt has been put into the river over decades which was never removed.  This was in the bygone days of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Its productivity is now coming to an end, which means that the problem has not been there for the past several years.  The ESB has responsibilities but has not cleared channels or kept the water flowing.  The Dutch philosophy is that we need to make way for the river.  If we do not make way for the water to flow, it will flood out onto the land regardless.  How do we prevent that?  Basic engineering principles state one starts by getting the outlet right and working one's way back.  Many artificial blockages have been created which prevent the water from flowing or cannot get out.</p>  <p>  We must also face up to the fact that a large volume of rain has fallen recently, with water levels increasing.  I heard Deputy Rabbitte speak recently about a one-in-100-year event that happened five years ago.  We have had four of them since.</p>  <p>  We need to recognise that work is being done.  The work on the pinch points, which I believe will be the basis of everything, must be sorted out.</p> <p>If the Minister of State focuses on that for the next nine or 12 months we will achieve something that will help people.  We will help the people in the Shannon Callows and the people whose houses are flooding.  We will also reduce the levels by creating capacity.  Deputy Stanley spoke about using cutaway bogs as places to dump floodwater.  I have checked all of those options out.  I come from an engineering background.  The volume of water that could be stored there would be such a small percentage of the flood as to make no difference.  Every approach has been tested over time.  The OPW has done a huge amount of work.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has also been very involved and has led by example.  In December 2016, for the first time in many years, we saw machines going out onto the Shannon to clear channels as a result of joint efforts between the Office of Public Works and Waterways Ireland.  That work has continued.  Works programmes have been prepared.  The one thing the Minister of State is missing, though it is not his fault, is legislation allowing him to direct those bodies to get work done more quickly. </p> <p> During the Estimates process last year I reviewed the work of the Office of Public Works.  That agency had intended to start six flood relief schemes last year.  It started two.  That had nothing to do with the Shannon Group or legislation.  Whether we like it or not, the consents that are required and the environmental issues that are raised constitute a huge barrier.  I launched that scheme in Cork in 2016.  Cork flooded three weeks ago.  The scheme has not moved on because people object and want to do something else.  The scheme has been delayed for the last five years.  Why are business people in Cork suffering again this year?  We have to be honest when we talk about bringing in legislation.  I have said to people on the ground that we should concentrate our efforts on getting work done rather than on legislation.  I looked at introducing a single authority when I was the Minister of State.  I did not do so because I could have been mired in a legal swamp for five years while trying to get something done.  Everybody would have taken their eyes off the ball and forgotten why we are here.  We want to reduce the level of flooding, reduce the pinch points, do the clearing work and get on with it. </p> <p> I am passionate about this.  People tell me that everything would be solved if we had a single authority.  I can guarantee that if we start tonight, a legal authority will not be in place in ten years and whoever is Minister then will still be introducing legislation to try to cover the Government's tracks.  Whoever is Minister in ten years will be tied up in all of that instead of getting the work done. </p> <p> This is all about co-ordination.  We have so many agencies, but the process can be boiled down.  The Minister of State is the chair of a committee that brings all the relevant agencies together.  He will be driving these people and they will be trying to get the work done.  In the next six to eight months we will see work done to remove some pinch points.  That is how slow progress will be.  Deputy Naughten mentioned the money that was given to Waterways Ireland.  It has been carrying out work, but one does not see the effects on the ground.  People are frustrated because land and houses are being flooded in the meantime.  This is compounded by the summer floods in the Shannon Callows.  I have met people there on several occasions.  They are so demoralised because they have not seen any progress.  The only thing I can say to them is that we can help the Minister to install the works they want.  They are not looking for legislation.  They want the work to be done. </p> <p> Personally I feel we have too many laws.  We are creating barriers for ourselves.  I would not like to see us waste our time on legislation when we need to get work done.  I do not say that to detract from the sentiment of this Bill.  I will ask the Minister for one thing.  A lot of Deputies here are passionate about this.  They have experienced the flooding in their counties.  Their families and friends are farmers.  Perhaps the Minister of State would consider setting up a forum or webinar through which all Deputies with an interest in this can advise the Minister of State and provide him with our knowledge and ideas on how to resolve this.  That would help.  People propose postponing this for nine months.  I would hope that the Minister of State will look at the existing structure and give the OPW the legal basis to drive this forward for the next ten years. </p> <p> I refer also to the River Suck, which feeds into the River Shannon.  We do not talk about our other rivers.  Local authorities do not have the financial wherewithal to clean these channels.  Deputy Naughten will know about one funny situation where riverine fishing rights are controlled by the ESB.  We have to sort that out as well.  It is strange that someone living in Dunnaman must pay for a licence to fish but one does not have to pay for a licence on the Shannon.  These small areas, which are trying to promote tourism, are suffering because of this.  I visited them last year.  The people deserve a little better.  We need to clear archaic legislation, rules and regulations out of the pond. </p> <p> I have no doubt that the Minister of State's heart is in the right place, or that his team and the Office of Public Works will deliver.  However, we need to work together.  I have always said that flooding should never be a political issue.  This issue is very close to my heart because I have seen flooding cause so much devastation in my own constituency and throughout the country.  We can do more and better, but we must maintain our focus.  I wish the Minister of State well in his role.  I am here to support him and to support the OPW.  We must bring together everyone who has an interest in this and make sure that at the end of the day we deliver rather than talk.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Sinn F&eacute;in as &eacute; a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach agus ba mhaith liom fuascailt a fh&aacute;il &oacute;n bhfadhb seo.</p>  <p>  I am very happy to speak on this Bill.  This issue has generated significant concern in the midlands and throughout rural Ireland.  I am one of the frustrated Deputies referred to by Deputy Canney.  In July and the summer months we had issues along the Shannon and farmers' lands were flooded.  A lot of farmers were affected.  Livestock had to be moved.  There was huge confusion around the sluice gates at Meelick.  I remember contacting the Minister of State's office and the OPW.  This is a recurring issue.  I remember raising it when I was a county councillor in 2014.  It has gone on for too long.  I hope that tonight's discussion will not be another meaningless talking shop.  We need concrete actions.  People are becoming very frustrated and angry over the whole issue.  I sincerely hope we can all be constructive and work together to formulate solutions to this ongoing issue which people really want resolved.  </p>  <p>  As we know, flooding has far-reaching and devastating impacts such as emotional stress, the loss of individual homes and the loss of farmland or businesses.  Severe health issues are associated with flooding, as well as dramatic declines in economic competitiveness in impacted communities and regions.  I accept that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is sincere when he speaks about his desire to address these matters, but as always the real issue is the lack of tangible outcomes.</p> <p>Time and again, my colleagues have called on the Department and the OPW to immediately escalate their response to ongoing flooding issues affecting farmers and residents, particularly in west Offaly where approximately 200 farmers are affected by flooding caused by the River Shannon.  In the village of Riverstown, which straddles the Tipperary-Offaly border, there is an issue with the River Brosna.  The Government needs to get to grips with these issues.  I am highlighting them again tonight in the hope that solutions can be put in place.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the response to this issue from the Government side has been lethargic at best.  I hope that will change.  I am constantly in contact with several farmers from west Offaly who are profoundly alarmed by the apparent lack of action.  Many of them have grazing land that can only be used for two months of the year, as a result of which they are at risk of fodder shortages.  The stress and hardship they must endure is unbelievable.  I am calling for that hardship to end.</p> <p> I have always maintained that this matter demands a whole-of-government approach because of the nature of the damage to farms and the significant threat to the provision of fodder as a result of flooding.  Unfortunately, as I have stated previously, for a significant number of farmers in Offaly and right across the midlands, the rain and flooding are becoming as predictable as the Government's lack of response.  I sincerely hope that will change.  I will be the first person to welcome any such change.</p> <p> Members are aware that the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme has been meeting for the best part of a decade to develop strategies for the reduction of risk.  I have become very cynical about all of the reports that have been produced without any action being taken.  A small number of actions from the reports should be agreed and then carried through.  There is a terrible problem here; it just seems to be reports all the time.  I remember discussing such reports while I was a member of Offaly County Council.  A significant amount of time was wasted talking about them but very little was done.  I would like to see an end to reports and a start to more focused actions.</p> <p> The Bill calls for a single agency to be set up.  I believe that is urgently needed.  There is significant confusion.  I remember being contacted by farmers in July and having to run from the OPW to the ESB and on to the office of the Minister.  The current set-up is a disaster.  We need to have one management authority to effectively manage the River Shannon.  That would be a pragmatic response to a difficult and complex issue.  Despite the fact that there has been much highlighting of this issue, a priority question I tabled was ruled inadmissible by the Department of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  The Green Party is full of aspiration but it does not seem to care about communities in rural Ireland that are being flooded.  The question I submitted specifically dealt with issues related to Waterways Ireland, which falls under the remit of that Department, yet the question was rejected.  That is not the kind of engagement that I or any other rural Deputy deserves or wishes to see going forward.</p></speech>

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing it forward.  I commiserate with the people along the Shannon and in its catchment area.  Members have seen television reports showing what they have suffered and endured and continue to endure, such as their homes being flooded.  There is nothing more horrible than a house that is flooded.  The water comes up the toilet from the sewer and all that and the house is ruined and never the same again.  It is horrible to see a slatted tank full of water with cattle inside it.  There may be small calves in it, paddling around in the water.  That is terrible and horrible and people should not have to endure it.</p>  <p>  I agree that there have been enough studies.  The time for studying is over.  Action needs to be taken.  There has never been as many excavators or as much technical equipment for taking levels and all that.  We did not have that equipment in the past.  I have been told that the River Shannon has not been properly dredged since the English did it back in the 1880s, which is very sad.  There is no excuse for it.  There should be no prohibition on taking silt or blockages out of the river.  In County Kerry, for approximately ten years until 2018, the River Flesk flooded regularly.  Fourteen homes were being flooded constantly.  The N22 was being flooded.  Thankfully, the former Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, came down and stood on Curreal Bridge.  I thank him for coming down.  He gave us &euro;160,000 to clear the branches that were blocking the river.  We were flooded out of it in late 2015 and early 2016 but the road and houses have not been flooded since the work was done.  It only took three weeks of cutting branches and trees.  It is a delight to pass up and down by the river now.   There have been serious floods as recently as last week, but only a small bit of work is needed and that work can be done.</p>  <p>  Surely it is more important to please and appease the people whose homes, lands and businesses are being flooded than to be worried about environmentalists who do not have to endure flooding.  That is the sad fact of the matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who is present, might be afraid of the environmentalists, but what would the story be if the people whose homes, businesses and farms are being flooded took a court case against the State for not doing anything to help them?  That is what the Government should be worried about because what is happening is not fair.  The ordinary, good-living people who have done nothing wrong must be listened to.</p>  <p>  There has been a lot of talk about holding back water.  CFRAM is trying to hold back water in various parts of the country, but I do not support that approach.  There is a river running through Castleisland.  It was cleaned out in the late 1950s and early 1960s and the place was fine for many years.  Now there is a proposal to spend &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million to enclose a 12 acre field with a wall to hold back the water.  That is rubbish.  It is a waste of good money.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland is proposing to raise the road in Glenflesk but the road has not flooded since the work was done on the river.  All that needs to be done is to maintain the river, ensure it is kept free from blockages and let the water flow.  If one has a glass of water and half fills it with sugar, what will happen?  The water will come out over the top of the glass.  All the Department needs to do is to clean out the pinch points and blockages.  That will relieve the people who are affected by flooding and give them a chance to carry on.  If a river did not flood in the past, why should it be flooding now?</p>  <p>  I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute on the Bill.  I support the people living along the Shannon and in the Shannon catchment area.  They need attention.  All Members will support them but we are depending on the Minister of State to get working, get machines out there and get levels taken to ensure that places will not continue to be flooded.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.814" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300060#LLL00300"><p>I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Party for tabling the Bill which is very much to be welcomed.  It is a Bill I will support.  I commend the Minister of State on the constructive approach the Government is taking on the Bill.  It is an acknowledgement that we need to move forward in a considered way.  The way the Minister of State is proposing to allow some time to effectively consider what exactly needs to be done is to be commended.</p>  <p>  The one issue I wish to particularly raise is that of the Shannon fishery.  The ESB has undoubtedly been one of the success stories of this State.  I think I can claim without fear of contradiction that it is the most successful semi-State company in the country.  ESB International is successful beyond our shores.  Very few people would take issue with the success of the ESB.</p> <p>However, it is not unfair to point out that the ESB has been considerably less successful with the management of the Shannon fishery, which is one of the largest inland state-owned fisheries in Europe.  At the time of independence, pursuant to the Shannon Fisheries Act when it came under the ownership of the ESB because of Ardnacrusha, the fishery was a major resource for landowners adjacent to it.  Families were fed by fishing the Shannon and it was a major tourism resource.  Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons that is no longer the case.  Salmon stocks in particular have declined significantly.  It is not just because of what the ESB has or has not done; there has been a decline right across the north Atlantic for which we cannot blame the ESB.</p> <p> We need to take steps to ensure that when the Shannon is managed, it is managed as a navigation resource and is properly drained.  Importantly, the ecosystem needs to be protected.  Protecting the fishery and ensuring that responsibility for it is taken away from the ESB and it is managed as part of that management structure is key.  We need to look at the effect Parteen weir has on fish, in particular fish not being able to pass Ardnacrusha.  I appreciate the infrastructure required to address that issue will not be cheap.</p> <p> Notwithstanding its profits and success over the years, the ESB has not put the necessary infrastructure in place, nor has it dredged rivers.  All the tributaries of the Shannon also form part of the Shannon fishery.  The ESB has had to be brought to the steps of the High Court on many occasions by small fishing clubs to get it to manage those rivers.  Managing and dredging them to improve the trout and salmon hatcheries means they also drain better for the landowners adjacent to them in the winter.  I do not want to take any more of the limited time.  I commend both Sinn F&eacute;in and the Government on the approach they have taken.  I urge that the Shannon fishery be managed by the new body. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.816" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="22:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300061#MMM00200"><p>I fully support the proposal to establish a River Shannon management agency.  Over many years, I have called for a single overarching authority to manage the Shannon.  As an MEP, I represented eight of the 11 counties through which the Shannon flows, namely, Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Clare and Galway.  I have attended meetings in all those counties, dealing for the most part with flooding.  For the past 20 years, at every meeting without exception, I have heard landowners, homeowners, business owners, community groups and environmental groups all call for a single body to co-ordinate the work of the agencies that manage the Shannon.</p>  <p>  The Shannon is a massive piece of infrastructure that has been neglected since the foundation of the State.  It has been used as a dumping ground for fallen trees and thousands of tonnes of silt that come from our commercial bogs.  Thousands of people in many of the counties I mentioned cannot get flood insurance.  They live in constant fear of heavy rain.  Our main problem with flooding is that we react to floods and do not prepare for them.  The creation of an overarching authority for the Shannon is crucial and will mean we do not deal with problems in a piecemeal fashion.</p>  <p>  I support the Government amendment, provided that the nine-month period is used to draw up a comprehensive plan to fully co-ordinate the work and responses of the agencies.  Earlier, I listened to Deputy Canney, whose commitment to alleviating flooding is unquestioned.  He warns against getting tied up in red tape and the need to continue with different schemes in parallel with any legislation establishing the agency.</p>  <p>  It is crucial that we involve local people in decision-making.  Some time ago, I met a group in Carrick-on-Shannon which has professional expertise as well as local knowledge, often acquired over generations, on everything from water flow and pinch points to soil types and managing water levels.  All of this needs to feed into a fuller understanding of how to manage this great river.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The Government has moved an amendment to the Bill.  However, we should not play politics with the Shannon, which covers 11 different counties.  There are people tortured in all those counties.  I ask everybody to come together.  This is about the future.  We will not drain the river tomorrow or next week.  We will not solve its issues in a few days.  We need to come together.  This is above politics; it is about people.</p>  <p>  I stood above in Lough Allen when the level was at 46.2 m.  I will remember it for the rest of my life.  If it was dropped to that level, it would give Carrick-on-Shannon 14 days.  People up there have done the analysis.  At Jamestown weir there is a problem with the gate.  We stood with the former Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, in Termonbarry a year ago.  There was &euro;8 million worth of gear.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate whether this has been bought or is in water.  Where is it this gear?  It was going to clear where there is water at a particular height at one level at Termonbarry and it is about 5 ft. lower at the other level.</p>  <p>  Rivers such as the Suck, the Rinn and the Brosna feed into the River Shannon.  If water is coming in - no more than if there are five taps feeding in - there must be an exit.  I have driven diggers.  I went to Athleague when they were raving about it flooding for years.  By simply jumping up on a digger, the problem was solved.  The regulations down through the years have been made very clear.  We went to Europe when Deputy Harkin was an MEP.  If there is an emergency, people should go in and address it.  Forget about environmentalists, laws and everything else; just drive in and get it sorted.</p>  <p>  The first thing that needs to be done is down in Limerick.  Generally, it is appropriate to start at the head of a river to get it sorted.  Below where there was what I would call the spillover, it is blocked by trees.  Unless they are ripped out, regardless of who is giving out, blocking or whatever, unless the trees are ripped out from one end to the other, an overflow for the Shannon is needed.</p>  <p>  I question whether we need Ardnacrusha.  This year, farmers have not cut meadow in most of the Callows.  I have talked to them in Bornacoola in Leitrim, Roscommon and Longford and they have been snookered all year.</p>  <p>  I believe the Minister of State should get the nine months' delay, but we will hold him accountable at the end.  We should work together.  As Deputy Martin Kenny said, the Deputies who are interested in this should get together, forget about the politics and get it sorted.  One Sunday evening about a month ago, the Shannon disappeared automatically.  What we mean by "disappear" is a drop of a couple of feet where the Callows are.  Why did that happen?  Who let the water go?  Those are the questions.  The Minister of State needs to be given the powers to crack the whip and ensure people are not left with their tongues out trying to save their houses and farms.</p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister of State to ensure the levels are dropped.  At the moment we are running at dangerous levels.  Yesterday evening, the roads in Cloonown were flooded.  If we keep allowing that, people will get frustrated.  People are sick of hearing about nothing being done about the Shannon.  I ask the Minister of State to concentrate on it.  We will work with him on it.  The Bill is a help but we all need to work together on this issue.</p>  <p>  I invite the Minister of State to come to counties Roscommon and Galway.  I looked at Lough Funshinagh a few years ago.  Every type of guru has come to it and said what they would do measuring levels.  Water is water; it comes down and we need to get it out.  The OPW needs to go in and do the job.  Local authorities have to give 10% of the cost but they do not have it and will not do it.  There is no point in us codding ourselves.  We have Correal and Glenamaddy turlough and I ask the Minister of State to come down and look at those.  These problems are solvable and would let people live a normal life.</p></speech>

I agree with many of those who have proposed it that it complements what we had sought in opposition.  It also complements remarks I made six weeks ago, as a previous speaker noted, when I sought an intervention similar to that proposed to deal with the issues around the Shannon flood risk management agency.  The response from the Government this evening and discussions I have had with officials with relevant expertise in the Department and the Minister illustrate that there is a political commitment and a recognition that the agency in its current form does not have the capacity to address this issue in the manner necessary.  How could it be otherwise given that, as previous speakers noted, winter flooding is getting worse and summer flooding is now becoming the norm?  In my constituency, some 200 farms in the Shannon Callows in west and south-west Offaly were under water in July.  This is happening regularly and is no longer a once-off occurrence.  Recently we have seen, through the best will and commitment in the world, efforts such as the CFRAM programme, an EU protocol, pilot pinch programmes and works, and selective flooding through the opening of gates at time.</p>  <p>  Some of those proposing the Bill spoke of how the agency had potential in its infancy.  That potential cannot be realised unless the agency has sufficient statutory powers.  We must pass the legislation necessary to give it those powers and provide for accountability.  I compliment and note the constructive contributions of other Members, including Deputy Canney who has much expertise in this area having been a Minister of State in the Department.  They recognised the potential in the Government's response to the Bill.  In acknowledging the contributions of Deputies, I encourage everyone with responsibilities in this area, not only Deputies but also the relevant stakeholders, including the existing agency, to collaborate and meet the commitment set out in the Minister of State's statement.  That would give this D&aacute;il an opportunity to resolve this issue in an amicable way which meets all our approval.  I hope that giving the authority the necessary powers will have the desired impact.</p>  <p>  My party spent nine years in opposition.  We are now in government and in a position where we might leave office having achieved a goal set by my party in the motions referred to earlier and recording a success in this area.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, it is not as if we are going to drain the Shannon in the next nine months.  There is potential for an all-party commitment and ownership among the parties and those with responsibility at ministerial and Government level.  We are in a position to achieve progress on Committee Stage.  We can all be associated with that progress and sell it to our constituents who for too long have been left with no prospect of unity of purpose among all those who have responsibility for achieving success. </p></speech>

Its purpose is to establish a River Shannon management agency on a statutory basis within the OPW with overall responsibility for the assessment and management of flood risk and flood defences along the River Shannon.  I can sense the sincere passion in the voices of those who have spoken on this very important matter.</p>  <p>  The River Shannon is a valuable natural resource that is important to Ireland&rsquo;s economy, society, culture and environment.  It serves an important purpose for electricity generation, navigation, tourism and fishing.  It creates employment and supports these activities.  It rises in County Cavan and flows for 260 km before entering the Shannon Estuary at Limerick city.  An unusual feature of the River Shannon is that it is remarkably flat, with the majority of the fall in height taking place on the 24 km stretch between Killaloe and Limerick.  This is the natural drainage basin of the Shannon which drains an extensive area of central Ireland.  However, these features can combine, resulting in flooding. </p>  <p>  The Government has a plan in place to deal with flooding on the Shannon through the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  This programme was the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State.  The output of the CFRAM programme was the 29 flood risk management plans to address the assessed flood risk nationally, which were approved by the Government in 2018.  It examined 80% of the properties at risk from future flooding which involved a study of 300 communities nationally.  One of the six CFRAM study areas included a dedicated study of the flood risk of the Shannon river basin district.  </p>  <p>  The flood risk management plans, FRMPs, derived from the CFRAM programme include 34 new flood relief schemes to protect towns in the Shannon river basin district.  These new schemes, together with 11 additional schemes already completed, will protect 95% of properties at significant risk from flooding in the future.  Of the 34 new schemes to be delivered, work has commenced on 25 and they are at various stages of development.</p>  <p>  The Shannon State agency co-ordination working group set up in 2016 is co-ordinating the overall response to flood risk management on the Shannon informed by assessment of flood risk carried out under the CFRAM.  The working group is performing well.  It has identified and delivered activities that are providing flood relief in the area and is focused on providing additional flood relief measures to protect communities, businesses, landowners and property along the Shannon.  However, the current regulatory framework in which it operates is such that progress in advancing its programme of activities can be impacted by the range of regulatory requirements which must be addressed and complied with.  This can lead to delays in implementing its programme of activities. </p>  <p>  When facing a major challenge such as this it makes sense for us to look to other European countries which have successfully faced down similar challenges.  The Dutch are renowned for their skill in flood management.  We might think of their dykes that prevent the North Sea from flooding a country that is mostly below sea level but the Dutch are also at risk of being flooded by the rivers that flow in from neighbouring countries.  For hundreds of years, they have developed techniques that have protected them from flooding.  It makes absolute sense to learn from their expertise.  We should collaborate with the Dutch and learn how they manage their high-tech room for the river approach to mitigating flooding.  It is not just their technology but also how they manage to get different agencies to work together.  The Delta programme, which still operates, is a scheme by which the Dutch get their local and regional authorities and water boards to co-operate in a way that allows a centralised and effective delivery of schemes.  I recently met officials from the Dutch embassy to discus other areas of expertise the Dutch have in areas such as sustainable transport and retrofitting.  We should reopen that channel and collaborate to see what we can gain from that.   </p>  <p>  I am fully supportive of an examination of the current regulatory requirements as they pertain to management of the Shannon, as has been outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, and I look forward to contributing to this examination and to its outcome in due course.</p></speech>

I listened to the response of the Ministers of State.  It is good that it will be re-examined in nine months.  At this time of year, the end of my back garden transforms from a nice green area to a field with swans and a few ducks.  I fully understand the problem.  I live only a mile from Clonlara.  Deputies McNamara, Wynne and Carey all know how bad things are down there when the Parteen weir spills over and floods the area for six or seven weeks every year.  This is still called a 100-year phenomenon but it is an annual event.  This agency must be established.</p>  <p>  We need to examine the EU habitats directives and all the EU's environmental laws over the years.  </p> <p>We seem to implement them a little differently from how it is done in other countries.  The logs and butts of trees that wash down from the midlands end up in the river around Plassey and Clonlara, where there are now protected habitats.  They gather up silt and become, in effect, little islands.  This is material that gets washed down in a flood and it needs to be taken out because it clogs up the channel of the river.  A farmer near me often said, about one of the smaller tributaries locally, that for every metre one dredges down, that becomes a metre one takes off the bottom of the river.  It has to be banked 1 m high, which creates a 2 m deficit.  It is the only answer.  A full dredging of our rivers has not been done since the foundation of the State 100 years ago.</p></speech>

The flooding we have witnessed on lands adjacent to the River Shannon has been devastating for a large number of households, farms and businesses in my county of Tipperary.  The problem has been getting worse and more frequent.  We have all seen the pictures and heard the accounts of those affected and we have listened to the plans to address the problem.  In Tipperary, the impact is devastating for many.  Large areas of farmland are submerged every year, with both long-term impacts and an immediate loss of earnings for farmers as the plans they have made for the year to come are set back.  This can come at a significant cost.  Businesses in parts of the county see footfall drop off as water levels on Lough Derg rise above a certain point.  Others have seen their stock destroyed.  The problem is made worse because insurance companies will not cover them.  It disheartens me that there are homeowners and business owners in my county who know they will be impacted by rising water levels on the Shannon.  They are helpless in the face of the surging current.  As I said, many cannot get insurance to help them pick up the pieces afterwards because the problem is so persistent.</p>  <p>  Studies have shown that flooding has become more frequent over the past 60 years, with the volume of flooding increasing by 5% per decade.  It seems that the impact of climate change will make that problem worse in the years to come.  There is a lot of focus on climate change right now, including the increase in carbon tax that was signed off by the Government.  However, a co-ordinated strategy to address flooding along the length of the River Shannon is not being given adequate priority.  The programme for Government includes a reference to expanding the river basis management plan, but the River Shannon does not feature as a headline issue.  We have seen how minor works upriver have had a negative impact on communities downriver.  This is an example of how a comprehensive approach to dealing with the challenges posed by flooding on the Shannon is not being taken.  This fragmented approach has made matters worse for some while bringing improvements for others.  It also causes delays.</p>  <p>  When it comes to who is responsible for the proper management of the Shannon, the list runs to 20 bodies, including the ESB, Waterways Ireland, the OPW and the local authorities.  This means there is little in the way of leadership or a co-ordinated response, leaving communities with the impression that their needs and the impact on the local environment are not understood.  It means that while there are plenty of agencies involved in managing the waterway, any actions that could prevent the type of flooding we are seeing lack a central point of focus.  The approach to dealing with the problems is, as I said, fragmented.  There are very real concerns that if a single agency is not created and tasked with the co-ordinated management and maintenance of the river and with anti-flood measures, then the works and schemes needed are not going to happen within a reasonable timeframe.  As a result, the risk to life and livelihood will continue.</p>  <p>  The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, is one of the voices calling for a single agency to deal with the issue of flooding along the River Shannon.  Farmers are the custodians of the land.  They know the land, how the river interacts with it and the impacts rising water levels have on it.  They say that a single agency is needed.  Last March, Michael Silke of the Mid-Shannon Flood Relief Group accused the State authorities of not listening to the farmers and communities who are consistently being impacted by the flooding of the River Shannon.  He, too, called for a single agency to assume responsibility for the management of the river.  Fianna F&aacute;il also advocated a single agency approach when it was in opposition.  The party has a chance now to make the change it called for when its members were on this side of the House.  The Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group was set up to examine these issues but, as far as I can see, it has met no more than a dozen times since its establishment in 2016.  Its impact has been limited and communities in certain areas continue to be subjected to intense flooding.</p>  <p>  The interests of the stakeholders up and down the River Shannon must be addressed in a comprehensive manner that is consistent in its approach and includes a plan of action.  This is the only way we can successfully tackle the problem.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill seeks to do just that and offers an effective strategy for managing Ireland's largest river.  A single agency would bring all these separate interests together and facilitate an agreement with local communities and organisations to maintain and adjust water levels to meet the requirements of all concerned.  The agency would co-ordinate the work of the key stakeholders involved in the management and maintenance of the Shannon and co-ordinate flood prevention efforts.  It would consult with all stakeholders and provide the Minister with a strategic plan for the river within three months of its establishment.  It would also have the ability to reach an agreement with any other bodies that may have an interest in a particular course of action that is being considered.  This would make progress faster and draw on the knowledge base of all interested parties.</p>  <p>  Constituents of mine who live along the Shannon have had enough of the disjointed approach adopted to date to the ongoing flooding problems.  For the sake of the thousands of home owners, businesses and farmers whose future is dependent on the proper management of the river, I appeal to all Deputies to support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.823" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="22:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300063#OOO00300"><p>We have heard from Deputies representing a dozen or so different constituencies throughout the State.  The one point that echoes loud and clear in all their contributions is that there is a serious problem with the management of the River Shannon.  We must do better in this regard.  Added to the complexities and issues we are currently facing is the unknown quantity of the future impact of climate change.  While we do not know or agree on what that might be, we should, at the very least, agree on the need to be prepared.  We do not have a huge amount of data on our rivers and the data we do have only go back to the 1960s.  As Dr. Mary Bourke of Trinity College has noted, we cannot definitively conclude that increasing flood levels are or are not related to climate change.  Either may be the case and we must be prepared for all eventualities.</p>  <p>  It is unreasonable not to try to make predictions and face up to a future that could be twice as devastating as what the situation is today for the people in the 11 counties along the River Shannon.  The data we do have show that, in each decade, the volume of flooding has increased by approximately 5%.  That is measured in cubic metres of water released per second.  For people living in the areas that are at risk of flooding, these figures will strike fear and anxiety as they try to calculate what exactly a yearly increase of 5% will mean for their home, family farm, livestock, livelihood and their children's future.  Earlier this year, a constituent of mine in Longford had to move livestock off his land because of rising water levels.  One might say that this is par for the course in the agricultural world but, in his case, it is the first time in the generations his family has farmed the land that livestock had to be moved from that area.  Last night, I spoke to a business owner in Athlone who told me he is already monitoring the water levels and ensuring there is space to move stock and fittings at very short notice should the need arise.</p>  <p>  The best chance to deal with flooding on the River Shannon is to allow this Bill is to progress in its entirety.  We cannot allow this ongoing failure to persist.  We must not allow the problem to continue to be put on the long finger.  This is an urgent issue for the homes and livelihoods of the residents of the 11 counties through which the Shannon flows.  We, as their elected representatives, should treat the matter as urgently as they do.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the Government amendment, support the Bill on Second Stage and allow it go to committee for scrutiny.  There is no justification for delaying these proposals and kicking them down the road for nine months.  The people of these 11 counties do not have nine months to wait.  The amendment is a ridiculous proposal that is reflective of the attitude of Governments for decades.  How can the Minister of State realistically be happy to delay a Bill which he clearly recognises has merit?</p> <p>Multiple Governments have had plenty of time to date to effectively deal with this.  How does the Minister of State go back to these communities, look his constituents in the eye and sell this amendment as a good idea that is in their best interests?  How does he tell them that they must wait another nine months - nine months of despair, worry and distress - before an agency with responsibility is even considered?  People are more well informed than others give them credit for.  In nine months' time, it will be August, when the D&aacute;il is traditionally in recess.  Every resident in any county through which the Shannon flows, including members of the public and of the Government, knows that a single agency with responsibility for the Shannon makes sense.  This Bill should be passed now.  It should be allowed to go to Committee Stage, where full scrutiny and full engagement with communities can take place.  </p> <p> This is typical of the approach successive Governments have taken to many issues, an approach almost of gaslighting.  It is a continuous insulting of the intelligence of those most affected.  It is also disconcerting.  The Minister of State's own party and his own Government know that this is true.  Any Deputy from these 11 counties, including those of every party and those of none, knows this agency is necessary.  The only conclusion one can draw is that the Government is willing to play politics with any and all issues, regardless of the devastating impact doing so may have on lives.</p></speech>

Mr. Iqbal has lived in direct provision for almost five years and in Longford town for several of those years.  During that time, he has endeared himself to the local community and excelled in the arts through the medium of dance.  Through the local Backstage Theatre, the Cruth&uacute; Arts Festival and many other local groups, this man has made countless friends.  An extensive appeal in support of this affable man's application for a right to remain with us represents easily the most comprehensive case I have seen submitted on behalf of anyone in support of a right to remain in the country.  It includes letters of support from high-profile names such as that of the actor Stephen Rea but also, perhaps more importantly, letters from local people such as our county librarian, Mary Carleton-Reynolds, and our local priest, Fr. James McKiernan.  All of these letters show beyond any shred of doubt that this man has become an intrinsic part of the local community in Longford and of the national arts scene.</p>  <p>  Mr. Iqbal is a popular dancer who has featured on the stage of the Abbey Theatre with his good friend, Vicky Khokhar, a fully trained and qualified emergency room nurse who, like Mr. Iqbal, lived in direct provision for several years.  It is ironic that the two men were part of a dance troupe on our national stage literally hours before Mr. Khokhar voluntarily left the country under the threat of deportation.  There are so many people who do not want Mr. Iqbal to face a similar fate.  When are we going to stop forcing good people who want to contribute positively to our society to leave our country?  </p>  <p>  It does not seem right that Mr. Iqbal has waited 19 months for a decision on his appeal to then be given only five days to leave the country at the height of a pandemic.  Perhaps there is a legal requirement that explains why the notifications had to issue last Friday but I appeal to the Minister of State to intervene and to defer the matter for further consideration, certainly until such time as the extensive case in support of Mr. Iqbal has been fully assessed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.832" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="22:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300064#PPP00600"><p>I thank Deputy Flaherty for raising this very important matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I know that it has been a cause of concern and that some Deputies have contacted the Minister directly over recent days to express that concern.</p>  <p>  Our objective is to have decisions made on international protection applications and permission to remain considerations as quickly as possible.  This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.  For those found not to be in need of protection, we can offer them assistance to return to their home country.  This objective of timely decision making is shared by the expert group led by Dr. Catherine Day, whose report the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, published very recently.</p>  <p>  During the early stages of the pandemic, it was decided to issue positive recommendations from the International Protection Office only.  This was to ensure that applicants with negative recommendations were not disadvantaged by the time limits set out in the legislation within which to make an appeal or to request a review of a refusal of permission to remain.  As substantive processing and appeal hearings recommenced in more recent months, so too did the issuing of negative decisions.  While the number of negative decisions has not increased, there has been a build-up in the issuing of such decisions, with a higher volume than normal issuing in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The letters referred to by the Deputy inform people of their negative international protection decision and that they no longer have permission to remain in the State.  Such persons are required to confirm within five days if they will accept the option of voluntary return, for which my Department provides assistance.  If they do not confirm that they will leave voluntarily, a deportation order is made against them.  The five-day timeline is set down in primary legislation and so must be adhered to in official correspondence.  However, I understand a pragmatic approach is taken and, to be clear, the person is not required to remove themselves from the State within five days; they are required to indicate an intent to do so.  Obviously, the time taken for relevant voluntary return arrangements to be made will take into account all factors, including Covid restrictions and the limitations to travel these have created. That said, I do accept that particular issues arise with level 5 restrictions and that the letters may have inadvertently caused distress.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has asked her officials to review the process of issuing such letters for its duration. </p>  <p>  I might add that Dr. Day's expert group has recommended that the five-day period for deciding whether to accept voluntary return should be extended to 30 days and that children and students should be allowed to finish the school year before departure.  These, along with all other recommendations relevant to the work of the Department of Justice, will be actively considered by a programme board established for this purpose.  This board's work will feed into the development of the White Paper by the end of this year, in line with the programme for Government commitment.</p>  <p>  While I obviously cannot speak to the specific case the Deputy has raised, I will bring his comments to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

I certainly hope the Department will move to issue a simple assurance that no deportations will occur during the Covid pandemic.  At the very least we would ask that no deportation orders be issued and, ideally, that leave to remain be granted in the case of Mr. Iqbal, which I outlined earlier.  I also ask that consideration be given to the many healthcare workers who received similar notifications last Friday, many of whom have been in direct provision for more than two years.</p>  <p>  I was glad to hear the Minister of State refer to the expert group under Dr. Catherine Day.  I understand that a key recommendation in its report on direct provision is that anybody who has been in the system for more than two years should be given leave to remain in the country.  I ask that the Department at least deliberate on the findings of this report before adjudicating on the status of Mr. Iqbal and others who were issued similar notifications last week.</p></speech>

I hear his passion for this very important issue.</p> <p>For those found not to be in need of international protection, full consideration of all aspects of their case is carried out before a decision is made to grant permission to remain in the State or to make a deportation order.  This includes full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as consideration of their work position and other issues.  Each case is examined in detail on its individual merits, taking all factors into account.  Additionally, section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, allows an order to be amended or revoked by making a request to the Minister for Justice.</p> <p> I fully acknowledge the important contribution that migrants have made to health, social care and other essential services during the pandemic and beyond.  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to the Department of Justice so we can make fully informed decisions at the appropriate time.</p> <p> Whereas the execution of a deportation order is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I assure Deputy Flaherty and the House that the Department of Justice will of course take a pragmatic approach to such matters in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></speech>

I will speak to the future of the Tidy Towns competition.  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on 17 September asking if the Tidy Towns competition would be allowed to proceed in 2021 under the current social distancing and public health guidelines.</p>  <p>  The Minister replied by saying the Tidy Towns competition has a unique place in Ireland's culture and since its inception in 1958, when it had 52 entrants, the competition has grown year on year to see a record number of 924 entrants in 2019.  Unfortunately, the 2020 SuperValu Tidy Towns competition had to be cancelled this year on public health grounds due to Covid-19.  The work of the Tidy Towns committees is built on communities coming together and working together; in the position we found ourselves in this year, it would not have been possible for committees around the country to deliver their projects in the usual way.</p>  <p>  The Minister acknowledges the importance of the competition.  There are many committees throughout the country that want to continue if they can adhere to public health guidelines.  They are seeking some solace from the Minister and the public health guidelines interpretation that there will be a competition next year.  They are seeking the goodwill of the Government and the Minister so she might seek to do her very best to ensure the competition proceeds next year because of the importance of the competition.  That is self-evident but if the committees had some words of comfort or a view on how the competition might proceed in 2021, it would give people a great lift in these times.</p>  <p>  We know the character of the volunteers involved with the Tidy Towns competition and that there are many people who are semi-retired or retired who work on it.  It is a competition that encourages young and older people to be involved.  They just want some guidance and direction from the Minister.  If it is in the affirmative, they would welcome such comment.  Will the Minister work with the Tidy Towns competition in a way that will allow it to proceed in 2021?  It would be a positive step on the part of the Government and for each of the committees involved.</p></speech>

First, I say very clearly tonight that it is absolutely my intention that we will have a Tidy Towns competition in 2021.  The SuperValu Tidy Towns has been in existence since 1958, as Deputy Sherlock notes, and it has become an integral part of our culture over the intervening years.  The competition continues to grow in popularity and in 2019, a record 924 entries were received.  The competition was just ready to be launched earlier this year when Covid-19 arrived.  Unfortunately, like many other events that we hold dear, the competition did not proceed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  This decision was taken in line with public health advice and in collaboration with the competition sponsor, SuperValu.  This decision was made in April during the first period of severe restrictions, when essentially the advice to everybody was to stay at home.  Many of our Tidy Towns volunteers and adjudicators were very limited in what they could do earlier in the year.  However, as we have moved through different stages of living alongside the pandemic, the Tidy Towns volunteers have demonstrated that they can continue to do some of their activities while still following all of the necessary public health precautions.</p>  <p>  My Department is in regular contact with the close to 1,000 Tidy Towns groups around the country and we are hearing of some wonderful projects and community-wide initiatives that have been delivered in recent months.  Indeed, many of our Tidy Towns groups have also been instrumental in assisting with the community response to Covid-19.  Many of the projects being delivered this year feature in the monthly Tidy Towns newsletter that the groups themselves contribute to and which my Department issues through our social media channels.</p>  <p>  The interest in the newsletter demonstrates how popular the competition continues to be and the level of work that continues, even in the absence of a formal competition this year.  As we look forward to next year, I assure the Deputy and the House that there will be a Tidy Towns competition in 2021.  We may need to alter and adapt our approach to delivering the competition next year given the on-going constraints posed by Covid-19 but we can retain the ethos of the competition that has stood the test of time so well.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering the format the competition could take next year, having regard to restrictions on gatherings at each of the five levels of the Government's Plan for Living with Covid-19 and the paramount need to protect the health and well-being of volunteers and adjudicators.  The details of any changes in the competition will be shared with the Tidy Towns groups well in advance.  I assure the Tidy Towns groups and the thousands of volunteers that my Department and the Government is absolutely committed to the Tidy Towns competition and we look forward to encouraging more towns and villages to join us in future years.</p></speech>

There is no ambiguity from the Minister about the future of the competition in 2021 and the more than 924 applicants that will be there will be delighted with the news.  It is a very genuine competition and the people involved are the salt of the Earth.  They do so much for their community and it is such a valuable competition.  I acknowledge the role of SuperValu in the sponsorship in brings along with the State intervention.  Its impact is enormous and in the midst of Covid-19, the social value of this competition is highlighted even more.</p>  <p>  This is a very positive response from the Minister and all the volunteers will be delighted.  It will lead to yet further enhancement of our communities across the State and I sincerely welcome the Minister's reply.  I welcome the fact that it was so unambiguous and direct.  On this night of the US election, it is worth getting an answer like that at 11.50 p.m.  It is rare that one gets a positive answer when putting down a Topical Issue coming up to midnight.  This is a very positive response and I thank the Minister sincerely for it.</p></speech>

I am a little biased because Glaslough in my county won the 2019 Tidy Towns competition.  I know, therefore, how much this means and the sense of pride which it brings to the local community.  I have also attended many events where prizes were given out and it was great to meet people from every organisation across the country.  I met the finalists at those events and had a chat with them all.  They do magnificent work.</p>  <p>  We were in a different place last March when Covid-19 stuck, compared with where we are now.  We are now learning to operate and live alongside the virus.  The vast majority of the work our Tidy Towns volunteers carry out, and which makes a significant difference to our local towns and villages, can be done in a socially distanced way.  As with everything related to Covid-19, there will always be some challenges, but I believe these can be overcome.  </p>  <p>  Let us look at what others have done.  I never thought I would see Monaghan play Cavan in the first round of the Ulster championship in front of an empty St. Tiernach's Park in Clones, but that is exactly what happened last weekend.  Cavan did beat us, but nevertheless it shows what can be possible when there is a will.  I assure the Deputy, therefore, that the will is there on my part to ensure the Tidy Towns competition happens next year.  That is what we want to see, and we will consult Tidy Towns groups and organisations because they will come up with their own solutions and good ideas.  We will consult with those groups because we want to make that happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.842" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300066#RRR00300"><p>I look forward to the Minister being as positive in response to my query as she was to the previous one.</p>  <p>  I thank her for taking time out of a long and busy day to be here so late to deal with this issue.  I will start by introducing her to a woman I know.  Her name is Kirsty.  She has been a foster parent for more than 13 years.  She, and her then partner, started fostering, and they were a regular family, with employment and a home.  As with many people, however, life intervened and Kirsty is now a single parent.  In those 13 years, she has fostered more than ten children.  Her eldest, who is 15-years old this year, has been with her since the child was a young baby.  Kirsty has, however, also fostered children for shorter periods, emergency stays and mid-length stays.  In doing that, she has made an enormous contribution to the lives of children who, for a variety of reasons, may not have had the opportunities to succeed in and flourish in life as they now do.  She has also made an enormous contribution to the State because otherwise those children would have ended up in State care at a much greater cost to the taxpayers.  The nature of some of our State care facilities also means that experience would have been at a much greater cost to the children themselves.  </p>  <p>  By all accounts, Kirsty is an exceptional mother, absolutely dedicated to the children she loves, rears and cares for.  The problem, however, is that she is a single parent.  From what I can see, she is in the only category of single parents not eligible under the existing legislation for either the one-parent family payment, OFP, or transitional jobseeker's allowance.  That creates an enormous anomaly.  A payment does come from Tusla to cover the specific costs of the child.  It is a non-means tested payment, paid to all foster parents regardless of income.  </p>  <p>  Kirsty now finds herself out of work, however.  Tusla wants her to continue to foster children, and during the Covid-19 pandemic, it even wanted her to take on additional fostering responsibilities because the organisation was trying to alleviate some of the pressure in care homes.  At the same time, though, officials in the Department of Social Protection are doing their job.  Kirsty is eligible for a jobseeker's payment and, therefore, the officials want her to apply for employment, engage with Seetec and do a range of things not compatible with a single parent to do under that payment.  </p>  <p>  I know what the official response of the Department will be because the Minister's predecessor gave it to me in 2018.  I also received the same word-for-word reply from her and her officials in September.  When the legislation was originally drafted, it included a list of categories of single-person households eligible for one-parent family and transitional jobseeker's payments.  Foster parents were not included.  I suspect that was because when that legislation was being drafted there was just a general assumption that foster parents were two-parent households.  It was, therefore, an omission or an oversight in that original legislation.  I cannot imagine any real reason foster parents would be treated differently from widows, widowers, guardians, etc.</p>  <p>  We can do two things now.  The Minister can read the same response I received twice previously, and the small number of people I suspect are in the same position as Kirsty will be stuck in this bind.  Their choices are to return these children to care, which is not something anybody in this House would support, or to go without means.  That is the position in which the State is putting Kirsty.  I am not asking the Minister to change the law in this Topical Issue debate.  I am not even asking her to commit to changing the law.  I am just stating there is a compelling reason for the Minister, instead of giving us the stock response, to ask her officials to review this situation to see if there are legitimate grounds for considering legislative reform, perhaps in a future social welfare Bill or similar legislation.</p>  <p>  We just had a valuable discussion regarding the Tidy Towns competition and the volunteers who do enormous work for their communities.  My mother and father were foster parents.  My youngest sister had been with us since she was two.  She is now a schoolteacher in Africa, has her own family and is incredibly successful in her own way.  I know from first-hand experience, therefore, the transformational impact of fostering.  Let us not continue to discriminate against single-parent foster parent households.  Let us find a way to fix this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.843" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300066#RRR00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for the opportunity to outline the current arrangements in place regarding foster parents and the one-parent family payment.  It is important to recognise the significant contribution that foster parents make.  I know foster parents myself and the Deputy is correct that they carry out a valuable role.  He has shared Kirsty's story with us, and I am sure there are more people like her out there.  Many of them are probably not one-parent families, however, and that is fair enough.</p>  <p>  I have a prepared answer and the Deputy can read it at his leisure.  The main point is that Tusla provides supports to foster parents.  Those payments are made directly to the foster parents, and the social welfare system seeks to provide supports more generally.  As the Deputy will be aware, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of an increase for a qualified child on certain primary social welfare payments.  It is possible, therefore, for foster parents to get the one-parent family payment if they have children of their own, but they will not get the payment if they only have foster children.</p>  <p>  We are probably not talking about a great number of people in that situation but the foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for children under the age of 12 and &euro;350 per week for children over 12.  This compares with a one-parent family payment for children aged under seven of &euro;239 per week, and a weekly jobseeker's transition payment of &euro;239 in the case of a child under 12 or &euro;243 in the case of a child over 12.  There is an enhanced payment in the respect.  Where a child has been placed in foster care by Tusla, and the child has been in continuous care of the foster parents for six months, child benefit would then transfer to the foster parent.  Tusla also provides a range of other supports to foster parents to help and support them in the invaluable work they do.</p> <p>The Deputy asked whether I will consider it and ask my officials to review it, which I will do.  I think that is a fair request and I am happy to get them to reconsider the issue.  I am happy to engage with him on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.845" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300067#SSS00200"><p>This is an issue where, with a bit of common sense and goodwill, we can make a difference to people's lives.  Someone like Kirsty today can legitimately claim jobseeker's allowance because she has no full-time employment.  She is in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and the State pays that in recognition of the fact that she has no means.  The foster care allowance is not a payment to provide an income support to the parent; it is to provide for the costs of fostering the child in recognition of the work that has to be done.</p>  <p>  Rather than forcing people like Kirsty to claim jobseeker's allowance and to have to be in potential conflict with their Intreo worker or Seetec adviser, we should acknowledge that there are a small number of single-parent households who are foster parents, and in the same way as any other household that is a single-parent family, allow them to access the one-parent family payment or, crucially, a transitional jobseeker's allowance.  Kirsty would love to work part time if she could get it, but the work has to fit around her caring responsibilities for her nine-year-old and her 15-year-old foster child.  Transitional jobseeker's allowance, therefore, is eminently more sensible.  This is not about the State saying these people are not deserving of an income support.  They are already getting jobseeker's allowance, but that income support does not suit their specific needs as foster parents.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's commitment to considering the issue.  If she takes it in the spirit I propose, this is simply about allowing people to do what they do very well, without being in conflict with one or other section of our social welfare, or care, system.</p>  <p>  My understanding is there is a severe need for more foster parents.  There may be people who, because of circumstances, could take up that role on a short, medium or long-term basis.  This could also assist Tusla and another arm of Government to ensure that some of the most vulnerable children in society will get the start in life they so much deserve.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on this into the future.</p></speech>

It is important that we encourage as many people as we can to foster children because they provide a great service to the State.  While Tusla supports them financially, I do not see any reason we cannot examine this, and I am happy to work with the Deputy in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.848" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300067#SSS00500"><p>The Minister of State might recall a few weeks ago when we debated the cross-party disability motion that I mentioned this issue, but I raise it again today because there is a serious problem with assessments in general in Carlow-Kilkenny.  It relates specifically to appointments for speech and language therapy, although there are also issues with occupational therapy.</p>  <p>  Speech and language therapy assessments are separated into two categories.  Currently, 929 children in Carlow-Kilkenny are awaiting an appointment for speech and language therapy, while there are 137 children on the list who are classified in the disability category.  That is more than 1,000 children waiting just for an appointment for speech and language therapy.  In the past week, I happened to receive responses to two parliamentary questions I had tabled about two specific cases relating to occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  Both responses predicted that the appointments would be made in October 2021.  This is for children who have spent approximately a year on the waiting list, and given that November has just begun, that is almost a full year away.  It is heartbreaking to have to go back to parents with that information.  There are so many people who cannot afford to access private services and it is just not an option.  They are watching their children's condition deteriorate.  Particularly in a child's first few years of school, it is crucial as he or she can be set back so many years.  The difference that a number of appointments with a speech and language therapist could make is invaluable.</p>  <p>  I was surprised that the numbers are as high as they are, even though I knew from people having contacted me that there was an issue.  While it is a number of more than 1,000 on a page, that is more than 1,000 children who are suffering as a result.  Some have waited 12 months for an assessment and then it turns out to be a wait of two and a half years for therapy.  This will have a detrimental effect on them.  I urge the Minister of State to examine the circumstances, especially in Carlow-Kilkenny, of the assessment waiting time for speech and language therapy.  Something needs to be done.  There are six speech and language therapists and five occupational therapists in Kilkenny, and they cover two large counties, with a rural and urban mix.  It is not doable and more therapists need to be put in place.  While some people will say it is because of Covid-19, this was an issue before that, as the Minister of State will be aware, because she was active on this issue when she was on this side of the House.  It is great that she is in that junior Ministry and I hope she will take this on board.  I acknowledge she has committed additional moneys, but there is an issue and the only way to resolve it is by recruiting more speech and language therapists and occupational therapists to deal with the assessments and appointments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300067#SSS00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  It is not the first time that community healthcare organisation, CHO, 5 has been mentioned by her or her colleagues.  The HSE and its funded disability partners will continue to provide therapeutic supports in line with the public health guidance and direction while also bearing in mind the availability of staffing resources.  Some south-east community healthcare staff members, including speech and language therapists, were redeployed to the swabbing centres in line with the national priority.</p>  <p>  The HSE is, however, currently engaged in a recruitment campaign for staff to support community testing facilities for Covid-19.  The recruitment of these roles will support the return of staff who have been temporarily seconded to swabbing centres and contact tracing centres to return to their substantive roles.  In the south east, the first group of swabbing staff commenced on 15 October and are currently being trained, which will facilitate therapists returning to their substantive roles.  In addition, Covid-19 restrictions have impacted on speech and language therapy service provision in recent months.  This service is working towards a full service resumption by ensuring that the appropriate measures are in place to guarantee safe service delivery to both clients and staff.  Speech and language therapists continue to work with service users and their families remotely and to use technology in effective ways.  In resuming services, guidelines on social distancing and infection control must be observed.  Routine services have recommenced in recent weeks but at reduced capacity to comply with Covid-19 measures.  This, unfortunately, has impacted on waiting times in each service.</p>  <p>  South-east community healthcare staff fully understand the frustration of parents and acknowledge the concerns for prompt, continuous assessment of speech and language therapy intervention.  They are hopeful, as am I, that services will fully resume at the earliest opportunity.  In addition to the issues outlined, it is acknowledged that given increased referral rates and demand for assessment and intervention, there is a requirement for additional resources to meet the current need in each area of speech and language therapy provision.  The Deputy mentioned the additional funding.  Some &euro;7.8 million has been allocated for assessments of need.  While some 643 children in CHO 5 are waiting for an assessment, none of the network disability teams in that CHO is involved in swabbing.</p> <p>All staff in those teams are in their posts.  I spoke with Janette Dwyer of the HSE prior to taking the question this evening.  I have asked that the HSE make it a priority in CHO 5 to follow what it has already done in respect to the network disability teams and prioritise the primary care team.  Many of the staff referred to by Deputy Funchion working in primary care with those aged between six and 18 years as well as those in the early intervention team are actually out of primary care.  That does not fall under my remit.  This is not a case of me washing my hands of the matter.  I spoke to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, earlier to get his support for having the primary care team focus on returning our clinicians.  This work is now deemed an essential service on the disability side.  This is what I have received.  Under level 5, my primary care members of staff will return to their posts in early intervention in speech and language.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.851" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="23:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300068#TTT00200"><p>I welcome that.  It is important that essential therapists and clinicians are not used for contract tracing or swabbing.  That is not to diminish Covid-19 and the seriousness of it.  I understand why there was something of a panic at the start of the pandemic.  Now, however, we are well into the pandemic and we can no longer use it as an excuse.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has acknowledged that she wants staff to operate in their correct roles.  That is very important.  We already had a problem with waiting lists and waiting times for assessments for various therapies.  We cannot have that problem compounded by Covid-19 but we cannot use Covid as a scapegoat either.  It is very important that the issue is addressed.  I understand what the Minister of State is saying but I appeal to her nevertheless.  The therapists are doing their absolute best.  It is difficult when they see a never-ending waiting list.  They know there are large numbers of children waiting and they want to be able to help.  They know they have the skills to help but they are hampered because there are not enough therapists.  It is important that we have recruitment of speech and language therapists and occupational therapists so that we do not have these waiting lists.</p>  <p>  I am dealing with several cases involving children who will wait until October 2021.  We simply cannot have that for children.  They will fall way behind in school and in their development.  Eventually, it will have a major effect on their confidence and mental health, especially around speech and language.  It is crucial that school-aged children and those about to start school get these interventions.  We always talk about early intervention.  We all know how important it is and how much of a difference it makes.  It is important that we put this into action and have the required number of therapists.  I welcome that the Minister of State will look into this specifically for Carlow and Kilkenny because it is an important issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.852" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="23:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300068#TTT00300"><p>Deputy Funchion is right about therapists.  Budget 2021 included a commitment to recruit an additional 100 therapists.  That number will include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  I want to have fully staffed children network disability teams, of which there will be 91 throughout the country.  However, there is no point in having leads if we do not have the therapists in place to make the interventions.</p>  <p>  Another aspect of this relates to the figures.  A total of 382 children are waiting for an assessment of needs.  I can elaborate on assessments of needs following my conversation earlier with Ms Dwyer in CHO 5.  They will be completed by the end of April at the latest.  The intervention will follow for those 382 children and the other families who are waiting.  The intervention will follow straight away for families who have received letters indicating they will not be seen until August 2021.  They will have been on the list for two years.  Some 100 therapists were doing contact tracing and swabbing.  Some of the 100 therapists to whom we referred never went into their field of being proper clinicians.  They are now being returned to the network disability teams.  In Carlow-Kilkenny they are all back in their posts.  The recruitment of a further 100 therapists will result in a dramatic improvement.  That should be of some comfort to the parents as these therapists start to come on-stream.  We are seeing the pathways and flows starting.  It will take us some time to see the outcome after we have completed the assessments of needs but I am confident from talking to Ms Dwyer that this is a priority for her.  I will speak with the CHO, which is fully responsible for this, to ensure this is a priority in CHO 5, not only within the disability area but also in primary care.</p></speech>

I hope no one planning to tune in tonight is accidentally watching the US presidential results instead.  I thank the Minister for being here so late.</p>  <p>  My first question relates to the ViroPro product.  Was the product physically tested by the Department in advance of it being approved?  What was the cause of delay in recalling the product?  Will the Minister refer to the subsequent issue pertaining to 50 other products being recalled from our schools?</p></reply>

I have no doubt that by the time we finish these questions, we will know a little more about what is in store across the Atlantic than we do now.</p><p>Biocidal products, including hand sanitisers, may only be marketed and used in Ireland once they have been registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and entered on the biocidal product register in accordance with Regulation 20 of SI 427 of 2013.</p><p>The hand sanitiser ViraPro was approved by our biocides unit and registered on 21 April 2020.  Administrative checks applied at registration included the provision of a safety data sheet for the ViraPro product from the supplier which was submitted with the application for registration.  As this is an administrative process, no samples were required as part of the approval process.  The product was approved on the basis that it contained 70% ethanol, which is a common standard for hand sanitiser products and fully complies with World Health Organization guidelines.</p><p>Following international notification of potential concerns regarding a consignment imported into Ireland, my Department took immediate steps to quarantine, investigate and test this consignment.  Following investigations, laboratory results received on 16 October showed that the products did not meet the standards for approval, particularly with regard to the presence of methanol.  The consignment being investigated remained under quarantine throughout this process.  The company was immediately instructed to retain all product in its possession and recall all remaining product under the ViraPro name from the market or in use by the public.  On 20 October, ViraPro hand sanitiser was removed from the Department's biocides register.</p><p>The primary responsibility for the withdrawal of products rests with the company concerned.  On Thursday, 22 October, it became evident on the basis of communication from the company that the recall of products had not yet commenced.  At that point, my Department took the additional step of issuing a statement outlining the possible risks posed by ViraPro and advising members of the public not to use it.  I was informed of the situation by my Department for the first time on the evening of 22 October.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>We are taking this matter seriously and will continue to follow up and investigate as appropriate.  My Department is continuing to increase its testing of product on the market to provide reassurance in respect of compliance with approved product specifications.  Test results available so far indicate no safety issues with other sanitiser products sampled.  I have asked my Department to review this matter to ensure that lessons are learned regarding communication of the incident.</p></speech>

That is a crucial issue.  We know, for example, that the HSE purchased 3 million units of this product, some 1 million of which were being sent to healthcare centres, including nursing homes and perhaps even hospitals.  That is above and beyond the issue pertaining to schools.</p>  <p>  What is the process for these types of products?  Is it that the Department simply receives written documentation from these companies and then approves the products?  Are spot samples taken?  Is it a case of companies being taken at their word?  More important, what recourse is there with regard to State expenditure?  Is there provision within the Department to recoup the cost, which was substantial?  I understand it runs to tens of millions of euro across all Departments.</p></speech>

Once that is approved by the Department and the composition of any sanitiser is made clear in respect of the licences provided, the legal responsibility is then on the company to ensure it actually meets the requirements of the licence which was provided.</p> <p>There is therefore an ongoing legal obligation on the company to ensure that its product is fit for purpose and does what it was licensed to do.  My Department is conducting ongoing tests on products that are on the market.  I have ensured that a number of those have been increased to ensure there is confidence in the products that are on the market.  However, that cannot at any point take away from the fact that the legal obligation is on the company providing these products, and it must provide them in compliance at all times with the licence.  If one were to sample a product at the point of licensing, there would be no guarantee that the product being sampled would be the same as any product subsequently produced.  The legal onus is on the company at all times to ensure that what it produces does what it is licensed to do.</p></speech>

The question remains: is there then recourse for the State to recoup the money that was spent on a product that was subsequently found to be deficient?  The Minister told the D&aacute;il he was informed of this issue on, I think, Thursday, 22 October.  We know that the recall happened on 20 October, the previous Tuesday.  We know that previously, on 16 October, the Department had recognised that this product was harmful.  On 8 October, I think, there were signals that all was not right with the product.  Back in September the first indication from Revenue, via OLAF, was made to the Department that the product may not have been what it had been set out to be.  Does the fact that the Minister was informed only on 22 October cause him concern?  Who is in charge of these issues?  Will the Minister take this issue by the scruff of the neck, as is warranted at this stage?</p></speech>

I am very clearly of the view that I should have been informed on 16 October, or whenever the recall notice was issued to the company.  Recalls are not unusual.  They tend to be operational in nature so they would not always be escalated within the Department.  This one should have been, given the nature of what was involved, and I have initiated a review of the handling of this incident.  The initial recall to the company was on 16 October.  It became clear, from communication with my Department, that by Thursday, 22 October, that recall had not proceeded.  At that point I was informed and then the public notification went out and a public recall initiated.  There are, however, undoubtedly lessons to be learned here, and I am determined they will be learned in the future.</p></speech>

I have never seen an issue cause so much antagonism, anxiety and frustration among the farming community and the marts.  The current system is not working.  I am sure the Minister has heard the stories from several marts around the State.  This needs to be addressed.  Will the Minister intervene and urge easing of the restrictions to allow some physical activity to take place in our marts?</p></reply>

This decision was made on foot of strong evidence presented to the Government of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead.  For marts this meant a return to similar conditions under which they operated in the first phase of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has called on us all to work together to suppress the virus and to reopen as much of our society and economy as possible when it is safe to do so.  The core responsibility of the Government is to protect lives and public health while also protecting livelihoods and supporting the wider economy and society.</p>  <p>  Protecting the agri-food sector and people in rural communities was at the centre of my Department's direction on 20 October that buyers could not physically congregate in sales rings and that all marts conduct sales by brokering transactions or using online platforms only.  Marts have been using online platforms since April.  Although marts are operating sales online, buyers may view livestock for sale at the mart premises and individual appointment times are allocated to individual buyers to view or collect livestock.  From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take-up of the new systems by marts over recent months.  The vast majority of marts currently have online systems in place and are operating through online platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing such platforms.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully online recently.  As with any new technology, however, there have been some glitches, which have been dealt with.  Marts have been operating smoothly in recent times.</p>  <p>  This is undoubtedly a challenging time.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation and we are seeing some positive aspects of online sales at marts, despite some reports that marts and potential buyers have not been able to access the online platforms due to connectivity issues, in particular last Saturday week.</p></speech>

Deputy McConalogue is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  He needs to stand up for our farming communities.  Let us take some things as given.  Marts are doing everything in their power to ensure that the online facilities are up to standard.  They are the people telling us they are not working effectively.  The people calling me - they must be calling the Minister as well - are farmers from right across the country who are telling me stories of how their animals have to be taken home and how they have taken a financial hit as a result.  This is not about whether or not restrictions need to be put in place.  We accept, of course, that they do.  This is about what constitutes essential activity.  The only aspect of food production that is not considered an essential activity is the one area within the market chain over which farmers have any semblance of control.  They are begging the Minister to intervene, to stand up for them and to call for marts to be able to operate on a restricted basis that would allow some buyers who cannot currently access the market to do so.</p></speech>

As I have outlined, there was a difficulty with one online platform provider last Saturday week which led to four marts out of 30 not being able to complete their sales.  However, overall there has been a lot of success with the sales operating online.  Very important from my point of view is the fact that prices have been holding up and have indeed improved across many livestock categories.  That is the number one priority for farmers.  Certainly for those selling this has worked reasonably well and is continuing to improve.  For those buying it has posed more difficulties.  Farmers and purchasers like to see the animals physically as opposed to just online or before the sale.  We are, however, in level 5 and, unfortunately, not in a position to operate level 3 restrictions in level 5.  The bottom line is that I am monitoring this very closely and prices are holding up, and for farmers that is the most important thing.</p></speech>

In my county, County Monaghan, for example, 48% of households do not have access to adequate broadband.  That is the Government's own figure.  I would imagine, and I think everyone would accept, that if we were to take the farming community alone, that figure would be much higher.  Where does the Minister think these farmers are buying, even when they go online?  They are meeting in car parks and in cars.  Many people are congregating in a small space with one young lad operating the phone because in some cases we are talking about elderly farmers.  That is not doing anything for physical distancing or protecting us from Covid.  The farmers who have to do this would be much better off if they were standing physically distanced around a mart ring for a restricted period.  I am not just making up these things; these are the calls I have taken today and over the weekend from buyers and sellers who have pleaded with me to make the case in as strong as possible terms to the Minister to stand up for them.  I am making that case once again as sincerely as I can.  I urge the Minister to intervene on this issue.</p></speech>

I have had many discussions with many farmers who would prefer to be operating level 3 restrictions and I have no doubt the Deputy's message is the same as mine, which is there is a personal responsibility on everyone to act responsibly for their own health, and for the health of their neighbours and friends, by following social distancing and the public health guidelines in all situations, including outside marts.  The personal responsibility is on everyone in this regard.  The bottom line is that I have been monitoring this very closely on a daily basis and, on particularly important days, on an hourly basis.  Prices have held up strongly and have increased in many instances.  Things have operated pretty smoothly since the one Saturday when the livestock platform went down.  Volumes are increasing as farmers become more adapted to it, I will bet not without some hardship and inconvenience, but we are at level 5.  The prices are holding up, which is the number one priority for farmers.</p></speech>

It is an important issue for many licensed merchants throughout the country.  I know it is a cause of concern.  I will outline the situation.  Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products is due to come into effect in January 2022.  This regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all member states.  Two issues have arisen, which are the new requirement under EU law for a veterinary prescription to be issued before antiparasitic products can be dispensed and the question as to whether Ireland can avail of a derogation in the regulation that permits professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions</p>  <p>  On the first issue, in 2004 European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products that did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment.  Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p>  <p>  A similar exemption is available under the new Regulation (EU) 2019/6.  However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.  Scientific evidence is now available showing that antiparasitic veterinary medicines intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in Regulation (EU) 2019/6.  Therefore, antiparasitic veterinary medicines must require a veterinary prescription before they can be dispensed from January 2022.  We do not have national discretion on this particular issue.</p>  <p>  On the second issue, there is a separate derogation in the regulation, which allows professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions in limited circumstances, but only if this was provided for in a member state's national legislation prior to Regulation 2019/6 coming into force in January 2019.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the difficulties and I have established a stakeholder group to try to deal with the issues and I am very much committed to working with all stakeholders to consider how best we can address the issue and find a way forward.</p></speech>

Agricultural merchants are highly trained and skilled professionals who have been dispensing drugs since 2006.  They also provide much-needed employment in rural towns where there is little or no employment.  In my constituency we have Midland Veterinary in Tullamore, Portarlington and Edenderry and John Grennan and Sons in Kilcormac and Rath.  They provide huge employment where there are few or no opportunities for people to gain employment.</p>  <p>  When I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in September he accepted there was still work to be done on the directive.  He also said he would discuss the matter with the Minister and look to see whether the application for the additional derogation clause could proceed.  This derogation must be sought to protect much-needed jobs and to avoid putting financial burdens and inconvenience on farmers who are already under great strain.  Perhaps the Minister might provide an update on the work of the stakeholder forum, which has been established and to which the Minister referred.  Has a compromise and resolution of the issue been achieved?  I have been inundated with calls from the Twenty-six Counties and there is no way forward other than the derogation.</p></speech>

The scientific testing on the antiparasitics will be done at national level and will be verifiable and done in accordance with prescribed specifications.  I have met many licensed merchants for whom this is a significant part of their business.  Many of them have trained and responsible persons on their premises who oversee the sale of these products.  I know how important it is for them to be able to continue to maintain the business line they have.  I also know the importance farmers attach to being able to continue to purchase from licensed merchants.  This is why I have established the stakeholder group to try to assess the challenges and concerns that merchants undoubtedly have about this and to see what the way forward might be.  It has not finalised its work and will continue to do so.  I will work with it to see what mechanisms might be possible to assuage concerns.</p></speech>

The fact that change is suggested is neither fair nor evidence based.  To suggest agricultural merchants represent a threat to the health of livestock, which is the assumption, is not fact based.  It is a worry.  The sector is a vital cog in the rural economy, as I have pointed out.  I hope the Minister will take on board the following point.  Given the reluctance of many Irish vets to fulfil their current statutory obligation under Regulation 43(3) of the 2007 animal remedies regulations to issue vet prescriptions to animal owners, the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 into Irish law will potentially create a monopoly on the supply of vet medicines.  Could we separate the prescribing and dispensing of veterinary medicines as we do with human medicines?  This is done in Scandinavian countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, and it has positive outcomes.  I would be grateful if the Minister will respond to this particular question.</p></speech>

My understanding is that at present Ireland, apart from the UK, is the only EU country that does not have veterinary prescriptions for antiparasitics.  The particular regulation will apply from January 2022.  It is about working with licensed merchants to see how we can try to deal with the concerns they have and ensure their business is not affected while, at the same time, remaining legally compliant with our obligations under EU regulations.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows there is not a rule as such limiting the age of cattle or the number of movements for beef production, but meat processors do make in-spec bonus payments in respect of cattle that meet certain market specifications which can be required by retail customers.</p> <p>The 30 month age and four movement specifications to which the Deputy refers fall into this category.  Such specifications are a commercial matter and are not conditions imposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It should be noted that certain third countries have imposed a 30 month age limit in respect of beef imports and that this is specified in certain veterinary health certificates which accompany beef exports to those countries.</p> <p> In September 2019, consensus was reached between stakeholders on the Irish beef sector agreement.  Two elements of the agreement relate to the specifications we are referring to, the first being the introduction of a new bonus of 8 cent per kilogramme for steers and heifers aged between 30 and 36 months that meet all non-age-related existing in-spec criteria and that up to now had not been the subject of any bonus.  The second element is an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in respect of the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the beef sector here.  The Deputy will be very much aware that the details of this agreement are publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p> <p> Grant Thornton was successful in tendering for the transparency studies, including the review of market and customer requirements, specifically in the context of the in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the beef sector.  The Covid-19 pandemic has caused some initial delays to progress on these studies.  The consultants were unable to have the necessary engagement with retail customers, both domestically and in key export markets for Irish beef, as retailers were understandably preoccupied with ensuring the continuation of their supply chains.  However, this work is back on track and substantial updates on it are planned for the next meeting of the task force.</p></speech>

The two positions do not relate.  I am disappointed even with the terminology the Minister is using.  He is basically reciting the factories' propaganda.  They call it a bonus criterion.  Every farmer I know calls it a penalty because it is one.  It is not a bonus that people who meet the criteria get, it is a penalty those who do not must pay in the form of receiving a reduced price.  Today, the Minister will see that the Teagasc annual farm survey has indicated that 40% of our beef farmers are still essentially non-viable.  They would not be able to survive and stay on their farms were it not for the fact that they have other employment.  The age profile of the people concerned is increasing.  All of these things mean that urgent action must be taken so it is just not good enough to say this is a matter for the industry.  If the farmers were doing something which was disrupting the work of the factories, the Department would intervene.  The factories are bleeding farmers dry and using some of these rules to do so.  There is a need for intervention.</p></speech>

That is why in the recent budget I secured an 11% increase in funding above last year's amount to ensure that some key schemes will continue next year during the transition period running into the next CAP programme.  That is something which is massively important for our farming community.  Also, in the context of trying to ensure transparency in the beef sector, the Deputy will know that I have brought forward into the programme for Government a policy on implementing an office of national food ombudsman to help bring transparency to the food sector.  I very much welcome the Deputy's belated conversion to the merits of that office and seeing how it can be particularly valuable.</p>  <p>  I very much value the work of the beef task force and it is a very appropriate forum in which to examine these issues.  In particular, the Grant Thornton report looking at the specifications and at the requirements of retailers and how that interfaces with processors and primary producers is really important.  I look forward to receiving it and ensuring that it actually informs how we and the sector move forward.</p></speech>

The food ombudsman is something to which he has committed.  I hope he does it quickly and I really do hope it works.  I still have my doubts.  A food ombudsman can only implement Government policy and if that policy is to turn a blind eye to these type of practices by the factories then the food ombudsman can do nothing about it.  These practices go back to 2009, a very different time.  Many players in the retail and food sectors say they do not make any sense.  Nobody goes into a restaurant, requests its best sirloin beef and asks the restaurant to ensure that the beef is 29 months old.  Nobody goes into a supermarket and looks at the packaging to see how many movements the cow that produced the beef made.  These are just mechanisms put in place to distort the market.  I ask again, will the Minister monitor these and analyse the impact they are having on the prices farmers are receiving?  If that analysis confirms what I believe, namely, that they are actually having a downward pressure on those prices, will the Minister then look at all mechanisms to ensure we can find a means to undo the damage?</p></speech>

I expect to see the report Grant Thornton is preparing on the relationship and the requirements of retailers and how that interfaces with processors and primary producers very soon.  It will be really important to informing the work of the beef task force.  Very importantly, I see a very strong role for that task force as the voice for farmers and the representative farmers on how we go forward from that point.  As I pointed out earlier, the commitment to introduce a food ombudsman to bring additional transparency is something I am very committed to because it is very crucial for me that farmers get a fair price, are profitable and are rewarded for the very hard work they carry out.</p></speech>

There is a ban proposed on the harvesting of peat for horticultural purposes and plans for it are very much advanced .  There has been a conflation of peat extraction for this purpose and its extraction for energy purposes.  They are two different worlds.  What does the Government plan to do on this, particularly where the mushroom sector, which is incredibly important in my own constituency, is concerned?</p></reply>

The High Court decision to strike down the legislation introduced in January 2019 regulating the extraction of peat now means that extraction of peat from bogs greater than 30 ha. requires companies to go through a licensing and planning regime.  The more recent decision by Bord na M&oacute;na to suspend all peat extraction presents major supply challenges for the horticulture sector.</p>  <p>  Following on from the publication of a report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticulture industry by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, plans to set up a working group to consider impacts on the sector.  It is proposed that this working group will represent Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, State agencies, environmental NGOs and industry stakeholders.  This working group will address the key issues raised in the report, including future use of peat by the horticulture sector.  The position of chair of the independent working group that will be formed is currently being advertised and the closing date for receipt of the applications is 23 November.  Once the chair is in place, the setting up of the working group members will take place.</p>  <p>  At a broader level, the Department provides a support to the horticulture industry through the scheme of investment aid for the development of the horticulture sector.  Financial support is available to assist growers and businesses through grant aid for capital investments in specialised plant and equipment including renewable energy, as well as technology adoption specific to commercial horticulture production.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the full budget allocation to the scheme of &euro;6 million for 2020 will be drawn down by the end of the year.  A 50% budget increase to &euro;9 million was secured by the Department for 2021, reflecting the importance of the sector.  That particular scheme is now open for applications.  In addition, my Department administers the EU producer organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables which allows growers jointly market their production in order to strengthen the position of producers in the marketplace.</p></speech>

I am asking for consideration to be given to this and for a bit of common sense in the approach.  The working group the Minister of State references has one fatal flaw: it includes in its terms of reference the ceasing of the use of horticultural peat.</p> <p>The mushroom industry has been looking at alternatives for the past ten years.  The Department keeps telling it there are alternatives.  There are not.  This is a fundamentally difficult point and the nub of it is that people are not going to eat less mushrooms.  The only question will be where and how the mushrooms are produced.  One of two things will happen if we ban the use of horticultural peat.  Either the peat will be imported - in fact, there is already talk of it being imported from eastern Europe - or the jobs and economic importance of these companies, particularly, the mushroom companies, will be exported.  They will go elsewhere.  Which course is the Government planning to take?  Will it take a third course and actually work with the industry to save it?</p></speech>

There are efforts within the mushroom industry and with my Department looking at alternatives.  It is probably early days in that but two funding research projects are currently commissioned by Ireland's mushroom producer organisation, Commercial Mushroom Producers, CMP, in conjunction with my Department examining the potential scope to, in one instance, recycle mushroom compost as a possible growing substrate within the horticulture sector and a second option looking at the scope to reduce the levels of peat required within mushroom production itself.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, in the absence of peat from Irish sources, the industry would have to import either from Northern Ireland, Scotland or the Baltic region at considerable cost.  I acknowledge that.  It is also worth evaluating the amount we actually export from what we extract and I believe there is potential there to retain more for our own domestic use rather than export.</p></speech>

What we need, however, is an open mind.  I have put this to three different Ministers, namely, Deputies Noonan and Ryan and Senator Hackett.  They all have one thing in common, that is, a party that is not very much trusted by the people involved in this or many other sectors in the community I come from.</p>  <p>  It is important we put this in context because people, obviously, are conscious that we need to protect our peatlands.  To give an example, in 1995 Bord na Mona harvested 8 million tonnes of peat in one year for power stations alone.  That amount of peat would keep the Irish horticultural industry going for 200 years.  We are, therefore, talking about a relatively small amount of peat extraction for an important part of our domestic rural economies.  That is why we need to have an open mind.  I fear there are closed minds within the Department.  There is constant talk about alternatives that have not been presented yet and it makes me fearful for the future.  I hope the Minister of State can put minds at ease.</p></speech>

Whether we extract it all and there is none left, we will end up at a situation where we do not have peat for every use we want it for.  We are exploring the alternatives which potentially utilise spent peat.  It is circular in nature in an economy sense.  There are other possibilities in terms of coir, wood fibre or biochar so the possibilities are great.  Perhaps there will be some further investment in that area.  We do not, however, have an infinite supply of peat.  The wider horticulture sector will have to move away from it.  I appreciate the particular difficulty with the mushroom sector.  Certainly, I enjoy my mushrooms as much as anyone else and I want to buy Irish mushrooms and will endeavour to make sure we can continue to produce and grow them here.</p></speech>

This question is about the development of the bioeconomy.  Can I get an update on what efforts the Department is making to develop to the bioeconomy?  Obviously, there are huge opportunities here for regional development and for farmers, fishermen and foresters as well so I would like an update, please.</p></reply>

The critical role of the bioeconomy in a sustainable global transition has been widely recognised albeit we are in the early stage of its development.  The bioeconomy refers to the development of value from biological resources with a particular focus on converting waste streams into valuable products or, perhaps, streams that were previously seen as waste or having no use and realising their real potential and value.  The bioeconomy brings significant potential to provide a source of income diversification for farmers, foresters and fishers and to boost regional economic development.  I am determined to realise that potential for additional income into our rural communities from the bioeconomy.</p>  <p>  The Government has invested significantly in this early development.  This follows from the development of a national policy statement, the establishment of a cross-departmental group co-chaired by my Department, financial support through the competitive research and rural development programme, the BiOrbic, Bioeconomy SFI Research Centre and the Irish Bioeconomy Foundation and building coalitions and public-private partnerships for co-investment with leading innovative companies, co-operatives and farmers.</p>  <p>  I recently announced an allocation of &euro;8 million research funding committed to support the generation of knowledge in the areas of agriculture, forestry and food and the bioeconomy.  My officials and I are working on the imminent establishment of a bioeconomy forum to provide a voice for a broad range of stakeholders in the bioeconomy sector, including the agri-food industry, primary producers, relevant State bodies and community groups.  That will be set up shortly.</p>  <p>  We recently ran a successful Bioeconomy Ireland Week to raise awareness of the bioeconomy and its products and to work with both public and private stakeholder to present ongoing research, innovation, demonstration, primary production, industrial, product and market activities that highlight how the bioeconomy is developing and being structured and mobilised in Ireland.  Much work is happening in this area.  Farmers and rural developers have a real nose for new opportunities and diversifying and that is what we are seeking to develop here.</p></speech>

It is clear important work is going on and that is very welcome.  I will emphasise the importance of continued investment in the area of research and development.  We need to continue that work if we are to give opportunities to residents of parts of the country such as where I come from in south Kerry to have prosperous futures.</p>  <p>  As I said, I welcome the ongoing efforts but I wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention an area that has recently been brought to my attention in my constituency.  It is, perhaps, something that warrants further investigation and that is the possibility of using wool.  We are aware, for example, the Chinese market, in particular, is inaccessible at the moment but we could look at possibilities in the areas of insulation or, perhaps, other uses.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's views and whether he will be able to look into that further.</p></speech>

In many ways, the bioeconomy looks at the opportunities in products we previously saw as only having one direct use or outcome.  In my Department and in my area of responsibility for research and development, we seek to use that money we invest in research and development to develop new opportunities in those areas.  The bioeconomy is another way of taking one element of an activity we have done in the past and finding more streams in it.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy looks at some of the initiatives we have been involved with in the early stages, there is a development of a carbon-neutral demonstration farm in Shinagh dairy farm in County Cork that has found four different values for what was normally growing-grass for dairy cows.  There are now four different values to that.  There is no reason wool cannot be the same.  If the Deputy has specific examples from his constituency in County Kerry he would like me to analyse further with him, I am happy to do so.  The bioeconomy, however, is about getting into biorefinery and identifying those additional opportunities to see how we can add value to them.</p></speech>

It is not a rule but it is a feature in many areas.  Perhaps, we could establish some sort of communication between people involved in the industry in County Kerry and the Minister of State in the near future to explore what the options are and see if this area could be pursued further.</p> <p>We need to be resourceful and to ensure that every opportunity is pursued fully.<br/><br/>I acknowledge the examples given regarding what is happening in Cork.  The relative impact of innovative breakthroughs on small, isolated rural areas cannot be overstated.  They may not appear significant in light of the bigger picture but, to the areas concerned, they can be very important.</p></speech>

It is important to address rural prosperity.  The bioeconomy affords an opportunity to develop innovative and valuable bio-based products, redistribute incomes and generate jobs and prosperity in rural areas.  We have seen examples of this, including the development, through EU funding, of a biorefinery for dairy waste in Lisheen, County Tipperary, and the development of a marine biorefinery in County Monaghan.  I mentioned the carbon-neutral demonstration farm in Cork.  My Department supports the small-scale grass biorefinery demonstration project in Cork, which makes use of grass in a number of new ways.  It is an innovation partnership initiative that is part of the rural development programme.</p>  <p>  Agriculture and forestry account for 80% of Irish land use.  There are 136,000 family farms and 22,000 private forest owners.  The agri-food sector included 1,715 companies at the last count and it employs 173,000 people.  That involves a significant social structure, whether it concerns wool or the marine aspects we can explore further to seek to develop additional income for rural areas.</p></speech>

I hope she finds a way to celebrate it in later years other than the way we are celebrating it tonight.  I hope the day ahead finishes better than the way it is starting, that is, here in the Chamber.  I thank the staff for being here with us.  I take the Deputy's point on the late hour at which we are here.</p><p>As Deputy Cairns knows, the Department has adapted the conditions under which marts have had to operate since April to reflect various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid-19 and to allow marts to remain operational throughout the Covid crisis.  From April to 8 June, marts operated without public attendance at sales rings in that they were able to conduct transactions online or facilitate broking.  Over the course of the summer, we have seen the introduction of online sales and they have started to work better and become a very positive aspect of operations.  On 19 October, the Taoiseach announced the country was to move to level 5 and that marts would be operated online only, albeit with buyers being able to view cattle and other livestock in advance of sales, by appointment.</p><p>By and large, given the way marts have operated, the volume going through them and the prices received by farmers, there have been many positive outcomes.  It has been a challenging experience for both marts and farmers.  While many have got used to operating online over the summer, many have not.  There is no doubt that a blended approach to sales is the way forward and the way to which the system will revert.  We would all like to see this occur in due course.  We are, however, in level 5, and the priority is public health.  Marts now have the opportunity to operate online whereas in the earlier part of the pandemic restrictions period, that opportunity was not available.</p><p>Let me give some feedback on how the system has been operating.  We went to level 5 on 21 October.  From 19 October to 31 October, the cattle throughput in marts amounted to 88,000.  This compared to 93,000 in the corresponding period in 2019.  It amounts to 94% of the volume in the corresponding period in 2019.  The number of marts operating during the period of level 5 restrictions is the same as that operating at the same time last year.  According to the mart reports from the <i>Irish Independent</i>farming section today and the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, and the feedback from mart managers, prices are holding up.  They are up in certain categories.  While the blended option will, without a doubt, be the way of the future and while it is the optimal approach, considering that we are subject to level 5 restrictions, we should note that if the online platforms were down and only a small number of people &mdash; 20, for example &mdash; were allowed around the ring, it would have a very significant impact on competition in the affected marts.  This is because the experience has been that while online operations have been challenging for some, they have meant that many have been able to get involved in auctions.  That is why we are seeing prices hold up and, indeed, increase in some ways.</p><p>I acknowledge that the circumstances are really challenging and I understand the difficulties farmers have.  I understand the challenges that mart managers have faced in adapting but, apart from Saturday week last, when 16 marts were affected when the online platform went down for over two hours, albeit with only four sales cancelled, the system has been continuing to improve.  We are now seeing an increase in volumes and confidence.</p></speech>

It it is simply not feasible, however, to expect farmers to go online instead of to the mart when doing so is an essential part of essential work and when some simply do not have good broadband.</p>  <p>  We understand and agree, as do all farmers, that public health is the priority.  Nobody is disputing that.  I take the Minister's word about prices holding up but given that farmers have to attend marts and simply cannot operate online, will he consider steps that could be taken to reopen the marts safely?  The Government's broadband plan identifies that 40% of marts have poor broadband services that require upgrading.  We are aware that many farms do not have broadband.  How does the Minister expect the system to work for people who just cannot access broadband?  For the reasons I have described, could the Minister look into reopening the marts safely?  I agree with him that public health has to be the priority but could we look into this again?</p></speech>

The Livestock Live online bidding system, LSL, has not been fit for purpose so far this month.  Back in April and May, when there were blended sales and people in the ring, the system was not under as much pressure but on Saturday, 24 October, the system crashed for about two hours at Sixmilebridge mart, with the result that many of the cattle already in pens in the back yard had to be loaded back onto trailers and returned to their home farms.  There was consternation in the marts and considerable anger and frustration among farmers.  The mart manager told me that if he were given a green light to separate farmers and bidders, on the basis of a 2 m distance, he could probably fit 28 in the ring.  People will really only buy cattle when they can see them in the flesh, as the Minister said.  That is what results in the best trading.  I understand we are in level 5 but the situation needs to be kept fluid and under review.</p></speech>

With regard to marts' sales in general online, the clearance rates have been very high and very much in line with traditional mart clearance rates.  They are certainly very similar.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Cairns's point, I am certainly monitoring the position very closely.  I have been talking to farmers, from north Donegal right down to south Kerry, about their experiences and I have also been liaising with mart managers.  As I said in the D&aacute;il earlier, the most important thing for farmers is the price.  The feedback is that prices have been holding up.  While some have been reluctant to go to the mart, we have seen an improvement in this regard and an increase in volumes.  The experience for sellers has been a good one.</p> <p>It has been more challenging for buyers because not everyone is adept at buying online, although many are adjusting.  I admit it is not ideal.  I am monitoring it closely.  Everybody deserves credit for how it has operated.</p></speech>

I completely accept everything the Minister said on how it is working, the prices and all of those aspects, but that does not address the question I asked originally and asked in the second round, namely, what do people, who cannot access broadband and do not have access to it on their farm, do.  There is no solution for those people.  Given that is the situation, will the Minister examine the reopening of marts in a different way that is safer and can prioritise public health but also allow everybody to take part?  As he acknowledged, it is an essential service.  It is an essential part of essential work that some people cannot take part in due to restrictions they cannot control if they cannot access broadband.</p></speech>

The mart in Sixmilebridge continued and some sales took place, including the sale of my uncles&rsquo;s yearlings, but too many animals went home in trailers.  Many rural farms in Clare do not have a broadband connection, and for those that have it, the connection is rather slow.   Given the age demographic of the farmers going to marts, I am sure they will forgive me for saying they would not be adept at going out to their jeeps and bidding on their tablets or iPhones.  That would not come too easily to them.  The only true way forward, and it is to be hoped we will get there quickly, is a blended sale format where 20 or 25 people can be in the ring and others can be sitting outside in their jeeps bidding as well.  That is where we will find the real market price being struck.</p>  <p>  Many farmers are budgeting their food rations, silage and hay for the winter.  There is a very small window of time during which they want to sell these animals so that they do not end up bringing them into a slatted shed, with those animals further eating into their planned food rations.  I hope it is a fluid situation.  The guidelines on Covid must be adhered to, but it is to be hoped this issue can be revisited.  I thank the Minister for giving of his time tonight.</p></speech>

We should acknowledge that being able to bid online in the safety of their home and not having to go out has been welcome for some farmers.  There is no doubt there have been challenges for those who do not have Internet access.  Compared with the situation in March and April where online transactions were not available and we had a bidding and tendering process for stock, the situation now is much more preferable.  That tendering option is still available for farmers who do not have Internet access and they can work with their mart managers to try to facilitate them. I know some are doing that.  I accept it is challenging.  There are inconveniences there.</p>  <p>  Regarding the sales, the clearances are very good and the prices are holding up from a seller&rsquo;s point of view, but it is challenging from a buyer&rsquo;s point of view.  It is a reflection of the fact we are in level 5 and the national challenge we face in dealing with the pandemic.  I will continue to keep the matter under very close review and I take on board what the Deputies have said.</p></speech>

For those who were in the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and had to leave it or were never in a scheme, when will the new environmental scheme that was promised in the interregnum between the old Common Agricultural Policy and the new CAP be published?  Will it be a general scheme for farmers to join or a very limited pilot scheme?</p></reply>

I take this opportunity to emphasise my commitment to the provision of agri-environment schemes which will continue to support the farming sector in these uncertain times, along with continuing the environmental benefits that such schemes have delivered.  This commitment was demonstrated by a number of key provisions in my Department&rsquo;s budget Estimate for 2021, including the provision of &euro;79 million in new funding for a range of new agri-environment initiatives.</p>  <p>  This funding includes a provision for a number of new initiatives and for the development of a pilot project to examine the implementation of results-based environmental actions. The exact amount of the &euro;79 million to go towards the pilot scheme is something I still have to determine, but the new pilot project will have a significant focus on biodiversity and climate change, with the aim of increasing the number of farmers undertaking agri-environment actions, and will be directed at farmers not currently in the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  The Department is working on the details of this pilot.  It is expected these pilot actions will inform the development of a major new environmental scheme for agriculture following on from GLAS.</p>  <p>  In addition, as CAP negotiations are ongoing, my Department is pressing for the earliest adoption of EU regulations to facilitate the operation of schemes in the period between the current CAP and the CAP strategic plan post 2020.  The intention is to roll over the existing schemes from the current rural development programme, RDP, and to ensure that scheme participants have certainty on their scheme participation next year during the transitional phase.  The budget funding allows for the rollover of GLAS, the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, and sheep welfare schemes subject to the agreement of the European Commission.  It is also intended to have tranches of the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, next year with the details to be finalised.</p>  <p>  I know the importance of environmental schemes and that the Deputy has advocated for them in the past.  Certainly this is a pilot scheme that will be in place next year and will be targeted at those not currently in GLAS.</p></speech>

It seems limited, strange, complicated and worrying.  I often wonder if we are going backwards or forwards.  When the rural environment protection, REP, scheme, was in place and we moved on to AEOS, a person who left one REP scheme could join another.  I refer in particular to those farming in areas of high nature value where much of the land is designated and who have come to depend on these schemes for their livelihoods.  They were not allowed expand their flocks or herds.  Will the proposed scheme be merely a limited, complicated and convoluted pilot or will it be a general scheme for farmers who have depended on these agri-environmental schemes not only to retain their farms in a good agri-environmental condition, which they must do because most of them live in designated areas, but also to put a crust on the table?</p></speech>

Importantly, the recent budget provides funding to ensure that GLAS can roll over for those farmers to enable them to continue in it next year.  Obviously, a number of farmers are outside GLAS and are not in any scheme.  The intention is to put in place a pilot scheme for a number of those farmers, which will be an indicator in terms of what the future scheme will look like and which will help inform what the successor scheme to GLAS will be.  The new pilot scheme will be targeted at non-GLAS farmers and will be designed in a way that will be reflective of what measures may form the successor to GLAS.  Out of the &euro;79 million in funding, measures will be introduced which will be accessible to all farmers, both to those in GLAS and those who are not in a scheme, and in that way they will be more openly available to them.</p></speech>

How many of those will be able to join this pilot scheme which it seems will have very limited numbers?  This is a bread-and-butter issue.  It represents survival for people on their farms.  It is not some added extra.  It is fine to say all the other farmers will be able to avail of some measures.  The cohort of farmers who were in AEOS had been in REPS 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on, but financially they have suddenly fallen off a cliff.  All the Minister need do is check their financial records.  Will they all be facilitated if they want to join this pilot scheme?</p></speech>

I commend and welcome the rollover provisions in respect of GLAS next year, but as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, it gives rise to as many questions as answers.  My question is in respect of the programme for Government commitment that &euro;1.5 billion - the headline figure for agriculture - would be allocated to a new REP-type scheme.</p> <p>Some &euro;79 million of that has been allocated for the REPS-style pilot scheme plus the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, roll-over.  That is a big gap.  When are we going to see the &euro;1.5 billion come to a REPS-style scheme?  Will the new scheme be modelled on the previous one, or will it be REPS in name only and actually be a set of obstructions for farmers?</p></speech>

I note the Deputy's support for the &euro;79 million which we brought forward in the budget as new funding for environmental schemes.  I also note that the Sinn F&eacute;in did not have any such funding commitment in its pre-budget submission so I am sure the Deputy is particularly glad to see we have delivered &euro;79 million in additional funding.</p>  <p>  I know that farmers who were availing of the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and finished out their scheme were, therefore, blocked from being able to join GLAS because that scheme was closed.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has raised that matter on a number of occasions.  That is a category of farmer that needs to be catered for and it is my intention that those who were previously in a scheme and wish to be in one again will be catered for in the new pilot.</p></speech>

Responsibility for maintaining the national inventory for greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland rests with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, operating under the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The EPA reports on emissions from all sectors of our economy on an annual basis and the metrics used in calculating greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors are based in EU legislation.</p>  <p>  As the agriculture sector continues to develop and grow, it is important to ensure it does so within a framework of sustainability that also ensures our resilience in dealing with future changes in our climate.  The programme for Government is very clear that we are committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, which is a 51% reduction over the decade, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  This 2050 target being set in law by the climate action Bill is to achieve a climate neutral economy that balances emissions and removals within the State by the end of 2050 and in subsequent years. </p>  <p>  Reducing emissions, termed "mitigation", is a critical element in addressing climate change but the process of building resilience and adapting to the changes we are expecting to see in our climate, termed "adaptation", is equally important.  With increases in average annual temperatures, significant decreases in summer rainfall and heavier rainfall events in winter and autumn months projected towards the middle of the century, it is essential we begin to take the necessary steps to build a strong and resilient sector.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published a climate change sectoral adaptation plan for the agriculture, forestry and seafood sectors which sets out 16 actions and a number of sub-actions across the three sectors.  This, our first statutory adaptation plan, is about preparing our systems to deal with the inevitable changes in climate by building resilience to the effects of climate change and weather related events in the agriculture, forestry and seafood sectors. </p></speech>

It is a chance to better inform ourselves about factors that contribute in both these areas.  I encourage as much research as possible to be done into the year 2020 in Ireland and the effects on greenhouse gas levels, particularly during periods of lockdown.  That could help to inform future policy.</p>  <p>  I also encourage a far greater emphasis on the carrot, not the stick, in the agricultural sector.</p></speech>

It will be interesting to see the 2020 figures showing the impact of the pandemic across many aspects of the economy from an emissions point of view.  I am not so sure that the impact on agriculture will be as significant when compared with other sectors of the economy because agricultural activity has not been affected as much as many other parts of the economy.  It will, nonetheless, be interesting to see.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also made a point about working with farmers and the agricultural sector in an incentivised way to influence behaviours and as an approach to policy.  I agree with that; it will be my approach.  It has to be about partnership.  Farmers are willing to play their part in that respect and it is important that the rest of society acknowledges the important role that farmers play and ensure that they are rewarded with an income for the work they carry out.</p></speech>

Farmers take a lot of unfair flak at times about greenhouse gas emissions and their contribution to climate change.  I am confident that 2020 will show that a lot of the flak that the sector takes is unjustified and unwarranted.  That is why it is critical that thorough research is conducted into the impacts of the lockdown on other sectors.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point that the agricultural sector deserves recognition in this House for the tremendous work it continues to carry out to ensure the security of supply chains.  The sector continues to prove its resilience and farmers never fail to step up to the mark in that regard.  Farmers have shown themselves willing to take a partnership approach and live up to their responsibilities as policy evolves and changes.  It is important that we do the same, going forward, to work and ensure that farmers get a fair income for the work they carry out.</p></speech>

At the most recent meeting of the beef task force which took place on 22 October, stakeholders agreed in principle to support an application by Bord Bia for protected geographical indication, PGI, status for Irish grass-fed beef.  The beef task force also agreed in principle that a PGI monitoring group with a majority of farmer representation would be established to report on the progress of the task force on a regular basis.  My Department has completed the remaining necessary steps in this process, including issuing responses to those who have submitted oppositions to the Department during the national opposition procedure and publishing the final document on the issue to the European Commission.  The final document reflects changes arising from concerns raised during the national opposition procedure, including clarification that a two-hour transport limit to an abattoir is not a requirement and that farmers can transport their own cattle.</p>  <p>  At the time of submission of the application to the EU, I intend to raise the following two issues with the Commission.  First, I will make the point that grass-fed young bulls should be included when further data on this cohort are available to support this, thereby reflecting strong views from some stakeholders received through the opposition procedure.  Second, reflecting discussions with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, I will advise the Commission that Ireland would support the PGI being extended on an all-island basis when a grass-fed verification system is in place in Northern Ireland as well.</p>  <p>  The EU procedures provide for detailed scrutiny of the application and publication of an EU opposition procedure.  If there is a satisfactory outcome to the EU scrutiny and no oppositions are received, it is hoped that, all going well, the application will be progressed for registration of a protected geographical indicator.  If successfully registered, PGI status will assist Ireland in further communicating the characteristics and reputation of this quality product in line with the programme for Government commitment to work at EU level for the development of a protected geographic indicator for Irish beef.  PGI status has the potential to improve the marketing position of Irish beef at a time when it is badly needed.  </p></speech>

I am not sure how successful this application will be because the only ones promoting suckler beef are the European Commission itself and, disappointingly, not Bord Bia or the Irish Government.  On 22 September, the Minister gave me a reply to a parliamentary question in which I had asked how much Bord Bia was spending on promoting Irish suckler beef.  The Minister could not give me an answer on that.  He indicated that Bord Bia has submitted an application for a three-year EU co-funded programme to promote suckler beef with a value of &euro;3.2 million.  The Minister has announced a &euro;6 million budget for promoting a suckler beef brand.  How much of that will be made up of EU money?</p></speech>

The Deputy knows well from previous debates in this House the absolute commitment I have to suckler beef and to ensuring it is promoted.  Working with the beef task force on this agreement, I have committed to ensuring that &euro;6 million of Government funding will go towards developing a suckler brand for the first time and supporting and backing it up.  That is alongside the submission of the PGI for Irish grass-fed beef to the European Commission.  I remind the Deputy that there was agreement among all the farming organisations within the beef task force on taking this approach, which I very much welcome because it is important we all work together to make the most of our beef product and ensure we give it every chance to be promoted abroad, to get a premium price abroad and, importantly, to ensure it is translated back to farmers' pockets for the hard work they do.</p></speech>

I may be a single voice in this regard but it will not benefit Irish farmers and it had the opportunity to do that.  The Minister is giving &euro;6 million to Bord Bia, an organisation that advised the Minister's predecessor that suckler beef did not have a resonance in Europe and yet was able to apply for EU funding because it was not prepared to put its hand into its own pocket.  Unless this State-developed brand is done in conjunction with a State-developed and State-controlled block chain for Irish beef, I guarantee the meat industry in this country will do its utmost to undermine at every hand's turn a distinctive suckler beef brand.  Can the Minister give a commitment that we will have that block chain control?</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy will recognise this is the first time that we have seen funding specifically put towards the suckler brand and it is to the tune of &euro;6 million.  That is something I am committed to and I am glad the farming organisations also are committed to it.  We have come together in partnership towards promoting it.  I assure the Deputy that it will be followed through on and we need to work together to develop the brand and to ensure it is marketed appropriately and developed fully.  I commend all the farming organisations on the massive effort they put in working with the beef task force and its chairman on coming to this conclusion.  It is important there will be a farming majority on the oversight committee for the PGI brand going forward.  It is important that farmers have that control and oversight.</p></speech>

There are two parts to this issue.  The first is increasing third country market access and furthering trade opportunities.  This is absolutely critical and is an integral part of my Department's response to the challenges of Brexit.  My Department has been very active in this regard through trade missions and leveraging our network of agricultural attach&eacute;s around the globe, which have been recently expanded to include a presence in Berlin, Tokyo, Mexico City and, most recently, Seoul, South Korea.  We continue to avail of every resource in furthering market access and trade advancement.  The Government's commitment to new market access for the agri-food sector has been proven by my appointment with specific responsibility in this regard as a Ministry of State for new market development.</p>  <p>  Ireland's agri-food exports have greatly increased in recent years.  Total exports came to a value of &euro;14.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 6% over 2018.  Half of this growth has been accounted for by markets outside of Europe.  This is a testament to the great work that has been done through Food Harvest 2020, initially, then Food Wise 2025, the ten-year strategic plans for the sustainable growth of our agri-food and drink exports.  Work is at an advanced stage in times of a new agri-food strategy for 2030, which will be published in the near future.</p>  <p>  On the practical and immediate issue of bypassing the UK to continue to access markets, I recognise the UK land bridge is of huge importance in accessing the EU Single Market and we may see severe delays in its operation after the ending of the transition period.  However, goods moving directly between Ireland and elsewhere in the EU will not be subject to any new procedures.  Therefore, I urge traders currently using the UK land bridge to consider direct sailing as an alternative.  Ferry operators have indicated that capacity is available on direct routes.  This is also the view of the Department of Transport and the Irish Maritime Development Office and I encourage early engagement between all parties, traders, hauliers and ferry companies to discuss their needs and options.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-03a.980" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300076#BBBB01000"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  Can I further inquire as to whether absolute plans are in place to bypass the UK itself in the event of there being no deal?  The breakout from the EU could have more serious consequences for this country than we think at the present time.  What has been put in place to address that issue?  Are we prepared for both options, deal or no deal?</p> <p>As the Deputy will be aware, successive Governments and Departments have been preparing for every eventuality in regard to Brexit since before it was voted on by the British people, none more so than the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We are extremely exposed, whether in respect of fisheries or the beef sector, and we face challenges in that regard.</p> <p> The UK land bridge is one tangible example that is critical to us in terms of movement.  A recent meat survey showed that 90% of our meat produce goes to the UK via land bridge.  There are extensive plans.  It is important to get the message out to people, including everybody in the agri-food sector and exporters, that even if there is a deal, the circumstances will change on 1 January.  A no-trade deal would pose significant challenges for us.  We are trying to cover every eventuality in that regard.</p></speech>

In his opinion and that of his Department, does he think adequate provision has been made to avoid a touchdown in the UK in the event that long queues or delays take place?  That could make Irish products uncompetitive on UK or world markets, assuming the UK market will still be open.  Are they satisfied that the necessary measures have been put in place to bypass the UK and deliver our goods to the Continent directly?</p></speech>

We are doing all the work we can.  It is important that those who export engage with ferry companies, which have said direct ferry sailings options are available.  My Department has been very active in encouraging all such elements.</p>  <p>  There has been significant co-operation with the Department of Transport because of the issues that would arise.  Following the end of the transition period, goods moving across the UK land bridge must be placed under customs transit procedures to maintain their Union status, as the Deputy will be aware.   The Commission's delegated regulation requires that official controls and checks be performed on animals and goods re-entering the Union if they go through the UK land bridge.  This means that, regardless of the measures that have been taken, it is highly likely that traffic using the land bridge will be impacted by delays at key ports immediately after the end of the transition period.  Every effort is being made to avoid a no-trade deal.  If those scenarios arise, we are preparing for every eventuality.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Minister the status of the actions he is taking as a result of the High Court ruling that overturned that policy directive and if an external review of the consultation process which was found to be in breach of fair procedures will be conducted.</p>  <p>  This ruling was overturned on a technical issue.  It has been depicted as a good thing for the entire fishing industry.  However, that is not true.  The reality is that the vast majority of people working in the sector regard this ruling being overturned as being worse than Brexit.  This directive would have helped to replenish stocks for small-scale and sustainable fishing families, which is the kind of fishing we should all support.  One of the reasons their voices have not been heard is because they do not have the same amount of representation, which is desperately needed.  The National Inshore Fishermen&rsquo;s Association, NIFA, and the National Inshore Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, NIFO, have applied for producer organisation status.

As she will be aware, in December 2018, following a public consultation process, the then Minister announced that vessels over 18 m would be excluded from trawling in inshore waters inside the 6 nautical miles zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020.  A transition period of three years for vessels over 18 m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels as sprat fishing is concentrated inside the 6 nautical mile zone.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy pointed out, that was subject to an appeal by two sprat fishermen.  On 6 October, a judge in the Supreme Court held that the court's final order should be that, among other matters, a declaration that policy directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and of no legal effect.  The breach of fair procedures referenced related to a failure in the obligation to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process, in particular by failing to consult with them once the preferred option had been identified. </p>  <p>  I am currently considering, on an urgent basis, the implications of the judgment in consultation with our legal advisers.  I want to also advise the Deputy that I am committed to the sustainability of fishing in Irish waters and the commitment in the programme for Government that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and pair trawling be prohibited inside the 6 mile limit.</p></speech>
