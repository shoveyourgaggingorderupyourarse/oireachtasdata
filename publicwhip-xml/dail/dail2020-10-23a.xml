However, it comes as we all know at a huge cost to individuals, families, communities and businesses.  It must work.  For that to happen we need a very wide buy-in to the measures.  Ireland&rsquo;s experience of the virus to date shows that the vast majority of people are following the public health measures the vast majority of the time.  Unfortunately, the highly contagious nature of this virus means that it exploits the times when we let our guard down.  When even for a little while we choose not follow the measures the virus can spread fast.  If we are going to suppress the virus in the next six weeks to the fullest extent possible we are going to have to be on our guard.  Unfortunately, there is also small number of people who make conscious decisions not to follow the measures everyone else is following.  Again, due to how easily this virus spreads the actions of these people put at risk the enormous sacrifices made by everybody else.  So while solidarity, personal and collective responsibility are at the core of our national response to Covid-19, enforcement must also be available as a last resort.</p>  <p>  Up until recently the only enforcement power available was the Health Act 1947 under what is called the penal provision.  This is a prosecution in court with a maximum penalty of up to &euro;2,500 and-or six months in prison, to be decided by the judge on a case-by-case basis.  More recently the Minister, Deputy McEntee, introduced legislation allowing for what in the regulations are called &ldquo;relevant provisions&rdquo;.  These are applicable for pubs, caf&eacute;s, restaurants and essentially licensed premises and allows for them to be shut down in the first instance for that day or that night and for repeat offences to be shut for longer periods of time.</p>  <p>  As I have said to colleagues in the House before, I do not believe that the current penal provision of up to &euro;2,500 and six months in prison is proportionate for most of the violations of the regulations and that it is too harsh.  This is why we have this legislation.  It introduces tiered penalties, which are essentially on-the-spot fines of up to &euro;500.  The exact amount for each measure is specified under the regulations.  For example, a fine relating to face coverings, which currently is a penal provision carrying a penalty of up to &euro;2,500 or six months in prison, - which we all agree is disproportionate, can be replaced by using this legislation with an on-the-spot fine of, say, &euro;50.</p> <p>Ultimately, failure to pay the fine would leave recourse to prosecution but that is the case for many other fines as well.</p> <p> Another power the Bill introduces is the ability to intervene in house parties where there is a public health risk and where it is proportionate to do so.  I would prefer that we were not introducing this measure and I was not standing here as Minister for Health asking colleagues to support it.  It jars with me on the basis of civil liberties.  Unfortunately, the evidence is that social congregation, in particular when alcohol or more than alcohol is involved, is a particularly serious vector for the disease and, as such, Government has decided that powers are needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to intervene where it is necessary and appropriate to do so.  The Bill refers to these events as "dwelling events".  The Bill also softens the existing penal provision in that it creates more level of penalties for the first and second offences and it only allows the existing level of penalties for a third offence or in certain cases, which I will lay out later, where the judge deems there to be aggravating circumstances.  Importantly, in the case of dwelling events, the Bill only allows for the lowest level of the penalties, which is for the first offence.</p> <p> If the Bill is passed, there will be five levels or categories of enforcement which can be stipulated in the regulations.  The first is called non-penal.  This is for measures which are included in the regulations so they need to be complied with by law but do not carry a penalty.  This includes, for example, the maximum number of people who could attend non-contact training.  The second category is penal.  This is what we will now have three levels of penalty for, for first, second and third offences.  This includes, for example, violation of the measures by retail outlets.  The third category is what is called a relevant provision and this allows for licensed premises to be shut for the day, or for longer in the cases of further offences.  The fourth category is fixed charge notices, which allow for on-the-spot fines.  This would include, for example, domestic travel, face coverings and relevant indoor and outdoor events.  The fifth category is the so-called "dwelling event" and this is specifically for large social gatherings in houses.  This allows for only the first tier offence under the penal provision to be applied.</p> <p> In summary, the Bill provides for penal provisions under the Act to be prescribed as fixed penalty provisions, meaning that persons alleged to have committed an offence under a fixed penalty provision may pay a fixed penalty in lieu of prosecution.  It provides that, on prosecution, different levels of penalties may apply to first, second and third and subsequent offences under the Act and, finally, it provides for provisions to be prescribed as dwelling event provisions, meaning that if the Garda reasonably suspects a breach of such a provision, it may attend at the entrance to the private dwelling and direct persons to leave that private dwelling or the vicinity of that private dwelling.</p> <p> I will go through the Bill section by section.  Section 1 provides that "Act of 1947" means the Health Act 1947.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of a definition of "fixed penalty provision", "dwelling event provision" and "penal provision".  Section 3 provides for the insertion of subsection (6C) on fixed penalty provisions.  Such provisions allow for a fixed payment notice to be served on persons in respect of an alleged offence.  The person may opt to pay a fixed fine within 28 days rather than face prosecution in court.  Paragraph (b) sets out the matters that should be taken into account when deciding to prescribe a penal provision to be a fixed penalty provision.  These matters include the nature of the offence, how prescribing it would prevent the spread of Covid and the impact prescribing it might have on the normal functioning of society.  Paragraph (c) provides that the Minister may make regulations for the form of notice and the process to be followed.  Paragraph (d) sets out that the Minister must consult with the Minister for Justice and Equality before prescribing a penal provision as a fixed penalty provision.</p> <p> Subsection (6D) amends section 31A to enable the Minister to prescribe penal provisions to be dwelling event provisions.  Paragraph (b) of this subsection sets out the matters that the Minister should take into account when prescribing a penal provision to be a dwelling event provision.  These matters are similar to the matters relating to the fixed penalty provision but also include the risk of Covid in indoor or confined areas.  This makes sense because the alleged offence is occurring in a private dwelling indoors.  As with the fixed penalty provision, paragraph (c) sets out that the Minister must consult with the Minister for Justice and Equality before making a decision.</p> <p> Subsection (6E) provides that, in relation to proceedings for an offence in respect of a dwelling event provision, the event organiser shall be assumed to be the occupier unless proved otherwise.  This means that if there is an event happening in a private dwelling that is not allowed under the regulation, the occupier of the dwelling is assumed to be the organiser.  The offence here is by the organiser.</p> <p> The Bill also provides for a new subsection setting out tiered penalties.  As I have said already, the current legislation allows for a fine of up to &euro;2,500 and-or six months in prison.  It is proposed to replace this one-level provision with a three-tiered provision based on the number of offences committed.  This provision applies when someone who is charged with an offence ends up in court.  It is separate to a fixed penalty provision.  If it ends up in court, then there is a reduced tariff for the first offence of a fine of no more than &euro;1,000 and-or one month in prison, a tariff of &euro;1,500 and-or three months in prison for a second offence and a tariff, which is currently the only tariff available, of &euro;2,500 and-or six months in prison in respect of a third and subsequent offence.  In a situation where someone is given a fixed penalty notice and does not pay in 28 days, it automatically becomes a court matter and these penalties come into play.</p> <p> Finally, the new subsection also provides for a judge to impose a sentence of up to &euro;2,500 and-or up to six months in prison where there are aggravating circumstances.  This means that if the judge feels the offence is particularly serious, especially on public health grounds, then the judge can impose the highest tariff.  The Bill also provides in section 3(c) for the substitution of a new definition in subsection (16) in section 31A of "event organiser".  For a private dwelling, an event organiser is a person who arranges, organises or manages the event or otherwise causes or permits the event to take place.  In a place other than a private dwelling, the event organiser is a person who publicises, arranges, organises, manages or receives some or all of the proceeds from the event.  It also defines the terms "licence", "occupier" and "owner".  Section 4 of the Bill provides for fixed payment notices by the insertion of a new section 31C.  Subsections (1) and (2) provide for a fixed payment notice to be served on persons in respect of an alleged offence.  The person may opt to pay a fixed fine within 28 days rather than face prosecution in court.  If there is a decision made not to give a fixed payment notice, that does not prevent the initiation of prosecution.</p> <p> Section 5 of the Bill relates to the private dwelling provision I discussed earlier.  As I said, the Minister for Health can designate a provision in a regulation to be a penal provision and a dwelling event provision.  If that happens, this section of the Bill comes into play.  It provides for additional powers for the Garda.  Under subsection (1), where a garda suspects that a person is loitering with intent to attend an event in a private dwelling in contravention of a private dwelling provision, the garda may direct that person to leave the vicinity.  Under subsection (2), where a garda suspects that an event in contravention of a private dwelling provision is under way, the garda may direct the occupier of the private dwelling to require and cause the other persons to leave.  Subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b) permit the garda to attend at the entrance to the dwelling and request contact details for the occupier.</p> <p>Section 5(4) provides that it is an offence without reasonable excuse to fail to comply with a direction given by a garda under the section.  Section 5(5) sets out the penalties to apply.</p> <p> Those are the details of the Bill.  This Bill is all about enforcement but as my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has emphasised, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to engage, educate and encourage.  Only as a last resort will they enforce.</p> <p> I am conscious that there is an element of public trust at issue here.  People in Ireland are looking to the Government to lead and act appropriately, proportionately and fairly.  Should the Bill be passed, it will not simply be a question of making a regulation and then handing out fixed penalty notices.  The regulations will be considered carefully and drafted appropriately.  I ask Deputies to remember that the overwhelming objective is to enhance compliance with public health guidance and regulations.  Penalties are only one part of that and, as I said, will only be applied as a last resort.  Any system of enforcement only works if people can see that it is being used appropriately, that the sanctions are proportionate and that it is aimed at the greater good.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="10:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300005#C00200"><p>It is unacceptable that this legislation is being rushed through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in one day without proper scrutiny.  The Minister will say, of course, that this is necessary because these measures have to be brought in as quickly as possible but we know that rushed legislation is never the answer.  Elements of this Bill are obviously necessary but others concern me.  Our job, in opposition, and the job of Government backbenchers, is to scrutinise legislation, make sure it is fit for purpose and ensure that we have enough time to discuss proposed amendments.  The reality is that we will not have that time.  If we get past one or two amendments to this Bill, that will be a lot and then that will be the end of it.  An hour and a half has been allotted for discussion of the Bill.  We should have six hours or more to discuss it and the proposed amendments.  Good, sensible amendments have been tabled by a number of parties and Independents in opposition and we will not get the opportunity to properly debate or scrutinise them.  I will hazard a guess, although the Minister might surprise me, that not one amendment will be accepted by the Government, as has been the case for all of the emergency legislative provisions that have been brought forward and rushed through the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I agree that the vast majority of people have complied, and continue to comply, with public health guidelines.  I commend everybody who has done so because we all accept this is a difficult and challenging time.  None of us in this Chamber wants to be where we are.  None of us wants or likes restrictions.  We all want everything to get back to normal but we are dealing with a virus that is deadly, contagious and requires public health interventions.  </p>  <p>  The Minister has had support from the Opposition in this State that would make many governments across the EU jealous.  We have given support to emergency legislation and restrictions that have been imposed and caused a great deal of distress for people, social and economic harm.  We support public health measures and interventions because we must, at the core of what we do, protect lives.  That has to be what we do and should be acknowledged more by the Government.</p>  <p>  There are, of course, a minority of people who are not complying with the guidelines.  In my view, a majority of that minority can be encouraged to comply with the regulations and guidelines.  If such people were approached by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and asked to desist from what they were doing and to comply, they would do so.  They should not be subject to these fines and that is why we have submitted an amendment that provides for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to first ask somebody to desist from what they are doing, as opposed to instantly going for the fine.</p>  <p>  A minority of the minority who are not complying with guidelines are reckless.  That is unacceptable and those people have to be subject to enforcement because they are putting their own lives and health in danger but, more importantly, the lives and health of other people.  That is unacceptable.  There must, of course, be enforcement for those people.  Their actions are causing anger and frustration for the majority of people who are complying in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus and protect their communities.</p>  <p>  At the heart of our efforts to achieve high compliance must be ensuring a common sense of solidarity.  We must abide by the rules and protect each other, particularly the most vulnerable.  The recent approach and actions of this Government, whereby it has cut incomes and business supports for some of the most exposed sectors, has undermined the idea that we are all in this together.  The Government and the T&aacute;naiste have attempted to under the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in recent times and that has damaged the emergency team's credibility and undermined public efforts to contain the virus.  The approach must be, in the first instance, to encourage those who are not complying to understand the guidelines and comply for the greater public good.  An Garda has taken that approach.  If people continue to refuse to stick to the rules, there will be situations where enforcement is required, as I have said.  </p>  <p>  The fact that nothing in this Bill has anything at all to do with large companies such as those running meat plants will be surprising to many people and not surprising to some.  I am open to a sensible discussion about enforcement for those who breach guidelines and the role of big businesses, corporations, meat plants and all of those who also have responsibilities.  That has to be a sensible discussion where we have an opportunity to properly scrutinise this legislation, put forward amendments that will be properly debated and allow for the Minister to respond to them.  He will not be able to respond to the vast majority of the amendments that have been tabled.  We will not even hear the his view on the amendments or the Government's rationale as to why certain amendments are unnecessary.</p>  <p>  In essence, the Bill provides for certain categories of fines, fixed penal provisions, dwelling event provisions and penal provisions.  It sets only upper limits of fines between &euro;500 and &euro;2,500.  The problem is what those fines will apply to and the precise nature of the fixed penalty provisions.  The on-the-spot fines, if we want to call them that, will not be for Members of this House to decide.  It will be for the Minister to set by way of regulation.  He is asking us to give him a blank cheque to go and draft the regulations, decide what will be subject to a fixed charge notice or on-the-spot fine.  That will be solely his prerogative and we will have no say whatsoever in that.  We have some sense that it will apply to house parties and those who travel beyond 5 km from their homes, and I have a view on that, but we do not know precisely what it will mean.  We have no opportunity to ensure there are proper checks and balances in respect of how people can appeal, how long they have to pay and what happens if they do not pay.  All of that will be set out by way of regulation and the regulations will not come back to this House or the Seanad.  All the Minister has to do is consult the Minister for Justice and Equality and bring them in.  We are being asked to give the Government a blank cheque here and if the Minister was in opposition, there is no way he would give any party in government a blank cheque of that size.  That is not the way to bring in legislation.  The regulation that the Minister will bring in will resemble primary legislation more than it will regulations.  That is a big mistake on the parts of the Minister and the Government.  For that reason, I will not be able to support the Bill unless the Minister accepts the sensible amendments that have been tabled by my party and others.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that there has been a failure in some sectors, whether meat plants or other factory settings, to properly put in place infection control measures.  That has, in its own way, led to the spread of the virus.  That is why we have proposed an amendment to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  Our amendment would make Covid-19 a notifiable, occupational illness that would require workplace occurrences of Covid-19 reportable and require their reporting to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  This would ensure that the HSA can immediately inspect a workplace and ensure that workplace practices do not contribute to the spread of the virus.  It is vital that is done and it is what workers are calling for.</p>  <p>  We also need proper sick pay and I acknowledge that the Labour Party tabled a motion on this, which we supported.  Those are the types of solutions and measures that we should put in place, as well as powers of enforcement.  We are not seeing those types of solutions but we are seeing a Government bringing forward and rushing through emergency legislation containing measures that will impact on ordinary working people.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> I want to make an important point and I will do so as carefully as I can.  There are parts of this city and country where people live in apartments and in areas where the accommodation is very cramped.  There are apartment blocks of seven to nine storeys.  It is exceptionally difficult for people in those circumstances to socially distance and for children to adhere to the guidelines.  These are socially deprived and working class areas.  I have no doubt that when people in those areas look at these types of fines, they wonder if they will apply to them.  Is that where the Garda is going to enforce them, as opposed to in more affluent parts of this city and elsewhere?  That is a legitimate concern because people living in those flats or apartment complexes - with 50 or 60 families per complex - are trying to keep their children indoors and socially distanced.  Can the Minister imagine how difficult that is?  They will be looking at this legislation and asking how it is going to apply.  That is why we have to be proportionate and apply common sense to what we do.</p> <p> I also share the concerns articulated by the Garda representative bodies and others that the overly punitive approach proposed by the Government risks alienating people.  Over-enforcement can be as bad as under-enforcement.  Excessive powers and measures can undermine the solidarity we need for high levels of compliance and we could end up making the situation worse.  To avoid disproportionate fines, we have proposed amendments which would require new regulations issued under this legislation and amendments to regulations issued under the Act to be first approved by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  There is absolutely no reason whatsoever that, when the Minister crafts his regulations, he cannot bring them back to the D&aacute;il for scrutiny and approval.  I said this to him yesterday.  We are giving him these powers to make regulations but we do not even get a heads-up or an email from his Department to say he has signed the regulations and will post them on the website.  We have to check every hour to see when the regulations will be up.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  We are saying this time and again.  Yesterday he committed to more improvement.</p> <p> The regulations were put up on the website yesterday morning after we had raised concerns the day before and after we had a briefing.  Many of us were at that briefing with officials from the Department who were not able to answer questions.  That was not because they were not equipped to do so, but because we were asking about matters that were not in the legislation but would be in the regulations, including the precise application of the fines, to what and whom they will apply, under what circumstances and the precise penalties involved.  The Minister says that the fixed notices can be up to &euro;500, although we know they will probably be less than that.  We can all speculate.  For example, will the charge for a house party be &euro;50, &euro;100 or &euro;200?  What can I say to people?  It is a maximum of &euro;500 but I have no idea because the Minister will set that by way of regulation.  I am expected to support the Bill blindly and not know what that charge will be, not be able to tell people what it will mean or what the safeguards, checks and balances will be, because these will again be done by way of regulations that will not come back to this House.  How is that fair?  How is that the way to deal with this matter?  How is that the way to get support from the Opposition?  I just do not see how it is.</p> <p> Regular briefings were due to begin this week.  I raised this with the Minister yesterday.  The first briefing with the HSE yesterday was arranged at the same time that we were in this Chamber with the Minister.  As a result, none of the Opposition spokespeople on health could be at the briefing.  I contacted the Department and the HSE and they said they were going ahead anyway.  They did not even reschedule the briefing; they just went ahead.  This is the type of nonsense with which we are dealing all the time.  We want to be constructive and to work with the Government.  We want information, to be able to feed into decisions and to give people answers to questions.  We cannot do that if we are being kept in the dark.</p> <p> References to custodial sentences in this Bill are unacceptable.  I do not think custodial sentences are the way forward and those provisions will also be of concern to people.  We want these provisions to be removed and have tabled amendments to that effect.  The practicalities of this Bill are also questionable and we must ensure that whatever measures are put in place are actually enforceable and do not cause non-compliance.  High fines and sentences of imprisonment for breaches of the guidelines are not proportionate.  It is particularly inappropriate where the Minister is making regulations that would lead to such things without proper D&aacute;il or Seanad scrutiny of any future regulations.  That is going to be a very important part of how people see this.</p> <p> A number of Deputies have made the point that people want to hear from the Government what the plan is.  What is the plan on how we deal with this virus?  Where is the exit strategy?  How do we get out of this?  We will have restrictions for six weeks and these may or may not work and may or may not bring down the numbers.  What happens then?  This has been categorised as a yo-yo approach.  We ease the restrictions for Christmas, then in January and February we will be back in the same cycle again.  I acknowledge that we will be discussing some of this during the statements later but people do not have any confidence that there is a plan.</p> <p> The Government published the roadmap for living with the virus and, let us be honest, it is dead in the water.  It never took off the ground because we had level 3+, level 4+ and level 5-.  It never took off.  It was never a living document that was properly actioned.  The county-by-county approach is completely gone and has been for some time.  What is the plan now?  I can tell the Minister what I think should be in the plan.  First, we have to make sure we get testing and tracing right.  We have to do what we should have done during the summer and look at the core components of ensuring people are given hope and that there is a vision from the Government which can allow us not just to wrestle back control of the virus but stay ahead of it for as long as we possibly can.  I accept that that means people doing what they need to do and that there must be individual responsibility.  Of course it does.  However, it also means that the Government must play its part.</p> <p> As regards testing and tracing, we still have not been given any sense of how many staff there are or how many additional staff have been employed in tracing over the past number of weeks.  We all know that when the cases get to a certain level they are going to overwhelm the system.  We all accept that but, equally, we accept that there is not enough capacity in the system and there has not been from the get-go.  The Minister has to accept that as well.  People who are working in the system are contacting us, some of them in tears, telling us that they simply cannot keep up and that the system is creaking under the pressure.  Test and trace is important.</p> <p> I do not know how many times we, and Deputies from all parties, have come into this Chamber and asked the Minister what is happening at the airports.  There is no testing at the airports, even today.  The European traffic light system provides us with some opportunity and a framework to try to get this right.  Today, despite all the promises from the Government, we have no idea whatsoever what is happening at the airports.  We have very limited protections and the electronic passenger locator form is still not the answer.  There is no testing and tracing, quarantine or isolation, despite the fact that the WHO has told us time and again that the way to keep control of the virus is to test, trace and isolate.  We are not doing that at the airports.</p> <p> I said yesterday that we need an all-island response.  The memorandum of understanding that was signed by the Minister and the Minister for Health in the North was a good initiative and a step forward but it is not working.  That means the Executive.  The Minister is right that my party is in that Executive.  We are up for all-island solutions and we are trying to move others onto that ground as best we can within that Executive.  This is ultimately about the two Ministers for Health, the two Chief Medical Officers, CMOs, the Executive and the Government joining up their responses as best they can in respect of test and trace, sharing data and resources and aligning restrictions and public health responses.  I can tell the Minister, hand on heart, that my party is up for all of that and more.  If we do not act as a single unit for the purposes of controlling and preventing the spread of this disease across the island, we are not going to do it.  Those are the types of interventions that need to be made by the Government, as well as all the income supports and protections.</p> <p> The Government does not want to hear this, but it wasted the summer by not doing all that I have outlined.  The WHO has said that lockdowns are used for a number of different purposes, one of which is to try to contain the spread of the virus.  Let us hope that works and that the numbers come down.</p> <p>The other intent of a lockdown is to give us breathing space to build our defences.  I want to hear from Government what exactly that means in practical terms.  What actions and interventions will be taken?  Where will the additional capacity come from in all of these areas?  If we come out of this lockdown and testing and tracing is still not fixed, we still do not have testing in our airports, or we still do not have capacity in our hospitals, intensive care units or acute beds, that is squarely on the shoulders of the Minister and the Government.  We are asking people to make significant sacrifices.  I believe the vast majority will.  Those who do not and those who are reckless should be subject to enforcement, but the Government has to step up to the plate and play its part.  In my experience, the vast majority of people do not believe the Government or Minister.  We need to see a new plan that gives people hope, a sense that we are in control and a sense that we can come out of this.  That is what people want and expect from the Government, and they are simply not getting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="11:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300007#E00200"><p>I would like to share time with Deputy Brendan Howlin.  Over the past seven months, the Government and State have made some big asks of the Irish people and here we are again.  Businesses have closed, hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs, especially in the past week, lives have been completely disrupted and turned upside down, and society in many ways has ground to a halt, all in the name of defeating this deadly virus that has taken so many lives and remains such a threat.  We are making all these sacrifices because the alternative does not bear thinking about.  There is no doubt that we will count the cost of this pandemic for many years to come.  It needs to be said at the outset of this debate that the people have, by and large, played a blinder in their attempts to defeat the virus.  The majority of people have and we must acknowledge that.  The example shown by tens of thousands of people in the HSE, by public servants, those working in front-line services, both private and public, by many businesses, by workers and by volunteers has been incredible.  It is something we have never seen in our lifetime.</p>  <p>  I am saying this at the start of the debate because this Bill is a step change in the Government's approach to dealing with the virus.  While the Labour Party will support this Bill, we do so with great and sincere reservations.  If the threat of the virus to human life and our society was not as great as it is, there is simply no way that we would contemplate supporting a Bill such as this.  Even with it being as great a threat as it is, we believe that this issue needs to be considered very carefully.  In general, we regrettably see the need to have a deterrent in place for irresponsible individuals, people who think that this virus is a hoax, or who oppose the public health guidelines based on conspiracy theories, people who deliberately and explicitly ignore public health guidelines, putting everyone else in danger, or those who simply use this situation for their own ideologically warped purposes.</p>  <p>  Before going through the contents of the Bill and setting out my party's position, I want to make a point to the Minister and to everyone here.  This is not the way that we should be doing business.  A Bill such as this, which provides for on-the-spot fines for contravening public health guidelines, should not be rushed through the D&aacute;il in a single day.  The Minister probably agrees with this.  He would be dancing around if he was in opposition.  It certainly should be rushed through the D&aacute;il in a single day having been published less than 48 hours previously.  It is completely wrong, disproportionate and downright dangerous.  Amendments to this Bill will not be discussed.  We will get to the first one and that will be it.  The Minister said this has only been drafted this week.  I find that hard to take.  The pandemic has been going on for seven months, so surely preparation was in place?</p>  <p>  The substance of this Bill is in section 3, which states: "The Minister may make regulations prescribing such one or more penal provisions as are specified in the regulations to be fixed penalty provisions."  In plain English, those are on-the-spot fines.  This is a key point.  The Bill does not lay out what the offences will be that will be subject to the on-the-spot fines but has given the Minister the power for such regulations to specify the fines.  The Labour Party believes that those regulations need to be examined in the D&aacute;il before they come into force.  We will support amendments that have been tabled to give that effect.  We are a responsible Opposition party.  We do not oppose things for the sake of opposing them.  We are saying directly to the Government and the Minister that they need to listen carefully to us and other Opposition parties on this issue.</p>  <p>  Public buy-in is essential.  While I believe there is widespread but considered public support for these measures, I also believe that this public support could collapse if the Government gets it wrong.  What offences will be subject to such on-the-spot fines?  With all due respect to this Government, given the volume of continual blunders, with another this week, that it has made on all of these issues, it does not exactly inspire confidence in me, my party or many others.  The Labour Party believes that the correct approach is for regulations to be brought before the D&aacute;il before they come into force and I want the Minister to consider that.  There will be grey areas and difficult calls and we owe it to the public and to the individual men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who will enforce these rules, to ensure that the Government gets it right.</p>  <p>  Section 4 deals with the process by which a member of An Garda can issue an on-the-spot fine and the methods by which it can be paid.  It is important to say that on-the-spot fines for traffic offences are cut and dried issues.  Someone either was over the speed limit or parked on a double yellow line.  Public health guidelines are far more complex and garda&iacute; will be dealing with a far more difficult situation.  Common-sense policing will be vital if it is to be a success and continue to have public support.  We also need to ensure that there is equality of treatment, and I would appreciate if the Minister for Justice and Equality could listen rather than use her phone.  We need equality of treatment because the virus does not respect different social settings.  It does not care what setting it is in, whether somebody is from an affluent setting, a working-class housing estate, a rural area or an urban area.  Everybody has to be treated the same.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to clarify to the D&aacute;il that garda&iacute; will take a common-sense approach when dealing with these situations and that enforcement will be a last resort.  It would be helpful if the Minister would assure the public that people will not be penalised for inadvertently breaching the guidelines.  This is an important issue of civil liberties and we believe that the Government needs to set matters out clearly through the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Section 5 deals with house parties and other indoor events.  I am pleased that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not be given the power to enter houses.  Even though we support the public health efforts, we would not support this Bill if that was the case.  Garda&iacute; will have the power to knock on the door, ask to speak to the organiser and take his or her details as necessary.  Given the difficult circumstances we are in, this is the right approach.  It is balanced between civil liberties and the need to enforce the regulation, which gives the garda&iacute; the ability to make their presence known without intruding into a person's home.  I stress that the Minister must come back to the D&aacute;il with the regulations that set out what will be subject to the on-the-spot fines.  As we all know well, public buy-in is vital in everything that we are doing to defeat this virus.  If we get this wrong, the Government will lose the dressing room.  It will lose the public.</p> <p>If the regulations are nonsensical and contradictory or if the public can see they are not fair or are not being fairly implemented, they could easily become counterproductive.  How the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice provide these, implement them and ensure they are enforced must be done with great balance and very delicately.  I hope the Ministers listen to us and consult the D&aacute;il and Seanad on these rules before they come into force.  While that might require some humility from the Minister for Health, it is a small sacrifice to make when we are dealing with such legislation.</p> <p> Finally, I wish to comment on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Ms Antoinette Cunningham, general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, and the AGSI have made some valid points about this legislation.  The AGSI has concerns about practical enforcement and the possible undermining of policing by consent.  We are putting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in an invidious position.  It will have to make some fairly close calls.  We must support the Garda and ensure garda&iacute; are not left in a difficult situation.  We must see how these regulations work out and how they will be managed.  We must learn quickly, and the Garda must be supported in doing that.  I am not comfortable with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being left in circumstances in which it is not clear how it should implement something.  We must work with the Garda very closely, particularly in the coming weeks when this legislation is passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="11:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300008#F00200"><p>I am happy to have an opportunity to speak, even briefly, on this Bill.  Every member of the Labour Party and, I suspect, the vast majority of Members of the House have the gravest concerns about this type of legislation.  If he was not in ministerial office, I believe the current Minister for Health would be among those voicing the concerns.  In any normal circumstances we would not countenance laws such as this being brought before the House.  However, we are not in normal circumstances.  The priority of all Members is to ensure that we uphold the health and safety of the people who elected us to the House.  That simple and overarching objective trumps many of our concerns.</p>  <p>  Last night, we extended the restrictions we enacted, I believe unanimously, at the beginning of the pandemic because the threat to the lives as well as the health of citizens is at least as real now as it was six months ago.  These are extraordinary powers.  We are modifying some of them and supplementing others.  The general principle with which I approach these matters is that rules without sanctions are simply advice.  While advice is important, and the vast majority of people adhere to advice, there will be some who will not and put their fellow citizens at risk.  Therefore, we must have the possibility of being able to ensure that the advice is implemented, and that must be by way of penal sanction.  In the current circumstances, that is warranted.</p>  <p>  However, we are on the threshold of going too far.  I am happy with the approach to private dwellings, as Deputy Kelly mentioned.  It would be a bridge too far to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the authority to enter private dwellings, which can only be done by way of warrant now.  That would be unacceptable.  Where there is an obvious disturbance taking place and a crowd potentially transmitting infection, the power to knock on the door and stop that is good.  We will walk the road that far with the Minister.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a general point to Members, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle.  I was struck by the news yesterday regarding the statement made by the President of the German Bundestag.  Mr. Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble is somebody I worked with, and I would not often regard him as a defender of liberal values.  However, he made a strong and urgent appeal to German members of parliament.  He used the phrase, with which we are getting familiar in a different context, that German members of parliament must take control of Covid-19 legislation rather than rubber-stamp extensions of provisions put forward by the government.  He said that any extension of powers and any trampling or diminution of the rights of citizens must be accompanied by clear explanations, justifications and timelines, because democracy requires that.  Democracy is always tested most in a time of crisis.  As we have seen in some jurisdictions, authoritarian governments use the backdrop of a pandemic as a crisis to restrict people's rights.  We cannot fall into that trap, but I am fearful that the approach to this legislation has brought us on that path.</p>  <p>  There should be the fullest debate possible about this law.  Let us examine what happened this week.  The schedule for yesterday and today was published on Wednesday.  The Bill was published late Wednesday and early Thursday.  There was limited or no time for consideration of amendments.  There was no time at all for external consultation with concerned individuals, organisations or bodies, which we would usually consult.  That is not right or acceptable.  The 160 Deputies have been trusted by the people to be their watchdogs, the protectors of their rights and interests.  We must not only do that, but be seen to do it.  People must trust what we decide and the processes we use to decide.  That is not happening with this legislation.  It is not good enough.  The notion that we have legislation that, in essence, simply transfers power to the Minister to make regulations is not good.  There are volumes of judicial decisions relating to the limit of ministerial power to make legislation by statutory instrument.  That is being tested in this legislation.  It is not even good for the certainty the Minister requires for his actions because these are all ultimately subject to judicial oversight.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Kelly said, we believe that, on balance, the real and present threat not only to the health and well-being but also to the lives of citizens is such that we must set aside those concerns to support the Bill today.  Even if the combined Opposition voted against it, we still would not be able to overcome it.  I wish to put a clear marker down for the Government.  This is the last time this should happen.  If we have to sit on Saturdays and Mondays, let us do that and have proper briefings so we have time to consult external affected bodies which normally give good advice on these matters.  At the end of the day, we will be seen to do the job the people have set for us.</p>  <p>  I will be raising this in the D&aacute;il reform committee when it next meets, as I have indicated to the Ceann Comhairle.  I hope the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle will take a clear and strong stand on the fundamental right of Members of the House to have the time and capacity to do their job properly and effectively in the public interest.  If we do not do that, we will ultimately erode people's confidence not only in the laws we enact, but also in these institutions.</p> <p>I am privileged to have been a Member for quite some time.  Crises have arisen.  We needed to sit all night in the past on particular issues and sometimes they were not given sufficient time or the external scrutiny they required, but we cannot fall into that trap again.  On the conclusion of the Second Stage debate, I wish to hear from the Minister for Health or the Minister for Justice and Equality that the process by which this Bill was brought to us was a mistake, that it will not happen again and that they will accept the requirement to bring the statutory instruments, once they are perfected, back here for debate so that we can be fully clear on what we are doing in order that legislation is properly enacted by the Oireachtas and that we are not simply here as some sort of rubber stamp that has transferred the power to make law to the Executive.  That is not the way it is and that is not how the Constitution says it should be.  I hope to hear those reassurances at the end of this debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="11:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300009#G00200"><p>I am pleased to speak in support of my colleague, the Minister for Health, on this important legislation.  He has outlined the detail of the legislation and the intention of the Bill, which is the intention of all of us here, that is, to reduce the spread of the virus.  Covid-19 remains a real threat to all of us and, in particular, to our most vulnerable citizens.  This is a critical time for our country and we have a responsibility to comply with the public health guidelines and regulations for the good of everybody.</p>  <p>  While the vast majority of people continue to comply with the restrictions, it is clear that too many people are acting in a manner which enables the transmission of the virus and therefore additional measures are needed.  We hope the fixed-charge system being proposed will help to change behaviour.  It is important to note, however, that the Government's objective here is not to catch people out or to try to punish people who are adhering to guidelines, or even those who make mistakes, because we all make mistakes; the objective is to prevent the kind of behaviour that endangers others.</p>  <p>  We do not want to see a large number of fines issued for non-compliance.  Even with these new enforcement powers, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue with the policing policy that has earned the support of the vast majority of the public during the pandemic.  Deputy Cullinane said that these fines will be the first instance.  They will not be.  I reassure Deputy Kelly that the Garda will continue to use the "four Es": first and foremost the Garda will engage with people, they will educate people as to what the guidelines are on what they are trying to do, they will encourage people to comply where they are not in compliance and it is only as a final resort that they will enforce.</p>  <p>  People who are in breach of the regulations will always be given the opportunity by garda&iacute; to come into compliance before any further action is taken.  I reassure Deputies that this will continue.  I also reassure them that the legislation is not being introduced without consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  We engaged with him to understand the concerns and needs of the Garda.  The penalties applying to some of the current health regulations remain a potential fine of up to &euro;2,500 and-or six months in prison.  It is not new to have a penal provision or custodial sentences.  What we are trying to do is reduce them and bring them more in line with the potential breaches.  The new system of fixed-penalty notices will allow for a more proportionate system of fines.</p>  <p>  The legislation before the House will also make it an offence to organise an event in a private home such as a house party that is in breach of the public health regulations.  However, as we outlined, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not be given any additional powers of entry into a private dwelling.  It will be presumed that the occupier of the home in which the event is taking place is the organiser, unless it is proven otherwise.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also have additional powers to give direction on events in private homes.  These are, first, the power to direct someone intending to enter a dwelling for the purpose of attending an event organised in contravention of the public health regulations, or someone who is about to enter a dwelling for that purpose or who is attempting to enter a dwelling for that purpose.  They will be asked to leave the vicinity in a peaceable and orderly manner.  Where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na suspects that an event in breach of the public health regulations is taking place in a private dwelling, he or she may direct the occupier to require and cause all those attending the event to leave the home or venue, unless they are resident in the home.  For the purposes of issuing such a direction, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may attend at the main entrance to the home and require the occupier to provide their name.  A person who fails to comply with a direction of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month, or both.  The person may appeal against the conviction or sentence to the Circuit Court.</p>  <p>  I will outline some other operations the Garda is undertaking.  As Deputies will be aware, Operation Fanacht is focused on supporting public compliance with the public health measures.  The Garda Commissioner has announced that there will continue to be high-visibility patrolling by Garda members across the country.  Again, the focus here is not to try to catch people out to penalise them; rather it is to encourage people to adhere to the public health measures.  The Garda will continue to conduct checkpoints on main routes.  In recent weeks, that has involved 132 large-scale checkpoints a day on main arterial routes around the country, in addition to thousands of mobile checkpoints a week on secondary routes in towns and villages.  There will continue to be high visibility.  I understand the frustration caused to people caught at the checkpoints who are trying to get to work, school or to attend an appointment.  I plead with those who do not need to be on the roads to stay at home.  Yesterday, on my way to the D&aacute;il I saw there was as much traffic on the road as any other day.  That should not be the case.  I urge those who should not be on the roads to please stay at home and to continue to work at home.</p>  <p>  As has been done since the start of the pandemic, garda&iacute; will continue to engage with the most vulnerable in society to provide them with the necessary supports.  While the vast majority of garda&iacute; will be focused on engaging with the public, national units in areas such as crime detection, armed support, national security and organised crime, as well as divisional drug units, will continue to prevent and detect crime.  In particular, the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and the divisional protective service units will continue to support victims of domestic abuse under Operation Faoiseamh.  We were asked earlier this year to stay at home.  For many of us, home is our safe place and where we can be kept safe.  However, for others it is not a safe place and, unfortunately, domestic violence has increased during the pandemic.  Introduced at the start of the pandemic, Operation Faoiseamh has seen an enhanced level of support, protection and, I hope, reassurance to victims of domestic abuse.  Thousands of contacts have been made with victims of domestic abuse, as well as arrests and more than 100 prosecutions have commenced.  Yesterday, for the first time ever, a barring order was granted, essentially over video link, by Ennis District Court.  This is a new and very welcome development following the amendments to legislation over the summer.  I want victims of domestic and sexual abuse to know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and other services, including the vital services and supports provided by the community and voluntary sector, are still here for them.  Perpetrators should also note that there will be no let up in our efforts to tackle domestic and sexual violence.</p>  <p>  There will be a release of personnel to front-line policing, including 125 attested Garda trainees currently undertaking phase one training in the Garda College, 75 Garda trainees not attested, undertaking phase one training, and 60 garda&iacute; working as tutors or instructors in the Garda College, out of a cohort of 80 garda&iacute;.  This is in addition to the 45 garda&iacute; who temporarily transferred from the Garda College to the front line at the start of the pandemic and who have remained on front-line duty.  The deployments will take effect from 2 November 2020.  In addition, across the organisation, garda&iacute; in administrative roles will, where possible, be redeployed to operational duties.  The 12-hour contingency roster will also be extended until 31 March 2021.</p>  <p>  These are just some of the initiatives that have been undertaken and are being supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I know that these are strange and difficult times and I reassure Deputies that the Garda will always continue to support people, work with them and engage, educate and encourage.  It is only as a last resort that they will enforce.</p></speech>

We know that we have to do this, in part because of the lack of capacity within the health service.  We have to protect the health service from becoming overwhelmed.  We have been told repeatedly by the Minister and her predecessor that testing is essential and that it is a vital tool in our battle with this virus.  I was very disturbed yesterday to receive a notification that was circulated in the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL.  The heading was &quot;Urgent Notification Relating to SARS-CoV-2 testing at the NVRL&quot;.  The notice stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Due to unavoidable staff shortages, the NVRL will not be able to provide any SARS-CoV-2 testing on the weekends of 24, 25 and 26 October and 31 October to 1 November.  Apologies for the late notice and any inconvenience this may cause. </blockquote> <p>Is the Minister aware of this?  What will the implications be?  Will he outline what additional capacity has been sourced in order to ensure that this does not have the potential knock-on effect that we know it could have?  What efforts have been made to address the short-staffing in the National Virus Reference Laboratory, which is concerning?  What will be done to ensure that when the swabbing takes place the testing will also take place?  We have already seen a shambles with regard to the tracing with people now being asked to trace their own contacts.  Testing is absolutely essential.  It was outsourced previously.  Is it the Minister's intention to shore up capacity?</p> <p> I tabled an amendment to the legislation that would see Covid-19 designated as a workplace injury and make it notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  I understand there is support within the Minister's party for doing this.  Will he consider my amendment and ensure that the maximum protections are given to people at work?  This legislation is a lot about personal responsibility.  There is nothing in this, however, that will make an employer or someone running a factory take notice.  If Covid-19 was to be designated a workplace injury and notifiable, as per my amendment, that would send a message that it is not only about personal responsibility but employers have a responsibility and a duty to their staff.</p></speech>

I believe that should be included in the first group of amendments because the objective is exactly the same.  Will that be reviewed prior to the end of Second Stage?</p>  <p>  It is hard to know how many speaking slots will be filled on Second Stage.  Three and a half hours are allowed.  If they are not fully used up, can we carry over that time to Committee and Report Stages?  We are all asking for additional time on this and there is no doubt that this is no way to do business.  The Minister has really put people in a difficult situation.  This legislation will undoubtedly severely curtail people's freedoms.  It should not be rushed by any means.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="11:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300010#H00400"><p>Okay.</p>  <p>  A briefing was called at short notice on Wednesday evening, which was highly unsatisfactory.  We were told that this has nothing to do with house parties, yet the Government's portrayal is that it is all to do with house parties.  I will come back to that later when we consider the regulations in more detail.  That is no way to do business, however.  We should not have to take key decisions here today in a rush.  I am putting down a marker at the very beginning that this is highly unsatisfactory and a very unprofessional way of dealing with legislation.  It is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  We are at level 5 now.  There are questions to be asked about why we find ourselves at a point where level 5 had to be invoked.  We are facing a national emergency.  We all want to be part of the national effort in responding to that emergency.  However, the Minister is making it difficult for us.  This Government, and to a certain extent the previous Government, has excluded the Opposition from any kind of national response.  That has been a poor decision.  Clearly we need to be speaking with one voice.  We need to come together sharing expertise and identifying those actions which are most likely to be effective in controlling the virus.  The issue of what is the best approach to take to tackling this huge threat to our lives and livelihoods should not be a matter for political division.  Instead, it should be a case of working together on a cross-party basis to devise a national strategy for responding to this.  Several times I have asked the Taoiseach to reach out to other parties to work together on this on the basis of the best advice and expertise.  Not only should that be the case at a political level, it should also be the case in terms of expertise being brought in to agree the national response to this issue.</p>  <p>  We have highly qualified people in NPHET and good people with expertise in public health and mathematical modelling.  While all of that is really important, it is only one aspect of it.  Back in early summer, I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that he would consider broadening the range of expertise that would be brought in to decide the best national response.  He told me at that point there was a Cabinet sub-committee.  That is all very well but the Cabinet sub-committee does not possess the kind of expertise required to respond in that broad way.</p>  <p>  I drew attention then to the fact that the decisions on level 5 were taken by ten respected people but that all of them were male.  There is an urgent need to bring diversity to decision-making because we should have the kind of balance that would be achieved with a gender balance.  We also need to bring in other expertise on, say, human behaviour and what is the best way to encourage people to come along with some of the severe actions proposed.  The mathematical and public health elements are a particular perspective.  There are other perspectives as well, however.  If the Government had involved broader approaches dealing with human nature, psychology and behavioural science, we would not necessarily find ourselves here today with the Government asking us to agree to the introduction of severe penal measures to get people to comply.  This should be about winning hearts and minds.  The Government should have set out to understand human nature better, come up with reasonable proposals. which would be seen as such, and bring people along.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Too often people hear measures being introduced that they cannot understand the logic for and feel that they are unreasonable.  Certainly some of them are unreasonable.  They do not necessarily add up to a situation where people can buy into the Government's response.  That is a real weakness in the approach that has been taken.</p>  <p>  I also have to express concern about attempts to demonise NPHET.  It is a highly qualified body but it is not the possessor of all wisdom by any means.  In the areas in which it has expertise, however, it is very good.  It is regrettable that when the Government's efforts fail, some if its members point the finger at NPHET and demonise it.  That has been entirely unhelpful.  I am speaking obviously about the T&aacute;naiste in particular.  Other actions of the T&aacute;naiste over recent weeks and months have also been unhelpful.  I am referring to deliberate efforts and comments on his part that were clearly designed to undermine the Government and Government agencies, while not playing his part in achieving a national response.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the Garda is not looking for the powers that the Government is setting out in this legislation, nor indeed has NPHET asked for them.</p> <p>The Minister spoke about the need to build trust.  Many people do not really trust the Government at the moment.  There are several reasons for that.  The political response to this should be aimed at gaining the public's trust.  It is very hard to do that if the response is not unified and steps are not taken to bring people together.  Moreover, unless the it keeps its side of the bargain, the Government will not retain the public's trust.  What is the deal here?  The Government must lead.  It must take the actions that only it can take so that it can bring people with it and expect them to play their part.  The vast majority of people have been playing their part, but people are increasingly asking why they should comply if the Government is not doing its bit. <br/><br/>There are major questions about why the Government is not doing its bit in a range of areas to which other Deputies have referred.  Testing is an obvious example.  The fact that this was not sorted out during the summer months is simply unbelievable.  It is incredible that weekend clinics are still being cancelled and results are being delayed.  It is unbelievable that the Government and the HSE have not sorted out the tracing issue.  This is fundamental.  Testing, tracing and isolation are central to the Government's approach to tackling the virus, but various aspects of that approach are now in complete disarray.  The linchpin of the Government's approach is not functioning.  The Minister must get that sorted out, and fast.<br/><br/>It was a revelation when we discovered a few weeks ago that tracing only covered the period of the previous 48 hours.  No detailed work was being done to identify where the virus was being transmitted.  We still do not know that.  It is guesswork.  We have not used the science or deployed the people who are capable of carrying out meaningful tracing that goes back seven or ten days.  At the heart of all of this is the traditional and continuing complete neglect of public health.  Most people had not heard of public health until the pandemic arrived earlier this year.  Public health has traditionally been hugely under-resourced.  It still is.  We only have a third of the public health doctors a country of our size requires.  The fact that a practitioner cannot become a consultant as a public health doctor is a real slap in the face.  The Minister recently promised to do something about that, but there has been no engagement with public health doctors or their representatives.  Public health nursing is another aspect of public health's position as the poor relation of our health service.  We are 700 public health nurses short of the complement a country of our size should have.  These are glaring areas where the Government needs to do its bit.  People are saying the Government is not doing its bit, and the Minister knows where that thinking leads.<br/><br/>The other area that has been completely neglected is travel.  I cannot understand that.  I have been raising this issue for months.  For the last few months there have been no safeguards or controls whatsoever at airports or ports.  The Minister mentioned the other day that as part of the European traffic light system he will look at or explore - phrases he uses frequently - the prospect of five-day quarantines and polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing at airports.  Why is the Minister only considering this now?  Is there any prospect of a system being put in place to address that issue any time soon?<br/><br/>The question of Northern Ireland relates that.  I am not saying it is straightforward by any means, but an all-island strategy must be actively pursued.  During the summer the North's all-party Committee for Health called for that.  That was the time for an immediate and positive response.  It did not happen.  It is essential that the Minister provides political leadership in all of these areas, and unfortunately that is lacking.<br/><br/>The Minister has brought legislation before the House which introduces further restrictions on people's lives and on what can happen in the country and enables him to impose penalties.  He has outlined some of what he has in mind, but the legislation allows him a very free hand to expand those restrictions and penalties.  It would be very dangerous to give a Minister that kind of <i>carte blanche </i>without any kind of democratic controls.  That is why my amendment requires any regulations to have the approval of the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>I have said that the briefing the other evening was very inadequate.  It told us something very different to what the Minister and the Government are saying now.  We need clarity on this.  Yesterday, like others, I heard by chance that the Minister had signed regulations.  The first of these imposes restrictions on the movement of relevant persons outside their places of residence.  Rather than outlining the things people should not be doing, the regulations set out 25 reasons for which people will be allowed to leave their homes.  That is incredible.  Without too much effort one can immediately think of another 25 or even 50 reasons that would be perfectly legitimate but are not listed.  For example, someone might travel 2 km by car to post a letter.  That is a legitimate reason, but it is not listed.  The Minister has been incredibly prescriptive in these regulations.  After outlining the 25 reasons, the regulations state that the paragraph in question will be a penal provision for the purposes of section 31A of the Health Act 1947.  The Minister is penalising people who leave their homes for reasons other than the 25 purposes he has prescribed.  The regulations then address events and dwellings.  That this is not a penal provision, despite what the officials told us.  While this is portrayed as a measure dealing with house parties, it actually does not do that in penal terms.  It sets out what people can and cannot do in their houses, but there does not seem to be any penalty attached.  Funerals and the operations of businesses, hotels, etc., are all covered by penal offences.<br/><br/>If this is the first set of regulations the Minister has come up with, I fear what he might do next week or next month.  It is completely unacceptable to expect the D&aacute;il to pass legislation allowing a Minister to introduce whatever regulations and fines he wishes without any democratic control whatsoever.  As I said at the outset, the Government's approach should aim to bring people with it.  It should win over their hearts and minds by speaking to them directly about how they feel about the huge price they are paying for the restrictions on their lives.  The Government should work with people and meet them where they are.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>It has not taken that approach to date.  The regulations the Minister signed yesterday do not take that kind of approach.  Given the first set of regulations the Government is proposing under the legislation, it is very difficult to have confidence in the judgment of the Minister or the Government regarding what we need to be doing.</p> <p> I refer to the areas that are causing difficulty.  House parties are undoubtedly causing difficulty.  What is the Government doing about them?  The regulations are very unclear about what steps will be taken in that regard.  Under the regulations, which are not penal regulations, garda&iacute; can knock on the door.  What happens if the door is not answered?  Is there anything the Garda can do in those circumstances?</p> <p> I do not think the Bill is what is required at the moment.  The Government needs to make a far greater effort to do what it undertook to do and get the basics right.  There needs to be an appeal to people to work together.  I have put it to the Taoiseach that unified political messages should be coming from the political system.  That will only happen if we can work together in a genuine attempt to reach agreement on what we should be doing in the national interest, and then encourage people to do that.  It is regrettable that that approach has not been taken.</p> <p> I urge the Minister to withdraw these regulations and to consider supporting the amendments that I and other Deputies have tabled, which I believe are quite reasonable.  The amendments propose that before introducing any regulations with relatively severe penalties, the Minister would get the approval of the House.  That is the only way we can build trust with the public.  I do not think it will happen otherwise.</p></speech>

Deputies have the right to criticise, but they also have the right to praise.  A significant amount of good work has been done, notwithstanding the criticisms all Members have of failings that are apparent in the system, particularly in respect of primary schools.  Two primary schools in my area had positive tests last weekend.  Up to yesterday evening, one of the schools, in which three young children tested positive, had not been contacted.</p>  <p>  That said, in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 8, which encompasses counties Louth and Meath, more than 100,000 tests have been carried out since March.  In County Louth, where I am from, 17,000 tests have been carried out.  In the adjoining county of Meath, part of which is in my constituency, 23,000 tests have been carried out.  Significant resources have been put in and there has been significant redeployment of nurses, doctors, dentists, physiotherapists, dieticians, social workers, administrative staff and other staff to help out.  I praise them for the work they have done and the organisational effort they have put in.  The Government has increased the number of tests to more than 100,000 per week, which is very important.  Unfortunately, the number gets bigger every day.  In the near future, 120,000 tests per week will be carried out.  Much has been done, but much remains to be done.</p>  <p>  I listened to the criticism of the Bill by Deputy Shortall.  I do not know what advice she has or what amendments she would make to the regulations to allow the Garda to deal with penalties under the Act, as it had to do yesterday on Grafton Street.  A group of people were resolutely determined to ignore the advice and encouragement of the Garda to desist from their illegal activity.  Unfortunately and sadly, several of them were arrested and will shortly be brought before the courts.  What do Deputy Shortall and her colleagues say about that?  Do they support it?  Where do they stand on that issue?  I know that I and my colleagues must stand on the side of the Government and with the approach of the Garda which, depending on the situation, involves an incrementally increasing strategy of encouragement, discussion and, ultimately, action as a last resort.  The Garda may not have the support of Deputy Shortall, but it certainly has mine.  There is a role for penalties, but only as a last resort when there is no reasonable alternative.  To imply that the Government-----</p></speech>

Many people, including me, get out of their car to go into a shop or to get petrol, suddenly realise they have forgotten their mask, and then go back to get it.  Most people who do not wear masks do so inadvertently.  It is not a determined action or an affront to other people.  However, some people refuse to wear masks.  That refusal puts the health of others at risk, particularly in enclosed spaces.  It is very important that there are incremental measures which the Garda can take if that is necessary to keep everybody safe.</p>  <p>  The main point about what is happening with this country is that we are at level 5, whether we like it or not.  I do not like it and I do not think any other Deputy does either.  We are at level 5 because the virus is getting out of control in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe, including in Spain, France and Germany, as well as further afield, such as in America, India and many other countries.  We must all heed clear and stark advice to stay at home if at all possible.  Notwithstanding that, I support the view that some physical activities are capable of being carried out individually and safely outside one's home and within a 5 km radius of it.  However, the fact is that we must accept the advice and act on it.</p>  <p>  The Government is acting cogently and properly in the way these regulations have been brought in and will be enforced.  I do not agree with all of the regulations.  Some of them need to be reviewed urgently.  Yesterday, I raised the issue of people who wish to go individually onto a golf course by prior arrangement, not meet anybody and play a round of golf alone.  There are also issues around gymnasiums and mental health.  The Government may need to do more thinking on that.  Along with NPHET, it should re-examine some of those issues because one of the big things is that if we are encouraging young people to adhere to the advice, we must accept that they have other social issues.  They should not be put down or given out to.  We must encourage and praise them and constructively engage with them to get their support.</p>  <p>  Members of the Opposition can be very negative.  Listening to some of the Deputies who contributed on this issue this morning, I heard only negativity, but maybe in their heart of hearts they have room for praise, particularly for the Garda and the workers who have given so much to help the public in fighting this dreadful virus.</p></speech>

It asks for powers that could only and should only be granted to a Government that has substantial levels of trust and confidence among the population.  I regret to say that this Government does not have that trust or confidence.  It absolutely should have.  Arguably it had it, but it squandered it.  The Government has abused much of the goodwill the Irish people invested in the collective efforts to get on top of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I could list any number of failures and debacles, but I will just concentrate on this week.  On Tuesday, we learned that the testing-and-tracing operation had collapsed to such an extent that the people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were asked to do their own contact tracing.  On Wednesday, we learned that far from learning previous lessons and protecting our nursing homes, almost the entire staff in one nursing home had been hit by Covid and that grave concerns were being raised about several others.  People rightly asked: how the hell have we got back to this point?</p>  <p>  Very late last night it emerged that the Virapro sanitiser widely used in schools but also in many other public settings, had been recalled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, causing further chaos in many schools that are already struggling to keep their doors open.  This morning as parents and teachers listened into "Morning Ireland", they heard Fran McNulty tell them that the recall actually happened on Tuesday.  In the absence of a debate on the issue that Sinn F&eacute;in sought for today, I want to put questions on the record and invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine to come into the Chamber today and provide answers.  Did his Department provide approval for this product in the first place?  If so how?  When did he and his Department first become aware of the concerns regarding this product?  When was it decided to consider recalling?  Why, when the decision to recall was formalised on Tuesday, was this decision not publicised until very late on Thursday night?  At what point were the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health informed that yet another debacle was coming down the tracks?</p>  <p>  In the absence of answers to these outstanding questions and with all these debacles, how could the D&aacute;il be seriously asked to hand over the wide-ranging and unspecified powers the Government is requesting today?  We absolutely need enforcement of the regulations.  Above all, we need the goodwill, trust and confidence of the people.  That needs to be earned.  The Government needs to earn it.  It is time for a sea change.  It is time to engage with communities that have done their level best from the outbreak of the pandemic.</p></speech>

The vast majority of people have adhered to the guidelines.  They have made enormous sacrifices of their liberty with financial, family and health implications and they will continue to make them.  In some ways a second lockdown was almost flagged.  If we are facing a third lockdown in February, the spirit of the people who had made such sacrifices will be broken.  There is a limit to what people can do.</p>  <p>  This Bill is largely cosmetic.  It tries to penalise people for holding house parties and so forth.  The powers given to the Garda to fine people and direct people away from particular areas and house parties are largely cosmetic.  On the issue of fines as a deterrent, people will be asking where the fines for meat processing plants were.  Where were the fines for nursing homes given that 56% of people who have died in this pandemic were residents in nursing homes?  Where are the fines for places like those?  None of that has been included in this Bill.</p>  <p>  In meat processing plants with no social distancing, workers' rights were under threat in respect of getting sick pay and so forth.  All that has been thrown in the air with this legislation.  As I have said, it is largely cosmetic.  There needs to be collective responsibility.  The vast majority of people have adhered to the guidelines.  The Bill is dangerous and will drive a wedge in the solidarity and the sense that we are in this together.  People will now say that we are not all in this together.  This is Government policy.  We cannot go for a third or fourth lockdown because the Government will lose people; it will lose the dressing room at that stage.  This will be completely academic and cosmetic in getting this under control.</p>  <p>  Policy is the most important thing.  The country has six weeks to change its policy regarding what it is doing at the moment.  We cannot go to another stage where we go back to a sense of normality at the start of December and then go back into another lockdown at the end of February.  We cannot do that; it will break people.  It is imperative now to have a policy change.  Testing and tracing are extremely important.  Opening the economy was a major mistake in the early summer.  We should have crushed the virus with a zero-Covid policy to really get on top of the pandemic.  If we do not, we will be in serious trouble.  As I said, this is largely cosmetic.</p></speech>

This is all about deflecting from the really deep systemic problems this society is facing.  We have seen the collapse of the tracing system with the domino effect on the testing system that we heard about this morning.  Deputy Carthy just talked about a complete disaster facing the schools.  Evidence was already coming through that they were in trouble.  F&oacute;rsa is calling for a strike by its school staff members and the ASTI has balloted.  They are not doing this because they do not care about the kids; the opposite is the case.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd wants us to praise people.  I utterly and totally praise the teachers and the other school staff who have done their best to get those schools open and keep them open.  I happen to live with a schoolteacher and the stress, worry and angst they carry with them every day through this pandemic is incredible.  I absolutely praise them, those working in the health services and all essential workers.  We have done so and we have clapped them to death, but we are failing them.  We are failing them because the number of infections is rising among our health workers.  The testing-and-tracing system has collapsed and our hospitals do not have the capacity.  Despite what the Minister says, his winter plan is not enough.  As we face into winter, we will face the same old problems with the beds and trolleys filling up, and the Covid cases will continue to increase.</p>  <p>  I have just read the speech the Minister, Deputy McEntee, gave in support of this legislation.  She mentions the four Es the Garda has been using: engage, educate, encourage and enforce as a final resort.  That is fine, but I am afraid what we are doing today is panicking and trying to turn four Es into four Fs.  I have no doubt that there will be a surge of fines against people who generally come from the lower economic classes.  We will not find garda&iacute; walking up the leafy suburbs of Castleknock and stopping somebody in their SUV with a crate of fine Pinotage wine going to a dinner party.  We will find that they stop young lads and young ones going through parks with a six-pack under their arm.  I believe the garda&iacute; do not want this at all.  In its panic, the Government is turning this into an argument about people's personal behaviour rather than the systemic failure of the Government to deliver.</p>  <p>  We are totally opposed to imposing fines on people.  In fact, they do not work.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has done some good research on this.  When we used to jail people for not paying their television licence fees, the jails were full of mainly single mothers who could not afford to pay their television licence fine and would go to jail for a day or two instead. </p> <p>The Minister may find that this will happen.  This approach does not work and is ineffective but, most important, it sends out the signal that we are not all in this together.  This is part of the domino effect where we have the tracing and testing systems collapsing, a lack of capacity in our hospitals, and our public health doctors in a panic because the amount of work they have to do means they cannot keep up with cases, never mind the ordinary day-to-day health issues they must deal with.   </p> <p> This legislation is an admission of failure not only in the past but also for the future because the Government intends to extend it to June.  It proves that the Government proposes a plan of ebb and flow, with lockdowns followed by reopening.  That will be a disaster for the population, psychologically, socially and economically.  It will not work for the levels of health service we need to achieve.  We advocate a zero-Covid policy which is not about a permanent lockdown but about focusing on the things this society needs.  We wasted the previous lockdown when we did not increase capacity to the levels required and reopened the economy too wide and too early.  As Deputy Kenny said, we never imposed restrictions and checks on workplaces such as meat factories and direct provision centres where the clusters broke out.  I am afraid history will repeat itself time and again unless the Government wakes up.  It is dividing the community, not uniting it.  People do not trust the Government and they are losing faith in it.  Nevertheless, the vast majority want this to work.  They want to see the pandemic end, a decent health service and normal life restored.  The Government's approach is a recipe for disaster and indicates panic.  There is also a strong class bias in how the legislation is framed and is to be imposed.  </p> <p> We saw the Garda quell events yesterday.  It already has the powers to do that, so why do we need to give it more powers?  If people refuse to mask up in a shop or on a bus, the Garda already has powers to do something about it.  This is a waste of our time yet again.  Unless we resource tracking and tracing, stop 7,000 people daily travelling into the country, have proper discussions with the Northern Ireland Assembly to have genuine and united cross-Border policies imposed to deal with the pandemic, we are wasting our time.  We need to return to a message that we are in this together and respect people, rather than treating them like children and telling them what they can and cannot do.  </p></speech>

Apologies for the late notice ... </blockquote>  <p>That is serious.  It is shocking.  It seriously contributes to undermining the fight against Covid-19.  Is that the responsibility of the people this Bill proposes to fine?  No, it is the responsibility of the Government and its failure to recruit enough people to build up the testing capacity to the degree necessary to fight Covid-19.  Similarly, if the infection rate is running riot, it has a great deal to do with the Government's failure during the summer to build up the tracing capacity for close contacts.  The people who failed to do that are the people who are responsible for the situation we are in now, namely, the Government.  </p><p>I will give another shocking example, which is also breaking news.  Eight third-year student nurses on placements in Sligo were due to start in a nursing home on Monday.  They had travelled from different counties and are sharing accommodation, with four in one place and three in another.  They asked their care placement supervisor if they could be tested prior to starting work but were told there was no need.  On the Saturday prior to starting work, one student nurse discovered she was a close contact of someone who is a positive case.  She went to a GP and asked if she should be tested but was told there was no need.  She told the GP she was going in to work in a nursing home on Monday and she was sure she should be tested.  She was told she was only a close contact of a close contact of a positive case, so there was no need.  She went to the length of pretending to have symptoms to beg for a test and having finally been tested, she tested positive.  That is truly shocking.  </p><p>I was sent a circular by a school principal which the Department of Education and Skills issued about two days ago.  In it, the Department suggests that if a teacher is positive, rather than follow the normal contact tracing protocols of the public health system, that teacher should ring a mobile phone number at the Department of Education and Skills, which will in turn contact public health authorities to make decisions about who are the close contacts of that case and who should be excluded.  The Department is interfering with the normal contact tracing and response to positive cases because the Government insists the schools must stay open.  If that results in more clusters and outbreaks because contact tracing is not being done, who is to blame?  Is that contributing more to the spread of this disease than the individuals this Bill proposes to target?</p><p>One can go through the list of failures.  The Government's own strategy essentially says that there is a tolerable level of community circulation of the virus.  Two weeks ago, it refused the advice of its own public health advisers with the result that the number of cases has almost doubled.  It is the Government's failure to have a strategy and put in place the resources to fight Covid-19 that is the reason we are in this situation we find ourselves in now.  Fines will not solve that.</p></speech>

The powers would allow a garda to call to a house, ask the people in the house to leave, and if they refuse to leave, the primary resident can be fined &euro;1,000.  A person on the way to the house can be stopped by the Garda and instructed to leave the area and return home.  If that person refuses to comply with the instruction, he or she can be deemed to have committed a criminal offence.  These are drastic powers.  I do not have time to go in to all the implications but we are being asked to accept the idea that people in their own home can be forced to give a garda their name and details, that someone who has never committed an offence in his or her life and who is in the territory of a first offence can be fined &euro;1,000 and that person would not necessarily go to court but be given a summary fine on the spot.</p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith was absolutely correct in comparing this with the situation around television licences back in the day.</p>  <p>People on low incomes and poor, working-class people could potentially end up in jail because they will not be in a position to pay a &euro;1,000 fine, whether on the spot or in court at a later date.</p> <p> We have been told that garda&iacute; will act with discretion in policing the regulations, but will that always be the case?  An incident took place on the Bandon Road in Cork city at the end of September when garda&iacute; called to a house where there was a gathering, entered the premises without a warrant, conducted body searches of the young people present and seized their college identification cards and handed them over to the authorities at University College Cork.  To be clear, I am totally opposed to house gatherings that are in violation of the guidelines.  I appeal to members of the public, in the strongest possible terms, not to have gangs of people around to their houses while the country remains in the current public health situation.  However, these measures are drastic and they are not acceptable.  They are part of a range of measures concerning masks, travel and protests.</p> <p> The protest that took place yesterday was organised by a group, Yellow Vest Ireland, to which I am very strongly opposed because it is anti-mask.  If one is anti-mask, one is anti-worker.  Refusing to wear a mask is showing no respect for the bus driver or the low-paid shop worker.  Some of the organisers of that march are far-right people whose politics are diametrically opposed to my politics and what I stand for.  However, I want to put it on the record that I am opposed to the idea of garda&iacute; drawing batons against participants in a demonstration, even a demonstration such as the one that took place yesterday, pushing them to the ground, handcuffing them and arresting them in significant numbers.  One of the reasons I am opposed to such action is that if it is used against people who are anti-worker today, it can be used against people who are pro-worker and pro-progress tomorrow.</p> <p> I wish to conclude by clearly stating my position on these matters.  I am a strong supporter of masking up.  I am a strong supporter of people not traipsing all over the country during the current travel restrictions and in light of the current public health situation.  The great majority of ordinary people understand and respect their responsibility in this regard and will embrace it.  However, we will not defeat the coronavirus with repression.  It simply will not work.  It will not be done on the basis of diktat but on the basis of persuading, understanding and encouraging a high level of consciousness.  That consciousness is already there but it needs to be linked to a strategy people can believe in, that they are confident will work and which they do not feel is being compromised from all angles by the vested interests in this country.</p></speech>

Lest Opposition Members feel that the Government is repressive and not conscious of the need to observe civil liberties, I assure them that the reverse is the case.  Members of the Government are as alert as anybody else in this House to the fact that it is unfortunate that we must move to a situation of restricting people's rights and movements because of the challenge of the pandemic.  There is no central ground in this.  We either take the virus on or we do not.  In the first instance, the Government was hoping that an appeal to the patriotism of the general public would work.  It did work, up to a point.  However, the Government is now being blamed for not succeeding in defeating the virus.  There is a complete and absolute failure to recognise that other governments all over the globe have been in the same situation and faced the same problems with no better results than we have had here or, in some cases, very much worse results.</p>  <p>  There are a number of facts that everybody needs to acknowledge.  One of those facts is that some 50% of people in this country strongly support every step that has been taken to restrict the forward march of the virus, notwithstanding the huge sacrifices they have required.  However, there are other people who do not feel the same way.  The graph we saw detailing how one person infected 54 other people as a result of that individual's irresponsible behaviour was sufficient illustration of what we need to do.  I am sure everybody in this House has made sacrifices.  I am sure every colleague has restricted his or her movements to the best of his or her ability by avoiding crowds and other interactions, following best hand hygiene practice and so on.  We all hope that such behaviours will enable us to succeed in controlling the spread of the virus.</p>  <p>  Some of those who say the testing and tracing system is broken down hold out the example of South Korea as a utopia in this regard.  That country has approximately one quarter of the resources we have in dealing with the virus.  The difference is that people there have a different attitude to the law and have embraced public health recommendations.  I understand why we are a bit more suspicious in this country but, if we are going to defeat the virus, we will have to make more sacrifices.  If we do not do what is necessary in the next month or six weeks, we will have another problem which nobody has mentioned yet in this debate.  That problem is the possibility that, at some stage, the front-line workers, who have been in the battlefield day and night, 24-7, week after week for the past seven or eight months, will get very seriously brassed off that they are having to make those sacrifices and take those risks on a daily basis while other people feel that there should be no restrictions at all and are breaching the rules in ways that could take us back to where we were at the start of the pandemic.  The actions of those individuals could lead to a situation where a duty is once again thrust upon emergency services staff to continue working in the face of insurmountable odds.  I try my best, as I am sure does everybody in this House, to observe the rules and regulations.  I am not going to identify any particular group that is encouraging the type of behaviour I referred to, because that is not my job.  However, I cannot understand how certain groups of people could converge together over the past two months, in whatever mode or mood, without knowing what the consequences of such activity could be.  Those consequences are now showing up and accelerating, which was always going to be the case.</p>  <p>  Much has been said, in another effort to blame the Government for what has happened, about the lack of investment in health services in this country.  Whether or not it suits one's position, the reality is that Ireland has the second or third highest spend on health services in the OECD.  That is a well-documented fact.  There is no point in saying it is not true or one does not agree it is the case.  It is a fact.  It may be the case that we are not spending the money in the right way or responding in the right way to the crisis but the fact remains that the money is being made available.  This country has invested something like &euro;18 billion in attempting to combat this particular threat.  The pandemic is the single biggest threat that this country, any other European country or any country globally has had to face in the past 150 years.  Sadly, the virus keeps coming back and people keep pointing the finger in one direction or another and heaping blame on somebody else.</p>  <p>  The simple fact we must all recognise is that everybody has a role to play and a responsibility to combat the spread of the virus.  I have repeatedly said, both within my own party and outside it, that we must appeal to people's patriotism.  People must ask themselves, whatever they are proposing to do, whether a particular action of theirs will create a possibility of the virus being transferred, either to them by somebody else or from them to another person.  That is a serious question.  If we continue to involve ourselves in congregations - many people are doing so, notwithstanding the circumstances in which we are operating - we must ask ourselves whether that is contributing to the defeat of the virus or otherwise.  We all have a choice in how we respond to the threat.  My belief is that we could voluntarily achieve the same results as the restrictions and financial supports are designed to achieve simply by voluntarily adopting the measures we have been advised to follow by all the health experts who have given of their time, energy and experience.</p> <p>At this stage it falls to us, the population in general, rather than any social group or class group, to observe the guidelines.  By doing so, we will be able to bring the virus to a halt and give ourselves space and time.  If we do not, we will see the spectacle of bodies building up in hospitals and morgues and being carted across the country as happened in central Europe at the beginning of the pandemic.</p></speech>

We see the same factories that continued their non-essential work throughout lockdown now forcing workers to take holidays over the coming weeks.  We are asked to vote for regulations without scrutiny.  That is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  Are our hospitals now ready?  A number of people within the health service have shared concerns with me.  They could be described as whistleblowers.  They have told me about deteriorating conditions within University Hospital Kerry, UHK.  Management has been telling consultants to cancel surgeries so that beds can be kept in reserve.  These patients have been tested for Covid and isolated for two weeks but then, the night before their surgery, they are told that it is cancelled.  We discussed the chronic underinvestment.  Theatres in UHK are outdated.  Built in the 1980s, the orthopaedic unit urgently needs another theatre.  No hip replacement procedures have been carried out since March and 150 patients have been sent to Bon Secours Hospital at a great cost to the State.</p>  <p>  These people have told me about the treatment of nurses.  Quality staff are not being offered permanent contracts.  Morale is low and communication between management and staff is poor.  The acute medical assessment unit, the brainchild of one consultant that has worked very well, now accepts overflow from the emergency department and, consequently, has even fewer beds.  The pathology laboratory has no pathologist, despite funding being allocated for two.  </p>  <p>  The people to whom I have spoken warn of potential disaster in the area of cancer screening.  The state-of-the-art endoscopy unit at the hospital is threatened with closure.  The programme is being plundered and nurses are being dispersed to the wards and, as a result, the detection rate will drop and cancers will probably go undetected.  The money paid to UHK from bowel screening programmes is now being used to pay the salaries of surgeons in Cork.  The funds are being diverted away from Kerry.</p>  <p>  With regard to surgery, the hospital had 70 inpatient beds, which is two full wards, and a day ward catering for 14 patients two years ago.  It now has 29 inpatient beds and no day ward.  The ear, nose and throat surgeon is due to retire and there are no plans to replace him.  Patients in Kerry will be at risk during basic procedures such as tonsillectomies because, if complications occur, no one will be available locally to follow up.  This is similar to the situation in respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund which, apart from not representing good value of money, lacks continuity of care.  Arthritis Ireland has also contacted me, as well as other Deputies, to say that the number of people waiting for rheumatology appointments increased by 26% between January and September of this year.</p>  <p>  Staff are committed to the healthcare system and have suggested solutions.  In towns of a similar size such as Clonmel, modular wards have been built.  In Letterkenny, another ward was installed in the car park to deal with the trolley crisis.  Nurses need to be recruited on permanent contracts.  Endoscopy should be considered an essential service.  The unit has the capacity to perform all types of scoping procedure but it must be staffed.</p>  <p>  If the hospital in Kerry is to be officially downgraded, let the Minister state as much in the House and defend that decision.  Kerry would ideally have its own stand-alone health board to prevent the hospital being downgraded.  The situation is bad enough at the best of times as the county has the second oldest population in the State but, during a pandemic, this would be unconscionable.  I ask the Government to reverse the cuts and to do right by the people of Kerry and the south west.</p></speech>

The Ministers have to decide who is going to take care of the shortfall mentioned in this announcement.  We have lost the capacity for 30,000 tests at the laboratory.  We do not know who will do them instead or what preparations have been made while we lock down the country and tell people that it is their fault.  We have heard Deputies say that we, as citizens, have to take responsibility.  This is the responsibility of the Government alone.</p>  <p>  I have seen the Virapro plan and the pesticides control service, PCS, certification for that sanitiser.  This certification is very difficult to attain and most products already on the shelves in Ireland do not have it because it costs &euro;300 and is not required.  However, it is required where a product is used in Covid prevention.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is now telling us that "Tests by the Department show that some of the sanitiser on sale does not comply with regulations." How then did this product receive certification?  How many other products have a certification they should not have?  I ask the Ministers to speed up certification for compliant products so that replacement supplies will become available, allowing us to keep our schools open.  I also ask that they investigate how the product Virapro receive PCS certification.  Was it tested before it received this certification or after it had received it and had to be withdrawn?</p>  <p>  These issues have arisen this morning but, more generally, I do not agree with Deputy Durkan and those who defend what can only be described as a failure of the State to put sufficient contact tracing in place and to build additional capacity within the HSE and in ICUs.  The Government knows that the patience of the public is quickly wearing thin.  These fines are proposed because the Government feels that stronger tactics are required to bring people into line.  I can see the argument for breaking up reckless events and I see that deterrents are proposed in that regard but many people see these restrictions as unjust, unfair and a significant attack on their fundamental freedoms.  </p>  <p>  These Covid regulations are the most draconian laws to be imposed on the people in the history of the State.  Some of our most fundamental rights under the Constitution are being cast aside.  In proposing these fines, the Government will strike fear into the hearts of ordinary law-abiding citizens.  Evidence from the previous lockdown shows that people will be afraid even to undertake essential journeys for fear of being punished.  How will the regulations work in practice?  </p>  <p>  I was elected by the people of Wexford to represent their views as best I can.  I will give the Minister a flavour of the types of issues that have been raised with me.  Farmers in rural areas who do not have Internet skills or whose broadband service is poor can no longer buy cattle in the mart.  They have been banned from attending and from standing at the ringside to place their bids.  Retired couples who have not had as much as a penalty point between them are threatened with fines if they dare to drive to the local park to walk their dog.  In rural communities, the local park could be 8 km to 10 km away and many people, old and young, do not feel safe walking on winding roads as cars fly past.  Will they be fined or threatened with fines?  </p>  <p>  What of widows or widowers who enjoy a round of golf with their best friend for company?  This sport, played out in the fresh air on hundreds of acres allowing for as much social distancing as one could want, is now banned.  There are other incredible anomalies in the area of sport.  Children can train for most sports except tennis and golf, two of the most socially distanced sports imaginable.  All is good for a child who plays Gaelic games but a child in the same house who plays tennis or golf is banned from doing so.</p>  <p>  The hard-working entrepreneurs who run SMEs may have spent thousands of euro in preparing to reopen but now have to close yet again as they are threatened with being financially punished by the State if they do not.  These people have been financially punished enough by the State this year.  </p>  <p>  I have had anxious calls from college students from Wexford and their parents.  They wonder if students will be fined for returning home on Friday after a week in college.  It is easy for the Government to flippantly tell them that they must stay in their college accommodation but it is not always as simple as that.  We in this House do not have to remain in Dublin all week.  We can return home when our week's work is done.  I want clarity as to whether students can do the same. </p>  <p>  I also have concerns about the provisions to fine the owner of a property if any illegal gatherings take place on that property.  Will the Minister clarify how this will work?  Will it mean that landlords will face fines for the behaviour of their tenants?  If so, that is an outrageous situation.</p> <p> These regulations contain so many grey areas and are so open to interpretation.  In fact, quite often the Government does not seem to understand what the regulations mean, or its understanding seems to be significantly different from Minister to Minister given that there was such confusion during the press conference the other night about when midnight on Wednesday was.  For many, understanding the inconsistencies in these regulations will be like trying to understand the terms and conditions of a mobile phone contract.  A PhD would be needed.</p> <p> The Irish people take great pride in the fact that our police force operates on the principle of policing by consent.  The proposed laws will be the most draconian that the Garda will ever be asked to enforce.  I ask the Government to clarify the position relating to them.</p></speech>

It suffers from significant deficits.  These are largely attributable to the inadequacies of the South/Southwest Hospital Group administration, to which University Hospital Waterford is also connected, unfortunately.</p>  <p>  The proposed legislation signals our arrival at a difficult juncture.  The questions now are whether we can live life as somewhat normal and whether society can function while we attempt to keep coronavirus at bay.  Since the virus arrived in Ireland in February, we have learned of the harsh dangers it presents, especially to our most vulnerable, including the elderly, those with underlying conditions and those who must undertake other medical treatments.  Beyond these patient streams, the virus has the potential to cause significant disease, although, thankfully, the severity and duration of illness seem to be considerably lower.  We have learned about the ease with which this disease is transmitted.  We can defend against this in hospitals with strict infection control protocols and in general in society through countermeasures involving hygiene standards and social distancing.  Social distancing has proved most effective but, unfortunately, has become the more difficult discipline to adhere to and enforce publicly.  That is because, for many, it is enforcing isolation and loneliness, causing businesses to fail and creating social anxiety.  For many, it is becoming overwhelming because they see the trajectory of the disease is going in the wrong direction.</p>  <p>  In attempting to drive home a Covid prevention message, our national media speak of the horrors of emergency rooms overflowing, first responders unable to deal with acute Covid distress and the potential for hospital morgues to require additional refrigeration capacity in the form of 40-foot containers parked on hospital grounds.  For many, this narrative no longer holds substance given the experience in recent months of a lower median age of those infected and lower numbers of deaths.  Many outside the vulnerable groupings whose members have contracted the illness have sufficiently overcome the disease, recuperating at home and with minimal discomfort.  The recent rise in the Covid-19 transmission trend is directly related to people's not unfounded assumption that the disease is not a killer for their age group.  The counter-narrative is that Covid is a significant disease for certain population groups only and, therefore, it is asked why all people in the country have to take the medicine that only some require and why their lives should be so disrupted with further national lockdown initiatives.</p>  <p>  The job of new emergency legislation should first be to set out clearly the medical and clinical case for Covid restrictions, that is, that rampant disease will affect every member of the population through either social, medical or economic deprivation.  The message that we are all in this together should be changed because is not correct in the minds of many.  We need to bring people with us in national health protection, and we should be communicating that we are clearly not all in the medical emergency together but that, economically and socially, we can exit this pandemic together successfully only by sticking together, working together and working in sacrifice and for one another and for the good of all.</p>  <p>  Regarding the increasing rate of Covid transmission, significant actions as part of the State's response are somewhat responsible for the ascending rate of disease spread.  Members of the Regional Group raised the issue of masks in this House many months ago.  NPHET did not endorse their use for months afterwards.  I raised the issue of antigen testing with NPHET over four months ago but, blindly, it would not consider it until last week when it saw the trend regarding the disease vector.  These circumstances must not continue.  We need NPHET to engage with industry and medical leads.  Most of all, we need transparency in the way we are fighting the disease and resourcing our efforts.  We need sufficient tracking and tracing and, most of all, we need political oversight and political responsibility to be borne by all in this House.  When we talk about house parties, all Deputies need to get their own House in order, get on top of things and ensure this lockdown is the last that they impose on the population.</p></speech>

It is obvious that, for some, education and encouragement just will not work and their behaviour will not change until we get real about enforcement.  We have heard the stories about house parties and other scenarios whereby people awaiting test results failed to isolate and caused further outbreaks.  The failure to deal with some of those circumstances under level 3 by way of meaningful fines - fines that would make people stop and think twice before engaging in what is clearly reckless behaviour - has, in part, led us to where we are today.</p>  <p>  We are told we need to socially distance but the provisions in this legislation are about social isolation, not social distancing.  While the legislation before us will give us statutory instruments with the harp on the front of them, the difficulty is that we are giving the Government a blank sheet of paper on which to write whatever it wants.  I will give a practical example.  Today, the website of the Department of Health states that one has to stay within 5 km of one's home but that one can travel beyond 5 km from home if going to visit a grave.  However, in the statutory instrument that has been drafted in respect of this legislation, there is no mention of travelling 5 km beyond one's home.  If exercising, one must remain within 5 km of home.  If someone living in County Roscommon wants to go to the chemist, he or she can go to the chemist in Belmullet and comply with the regulations as currently drafted but there is no mention of graves in the regulation.  If I want to walk 50 yards down the road to visit a grave, I could, under the regulations as currently drafted, be fined &euro;500.  This is the contradiction in the regulations before us.  This is what has frustrated the public.</p>  <p>  We have heard a lot of discussion about house parties.  On 19 March, I tabled an amendment to the emergency legislation specifically to address the issue of house parties.  The then Minister for Health stood in this House on that day and told me he was satisfied there were sufficient powers in the legislation being enacted at the time to cover house parties, public houses and restaurants.  Here we are, seven months later, introducing legislation to deal with this.  There is contradiction after contradiction and confusion after confusion.  That is what is causing absolute frustration and anger among the public.  We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke and bring in the most draconian laws ever introduced in this country, laws that contradict what is in black and white on the Government's website as we speak.  What are we doing?  Can the Government not get its act together and be unambiguous about what it is trying to do?</p></speech>

Basically, the Government is raising the white flag.  It has lost the good will of the people and now it is seeking to coerce them.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 is a serious illness for sure, and we need to do all we can to reduce the numbers.  The truth is, however, that it is not the people who have failed with regard to containing this illness, it is the Government.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Ireland is an outlier in Europe with regard to the severity of the illness at present.  The reason this is the case, and the reason the front-line battle against Covid is being placed on the shoulders of the Irish people through these restrictions, is that the Government could not get it together with regard to ICU capacity.  Last week, we had a budget with &euro;18 billion in extra spending.  We have been speaking about this issue for seven months but we are still at the bottom of the pile in Europe with regard to ICU.</p> <p> The other major battleground in this illness is contact tracing.  At the end of the second quarter, there were 1,700 contact tracers but there are fewer than 500 contact tracers now.  The Government is employing 60 contact tracers a week.  At this rate of recruitment, it will take 20 full weeks just to get back to where we were in the second quarter.  It is a case of "Crisis?  What crisis?"</p> <p> We have heard from Deputy O'Dowd about coercion.  Coercion will be manna from heaven to those who purposely seek to break the guidelines.  I can see the Facebook and Twitter videos already where the newly minted martyrs who just got their fines will be rallying the troops to build their own political movements.  Deputy O'Dowd spoke about the garda&iacute; on Grafton Street yesterday.  They were able to do what they did under existing law.  Those events did not make any argument for this Bill.</p> <p> I want to speak about the fact that several amendments have been tabled.  I have looked at the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment and I cannot support it.  Sinn F&eacute;in spent weeks sitting on the fence over this issue.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald has been like Humpty Dumpty teetering on the fence with regard to whether she will or will not support the restrictions.  Last week, in an interview with Brian Dobson, Deputy McDonald, like Humpty Dumpty, had a great fall.  In fairness, poor old Deputy Cullinane had to come out with a definitive statement over the weekend.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment tries to be all things to all people.  It is a serious effort at legal fence sitting.  For those against the fines, Sinn F&eacute;in can say it voted against the Government's Bill, and for those who support the fines, it simply put the decision off until next week.</p> <p> I reiterate that we need to protect life and health but it will not be done with overly aggressive and damaging restrictions.  These restrictions have not had the debate that is necessary.  For us to understand what restrictions are appropriate in this situation, we must understand the cost of the restrictions.  Their cost will be lives and ill-health.  They will have a radical effect on the mental health of people throughout the country.  The Government has refused point-blank over and over again to carry out the necessary research to identify the impact of the restrictions.  Britain and other countries have done definitive research to understand that tens of thousands of people whose cancers will be missed, at irregular or precancerous cell stage or as cancers, will have delayed diagnoses and treatment and will experience ill-health and possibly mortality in the future.  I raised in the D&aacute;il examples of doctors who have told me their patients have had delayed diagnoses and treatment.  I urge the Government to carry out research on the impact of these restrictions.  Only then will we know what is balanced and appropriate.</p> <p> We need to make sure we reduce the illness.  I believe this can be done with balanced and fair guidelines, supporting people's incomes, allowing the Garda to engage and taking the pressure off people through having proper ICU facilities and a functioning tracking and tracing system.  With regard to the news on the UCD National Virus Reference Laboratory released this morning, it is astounding that the laboratory does not have the necessary staff to be able to test next weekend or the following weekend.  What does this tell us about where the locus of fault is in this crisis?  It is not the fault of the people of Ireland that we are where we are today with Covid.  It is the fault of the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="12:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300018#Q00200"><p>It is important to point out that the vast majority of people want to comply with the guidelines and do the right thing and that they are doing their very best to do so.  Sometimes people make mistakes and step over the line without realising it, often in rural areas where the distance of 5 km is an issue for many people.  It is important that the Government is very clear with people that they are not breaching the guidelines if their nearest shop or where they need to go to get something is 10 km, 12 km or 15 km away.  Patience will be needed with regard to all of this by everybody.  We have to be patient with ourselves also.</p>  <p>  Something that is putting a strain on people's patience is how the Government sets out these particular issues.  Many people are frustrated when they see pictures of the occasional house party somewhere or frustrated with people who clearly go out deliberately to break the guidelines, cause friction in society and put it up to the Government.  They want something done about this.  At the same time, they are very fearful that the types of fines or measures to be put in place will be used against the ordinary person who would inadvertently stretch over the limit.  This is why people are very concerned about giving a blank cheque to the Government to set out these particular fines and put them in place.</p>  <p>  I go some of the way towards the Government's position.  This is not a black and white issue.  We recognise that there is a need at times to have some level of protection to ensure the law is adhered to.  What happened on Grafton Street yesterday is an example of this.  Clearly, powers are available to the Garda to do what needs to be done in the vast majority of situations.  The Garda has stated it has issues with this law and that if very draconian measures are put in place, it will inhibit the ability of garda&iacute; to bring people with them and engage with people in the way they want.  We all recognise this is the case.</p>  <p>  We also have to recognise the small number of people, as has been said earlier, who clearly want to break the guidelines and are up to no good.  They have a different agenda.  Their agenda is not about Covid or civil liberties.  Their agenda is about something else.  It is to try to create a counterculture in this country and throughout the world, one that is against authority and against people.  It is a far-right movement that we see coming into place.  We have to be very much aware of this.  While we need measures to deal with this, introducing these draconian measures is not the way forward.  The Minister should consider the sensible amendments that have been tabled.  They are about capping and reducing the level of fines and removing the possibility of imprisonment because imprisonment is a totally disproportionate response to what people recognise needs to happen.</p>  <p>  I return to the issue of patience.  We all have to be patient with each other.  Society needs to sit back and relax a little and realise that this will pass and that in one or two years' time we will get back to normal.  We can do an assessment then and work out what was done right or wrong.  In the meantime, we need to be very careful about what we do so that we do not lose people.  I am afraid these particular measures will lose the public.  We need to be very conscious that this should not happen.</p></speech>

I have always believed it is a massive danger but that we should also be doing everything in our power to bring people with us and not dictate to people.  There will always be people who will break the law.  We will never be able to rectify that in our political careers.  Certainly, there are elements of danger but we must also take account of the facts.  There have been 12% fewer deaths in the country this year than last year.  I do not know what the figures were last night because I try to tune out and I advise everybody who is trying to do his or her best in the pandemic to tune out to a degree.  We are on media overload and the coronavirus features in every headline and at the end of every political discussion.  I am not sure whether I heard yesterday that there were three deaths.  How many people died of cancer yesterday who were neglected because of the coronavirus?</p> <p>I would like to know the number of people who died by suicide yesterday.  God knows the number of people who have died as a result of ailments other than Covid-19.  Statistics on those deaths are not released every day because if they were we would put fear into people.  There has been a complete focus on Covid-19 and a complete lack of focus on other issues.</p> <p> I do not agree with people being fined or with cracking the whip to keep them in line.  People are asking me if it is all right to travel a few miles extra to go to a shop where they can pick up their goods a little cheaper or whatever.  As politicians, we have to come up with the answers and that is not always easy.  I have been inundated, as I am sure are other politicians, with questions the answer to which are difficult to find.  The Minister might be able to comment on the position of college students in this regard.  Are they allowed travel home?  Some of them have no other choice but to stay in their accommodation near the colleges they attend and then go home at weekends or if they get a week off.  Are they allowed travel home?  Those college students who decided to educate themselves at home are still paying for accommodation.  Unfortunately, it is still very much up in the air as to whether they can have their money refunded.  I would appreciate it if the Minister touched on that matter when replying.</p> <p> I am very critical of the testing and tracing system, which has been lethargic.  It seems to be a case of carry on with it day by day and something might happen down the line.  It is the same old system of driving up, getting tested and waiting for one's results.  I presume that the samples are still being flown to Germany.  There seems to be some type of game going on yet, as I told the Minister yesterday, they were able to do approximately 20 in my office in Bandon last week.  People had to go to Belfast where they got immediate results.  Why can we not do that here?  Why is our testing system so slow?  We cannot do it at the airport.  When the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, was Taoiseach, I asked him if rapid testing would be done at the airports and he said it was too costly.  We now realise that the cost of these tests is &euro;40 or &euro;50.  Many people who fly into this country for a holiday would love to be tested before they come here, and they would pay for it themselves, but no effort is being made to do that.  It is a case of rolling on in the hope that this will rectify itself but it will not do so for quite a long time.</p> <p> We will be telling people to stay in and adhere to the restrictions for the next six weeks.  People are saying that we must do our best but I know what will happen when we open the doors again, so to speak.  We need to ensure that people clearly understand the need for social distancing and to do their best in terms of sanitising their hands.  There should be more focus on that instead of threatening them and terrifying the living daylights out of them because we will have people dying of fright.</p> <p> I raise another problem.  A newly married man in west Cork is trying to get a D visa for his Indonesian wife.  That application has been with the Department since early March.  That Irishman will now have to leave Ireland and go to the UK to try to get a family reunification visa to fly out to his wife in Indonesia.  Is there any way a D visa can be sorted out after all this time?  Surely to God the coronavirus is not the cause of that problem.</p> <p> There is also an issue with public service cards.  A man for Ballydehob applied for a public service card in March and still has not had a response.  He needs that to transfer his English driving licence.  Without it, he will not be able to drive here.  He is the only member of the family who drives.  It should not take any length of time for a person to get a public service card.  We are telling people to work from home, so why are these processes taking so long?</p> <p> The final issue I want to raise is to do with marts.  I respect the fact that the Minister is a busy person but I would like him to listen.  He can play with his phone if he wants to but the farmers of this country have been on their knees for some time.  I sent an urgent letter to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to ensure that he had a clear understanding that people are losing money as a result of the prices paid for their cattle, which is &euro;150 for a bull and &euro;100 for a heifer.  Farmers cannot take that hit.  I plead with the Minister to talk to his colleague.  Marts are open areas and the buyer, at least, should be allowed inside the mart.  I have sent an emergency request to Deputy Cahill, the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, to immediate reconvene the committee over the weekend or early next week to make sure that marts can reopen for business as farmers will not be able to take this hit.  It is causing them mental stress.  They cannot pay their bills.  The only chance they have is to sell their cattle but they are losing money because of Covid-19.  That should not have to happen.  Dan McCarthy, the mart manager in Kenmare, outlined on Facebook what happened at that mart yesterday.  That is happening throughout the country.  The Minister is the Minister for Health.  I ask him to talk to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and at least resolve that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="13:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300019#R00200"><p>I will start my contribution with some breaking news.  The media has a responsibility if they put out a story by way of breaking news but the Government has a responsibility to give the proper information.  I see the Ceann Comhairle was at the front of a breaking news story last week that 400 former Deputies were told, by way of a headline, not to attend the bar and, in small print underneath the headline, the restaurant in the D&aacute;il.  The facts are that the bar has, along with the wet pubs, been closed since the start of the pandemic.  That is the breaking news but it was a headline last week.  If we want the real news to get out it should be done properly.  I am not a drinker but I am telling the truth.</p><p>Before we left the D&aacute;il last night, one Deputy came out and said that there was a problem with the sanitiser used in schools.  It was breaking news.  I did some research this morning and found that there was an issue with one batch of a sanitiser from this company and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine asked for the product to be recalled.  That is a fact, but the direction from the Department forgot to state that this company has 500 products.  The name of a company was tarnished, whether it was right or wrong, but the information had to come out, yet it has 500 products.  If a company like Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson had an issue with a shampoo, does it recall its hand creams and everything else across the board?  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should have come out with proper information about the company and told people exactly what was wrong.  We all know that bad news sells newspapers but at this time of a pandemic people need reassurance.  They need facts.</p><p>During the week, I spoke to the <i>Limerick Leader</i>.  I said that bringing out the Army was the only way we can help this country but the front headline was that a local Deputy had asked for the Army to be deployed.  I did ask for it to be deployed but if people read the article they will see the reason I called for that.  The medical staff in the Army could help the medical services.  The Army could come out and assist garda&iacute; on the roads.  That would release some garda&iacute; from that duty and allow them go back into areas where antisocial behaviour has gone through the roof.  I asked for that to help and protect the people of Ireland and because there is a massive difference between city and county.  We have no infrastructure in the county.  That is where the Government is failing in bringing out laws.  That was mentioned by other Deputies.  One might have to travel 10 km or 15 km to a shop to get groceries but all the facilities including taxis and so on are available within the cities.  I can get nothing like that in the county.  If the Government is bringing out laws it should think of the people in the county who have no infrastructure.  Previous speakers mentioned rural Ireland.  I have mentioned it many times.  As I said, since this Government was formed and since the start of the pandemic people now realise what is rural Ireland; it is when one lives outside a major city anywhere in the country.  When the Government is making laws it needs to ensure that they are for everyone.  If it needs to bring out a law for eight cities, bring it out and if it needs to bring out one for the counties, bring that out and make sure it is implemented.</p><p>I wish the Minister well in his role but &euro;3.8 billion will not fix the HSE, which was broken long before the outbreak of the pandemic.  My first speech in this D&aacute;il was to say that it should run the hospitals like a hotel system and have a management system in place.  Let the healthcare workers, who are doing a fantastic job, do their job.  We should have a set-up where beds are released at a certain time and if the patient is not well enough, they hold that bed.  The consultants come around before 11 a.m. to meet the patients.  We need to make sure that we have a regulated system in place so that when a nurse or a doctor looks at it they can see that there are two beds free in, say, ward 2B or five free in ward 1A.</p> <p>The problem with our hospital system is the management of some of the hospitals and there has been a failure to address that for years.  We need a structure where the beds coming in and out are run like a hotel system.  If a hotel said a guest could check out at 7 p.m., it would not have a room the following morning.  The same system needs to be put in place in hospitals.  If people are not well enough to leave, they should stay where they are but they should see a consultant in the morning at a certain time.  When there was a public private partnership in place, consultants were getting more than their allocation of beds.  Some people were getting treatments and the public were on waiting lists.  That was because management was not strong enough to tackle the consultants and make things work.  The &euro;3.8 billion will not fix this health system.  The problem is management, structure and accountability.</p> <p> I approached the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, about a case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and he told me he would ask the HSE to liaise directly with the family in question and respond to their case.  That was on 21 May.  It never responded.  He said he would ask the multidisciplinary team to look at the case but the family has never been contacted.  I brought this matter up again in two parliamentary questions and on 14 October I brought it up with the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler.  The system is broken.  Throwing money at it will not fix it.  Accountability to the management is what will fix our HSE. </p></speech>

We have an excellent community division in Tipperary.  It was stood down but is back up running now.  I support Sergeant Ray Moloney, Superintendent Denis Whelan and all the inspectors in Cahir and thank them for the work they have done.  They have re-engaged since yesterday morning to go out to visit elderly and vulnerable people.  I support them 100% and will not let anyone construe from my contribution anything different.</p>  <p>  The testing and tracing system is a shambles.  If we wanted confirmation of that, we had it a while ago.</p>  <p>  I agree totally with Deputy O'Donoghue about breaking news.  The media should be curtailed because they have people frightened for their lives.  There is breaking news morning, noon, night, midnight, an hour after and again at 5 a.m.  They have our hearts broken with it.  T&aacute; na daoine amuigh sa t&iacute;r briste.  They are frightened, scared, worried and confused.</p>  <p>  The Minister told me yesterday that my contribution was not worthy of him speaking to it.  Since he came into office, he has been an utter failure.  I thought the previous Minister was bad and that the situation could not get any worse but the two of them come from the same village in the leafy suburbs of Wicklow, up in Greystones where one could pay &euro;3 million for a house.  They do not have a clue what is going on.  The Minister is presiding over this shambolic health system.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the &euro;3.8 billion for the HSE.  Since I came into the D&aacute;il in 2007, every year we have incrementally given &euro;1 billion extra to the HSE and we have got less and less for it and worse and worse outcomes.  It is a disastrous and incapable system.  People need hope.  I could go into lists of people who are waiting and talk about PCR tests and so on.  The Minister will not engage with any of the scientists and specialists who know much more than I do or will ever learn.  He says they are all conspiracy theorists and are all wrong.  He is just steaming ahead with the PCR tests which cost &euro;195 each.  Some people are making an outrageous amount of money off that but money does not matter in the HSE.  It pumped &euro;2.1 million into a closed psychiatric hospital in Clonmel where we badly need mental health beds but do not have any.  There has not been a word about accountability for it.  For the Covid crisis, money is like confetti.  It is like the fertiliser spreaders helicopters use in forests, which just throw it down.</p>  <p>  The Government thinks money is like manna from heaven but most members of the Government do not believe in heaven and will not allow people to go to mass.  I thank Deputy McNamara for bringing this issue up.  When he did so, the Minister retorted that people could go to mass and that priests were not being punished, but priests will be punished under the legislation unless they say the mass online.  The churches are d&uacute;nta.  It is a sad country where Mary, Johnny, Tom or Biddy cannot go in and say a prayer.  I cannot go to mass and people on their death beds in hospitals cannot get the last rites.  It is shocking.  The Minister had the audacity to challenge Deputy McNamara but the Deputy was quick enough to get the regulations and quote the exact sections to the Minister because he has a legal brain.  Fair dues to him.  I compliment him on his work.</p>  <p>  The marts are closed.  People have it so bad at this time of year.  The Ceann Comhairle will understand as he is a farmer and brings a few cattle to the mart occasionally.  People have to sell their cattle at this time of year to pay their bills.  Some people do not have the technology to do it online in the first place and that technology is a disaster in most places in rural Ireland anyway.  Many sites collapse when the marts cannot work.  The Minister must deal with that as well.</p>  <p>  This morning, Deputy Kelly said this Bill was simply crazy, appalling and downright disgraceful.  Why, then, is he voting for this legislation?  I cannot understand that.  We are expected to come in to the D&aacute;il to scrutinise legislation but we have had no scrutiny.  We got 48 hours' notice of this Bill and Deputies are condemning it but also voting for it.  What is wrong with these people?  We are voting again today to give the Minister the power to dream up whatever statutory instruments he wants in his leafy suburb and comfortable bed out in Greystones, with the sea water going around in the air like a vapour giving him clean thinking.  Yesterday, he brought up 25 reasons in these regulations that allow people to leave their houses.  He says we should lock people up and that they are breaking the law if they leave their houses.  He is also saying he can bring in any statutory instrument he likes without any recourse to this House and without any scrutiny, debate or vote.  We are wasting our time here.  We should stay at home and save the taxpayers the cost of being here because we have no say in this Government.  It is imposing a tyranny on the people.  I cannot believe the Opposition parties, which I respect individually, are buying this pig in a poke blindfolded.  They are giving out about it with their cronies and so on but they are going to vote for it.  I am certainly not going to put my name to any vote to terrorise and put a tyrannical rule on our people, young and old, from the cradle to the grave.</p>  <p>  I condemn the people who were misbehaving on Grafton Street yesterday.  I support the Garda but we saw that it has the necessary powers already so we do not need to be here debating this.  The Minister must respect the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, and Sergeant Antoinette Cunningham, who has said she is concerned about these powers.  There are more rules and regulations now and garda&iacute; are on 12-hour rosters.  I thank them for working so hard.  They have to give the whole day to reading the regulations and are trying to clock out when they are finished.  It is a cop, a con and a codology job.</p>  <p>  The Departments are so secure in their ways and claim they know it all.  They say not to mind Deputies Mattie McGrath, Fitzmaurice, McNamara, Pringle or any of us.  Deputy Connolly said yesterday that the Government thinks it knows best and knows it all.  It cannot bring the people with it that way.  As I said yesterday, Dan Breen, Se&aacute;n Treacy, Se&aacute;n Hogan and many more ended the tyranny in the Twenty-six Counties in Ireland.  My late father spent 14 months in prison as well as being out in that war with that great patriot Liam &Oacute; Loingsigh.  Those people gave their lives and now the Government wants to take life from people.</p>  <p>  There has not been a word about the suicide deaths, cancer deaths, the scandal of the cervical cancer smear tests or the many other scandals that are brewing in the hospital system because of the inept, inadequate, ham-fisted and draconian HSE that is not fit for purpose.  Two former taoisigh, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, told me they were going to disband the HSE.  I doubt if Mickey Martin - the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin - will disband it because he is good at setting up quangos and it is the biggest, most dangerous, most irresponsible and tyrannical quango in this country or any part of the world.</p>  <p>  The only three countries in which people cannot go to mass or church are North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and mother Ireland.  Mother Ireland is dead and gone, it is with O'Leary in the grave.  God help us. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="13:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300020#S00300"><p>I will do my best to be focused in my ten minutes.  Two of the Minister's statements do not fill me with trust.  I will come back to the factual situation, particularly regarding the Policing Authority and its eight reports to date.  As the Minister knows, a situation has arisen in a nursing home in Ahascragh in east Galway, just outside my constituency, though the word "situation" does not quite capture it.</p> <p>I will not dwell on it.  The Minister's comments on that yesterday were worrying.  He accused a Deputy of scaremongering, spreading fear and being inaccurate.  I have a number of reports from the press and local radio before me.  There might not be exact figures, with 22 or 24 testing positive, but what is not in doubt is the nurse on the radio, crying.  She said that she was not given to emotion, pointing out that they felt abandoned by the HSE.  The Minister responded to what was raised yesterday by saying that it was spreading fear and anxiety.  That does not fill me with confidence.</p> <p> In his opening speech about the extension of the sunset clause, he said these laws are necessary for now and their main aim is to protect people and their lives.  Proportionality is not a spirit; it is an obligation.  Laws must be proportionate, fair and focused.  The Minister said, "In the spirit of proportionality, I recognise that the extension of these extraordinary measures must be temporary and I will repeal them as soon as it is safe to do so."  Perhaps that is inadvertent on his part but for me, that captures what has happened with this D&aacute;il.  He will make the decision when he sees fit, not this D&aacute;il, the seat of democracy.  I ask him to reflect on that type of language.</p> <p> We are rushing legislation through the D&aacute;il.  I was one of the Deputies who unanimously agreed to the draconian powers.  I used that word at the time and I will reuse it.  We passed draconian powers because, at the time, the virus was new and life-threatening.  It remains life-threatening.  I will not diminish the virus.  We passed draconian powers and I had serious reluctance to do that, but did so after careful consideration, on the basis that the Government would be frank, honest and open with us, and keep us informed, and that we would have full discussion in the D&aacute;il.  I have reflected on that decision many times since and part of me seriously regrets it.  I did it as well as I could according to my conscience at the time.  I kept up my side of the bargain as a parliamentarian, while the Government has utterly failed.</p> <p> The Government has a narrative of us all being in it together.  The difference between this Government and its predecessor is the previous Government spun this much better.  People wanted to believe that spin and I could see why.  We were never all in this together.  Nursing homes were never in it together and they are still not in it together as we see from Ahascragh.  People aged over 66 were never in it together.  In the final quarter of last year, 65,000 people over 66 earned their livelihood and they have been excluded from every single Government scheme, with no justification, proportionality or underlying rationale other than that the Government does not care.  Meat plants were never in this with us because they were ignored.  Direct provision was certainly not in it.  The message contained the appalling word "cocooning" for 70 year olds.  I am glad that it has been dropped.  The language was undermining, ordering them to stay in, with no basis for it.  We were never in it together.  However, the vast majority of people, including the vast majority of Members, all worked together for the common good.  We worked together in an imperfect world to try to protect the most vulnerable.  We did not do it very well.</p> <p> We fought to put in a sunset clause.  Imagine that legislation was brought before us with no sunset clause.  It was to go on forever, which is worrying, given the Minister's comments that when he sees fit, he will amend it.  The sunset clause has been renewed by majority vote with regard to the mental health provisions.  We are here today with legislation to give more power to the police force.</p> <p> Let me look at the confused message before I go to the substance of the Policing Authority's report.  We allow horticulture but we close allotments.  We talk endlessly about mental health but we close public swimming pools, which are easily able to comply with regulations.  We close allotments out in the air, where all the allotments are separated.  We give confused messages to therapists who are carrying out acupuncture or reflexology.  They have no idea whether they are allowed to work.  I do not wish to describe myself as an atheist or agnostic because it is not relevant, but I am not the loudest supporter of the church.  It is wrong to close churches.  They function as a protected asylum, in the best sense of the word "asylum" for people to go into.  I have used them myself on occasion to go into to reflect, calm down and use the space, which is sacred in the nicest sense of the word, yet we give out totally confused messages.  Nursing homes have been deprived of visitors.  I know somebody who was visiting his wife who had dementia prematurely and after a two-week break, because there was an outbreak of Covid, that person did not recognise her husband.  That is copper-fastened, with no more visits.  It is not clear whether somebody can stand outside a window and talk through the window.  That seems to be disallowed.  I had a personal contact about that.  There is utter confusion.  Our attention was deflected to a Bill that was not necessary, in the urgent manner that it was put through yesterday by a majority vote and the power of the tyranny relating to mother and baby homes, when our attention should have been in here, holding the system to account and asking the Minister not to talk about "I" but how he will have accountability in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> With regard to the Policing Authority reports, at the risk of being called a misreport after all the reports about the commission of inquiry, it has done us all a great favour.  Let me pay tribute to the garda&iacute;, as the Policing Authority has.  Like my colleagues, I have called for more garda&iacute;.  They have stood up to the challenge of Covid, notwithstanding the Morris tribunal, the Charleton tribunal, the McCabe matter and the O'Higgins report.  They have learned and they are still learning, which is welcome.  We set up the Policing Authority to have oversight of what garda&iacute; are doing in Covid.  It published eight reports.  In those eight reports, it praises the garda&iacute; but highlights its concerns.  In the latest report, it points out, "Throughout this period, the Authority has held the view that emergency powers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be at the minimum level possible."  The Garda Commissioner has reaffirmed his view that added powers are not required.  This report is dated 9 October.  It is not inappropriate to sound a note of caution.  There is a genuine and well-founded concern that extensive new powers for the garda&iacute; and their widespread use might not act as a panacea.</p> <p> I have repeatedly pointed out that there is no need for more powers.  What is needed is more garda&iacute;, better training and for the management of the Garda to outline in detail how it has used existing powers.  The Policing Authority has repeatedly expressed its concern that there is no disaggregation of how many times the Garda has used its powers to give direction or to ask a person for his or her name.  It is not the garda&iacute; that have failed; their management has failed to give that breakdown of information that should be before us so that we can make a rational decision about whether they need more power.  We have regulations to come with regulations to come, and regulations from yesterday.  Like two peas in a pod, two households can suddenly come together.  It is insulting that we are now using a punitive approach and punitive language, not based on what the garda&iacute; are asking for or what the Policing Authority is asking for, but a threadbare figleaf to hide the failure of this Government and the previous Government to protect our people, maintain solidarity and show leadership.  Leadership is not shown by undermining NPHET in the way that the T&aacute;naiste did.  Of course, NPHET needs to hear constructive criticism and it needs proper representation.</p></speech>

I did not mention any name of a place and I will stand over every bit of information that I stated on Leaders' Questions yesterday.  I ask the Minister to clarify that I was not the Deputy he was referring to about scaremongering.  I would like that to be clarified because I will stand over everything that I said.</p>  <p>  I go to the marts, and yesterday cattle came back &euro;150.</p> <p>While farmers were safely socially distancing, and everybody agrees with that, they were stopped because of this new online system.  On the evening before, the broadband blew up in 12 marts, so they had no broadband.  We are now left in a situation that at the time of year most weanlings are sold, there are no markets for them.  There was an exporter in Kilkenny mart yesterday.  He left the mart because he was not allowed to look at the cattle.  These are the problems around the country.</p> <p> I have been very blunt in outlining how we solve things.  The off-licences should be closed and the pubs should be opened from 10 p.m.  A garda can walk into a pub because there is legislation for that.</p></speech>

We are just being trampled on with the decisions that are being made.  I watched the Minister while the previous speaker was talking.  He never got off his telephone.  In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is watching the debate.</p>  <p>  The other issue is the churches.  Some 25 people can go to a wedding and 25 can go to a funeral.  Some people really wish to go to mass and if 25 people are safe at a funeral, they are equally safe at mass.  I will finish with a matter that parents have brought to my attention, as I wish to give my colleagues time.  Young children are in school classes at present in which a third of the class has received first communion.  The children have been psyched up about it, but they are growing out of their clothes.  This is the third time first communion has been cancelled for them.  If we could take them in tens over the next three weeks or a month in a safe way, not an unsafe way, we must ensure that is facilitated.</p>  <p>  I do not believe the Garda want the powers, as Deputy Connolly said.  Private property is private property and if somebody tells a garda that he or she does not want the garda on the property, what can the garda do about it?  In fairness, the representative, Ms Cunningham, was very clear about it.  It is to support the Garda needs, not mad laws being introduced on the rebound.</p></speech>

We are more than seven months into this pandemic and experiencing the expected second wave.  In March, we felt we were all in this together and communities pulled together.  Then the great coalition was formed and things started to fall apart.  The scandals, the Fianna F&aacute;il-ness of one's behaviour, golf-gate, Mr. Phil Hogan&rsquo;s whistle-stop tour around Ireland instead of quarantining, the rotating agriculture Ministers, not to mind rotating taoisigh, grated on the public&rsquo;s patience and nerves, and rightly so.  In fairness, it is easy to close everything, but it is hard to reopen everything.  The Minister took office at the point when everything was starting to reopen.  Recently, however, he has been blaming the public for the resurgence of Covid and, while people definitely must take personal responsibility, he must take responsibility too.  With the mixed messages, the bad communications and the consistent undermining of each other by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the Government's behaviour has shown the public that we are certainly not all in this together.</p><p>This Bill provides for the enforcement of regulations under section 31A of the Health Act 1947.  It relates to ministerial power and the option to make regulations under section 31A.  It will also extend the previous sunset clause from 9 November 2020 to June 2021.  It will mean fines for those contravening public health measures and will provide additional Garda powers that are supposedly needed.  As my colleagues have outlined, there is some doubt about that.  I have submitted an amendment for Committee and Report Stages and will speak to my reasons for that amendment at that time.  However, I still do not believe this Bill is necessary.</p><p>What data are being collected on the locations being policed?  What is the socio-economic status of those being stopped and questioned by garda&iacute;?  The public has been rightly sceptical about the Government&rsquo;s focus on house parties and personal responsibility, while ignoring the grave problems in meat processing plants and direct provision centres.  It is a Trump-like tactic to deflect stories when they arise.  It is also noted that certain legislation can be rushed through the Houses, but not when it relates to workers&rsquo; rights such as a statutory entitlement to sick pay.  I believe that would do a great deal more to stop the spread of Covid than any of the regulations being introduced now.  People are being told to work from home, but what if they cannot?  Many people in our cities and urban centres are living in substandard, overcrowded accommodation.  How will the Garda differentiate between house parties and a large number of tenants merely sharing a house because of unaffordable rents and discrimination in the rental market?</p><p>Mr. Liam Herrick, the executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, said that it &quot;highlighted many areas where this legislation needed to be improved from a human rights perspective&rdquo; back in March.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	... those improvements weren&rsquo;t made, that debate hasn&rsquo;t happened, and there has been no review of the law to ensure it is fit for purpose. All of these things must happen before the legislation is renewed. </blockquote>  <p>For that reason, I will vote against the Bill.  The Garda has sufficient powers and can already achieve what we want it to do.</p></speech>

The Bill is a fig leaf.  It tries to give responsibility to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do the work the health service failed to do.  Whether it failed to do that because it was mismanaged or was inadequately resourced is not pertinent.  Either way, the responsibility for that rests firmly with the Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, as was the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  We were repeatedly told that testing and tracing was the key element in the armoury of the State for dealing with this.</p>  <p>  We have tested repeatedly.  We have used a PCR testing system which we know, and this is not a conspiracy theory from the Internet but was confirmed at the Covid committee and by Dr. Cillian De Gascun on Twitter, will include in those who test positive those who are no longer infectious.  We then have to contact trace all the people who are not infectious and test them and a proportion, at least, of their close contacts, who will no longer be infectious.  We are creating this significant requirement to trace.  It may well be that PCR testing is, unfortunately, the best type of testing available, but it has its limitations.  Whether it is because of PCR testing or otherwise, our tracing system has fallen apart.  I have been flagging this for some time at the Covid committee.  I have received telephone calls from concerned parents in Lissycasey stating that nobody was being contact traced, notwithstanding an outbreak there.  Now, we are told that the whole system fell apart last weekend.</p>  <p>  As it is all falling apart in the realm of health, we will now make the garda&iacute; do the job.  We are told there is not enough capacity in the health system.  What is the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Is it infinite?  Are we going to recruit garda&iacute; tomorrow morning?  Many doctors and nurses have come home from other countries.  They have been treated shamefully.  They have not been employed, but at least they are trained.  I am not aware of a rush home by Irish police officers in the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand who might be available to be recruited as garda&iacute;.  They do not exist.  There is fincapacity in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that capacity must be used to do the job garda&iacute; were trained to do, which is not to police public health.  Policing public health does not work.  It has not worked anywhere in the world and it is not going to work now.</p>  <p>  I wish to return to a technical point, which is my concern about the potential constitutional frailty of this.  The Bill states: "&lsquo;dwelling event provision&rsquo; shall be construed in accordance with subsection (6D) of section 31A;".  When one looks at that, one sees that subsection (6D) does not define what dwelling event provision is.  If a dwelling event is defined in this Bill, I would like to know where.  Subsection (6D) refers to "When prescribing a penal provision to be a dwelling event provision...".  We have not had time to examine this in the detail I would have liked.  The Government does not like to give us time to examine things because when one does so, one sees that they do not add up.  If we are going to penalise dwelling event provision without defining what dwelling event provision is in primary legislation, and we are going to delegate its definition to the Minister, there is a fundamental problem.  Under the Constitution, the dwelling is inviolable and can only be entered save in accordance with law.</p></speech>

I wish to briefly outline what that meant for me and my family.  My wife is a secondary schoolteacher and last Thursday she was notified by the Covid app that she was a close contact of someone who had tested positive.  The same day, her school notified her that a positive case in the school had been confirmed but after risk assessing the situation, she was not deemed to be a close contact.  She was informed by the app that she would receive a telephone call within 24 hours from the HSE to indicate whether she was affected and if the close contact was correct or if it was the same case as the case in the school.  Eight days later, she has still not received a phone call.  My wife had to self-isolate due to the restrictions set out in the notification from the app.  By Monday, she still had not been notified by the HSE.  On the advice of the Covid officer in Leinster House, I took the decision not to travel up to Dublin but to err on the side of caution.</p>  <p>  On Monday, I contacted the HSE and I was told that I would get a call back.  On Tuesday, when I had still not heard anything I contacted the Minister's office and was told there was nothing he could do.  My wife contacted her GP on Tuesday to arrange a test the following day and yesterday afternoon she got back the results indicating that she was negative.  Under the close contact guidelines, she still had to quarantine for the full 14 days, but I could travel to Dublin.  I immediately came up here yesterday evening.  My wife feels that she has let her students and her school down but she has not.  It is the Minister and the tracking and tracing system operated by the HSE that have let her students and her school down.  They have also let the constituents of Cork North-Central down because I missed major debates, discussions and votes this week as I could not get an answer to a simple question that should have been answered within 24 hours.  This was a disaster for me and my constituents, the people I represent.  Eight days later, my wife, who had a negative test, is still at home self-isolating.  How can that be acceptable?  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for a proper system all summer.  Deputies Mary Lou McDonald and David Cullinane have been outlining the problems with tracking and tracing and how we have to get it right because it is vital to tackling the Covid crisis.  This is just not good enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300023#V00700"><p>I thank my colleagues for a very detailed, useful and passionate debate.  There are a lot of different views in this House, as there should be and needs to be.  I have listened attentively and I have taken many pages of notes.  Most of the Deputies who made points are not here but I will address the matters raised by those who are present.</p>  <p>  Questions were raised repeatedly about golf.  There is obviously a big golfing fraternity in the D&aacute;il.  Questions were also asked about third level students.  There are 180,000 registered golfers and approximately 250,000 registered third level students in Ireland.  If colleagues are suggesting that exemptions should be made for in excess of 400,000 people, assuming not too many third level students are registered golfers, I hope we would all agree that would pose a very serious risk to the great work and sacrifice everybody is making this week and for the next five and a half or six weeks to suppress the virus.  The public health advice would strongly recommend against allowing 180,000 people to travel around the country to golf courses.  We have, therefore, regulated against upwards of 250,000 students moving around.  Obviously, it would only be some portion of those who would be travelling back and forth and they can still do so for essential family reasons.</p>  <p>  I do not say this lightly.  I do not like this situation, these laws or these powers.  I was in opposition when the original emergency Bill was introduced.  I was one of the Deputies, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who sought a sunset clause.  I think I spoke directly after the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I used the same word that she used in referring to the powers as "draconian".  I agree with that description.  This does not sit easily with me.  I would much prefer that we were not here last night seeking extensions.</p>  <p>  Deputies Boyd Barrett, Barry and their colleagues argued against the penalties and enforcement.  While I accept that is a reasonable and important debate for us to have, what I would say to the Deputies is that the Bill before us reduces those penalties.  Let us take face coverings.  I think Deputy Barry strongly supported the use of face coverings.  Right now, the only option available for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a prosecutable offence, that is, to bring a person to court where a judge can impose on that person a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment of up to six months.  That is not appropriate and I do not believe anyone in this House or country believes that is appropriate.  What the Bill before us is doing is reducing that penalty and saying that is simply not appropriate.  What is appropriate is an on-the-spot fine to be determined through regulation.  Let us say &euro;50 or whatever it may be.</p>  <p>  For the offences where a person ends up in court, again, the Bill aims to reduce those penalties and create three tiers for a first, second and third offence.  We need to bear in mind that this Bill is not about whether we should have enforcement powers.  The Bill is saying that the enforcement powers we have are too strong and we need to create much more proportionate enforcement powers.  That is what we are being asked here and that is the issue on which I am asking my colleagues to support the Government.  This Bill is not about whether these powers exist; it is about saying the current enforcement powers are inappropriately high, so let us bring them down to an appropriate level.  My belief is that they could be used at a more appropriate level, whereas at the moment they are far too cumbersome to use.</p>  <p>  I do not know if Deputy Fitzmaurice is present, but he asked for clarification on whether I was alluding to him yesterday.  I was not.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle also referred to my comments.  My comments specifically related to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, who stated on the record, as a matter of fact, that no help was being provided by the HSE.  That is factually untrue and grossly unfair on front-line clinicians and managers, many of whom have not had a day off since March and do not get to see their children because they are working such long hours.  They are doing everything they can to support nursing homes.  As Minister for Health, I simply do not believe I can let false statements like that stand in our national Parliament.  I assure the House that throughout yesterday the HSE was engaged at length and in detail with what is a private nursing home.  This is a private business.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The first responsibility lies with the nursing homes.  The HSE is conducting serial testing and providing specialist care, access to geriatricians and numerous supports in this case that I will not go into because it is an individual example.  It has also provided staff.  More can be done and always must be, but that is why I do not take anything away from the nurse in Galway who was crying on the radio, to whom the Leas-Cheann Comhairle referred.  I cannot begin to imagine how horrific it is for anyone working in a nursing home where almost all the patients and staff contract Covid over a two or three-day period.  That must be horrific.  We have to support that nurse and everybody else working in nursing homes with mental health and counselling supports.  We are wrapping significant funding, and other supports such as personal protective equipment and training in infection prevention and control, around these nursing homes.  That is what we are endeavouring to do all the time and it is why those statements were made.</p> <p> I thank the Labour Party and Deputy Howlin, who is present in the Chamber.  I very much acknowledge the role taken by the party and accept the Deputy's challenges on the democratic front.  Nevertheless, when he was a member of the Cabinet and I was in opposition, I do not recall any amendment of mine being accepted by the then Minister, although I certainly tabled many of them.  While I may stand corrected, I do not recall ever during that period, which was another time of crisis, any statutory instrument being brought to the House for debate.  I am very open to being corrected on that but that is my memory.  I would, however, have made exactly the same points that Deputy Howlin made, were the tables turned.  I accept and acknowledge that and the very responsible role the Labour Party has played.</p> <p> Deputy Cullinane, too, is present in the Chamber.  I accept the very good faith in which he and his party have engaged on this legislation and in which their amendments have been tabled, which we will discuss presently.  One point, however, which I direct not at the Deputy but rather at Sinn F&eacute;in, is that it needs to stop speaking out of both sides of its mouth on this issue.  Its party leader says the party supports the framework and, publicly, that she did not believe that it was appropriate to go to level 5 at the time that it was initially recommended, and nor did the Government.  She stated she supports the move to go to level 5, yet several Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have undermined that in the Chamber.  I do not believe that is reasonable.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in needs to decide as an organisation whether it supports the recommendations from NPHET.  One Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy described the framework as "dead in the water".  That is a pretty serious statement for a lead Opposition health spokesperson to make.  The framework was launched and supported by the Oireachtas.  The country was at level 2, various counties then moved to levels 3 and 4, and the country has now moved to level 5.  The measures now in place are the level 5 measures not as dictated by the Government but as advised and designed by NPHET.  That is what we have implemented.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is, of course, free to decide that it disagrees with NPHET, with the public health advice or with the country or individual counties moving to any level.  That is an ongoing debate we should have.  The party should, however, state whether it backs a public health-led approach, which is the approach we are taking, and what it means when it says the framework is dead in the water.  Nobody else believes it is dead in the water.  I fully acknowledge there is a constructive relationship in other ways, but the party needs to get off the fence and tell the people whether it supports a public health-led approach.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy after Deputy has stated during the debate that the testing and tracing system has collapsed.  That is absolutely untrue.  Something happened over the weekend that should not have happened.  There is no question about that and nobody is defending it, but it was an operational decision made by the HSE, which was dealing with an exponentially increasing number of positive cases.  It scaled up the number of contact tracing calls by 400% in six weeks, not an easy thing to do.</p> <p> I wish, as do all Deputies, that it had twice as many people for contact tracing.  Nevertheless, in mid-September, it had 231 staff, while in four weeks' time, it will have 800 staff.  It has assured me it can deal with 1,500 positive cases a day and carry out full contact tracing in respect of them.  Intensive contact tracing is ongoing in all schools, which is one of the reasons the positivity rate in schools, in both primary and secondary, is approximately 2%, versus more than 7% in the community.  If Sinn F&eacute;in honestly believes that the testing and tracing system has collapsed, fair enough, that is fair game.  I strongly reject that, however.  In the past seven days, the HSE has tested 117,000 people.  It gives us one of the highest testing regimes anywhere in the world and it is all PCR testing, which is the gold standard.</p> <p> The HSE is not getting everything right and it did not get everything right in respect of contact tracing.  I am not defending that but it is doing everything it can.  It built up a system from zero in the middle of a global pandemic.  It has given us one of the highest testing rates in the world.  I think we are in the top ten when microstates are excluded.  Testing and tracing needs to be better and it is getting better.  Not everything the HSE is doing is perfect, but its staff are coming into work every day and working very hard, as they have been doing for months.  They are doing well, certainly by international standards.  Currently, if someone wants to get a test in France or the UK, he or she cannot just phone a GP and get a same-day or next-day test.  That does not exist anymore.  In my view, we have to stop this pile-on anytime the HSE makes a mistake.  It will make mistakes, as will I and the Government.  We are dealing with a national pandemic; this is not business as usual.  That is my view, although I fully respect colleagues' right to say whatever they want.  I wanted to say a few words in defence of the people who are doing their damndest to run a testing and tracing system.</p> <p> I again thank Deputies.  It has been a useful and productive debate.  As per my offer yesterday, I am more than happy to sit down with Deputies later to discuss any issues I have not covered.  Many Deputies have made reasonable points about the regulations.  They are extraordinary powers and they do not sit easily with me at all.  They did not sit easily with me when the emergency legislation was passed and they still do not.  I invite all Deputies, if they have views on the regulations, the measures, the levels of penalties or the best way in which we can fight the virus, to contact me directly.  I would love to hear from anyone who has ideas.</p></speech>

I just want to point out the sort of preposterousness of this and the misguided focus that it implies.  This lies at the centre of how misguided this entire legislation is, namely, trying to suggest that the primary responsibility for rising infection rates and the necessity to resort to another lockdown lies with events in people's homes.  It is a narrative I have heard repeated endlessly with, for example, the commentary that it is in households that we are seeing the majority of cases and so on.</p>  <p>  This is done while failing to point out the very obvious, namely, that we had pretty much or close to eliminated community transmission as a result of the actions of millions of households.  This was overwhelmingly done voluntarily the last time around because people understood the need to act quickly to deal with the virus.  Despite the fact that the people had done their part and largely eliminated community transmission, it came back.  Where did it came back from?  It was not from people's houses at that point but the places that the Government refused to act against.  These are the places, which the Bill does not focus on in any serious way, such as the meat processing plans, the direct provision centres and so on.</p>  <p>  Most crucially of all, however, it came back due to the policy decision of the Government essentially to say there is an acceptable level of community transmission which we can manage.  It is now absolutely clear the Government cannot manage it meaning the virus has now run out of control and, not surprisingly, it is back in people's homes.  The implication that it started in people's homes is simply not true and not evidence-based.  It is worth pointing out the simple fact that everybody lives in a home.  That tells us absolutely nothing about the virus.  How did it get into the home?  Did it come through the walls?  No, it did not come through the walls.  It came from a policy decision made by the Government that it is possible to live beside the virus.</p>  <p>  It is now clearly apparent we cannot live beside this virus.  This virus does not respect level 2, level 3 or level 4.  It has its own logic and dynamic.  Either we chase it down or it chases us.  That is precisely what has happened.  To blame the people or events in people's homes is an attempt to deflect from the Government's own political responsibility.  The Government should be big enough to own up to that responsibility rather than trying to redirect that against the family home and then give enforcement powers to the police as a way of scapegoating.  There is no other way to put it.  It is scapegoating individuals and families for doing normal, human, family things rather than blaming the Government for having a failed strategy, for failing to resource our public health services, as well as the public health response to the degree necessary to control outbreaks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300026#Z00200"><p>I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on this.  The whole tenet of this legislation appears to be just to place the blame on householders and that householders are responsible for everything that is happening with Covid.  One would imagine that Covid was lurking somewhere in the utility room or in the kitchen waiting to get out and that the only way to get out was through the householders.  We know that is not the case.</p>  <p>  We actually almost had it beaten in and around June and July but the Government lost the run of itself.  It started listening to calls to open up business and everything else.  That is what caused the virus to spurt back and led us to where we are now.  The argument now is to try and turn it around with householders and individuals to blame for this crisis and this response.  It clearly is not the case.</p>  <p>  The biggest action the Government could take to defeat this virus would be to introduce universal sick pay.  This virus is prevalent among the low paid, badly paid and neglected workforces.  It is prevalent among low-paid retail workers and foreign workers in meat factories, for example.  Universal sick pay would do far more than restricting people's households.  The legislation gives the Garda powers to go into households when it does not need them.  The Garda has said it does not want this power.  The Garda Inspectorate also said it does not need or want this power.  What is the reason for this then?  It must be to deflect away from the actual cause of the problem.  That is what we should be discussing and finding out about here.</p></speech>

Either he believes in it or he does not.  If it is the mandarins in the Department who are looking for it, he should tell them he does not believe it.</p>  <p>  I, along with Deputy Michael Collins and others, asked the Minister earlier about the marts, people's mental health, as well as their financial ruin, and the churches.  When he was replying, he said he would only reply to Members in the Chamber.  I never left the Chamber but he did not address any of the questions I raised.</p></speech>

We are also delegating the punishment for contravention of the rules on dwelling events.  I question that approach.  It is not unusual to delegate powers to a Minister, but it is unusual to delegate powers that define a criminal offence.  I am not aware of that ever happening although I am open to correction on that point.  At the very least it is very unusual not to define a criminal offence in primary legislation, particularly when the offence takes place in a dwelling.  Dwellings enjoy a constitutional protection, although not an absolute one by any means.  That is one of my many problems with this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300027#AA00200"><p>Deputies Boyd Barrett and Pringle raised the point about dwelling events.  Their argument, if I understood it correctly, is that taking measures that prevent certain things happening in houses means we are therefore somehow blaming, scapegoating and attacking people who live in houses.  If that is the Deputies' view, that is fine, but it would have to be applied to every measure.  As Deputy McGrath has said, the regulations apply to religious events.  By the way, the churches are not closed.  Anyone can go into a church.  The Deputies' logic would also suggest that anything referred to in the regulations, including sporting events and travel, is somehow being blamed.  That is not what we are doing.  The approach from day one, as laid out in section 2 of the Bill, has been to suppress the virus through measures that are as targeted as possible.  As we get better and better evidence of what interactions spread the virus, we will target those interactions in order to protect human life and health, the health service, education, childcare and jobs.  That is broadly the strategy that is being deployed.</p>  <p>  These provisions are included in section 2 because there is very strong public health evidence showing that the virus is spreading most prodigiously within households and between households.  That is not really a matter of opinion.  Those are the facts gathered by the testing and contact tracing systems.  The advice I have received from the Chief Medical Officer and the data backing that advice both say that the majority of transmission is happening within and between households.  The Chief Medical Officer therefore deems it necessary for restrictions to address those locations which account for the majority of transmission.  The Government agrees with that.  That is why the definition is included in section 2. </p></speech>

I would like to respond to the Minister's last comment about the supposedly indisputable fact of widespread transmission in households.  It is not really indisputable fact, but rather a particular interpretation of the facts.  As I said to the Minister, it does not explain how we got so close to eliminating community transmission.  We had driven the virus out of private homes, but then it got back in.  Of course it will end up in homes and circulate among families if it is picked up somewhere else.  That stands to reason.  That does not mean activities or irresponsible behaviour within the home are the reasons for the rising infection rate.  Those two things are not the same and the Government is implying that they are.</p><p>When we had come so close to eliminating community transmission the disease was continuing to fester in direct provision centres, meat processing plants, certain workplace environments and certain large-scale congregations.  We know those settings are where it spreads.  It infects individuals who then go home, and then it spreads to their families.  Critically, the Minister has not resourced testing and he has particularly failed to resource our tracing regime.  As a result we cannot monitor that in detail.  The under-resourced tracing system chases the virus but it does not actually find where the virus came from in the first place.  We know the virus has a two-week lag.  Despite this, the system goes back a couple of days rather than going back two weeks to thoroughly investigate each case and all the contacts involved to determine where an outbreak started.  It is pretty obvious that if the Government did do that, the system would be able to identify particular congregated settings, workplaces and so on.  </p><p>This is why we need D&aacute;il oversight.  We fundamentally reject the focus of this Bill, which is why we will reject the Bill itself.  We fundamentally reject the underlying logic which focuses on individuals, households etc. as the cause for the current situation, rather than systemic, policy and strategy failures.  Having said that, we will need oversight if the Minister is to have these draconian powers.  To be honest, the Minister should support this series of amendments out of a sense of discomfort.  If, as he has said, he really is uncomfortable with the use of draconian legislation, he will surely recognise the need for Ministers to be overseen by the entirety of the Oireachtas.  Surely that is a good thing.  The reason he feels uncomfortable is that these are unprecedented and draconian powers.  Rather than wanting to make those decisions himself, the Minister should be glad to benefit from the collective wisdom of the D&aacute;il in deciding whether to impose penalties on people.</p> <p>I know other Deputies wish to contribute, so I will not go on at length.  I reiterate the point that the provisions under which penalties and fines will be imposed are aimed at people who are not adhering to public health advice.  Who is the biggest culprit in terms of not adhering to public health advice?  I ask the Minister to think about that.  It is the Government.  Slightly more than two weeks ago, it received public health advice that there would be exponential growth in infections unless the State moved to a higher level of restrictions but it ignored that advice.  As a result, there was an exponential rise in infections and hospitalisations and the number of people who lost their lives multiplied.  The Government ignored the public health advice, with the consequence that we are in a much worse position on a national scale and have thousands of extra cases.  Neither the Minister nor the Government has been fined and there is no suggestion that they should suffer penalty or sanction.  However, the Government thinks it is okay to impose sanctions on people who have no choice about these things and the overwhelming majority of whom have demonstrated a willingness to voluntarily comply with public health advice.  Through the Bill, the Minister is effectively pointing the finger at those people.  That is the logic that I and my colleagues reject.  At the very least, surely the Minister should accept there should be Oireachtas oversight of the use and potential abuse of these draconian powers.</p></speech>

They are variations on a theme.  Essentially, the amendments propose that the regulations the Government will eventually craft will come before the Oireachtas for approval.  I reiterate my earlier comments on a very important point that goes to the heart of my difficulty with the Bill.  It provides for certain categories of fines and then provides for upper limits for those fines.  Deputies know the on-the-spot fines will be less than &euro;500, but we have no idea what the figure will be.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated in his response on Second Stage that Deputies who have opinions on the Bill should give him a ring and have a chat with him.  Would it not be preferable for them to bring those issues to the House to be explored in a proper debate, or include the issues to be addressed in the Bill such that Deputies would at least know what they are?  We should know to what an on-the-spot fine refers, the definition of a "house party", the number of people who need to be present to constitute a house party, the meaning of straying outside a 5 km radius and what are the safeguards, checks and balances.  None of that is in the Bill because it will all be in the regulations.  The problem is that the regulations, when we eventually get them, will bear more resemblance to an Act or primary legislation than to regulations.</p>  <p>  I assume the regulations that will flow from the Bill will be published tonight.  I may be wrong.  They may be published next week.  I ask the Minister to please let Deputies know when they will be published and arrange a briefing for Oireachtas Members such that we have a heads-up about the publication before we receive calls from journalists asking about the regulations.  Members have been caught on the hop many times in that manner in respect of statutory instruments and regulations.  I ask the Minister to please ensure we are at least informed that he has published the regulations and they are being uploaded to the departmental website.  I ask that he afford members of the Opposition the chance to ask questions.</p>  <p>  If the Minister will not accept the amendments and will not come back to the D&aacute;il for consent, there is a problem.  All of these amendments relate to the public health advice and guidelines as well.  I wish to respond to an earlier comment by the Minister in that regard because it is important for me to so do.  I believe in the public health advice and guidelines.  At every stage, my party has supported all of the measures brought in by the Government, no matter what level has been recommended.  My party leader has supported them, as has our health spokesperson and party colleagues.  What we have not done and will not do is to second-guess the public health guidelines.  We have not tried to land on precise levels of restrictions or variations.  That is what the Government has done, based on hours of opportunities to probe and interrogate the advice given by NPHET.  Last week, there was a five-hour or six-hour meeting with NPHET.  I am sure the Minister attended it.  Deputies were told that very detailed presentations were given to the Minister.  Was it then for me to decide whether the country should go to level 4 plus or level 5 plus?  The Minister mentioned the Labour Party.  It stated we should go to level 4.  We eventually went to level 5.  What difference did it make?  It then accepted level 5.  Sinn F&eacute;in stated that it will support any public health advice and guidelines that are brought in and it has done so.  It has not gone against the advice or guidelines.  It is appealing to people to abide by the advice and guidelines.</p>  <p>  When I stated that the strategy is dead in the water, I was not referring to the public advice or NPHET or any other body.  Rather, I was referring to the strategy to get us out of this.  Deputy Shortall and other Deputies have rightly asked what is the strategy.  Aside from a cycle of restrictions and lockdowns, what is the wider strategy?  What more can we do to ensure we do not end up in endless lockdowns?  That is the strategy to which I refer.  It is not there.  We need a new plan and a new vision and I wish to be part of that, working with other Deputies on how we get there.  For the Minister to suggest that is somehow an attack on NPHET is disingenuous because he knows that is something neither I nor my party would do.  We need to get back to having robust discussions on what we can be doing and being productive in trying to create strategies we all want.  Every Member wishes to get ahead of the virus and lower the numbers to the greatest extent possible.  We do not just wish for the Government to succeed, but for the State to succeed.  That is not just about public health measures.  The enforcement of fines is only one part of it.  It is about everything else that must wrap around that.  In some respects, that is absent.  It is about the lack of capacity.</p>  <p>  I cannot support the Bill if the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendments.  If they are not accepted, the Bill is giving him a blank cheque.  There is no doubt about that.  Deputies are being expected to take it in good faith that whatever will be in the regulations will be in the best interests of the people whom we represent.  That may well be the case, but we do not know that it will.  Would it not have been better for Deputies to have been given sight of the statutory instrument and the regulations even if they were not going to have the opportunity to vote on them?  Deputy Howlin made that point on a previous occasion when we were discussing legislation that brought in similar penal provisions and Members had not had sight of the regulations.  Members would have known precisely what were the fines, to what they apply, how much they were and what safeguards, checks, balances and protections were in place.  We would have seen what the regulations were and known that if we were to support the Bill, we would support those regulations.  We do not have that.  We are fighting blind.  The Opposition has been blindfolded and I do not believe that is acceptable.</p>  <p>  That does not mean that I am against enforcement.  I am not against it.  Some people in this State are not abiding by the guidelines.  As many Deputies have stated, if those people are approached by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and asked to obey the rules, the vast majority of them will do so.  There is a tiny percentage of people who will not comply and who are reckless and put the lives of others in danger.  Of course, they should be subject to enforcement measures, but those measures must be fair and proportionate and Members should be able to see what they are before voting on them.  Surely it is a fundamental and basic principle of democracy that Deputies would have some sense of the matters on which they are expected to vote.  However, that is not the case with this legislation.  That is my quarrel with the Bill and with the Minister on this issue.</p></speech>

Deputies are voting but they do not have a clue on what they are voting.  They are just running along.  In west Cork, we call such people "Yes boys" or "Yes girls".  What is wrong with them?  Surely they should know what we are voting for here.  What fines will be applied and to whom?  College students in Cork city or elsewhere might have next week off and wish to go home to their parents.  Are they allowed to travel home this evening?</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I asked the Minister that question earlier, and he did not clarify that.  Will they be fined on the way home?  Will they face sanctions in law?  People have a right to get answers to those questions, but we have no answers.</p> <p> Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the marts.  Farmers are facing a major crisis.  If the buyer goes in around the ring and he is 10 ft or 12 ft away from the next person in wide open sheds, will he face a fine?  Will the mart owners face a fine?  In some marts yesterday, prices for some bulls were down by &euro;155 and prices for weanling heifers were down by &euro;100.  Those are enormous amounts.  Farmers cannot keep taking this hit because of indecision in the Government.  It is up to us as the Deputies on the ground to try to find answers.  The Government is railroading ahead, and it will have the same old gang who will vote for it no matter what it puts before the people, even if they do not know what they are voting on; they are voting on a blank paper.</p> <p> I question everything because that is what my electorate in west Cork asks me to do.  I acknowledge that the Minister cannot have an overview of everything that goes on in the country, but certainly the buck lies with him to a degree.  Can the marts reopen?  Basically, that is what it is down to.  Can the farmer continue to trade?  If he cannot, the Government should announce that today and cease that trading.  It should not leave farmers in a situation where they cannot sell their animals in the mart.  That is the situation they face in many marts.  The Minister can ask the mart managers.</p> <p> I am surprised that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, has not come out and clarified the matter.  He should at least work towards a solution.  Solutions are available and they have proved that.  Farmers and buyers do not want to be fined.  Mart owners do not want to be fined for breaking the rules.  They applied the rules meticulously.  Caf&eacute;s, restaurants and pubs applied the rules meticulously and they are all closed no matter how well they did things.  We have had considerable contact from people working in gyms etc.  They worked to the guidelines to the best of their ability.  They do not know why they cannot open.</p> <p> The Minister is probably running down the clock because regardless of the amendments tabled, the Government has its majority here.  We saw that with last night's vote on the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill.  The way Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Deputies came in here and voted was appalling.  The Government has too much power and it is abusing that power.</p> <p> I made it very clear at the beginning of my discussions earlier that the coronavirus is a very dangerous virus.  It is a curse on our people.  While it is here, we should work with it.  We should work with the people and not crucify them.  I am surprised that the Labour Party and the Social Democrats support these fines which hurt people further.  I accept we need guidelines and people need to stick to them to a degree.  However, chasing and fining people who are struggling at this time is a step too far.</p> <p> I plead with the Minister to speak with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I contacted Deputy Cahill, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, to convene a meeting of the committee any time between now and next week - it does not matter if it is Friday, Saturday or Sunday, I will come back up - to try to resolve this issue with marts so that at least some people can continue to operate in some normal way and not be worried about facing a fine.  It could be a fine of &euro;1,000, &euro;100 or &euro;500 because a man or a woman wants to put food on the table.</p> <p> I have been inundated with calls on the issue, mainly from women, who are very stressed about the situation they are facing.  They have bills to be paid and food to be bought.  Their children cannot come home from college and be given a bit of food or whatever and let go back again the following week or the week after when they can resume after the break.  We are basically standing over them with rules and regulations, which the House is agreeing to without knowing what we are agreeing to, and it is happy to do so.  Imagine a young person who may be struggling to continue with his or her education and has to be in college.  These young people are asking if they can come home for the week ahead.  Deputies who are voting for this legislation today should ask themselves one question.  If they did not know whether they could go home this evening, how would they feel?  However, they are quite happy to come here, pat themselves on the back and vote for that.  They should be ashamed of themselves.</p> <p> We need clarity.  These young people need clarity.  These farmers need clarity.  I know the Minister cannot answer every question.   In certain areas there is major doubt at present.  The Minister needs to stand up to the plate and give leadership.  He must give these young people this opportunity and clarity.  It is a strange world if they are told they cannot go home and have to stay in an apartment for a week.  Their parents cannot go to them to give them food either.  It is turning into a very strange world.  Politicians should be thinking twice.  I will support these amendments.</p></speech>

I will take my slot now that I have it and I will try to be brief.</p>  <p>  During my nine terms in this House, my approach has always been that everybody is here on their own mandate and entitled to their own views.  The notion that Deputies come in here to tell other people how they should think and what is right or wrong according to their likes is not right.</p>  <p>  This is a fundamental set of amendments.  Other speakers are absolutely right.  This is a very unusual Bill, almost unique.  When the Minister for Health gave his concluding speech on Second Stage he spoke about previous crises.  We never introduced legislation that amounted to a series of penalties with crimes to be determined later.  That is just a very odd way of doing it.  In my Second Stage contribution, I said that the Labour Party is willing to give qualified support to this approach because we are facing an unprecedented crisis.  People are dying and are very sick.  Last night, I spoke to a family, six of whom have tested positive for this awful disease and one of whom is very ill.  When we talk to people who are enduring this, we know how awful it is.  I want us to take whatever measures we can to mitigate that harm and not allow it to spread across our community.</p>  <p>  I am really amazed that the Minister has not just accepted this because I think it gives him comfort and strength.  The two sets of regulations he drafted previously are very complicated.  Other speakers have done some analysis of them.  The regulations could certainly be vastly improved.  I notice in the regulations he published two days ago, although this legislation has been vaunted as being a response to house parties, that the Minister has yet to criminalise house parties.  Unless he does so in the next set of regulations, the penalties in this legislation will not apply to house parties.</p>  <p>  We need to have an opportunity to examine in detail the specific secondary legislation the Minister is introducing.  I say this not only because it is the right thing to do, but because I am absolutely certain that the collective wisdom of all sides of this House would improve them, make them more effective and would allow for much more public buy-in.  All of this is predicated on public support.  We hope that nobody will be fined or prosecuted.  That is our collective wish, but that is built upon the hope that people will accept these rules.  They are much more likely to accept them if we have proper debate and scrutiny and people are not claiming that this legislation has been rushed through and not properly thought through.</p> <p>That is a very reasonable argument to make if the Government does not come back and allow the House to have a very clear view of the particular secondary legislation that will flow from this enactment.</p> <p> A few things in the Bill cause me concern.  I am looking at friction points that will cause annoyance and undermine confidence in our ability to tackle this terrible virus.  Take the notion of people who are "loitering with intent to attend a gathering".  We know from legislation across the globe that giving that sort of power to a police force to move people on because they are loitering with intent is fraught with difficulty.  All that is needed is one member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acting out in a way that they should not to really fundamentally cause concerns.  We can make this much better if we are given the opportunity.  Every Member of this House would be very willing to sit whatever hours the Minister wants on whatever days he wants, to ensure that we do this right and proper.</p> <p> I conclude on the fundamental issue of test and trace.  It has been the mantra of the World Health Organization from the very beginning of the pandemic.  It is a reasonable criticism that we wasted some of the opportunity we had to build a comprehensive test and trace system.  I know the Minister pushed back on all that but what happened over that weekend proved that we do not have a proper trace system.  The Minister says we have a proper comprehensive system because we have 117,000 tests.  I dealt with a case this week where a very ill gentleman was tested in a hospital last Saturday, and tested positive.  Since last Saturday, he has received two text messages with the same reference number calling him for two further tests in two different test centres.  Mistakes will be made, I understand that, but getting test and trace right is so important that we must deploy whatever resources we have to do that.  In the interim, we must take whatever measures are needed to discourage any activities that will allow the virus to spread but we must do it by holding on to the collective support of the majority of the people - we will not have everybody - but the handling of this legislation is fundamental to doing that.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this series of four amendments because that will allow the House to improve things fundamentally and to build the kind of support we need.</p></speech>

Deputy Howlin referred to very unusual legislation.  Much of it is.  Maybe it is because we are in unusual times.  I have just thought of a name for this Bill: the Donnelly Dictatorship Bill.  If we were to give the powers to the Minister that he is asking for, without any checks and balances, then our mental health would be lost.  When the Government refused to listen to NPHET's advice two weeks ago, the Minister, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste all suddenly found a new, grave concern for the mental health of the population, the same mental health that has had its budgets cut and been ignored in policies for years.  The Government found a new interest in mental health and now it must think that we are all mad that we might give it these powers without opposition and without pushing our amendments.  The Government is asking us to give it <i>carte blanche</i>to attach fines and possibly jail sentences to a whole range of activities and we do we do not know what they are.  The Minister needs to accept this amendment even just to save face; I will not vote for the Bill even if he does accept the amendment but I hear that others might.</p><p>I will make a broader point.  I read today's briefing from the Department of the Taoiseach on Covid.  It is an understatement to say that we are being treated like we are little kids who do not understand.  It does not mention the collapse in tracing, the disaster we are facing in testing or the crazy stuff that happened with the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine notifying the schools in time about the hand sanitiser that had been sent to them.  It does not talk about the serious issues that we, as politicians, and the population have to grapple with to get ahead of the virus, it only talks about individual behaviour.  It tells us to wash our hands again, to watch our distance again and to mask up again but where are the actual systemic measures that the Government needs to address as a matter of urgency?  The Minister might think they are here in this Bill but we utterly disagree.  I think An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na probably disagrees as well.  I listened to an interview with Drew Harris on the &quot;News at One&quot;.  Paul Reynolds of RT&Eacute; did his best to extract from him how he feels about this legislation.  The best Drew Harris could respond, because he cannot actually criticise the Government, was that as a good and faithful public servant, he would do what he was told.  That is not a great endorsement of this legislation from the Garda Commissioner.  In fact the whole mood of the interview was that he was not happy about it and I doubt many garda&iacute; on the beat are happy either.  It does not improve anything.  If anything it sends out the message - optics are important - that ordinary people, families and people who try to socialise are to blame and that it is not to do with the Government's systemic failures, the failure to get ahead with tracking and tracing and to employ the additional 200 nurses needed in homes, the failure that where contracts are issued they are zero hours, and the failure when teachers and special needs assistants are taken out of schools when they are badly needed.  I could go on and on about the many systemic failures that are not being addressed here.</p><p>Fines do not work.  Back in 2016, the Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, introduced legislation to stop attaching jail sentences to fines.  That was a progressive move.  A report in <i>The Irish Times </i>late last year showed that since that legislation was introduced almost 32,000 failed to pay court imposed fines from 1 January to the end of November 2019.  That figure was exponentially rising.  The imposition of fines does not work.  The Minister might say that attaching a jail sentence to them seemed to work but it did not and that is why we had to end it.  There were jail cells full of lone parents, usually poor women, some coming from as far as Donegal or the bowels of Kerry to the D&oacute;chas Centre or Limerick, being jailed because they did not pay their TV licence.  That is why we ended that draconian practice which the Minister now wants to bring back into law, moving away from progressive legislation back to regressive legislation.  More important is the signal this is sending to the people that they are the problem, not the health service being a disaster or the tracking and tracing that is falling apart and the domino effect that follows that but actually it is the ordinary Joe and Josephine Soap.  It is not good enough and we will utterly oppose this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300030#DD00300"><p>I make a very strong appeal to the Minister to work with other parties in the House.  We all want to work together, we recognise that we are facing a very significant threat to our lives and livelihoods.  It is a national threat and there is a need for a national response.  The best way of demonstrating that is for us to work on an all-party basis and to co-operate, collaborate and be very clear about the messages we are giving.  The Minister's actions in handling this legislation work against that.  The aim of these five amendments is purely to say that while we recognise that this is enabling legislation, we cannot possibly tell the Minister that yes, we will enable him to do whatever he wishes to do.  At a minimum that would be highly irresponsible but neither is it the way that democratic politics works or should work.</p> <p>We are saying to the Minister, in putting forward these amendments, that before he does the things that this legislation enables him to do, which involve imposing restrictions on people in their daily lives, on businesses and on a range of different activities, and before he decides what penalties should apply for breaches of the public health advice, that he bring those proposals to the House and that we work together to ensure they are the right ones.  We should all aim to identify what will actually work.  It should not be about political differences.  It should be about taking everything into consideration, including the way people behave, what we know about human nature and what has worked in the past.  On the basis of that experience and expertise, let us identify the best way of achieving what we all want to achieve.<br/><br/>The most important question is how we can ensure compliance with the public health advice.  We know from human nature, behavioural psychology and what people such as Dr. Mike Ryan have been saying in recent days that telling people what to do and underpinning that in legislation does not work.  We need to persuade people, bring them with us, convince them that the measures are the right ones and ensure they trust the Government and will work with it.  We need that type of trust more than anything else at this stage.  There are pressures on every aspect of the State response to the pandemic.  People are becoming very concerned that testing and tracing and lots of other provisions are not working.  There are increasing concerns about what is happening in nursing homes and whether we are facing into a repeat of what happened earlier in the year.  We know the infection numbers are increasing at an exceptional rate.  It is important that we work together and have an agreed approach if we are to bring people with us.  That is what we are seeking to do in these amendments.<br/><br/>Many people will agree that, ultimately, we probably need some kind of sanction but, first, we must persuade and cajole people, provide the evidence for measures introduced and encourage them to comply.  All of that must be done first and there must be good messaging.  Unfortunately, the Government's messaging has been hopeless.  Several weeks ago, the Taoiseach was talking about possibly using influencers to reach out to people, but he never did anything about it.  With all due respect, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; has a very limited appeal.  The Government needs to use different influencers, people who will be listened to, whether in the sports world, music industry or any other area, by different cohorts of people, and use different platforms to get the message across.  It has not tried any of those things and is instead jumping straight to penalties.  That is going to get people's backs up and it is a big concern.  Rather than getting people to come along with it, the Government will be encouraging them to work against it.  That is the very last thing we need.<br/><br/>Dr. Mike Ryan has said that the Government must stop doing what it is doing.  We must bring everybody along with us and get everybody working together to achieve the same objective.  That objective is to reduce the rate of infections, save people's lives, get back to some kind of normality and keep the virus under control.  We will not do that by taking the type of penalty-based approach the Government has adopted in the absence of anything else.  I would happily accept the introduction of penalties as a last resort but they will not work as a first resort.  That was tried in the UK and not only did it not work but it did damage.  What we are asking for is absolutely reasonable.  I have no doubt that if the Minister were on this side of the House, he would say exactly the same thing.  He would say that we can pass the enabling legislation but it should be on condition that any regulations made on foot of it will require the approval of the D&aacute;il.  That is the purpose of these amendments and I appealing strongly to him to consider accepting them.  He will have the support of the vast majority of Deputies in so doing.<br/><br/>I heard what the Garda Commissioner said at lunchtime.  It is very clear that he does not want the Minister to take the approach he is taking.  The Commissioner will do what he is told to do but we should listen to what members of the Garda are saying.  Nobody is asking that this hardline approach be taken.  It is heavy-handed, it is not a good idea and it will be counterproductive.  I have no difficulty supporting this legislation if the Minister is prepared to accept these amendments.  In the absence of the kinds of very reasonable safeguards they set out, it is completely unreasonable to expect us to give him a free hand and <i>carte blanche</i>in the regulations he introduces and the activities he decides will attract penalties.  We cannot do that and nor can we allow him to dictate what the penalties should be.  We would be failing in our job if we gave him that free hand.  We all want the same thing and we must work together to achieve it.  The issue is ascertaining the most effective way of going about it.  We know from experience that penalising people from the very start is not effective.  I urge the Minister to listen to what people are saying.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300031#EE00200"><p>Previous speakers have taken a lot of time and I want to ensure I leave an opportunity for others who are waiting to speak.  Several Deputies have argued that we all need to work together.  We should do the same to ensure we all get a chance to say what we have to say in the time available.</p>  <p>  Several speakers made the point that NPHET's advice was ignored in advance of the current lockdown.  My view at the time was that it was not ignored but it needed to be discussed.  It was the way the story was leaked that caused panic and led to people running to shops.  When the current restrictions were announced, people were behaving as if it was the end of the world and they needed to get their shopping done.  It is the false spin and scare tactics that caused the spike in infection rates over the past two weeks.  We must ensure that the message that goes out to people is a clear one.  There must be an end to the leaking of information bit by bit.  Before we left the Chamber last night, there was talk that sanitising personnel had gone into a particular school and that all schools would now be closed.  We found out today that this particular piece of scaremongering was untrue.  The information that goes out to people must be definitive and there must be an end to the spin.</p>  <p>  I am seeking definitive answers from the Minister on a particular matter.  I have some chance of getting answers to my questions but members of the public have no chance.  I started a process last night to ascertain the status of music schools that provide classes for junior certificate, leaving certificate and college students.  They are in limbo at this time.  When I spoke to the Minister about it yesterday, he said it was a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley.  When I took the matter to that Minister, I was told I should bring it to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I was then advised by the latter to go back to the Minister for Education and Skills.  If Deputies are being sent around in circles, what chance do members of the public have of getting definitive answers to their questions?  We need clear answers and clear instructions.  Are music schools that provide lessons for schools that do not have the facilities to teach music but have the facilities to hold the examinations allowed to open?</p> <p> I do not want to go around in circles again.  I want one Minister to take clear action on this matter and to give me a clear answer.  Today, and since this Government was formed, we have seen a massive divide between city and county.  If a 5 km restriction is introduced in a city, one can get everything one needs.  If a 5 km restriction is introduced in a county, one cannot.  We need to ensure that facilities are available for people within their counties.  There must be clear instructions rather than spin leaking out for a headline.  The Government should stop scaring people and then coming out with amendments afterwards.  We have a problem here.  If things are to be agreed, they need to be agreed properly and communicated to the public properly.  We all know that bad news sells media and papers.  The small minority of good news also sells papers but it is all spin.  We need clear direction.</p> <p> As other Deputies indicated, appearances on "The Late Late Show" will not get messages out to the public.  I told another Deputy yesterday that we had something up on social media.  He asked if it was on Twitter before saying that I was too old for Twitter.  This is what was said to me.  The way forward is to make use of every form of media through which we can get clear decisive information out to people.  If our Government cannot give us that information and cover the whole country and every sector, what hope do we have?</p> <p> As I said at the outset, I have gone to three Ministers on this issue and have been sent around in a circle.  I have asked a question about people who are getting music classes as part of their junior certificate, leaving certificate or college studies.  The Limerick School of Music is aligned with the education and training board.  Other schools do not have facilities for music in the school so parents outsource and pay for their children to study music for the junior certificate, leaving certificate or college education.  These students sit examinations in the school.  Are they part of the education system or are they not?  Will people in rural Ireland be discriminated against because some schools do not have facilities for music classes?  If students are sitting examinations in school, these classes must be educational.  I need a Minister to make a decision in this regard and to let these people know the position, one way or the other.</p> <p> Some of the stuff put out today suggests that, even under level 3, one-on-one tuition is not allowed.  If one is paying for a music class, it may be taught one on one.  People attending such classes will have their own instruments and can sit in their own chair.  We are doing it here.  We are all 2 m apart.  If the facilities are available to do this, if people are using all their own equipment and if the classes are educational and being pursued for the purposes of one's examinations, the schools should be allowed open, with the proper guidelines in place.</p> <p> The same situation pertains to the marts in our farming sector.  The marts cover 4 or 5 acres of ground at a minimum.  Something could be put in place for the farmers.  If one goes to rural areas anywhere in the country, one will see that the Internet service is poor.  People say marts can be held over Zoom or social media but they cannot.  Let us get real.  It is a question of county versus city.  County does not have infrastructure or the Internet but the city does.  Can we please make rules that cover everyone?</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Cullinane and his party for tabling them.  I endorse what Deputies Howlin, Shortall and Br&iacute;d Smith have said.  I hope none of them takes offence at my endorsement.</p>  <p>  I will take this opportunity to ask the Minister a specific question and I would welcome an answer to it.  We are allowing the Minister to define a dwelling event, the holding of which will be a criminal offence punishable by law.  I would put question marks over the constitutionality of that measure.  They are no more than question marks, but I believe the provision needs to be teased out.  At the very least, an event is an event.  A rave or the benching of a judge might constitute an event but a friend visiting a friend, a grandparent visiting a grandchild or a child visiting a parent is not an event by any stretch of language.  It may be contrary to public health advice, at least if precautions are not taken, but it is not an event.  Will the Minister clarify that he will not seek to impose fines in respect of the normal daily occurrences which I have just described?  For the avoidance of doubt, I am talking about a friend visiting a friend or a parent visiting a child.  These are not events.  It is an abuse, if not of the Constitution, then certainly of language and of the political process for the Minister to seek to bring a Bill before the House to declare these actions to be a criminal offence.  I am not saying that it is not contrary to public health advice or that such advice should not be followed, but we are talking about criminal offences.</p>  <p>  I will return to the issue of public health advice, which has been raised.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett stated, this is about punishing breaches of public health advice.  The Minister has portrayed all of this as being driven by public health considerations.  We have public health advisers on the one hand and the Government on the other.  The Government says that the advisers tell it what to do and that it does it while not influencing the advisers in any way.  I was, therefore, really concerned by the comments of the chairman of NPHET which suggested that we should not concentrate so much on the absolute and utter shambles of a tracing system we have because it could not possibly deal with the number of cases we have and because these measures are needed.  Was that public health advice?  Was the chairman speaking as a member of NPHET or as a servant, agent or official of the Department of Health, who answers to the Minister, to absolve the Department and the health authorities of their obligations to follow public health advice?  I have never heard anybody suggest anything other than that testing and tracing is key.  It has been repeated for months, by a committee of which the Minister was a member before he took office, that our tracing system is not working.</p>  <p>  We can seek to criminalise the poor for being poor.  It will not work because our fines system does not work.  We can give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the job of handing out these notices.  I have no doubt but that it will do the job this House assigns to it.</p></speech>

If parents cannot pay such a fine, will the Minister have him them brought to court?  If they will not go to court, a bench warrant will be issued, which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have to execute because that is the position of our fines system at the moment.  There was recently a District Court enforcement list of 600 cases in Limerick and 400 bench warrants were issued.  I do not know whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had the capacity to execute all of those warrants but this is not an efficient use of its time.</p> <p>There are other policing matters with which the Garda should and needs to be dealing.  In effect, we are assigning the Garda to seek to compensate for the failings of our testing and tracing system and our health response.  We had moved away from that.  In every area, we had agreed that deficiencies in health, matters of health and personal autonomy, which is an essential part of health, were not the appropriate subject matter of policing.</p> <p> I welcome the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments for the simple reason that they require the Minister to bring the regulations he is going to make before the House.  In the event that he is not going to accept the amendments, I ask the Minister to clarify that when he is talking about events, he is talking about parties involving large numbers, raves and, heaven forbid, benchings, and not about a parent visiting a child or someone dropping in to a neighbour to make sure he or she is okay as we head into the winter.</p></speech>

What has happened in nursing homes has been one of the most heartbreaking aspects of this whole crisis.  The most vulnerable have been the most exposed.  They make up the majority of those who have lost their lives to Covid-19.  Yesterday, I raised the issue of the nursing home in Galway at which 26 of the 28 residents tested positive for Covid-19.  I quoted the information that I got to the effect that the director of nursing stated the HSE was not listening.  The HSE's first response was that the home should get agency staff.  The nursing home found that there were just none available.  While the HSE did send somebody, it did not send hands-on help for the nursing home.  In the words of the staff, the HSE did not provide boots on the ground.  As an Opposition Deputy, it was my duty to criticise this event owing to what happened in the first half of the year.  I criticised the fact that the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the current Minister both refused to investigate the Government's handling of the nursing home crisis at the start of the year.  In my contribution, I also criticised the fact that both Ministers, the Department, HIQA and the HSE have refused to investigate the case of Mary Bartley Meehan, a constituent of mine, given how tragically her husband died.  I also raised the fact that the Ombudsman has articulated his frustration over not having the ability to investigate clinical decisions made in nursing homes.  These are all fair and genuine criticisms.</p>  <p>  I made reference to the comments of Deputy O'Dowd and the Minister.  The Minister repeated what he said today.  I heard him say that the nursing homes are private businesses, private organisations.  In some ways, he is washing his hands of responsibility for them.  He is erecting a paper wall to prevent responsibility leaking into his area.  The truth is that those affected are all citizens of this country.  We are all responsible for them, whether they are in a private nursing home or a public one.  The truth is that these elderly people are in a private nursing home because the Government has been derelict in its duty to provide the necessary public spaces for them over time.  The Minister is entitled to deflect the criticism but the manner in which he did so is completely odious.  He stated earlier that we were criticising the workers in the nursing homes and that he was standing up for them and defending their actions.  That is the furthest thing from the truth because we were actually criticising the Government's handling of the nursing homes issue.  Trying to twist the matter to say we are criticising the staff in the nursing homes is simply outsourcing responsibility again.  It is absolutely wrong and the Minister should withdraw what he said earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300033#GG00300"><p>A speech could be very brief today based on the previous contributions, which submitted that the Government is responsible for absolutely everything, even for the pandemic itself.  I, along with a few others, but not everybody, attended the briefing given by the Minister's officials yesterday on what Jonathan Swift would have called modest proposals, yet we have heard today a litany of questionable comments, unusually from Members I would normally consider sensible, including Deputy McNamara, who is in the gods up above me, who makes a lot of sense on Covid and who chaired - very intelligently - the Covid committee, a committee that is missed.  The idea that legislation is planned by the Government so the Garda can fine and criminalise parents who visit their child or children who visit their parents is catastrophising what are modest proposals.  It adds to the stress of people listening.  To those who might be listening, I say that nothing could be further from the intentions of the Government in this legislation.  The proposals are very simple and modest, in response to the fact that, while the vast majority of people continue to abide by the guidelines and the advisories issued by the public health authorities, HSE and NPHET, there are those who breach the guidelines, sometimes inadvertently, and cause difficulties for everybody else.  Issues have arisen over larger-than-allowed gatherings in family homes.  Some of those gatherings do not constitute raves or massive house parties but we are aware, based on the evidence that NPHET has given us, that they have been the source of super-spreading incidents.</p>  <p>  We are also aware that the philosophy behind this legislation and the manner in which the Garda has commendably policed our country throughout the pandemic have been, first and foremost, to engage with the public, educate in a gentle, consent-led way those who are not complying, encourage those who are not complying to change their behaviour and, as a very last resort, introduce enforcement proceedings.  People need to catch hold of themselves.  The country is up to its neck, stressed out and anxious.  The kind of language used today, particularly by those on the left, does nothing except add to the catastrophising of the crisis we face.  They need to take a long, cold shower and listen to some of the rubbish they bleat about some of the regulations, advisories and guidelines that the Government is trying to introduce in the midst of a pandemic, the environment around which changes hourly and daily.  The pandemic creates enough crises of its own without individual Deputies in here catastrophising one event after another, the latest concerning hand sanitisers, as though the Government deliberately procured dangerous hand sanitisers for schools and as if every school had procured them and every school would have to close down.</p>  <p>  A Deputy for whom I have a lot of regard was in the upper tier earlier looking for advice on music schools.</p> <p>The Deputy knows the answer to this, he just does not want to be the one to deliver that news.  It is set out as plain as the nose on my face in levels 1 to 5.  We know from various groups and residents that most people understand it.  Many people need hand-holding and an awful lot of people ask questions to which they already know the answers but they wish the answers were not so.  They want someone else to give them that answer and when they get the answer the person giving it gets a barrage of criticism.  I have my own issues with level 5.  I support what the Government is doing.  We have gone into a phase for six weeks and we will have to wait and see what the outcome will be.</p> <p> Then we look at the hard left.  Deputy Shortall, whom I greatly respect, spoke about the entire House coming to a consensus on how we deal with these issues and on the fines and the levels of enforcement measures the Garda takes.  We do not have the time for this.  The Deputy knows the House would not come to agreement on any measure on the pandemic.  The Government has to take the difficult and courageous decisions.  This is what governing involves sometimes.  It is not the easy decisions and the crowd pleasing decisions that come from the hard left that are so easy to make.  It is the really difficult tough unpopular decisions that are the decisions the Government has to make.  The Government does not always get it right and when it does not get it right it comes back and it says we have to change this and amend it.  With regard to the hard left's latest proposal on zero Covid, I looked online, and yesterday my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, referred to the fact there are 66 active cases in New Zealand, which has been one of the pin-up countries for a zero-Covid policy.</p> <p> This is a virus.  The Government is doing its best.  Our health service is doing its best.  The testers and tracers are doing their absolute best, as are the HSE, nurses, doctors, shelf stackers, teachers, special needs assistants and caretakers.  The Government got the schools back and ensured the delivery and fulfilment of the social contract that protects as best as possible those who lost their jobs or whose businesses are struggling but never a word from the left about how the Government has fulfilled the social contract with the most vulnerable.  In the pandemic, the most vulnerable can have various hues because they include businesses, entrepreneurs and the private sector and not just those who would traditionally be regarded as vulnerable.  Never a word from the left in the House about how the Government has absolutely supported them at a time when they most need it.  The Government has poured billions into ensuring that stability is maintained in society at a time of unforeseen and sudden crisis.  All the left does is catastrophise, attempt to divide and cause more anxiety and upheaval because that is the environment in which it thrives.  The Government's responsibility is to keep order in the midst of chaos.  What a challenge it is to maintain order in the midst of chaos.</p> <p> I will communicate privately with the Minister on my next point.  There are other measures the Government could take from a behavioural point of view.  Nobody is thrilled that we have moved to level 5.  We will know in six weeks whether it has worked.  It may be a fork in the road for the country in terms of whether it has.  I truly hope it does work because we are facing into Christmas and a time of hope for people.  Members of the public looking on need to know that the vast majority of Members of the House, on the left and right, and all of those who support the Government are doing their absolute best to help them through the crisis and to maintain order and stability.  The proposals before us today from the Ministers for Health and Justice and Equality are modest.  They are in response to the anxiety and concerns of the public about the fact that while they have been obeying the laws, they see others flagrantly not obeying the laws but have not seen any enforcement on this.  These proposals are modest efforts to attempt to tackle this issue.</p></speech>

We can all agree we want to bring the virus under control, reduce the spread of Covid-19 and do so by working together.  I do not just mean all of us in the House but each and every one of us in the country.  I also think we can agree, particularly as we are now at level 5 and infections are increasing at the rate they are, that we cannot do whatever we want to do, visit whomever we want to visit, drive wherever we want to go and carry on as normal because if we did, we would not be able to bring this pandemic under control.  We would all agree with this.</p>  <p>  At every stage of this process, when the Government has put in place regulations and measures, we have always tried to work and engage with people.  We will all agree, because almost everybody who has spoken so far has said so, that the vast majority of people have complied.  They are trying.  We all make mistakes and nobody is perfect.  People might have breached the regulations without meaning to or without realising it, but we are all trying.  We can all agree the legislation will not actually apply to the vast majority of people.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I brought forward legislation specifically relating to pubs, restaurants and premises selling alcohol because it was apparent to the vast majority of premises that were compliant that there were no penalties for those that were not compliant.  Members of the House supported me, perhaps because the publicans supported the legislation.  What happened very quickly afterwards was that the number of repeat offenders dropped and offending then disappeared.  What we are trying to do here is very similar.  The regulations will not apply to those who are adhering to the guidelines but there needs to be a very clear example for those who are adhering that there is a difference between them and those who are continuously and repeatedly breaking guidelines and putting the health of others at risk.</p>  <p>  Deputies are asking to what this will be applied.  The legislation is to bring the penalties in line with the breaches.  At present, we believe the penalties are too severe because penalties are applied whether it is 5 km visit or gatherings.  These have all been in place from the very beginning but because we are working from legislation based in the 1960s, the penalties are up to &euro;2,500 or six months in prison.  I do not think these are fair, and nor do other Ministers and most Deputies.  This is why we have set a limit of &euro;500.</p>  <p>  Deputies cited the Garda Commissioner.  They could also cite the Commissioner's statement that with regard to house gatherings, the Bill is good.  We have not brought about this particular measure because we want to or because we are trying to be mean or stop people's fun.  Far from it.  There will not be garda&iacute; going around looking in people's windows.  What we are doing is responding to the fact that the Garda and the Chief Medical Officer have said the concern at present is very much connected to large gatherings in homes.  We are trying to respond to this.  Those who are not breaching guidelines will not come into contact with the Garda or the legislation but we need to send a message to those who are, particularly at this time and given that we are trying to bring this pandemic under control, that it is simply not acceptable.</p></speech>

We are certainly keeping him busy today.  I ask Deputies to do those of us who will be here all night the service of keeping quiet while the Minister addresses the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300037#LL00200"><p>I thank the House for this opportunity to consider the measures that have been introduced in response to the recent rise in cases of Covid-19.  As Deputies will be aware, earlier this week the country moved to level 5 of the Government's medium-term strategy for dealing with the virus, Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.  I do not propose to rehearse all of the measures that are encompassed by that move.  Colleagues are aware at this stage, following the address by the Taoiseach on Monday, of the primary measures that have been taken.  Among the most significant is the decision to close non-essential retail outlets, to restrict restaurants to takeaway service only, and most difficult of all, the requirement for people to stay at home as much as possible, and to exercise within 5 km of their homes.  I emphasise that the Government and I understand that people are extremely frustrated at the restrictions which we have all been living with since March of this year.  I understand the difficulties and the anger that have been generated by the ways in which life has been altered.  However, it remains the case that we are in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic.</p><p>As <i>The Irish Times</i>reports today, Europe's reported coronavirus cases more than doubled in ten days, surpassing 200,000 daily infections for the first time.  Various European countries have reported their highest ever number of daily cases.  Hospitals across Europe remain under strain.  Covid-19 hospital admissions and occupancy rates are rising.  Belgium has had to postpone non-essential hospital procedures.  There have been reports that stretched Dutch hospitals are going to have to transfer patients to Germany.  The Czech Government has had to seek help from the United States National Guard.  Our European neighbours are also using various measures, including curfews and the closure of bars, restaurants and non-essential retail outlets to limit the spread of this virus.  Germany is now grappling with more than 10,000 coronavirus infections daily, the most it has experienced since the outbreak started, while admissions to hospital intensive care units have doubled over the past two weeks.</p><p>It is important to remember that while there have undoubtedly been some positive developments with regard to improved outcomes for Covid-19 patients in critical care, and some drugs have been shown to be somewhat effective in certain circumstances, we essentially remain without any therapeutic intervention that we can rely on as a cure.  I am hopeful that in the near term, that situation will improve, but that is the case today.  The World Health Organization recently reported from its international Solidarity trial, which Ireland is also participating in, and concluded that a number of drugs for which many people had high hopes, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and interferon, had little or no effect on the course of the disease when examined through a gold-standard, randomised trial.  That trial involved more than 12,000 patients in 500 hospital sites in more than 30 countries.</p><p>As the House is aware, there is also a major global effort to develop a vaccine for the virus.  Ireland is part of the process that will be procuring supplies for the EU and has signed on to the first contracts that have been put in place.  That leaves us with what are termed non-pharmaceutical interventions and the terms which we have all become very used to over the past eight months, including social distancing, cough and sneeze etiquette, wearing a mask and avoiding crowded situations.  Most people have embraced these new behaviours.  We all slip up from time to time.  We can all forget and stand too close to someone in a shop or not wash our hands when we had planned to, but I think it is reasonable to conclude that most have demonstrated remarkable fortitude in the face of what has been an extremely difficult year.  However, we also know that it has been sometimes necessary to bring forward legal instruments to ensure that public health was provided for by means of particular measures.  We are not alone on this.  Many countries have done the same.</p><p>I would also like to update the House on the situation with regard to testing and tracing.  As Deputies will be aware, the HSE has worked intensively over recent months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation.  Capacity is in place to test up to 20,000 people a day.  With this level of testing, more than 111,000 were swabbed last week, and we are finding more cases than we would have previously.  In recent weeks, while we have increased resources significantly as demand has increased, the numbers of positive cases and close contacts have risen even more sharply.  The impact of the sharp rise in cases and volume of contacts meant that demand on the tracing system last weekend temporarily exceeded its capacity.  The HSE put in place one-off temporary measures to address this situation.  This understandably caused anxiety. However, as our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, said clearly, we need to recognise that in a mitigation period in a pandemic, which is what we are currently facing, when a surge on the scale of what we are currently seeing is apparent, it is clear that we cannot contact trace our way out of where we are.  We need the social restrictions that are now in place and we need everyone to help us make them work.  The number of cases now being detected on a daily basis has exceeded the ability of the contact tracing system.  Indeed, the events of this weekend underscore the need to move to level 5 restrictions.</p><p>It is important to state clearly that we as a country continue to face a major threat from Covid-19.  Its lethal potential has not been altered.  We know that most people who get the virus will have mild symptoms that resolve themselves but we also know that we can expect to see a proportion of people infected with the virus require hospitalisation, a smaller percentage requiring admission to critical care, and, tragically, some people have died and more, unfortunately, will die.  As of yesterday, we have seen 1,871 of our fellow citizens die from this disease.  Many others have suffered extremely debilitating bouts of illness, requiring hospitalisation and, for some, assistance with breathing via a ventilator.  I express my deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of all those who have died.  I also once more wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to all of the healthcare staff who have worked far above and beyond the call of duty over the past eight months in responding to this crisis.</p><p>If a situation occurs, as it has now in Ireland, where the virus is spreading rapidly among the population, the ramifications of that begin to pose an enormous threat to the health of our entire country.  It is vital in such circumstances that we work to prevent the spread of the virus from moving so rapidly that it overwhelms the capacity of the health service to treat those requiring care.  There is no health service in the world that has an infinite capacity to meet the level of demand that uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 would impose.  We witnessed the scenes earlier this year in a number of very advanced healthcare systems - in Italy, Spain and New York, to name but a few - where the hospital network came under the most severe pressure.  As I said earlier, real pressure points are beginning to emerge across Europe.  This is the situation that we are working hard to avoid in Ireland.</p><p>As the House is aware, critical care plays an essential role in the provision of care to patients who are seriously ill as a result of Covid-19.  Ireland has an acknowledged historical deficit in critical care capacity and we are working to address this.  Deputies may wish to note that baseline permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland at the start of 2020 was 255 beds.</p> <p>Funding for a further 40 adult critical care beds and two paediatric critical care beds was provided as part of the response to Covid-19 in March.  Investment announced in the recent budget will bring the overall number of permanent beds by the end of next year to 321, an increase of 25% on the numbers last January.  The acute system also has the capability to respond with surge capacity if required, although not without consequences in terms of staff redeployment, curtailing other services and greater clinical risk as the number of surge beds rises.  This is precisely the scenario we are working to avoid.  The acute hospital system and critical care service coped with the initial surge in admissions largely due to the success of public health measures in flattening the curve and the subsequent fall-off in Covid cases and non-Covid care.<br/><br/>While we are continuing to work to address the deficits, it must be recognised that the development of critical care capacity is not straightforward and involves much more than simply sourcing a bed and putting it in a hospital.  It is a system of care that requires trained available nurses and doctors as well as appropriate equipment.  As of 21 October 2020, 247 critical care beds were occupied.  There were 35 confirmed Covid patients in critical care, as well as a further 15 suspected cases.<br/><br/>I recognise the genuine concerns that have been expressed by Deputies about other aspects of healthcare delivery.  To be clear, we are not prioritising care for people with Covid over people with, for example, cancer.  We are making every effort to ensure that we retain capacity within the health service to treat all patients.  My concern, and the concern of NPHET, is that we would lose the ability to respond to non-Covid ailments, such as cancer, to stroke patients and to people injured in accidents as a result of the strain that would be placed on hospitals in the worst-case scenario.  There is no option available to us where we can ignore the growth in the disease and expect hospital functions to continue as normal and to be available to all who will need them in the coming weeks.  This is a public health matter, first and foremost.  It has economic, legal and societal ramifications that have to be mediated through the political system.  However, the virus can only be suppressed if we all buy into the public health measures in place here and across the world.  Social distancing and other measures, such as good hand and respiratory hygiene, remain our primary defence.<br/><br/>I wish to conclude by giving a message to people throughout the country for the coming six weeks.  It is about non-Covid care.  During the initial efforts to flatten the curve, many health services were closed, as were schools, colleges, childcare and most of the economy.  What happened was a serious reduction in the number of people presenting to their GPs and, for example, being referred to the rapid access clinics for cancer.  The number of people presenting with strokes and other conditions fell to a level that deeply worried those working in emergency medicine and across the healthcare system.  For understandable reasons, there is still a lower level of referral and presentation by people across the country.  People are scared and anxious.  They want to know that their healthcare system is safe.<br/><br/>For example, one of the programmes we all support, and I have discussed it at great length in the Oireachtas, is the national screening services.  I was informed in the last few days that 90% of women invited for smear tests or the new test are not turning up.  I do not blame anybody.  People have many reasons, and it has been a very difficult year for many.  However, it is essential that people continue to engage in the healthcare system.  We could find ourselves in a situation, through the measures we are taking, whereby we save many lives that otherwise would have been lost to Covid-19, but, on the other side, we could end up losing many more lives and healthy years for people to live as a result of them not engaging and presenting as early as they normally would.<br/><br/>We have moved to level 5, but it is not like the first time.  It is identical to the first time in one critical way, which is in the core message from the public health doctors, the Government and the vast majority of Members of the House that people should stay at home for the next almost six weeks.  There are exceptions to that, but the core message is to stay at home, where possible, so we can drive this virus back down again and reopen in early December.  How it is different is that more aspects of our lives are open, such as childcare facilities, primary and secondary schools, colleges, adult disability services and, critically, the healthcare system.  The healthcare system, GPs, primary care facilities, diagnostic services, emergency departments, outpatient clinics and operating theatres are all open.  The doctors, nurses and allied health professionals are all going to work.  I hope we all can tell the people we represent that healthcare is open.  Indeed, one of the reasons we moved early to act pre-emptively against this rise in Covid-19 is to ensure we do not find ourselves in the position we were in last time, or in the position some other European countries find themselves in now whereby they are having to close down large parts of their healthcare systems to cope with Covid.  That is not where we are, and it is why we are moving early and decisively.<br/><br/>The message is to stay at home or within 5 km of one's house.  We must look out for, and take care of, each other.  Essential visits are fine, just as they were last time.  For visits to relatives or friends who may be vulnerable or in trouble, we introduced something I pushed hard for, the concept of the social bubble for single adult households.  Nonetheless, this will be a hard six weeks.  We are heading into the winter, whereas we were heading into summer on the last occasion.  That made a big difference.  The message is that people should stay at home if they can or within 5 km of their house.  There is a set of exemptions to that which are available on <i>gov.ie</i>.  I reiterate, as Minister for Health, that the healthcare system and non-Covid healthcare are open.  The best way we can protect and keep each other safe is to ensure that everybody continues to engage with the healthcare system.  That is how we will save as many lives and as many healthy years for people as possible.<br/><br/>I must inform Deputies that I must leave.  I had hoped to stay here so I ask Deputies not to take offence.  I am meeting the 221+ group and because the business ran on, I must leave now.  I apologise to Deputies for leaving.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300038#MM00200"><p>I am sharing time with Teachta&iacute; &Oacute; Laoghaire and O'Reilly.  I accept the reason the Minister must leave.  It has been a long day and we have been discussing a number of different issues.  I hope the Minister listens carefully to what the members of the group he is meeting have to say.  That is an important issue, and they are quite sore about the fact that the tribunal has been created and put in place, in their view without proper consultation with them.  It is appropriate that the Minister meets the group and also listens carefully and acts on what the members say.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of opportunities over the last few days to discuss the Government's strategy for how to live with the virus.  We have done that in the context of different legislative measures that have been brought forward and motions relating to extending emergency powers to the Minister for Health, the sunset clauses that give him those powers for certain periods and, for most of today, the fines that will be associated with the regulations the Minister will introduce.</p>  <p>We have had plenty of opportunity to discuss many issues but the big question people are asking is what the strategy is to get us out of this crisis.  We are now in a six-week lockdown, which could possibly go on longer.  What happens when we come out of lockdown?  Do we open up for a few weeks and then is it the case that in January or February we go back into level 4 or level 5 restrictions?  Are we on a wheel of constant lockdowns which are then lifted and the period between the lockdowns and their lifting shortens as opposed to lengthens?  That concerns people.  They want to know what the plan is and what we can do to get out of this cycle.</p> <p> I speak as a member of the Opposition.  There is a personal responsibility on each and every one of us.  When I make asks of the Government and when I criticise it for what I see as lapses in its duty of care or failures in policy, I also accept that each and every one us has a responsibility to play our part in reducing the spread of the virus.  Each and every one of us has to look to ourselves and check and recheck that we are doing all of the basic things that are required of us.  That includes handwashing, the cough etiquette and wearing a mask.  I encourage people as best I can to do all of that and to abide by those guidelines.  Equally, when we are asked to keep socially distant, to limit our interactions with people and keep our social contacts to a minimum, I also accept that has to be done and we have to abide by all of the advice.  I am under no illusions whatever that a big part of this State's and this island's ability to wrestle back control of the virus rests on us as individuals, but it also rests on the Government and Government agencies have a part to play.</p> <p> In recent weeks, a number of parties in this House, including my party, voiced criticism of the Government.  Sometimes when the Government is criticised, its reaction is that it is always Sinn F&eacute;in.  It blames Sinn F&eacute;in and talks about my party as if we are the only ones who are pointing out the Government's problems.  We have an obligation to hold the Government to account, but we are not alone in pointing out the failure in the testing and tracing system.  We do not do it just because we want to attack the Government, nor do we do it because we are trying to undermine the work people in the various areas are doing.  We point out failures that are fairly evident, that are factual and that are coming to us from people who work within the system.  In recent months, we got calls from very senior people in the system, but also from testers and tracers who told us that there were not enough staff and that there was not sufficient capacity in the system.  Teachta O'Reilly informed us again today of more problems with a lack of staff in one of the testing facilities over the weekend.  These are very serious issues, yet time and again, not only have our calls to the Government to act and to put the capacity in place fallen on deaf ears, but we have got pushback and been told that we are playing politics and not being honest about the extent of the problems.  We are.  The problems were real and the Government failed to use the summer months to invest in testing and tracing.  That was a mistake and it has cost us.</p> <p> We also said that we have to watch what is happening in nursing homes.  We cannot prevent the virus going into every single institutional setting and of course when the virus spreads there is the possibility that it can go into nursing homes.  It is a concern when in one nursing home, for example, almost all of the residents and staff have contracted the virus.  There have been many more outbreaks in recent weeks because the older people who live in nursing homes are vulnerable and are most susceptible to contracting the virus.  We must do everything we possibly can to ensure these people are kept safe.  There were reports from one nursing home that the support that was sought did not come in time.  Again, that information is not coming from the Opposition but from the people who work in the home.  This is another failure on top of the failures we had in nursing homes in the past.  This is another area that we have to get right.</p> <p> I am not one who says that we can get to zero Covid.  Others in the House have different views on that.  However, from the get-go, everybody with an ounce of sense knew that if we want to get as close as possible to zero Covid, we should aim to reduce it to the lowest rate we possibly can.  That is a laudable objective.  To do that, one has to get it right at the airports yet, as we speak today, we still have no testing at airports.  That is despite all of the promises, commitments and talk.  Again, that is not the Opposition's fault but the Government's fault.</p> <p> Before he left, the Minister for Health spoke about hospital capacity, specifically ICU capacity, although he did not mention inpatient beds and acute beds, which are also important.  Many of the beds that were promised were not delivered or were doubly counted, as sometimes happens during the spin that goes with budgets.  The Minister is correct when he says we cannot magic up ICU beds and that they require specialist staff to make sure they are operational.  That is all the more reason he should have heeded the call from Sinn F&eacute;in and others in opposition and, more importantly, from those on the front line in hospitals &ndash; consultants and managers &ndash; who said as far back as May, June and July that we should plan to put in the capacity then because it takes time.  However, that did not happen.  That is the wasted summer and wasted opportunity that we talk about.  Had the Government heeded the advice, those ICU beds would have been in place when the second surge came, which is right now, and we would be in a much better position.  It is not that we want people to be in ICU because obviously the plan is to bring the numbers down.  The issue was to have capacity so that if and when a second wave came, our hospitals would be able to withstand it as best they could, but that capacity was not put in place.  Again, that was not the fault of the Opposition.</p> <p> When the Minister referred to ICU beds, he left out acute beds.  Every time he talks about additional beds, it is in the context of opening up beds in existing hospital wards in existing hospital infrastructure.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, comes from the same constituency as me.  I spoke to the hospital manager in University Hospital Waterford last week about the 1,146 additional hospital beds that were promised by the Government.  I asked how many we could get in the hospital in Waterford.  She said none, because she does not have the physical space to open any more beds.  What we need are rapid-build modular units or more physical infrastructure.  Many hospitals in this State have old wards, what used to be called Nightingale wards, that are not fit for purpose and where the space is not available.  We talk about opening up beds and we provide funding to do that in current spending, but no money is provided for capital expenditure to expand physical infrastructure or even rapid modular builds.  We are not really being entirely honest about what is possible and what can be delivered.</p> <p> I use Waterford as an example because it is the regional hospital for the south east.  I also know from speaking to the hospital manager there that pressures in the hospitals in Tipperary, Kilkenny and Wexford, due to a lack of ICU and acute bed capacity, resulted in patients being referred in record numbers into University Hospital Waterford, which put pressure on it.  That is all the more reason the regional hospitals and the specialist hospitals have to get additional capacity but that did not happen.</p> <p> The overall response to the crisis is that it is like baking a cake.  There are lots of different ingredients, such as those I spoke about, for example, testing and tracing, doing more at airports, making sure we put capacity into hospitals and people taking personal responsibility, but the lack of an all-island approach is the one big missing piece of the jigsaw that we are not getting right.  As I said to the Minister, we have a memorandum of understanding between the North and South.  The Minister quite rightly put it back on my party when he said we are in the Executive in the North and we need to do more.  We have done everything possible within the Executive to argue with others for more all-island responses, but the memorandum of understanding that was signed was between the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister of Health in the North, Mr. Swann.  They need to make sure that what was signed up is delivered upon, strengthened and advanced because that has not happened.  We did not even deliver what was signed up to and agreed, never mind trying to strengthen it.  We have very little co-operation on testing and tracing and travel.  How in God's name are we going to have a response on an all-island basis that allows us to wrestle back control of the virus and get ahead of it if we do not operate on an all-island basis?  That is my point.  All of these things are important.  They are all of the ingredients.</p> <p>I hope that when the Minister looks back at the Official Report of this debate he will note the wonderful presentations made and he will act on some of the advice given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300040#OO00200"><p>The atmosphere has changed in recent weeks and months and there is a rising concern about the incidence of the pandemic.  It was clear there was a need for dedicated action, which is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  We also welcome the fact that the Government eventually listened to the point made by Sinn F&eacute;in and others for weeks about the pandemic unemployment payment and wage subsidy scheme.  We would like the Government to have gone further.  It was incredible these payments were cut in the first place and not restored in the budget.  It was clear these supports are necessary to ensure people are not put into penury or put to the pin of their collar because their work is gone.  That was and still is a reality facing people.  I urge the Government to address that.</p>  <p>  After announcements were made around restrictions, attention shifted to the sphere of education and schools.  It is a pity the Minister for Education and Skills is not here.  She may well have a good reason not to be here.  One of the requests for a debate, made by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats, was specifically on the implications of level 5 for education.  The picture is unclear.  Level 5 is subject to public health advice and significant clarity is needed.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the objective of schools being open in a safe and sustainable way.  We saw the damage done, despite everyone's best efforts, and the learning lost in the early part of this year.  We see the benefits of children being in school.  I see it with my own family.  It is vitally important schools remain open.  However, it must happen in a safe and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  While it is an objective we support, regrettably, there is a rising concern about how schools are able to function in this context which needs to be urgently addressed.  We raise those concerns not to create some calls for extended closures of the kind we do not want to see.  We want to see these concerns addressed.  We have raised them for weeks but many of them have not been addressed.  It is the same for staff, unions and parents.</p>  <p>  Schools have had enough significant issues and chaos to deal with over the past year without the fiasco of an email at 11.40 last night informing them that one of the 11 sanitiser products recommended is defective and that they should close their school if they cannot source an alternative.  Principals and school leaders had to decide late last night or early this morning whether to open their schools.  That simply is not good enough.  I do not know how this happened or how the Department of Education and Skills only found out and informed people at that stage.  I have heard many stories of parents and thousands of kids turning up to school this morning to discover the school gates were shut and schools closed for the day.  Many principals only learned of the issues this morning.  There are significant questions for the Department.</p>  <p>  We now know that the recall notice stated the products were due to be recalled by Tuesday.  Why did this break so late?  In a recent email, the Minister's private secretary informed a member of the public that all sanitiser providers were asked to provide product samples which were then assessed and evaluated by a team with the necessary technical competencies.  The product in question can apparently cause dermatitis, eye irritation, upper respiratory system irritation and headaches, as well as aggravating asthma.  I have been contacted by many parents concerned by this.  The product was supposed to be sampled and tested.  The Department said each of the sanitisers was sampled and tested.  How was this missed?  What kind of tests were happening that they did not pick up how damaging this hand sanitiser is?  It was being used in schools for children when it was not suitable.</p>  <p>  Deputy Lahart earlier said people were making too much of this issue.  It is not much to expect that when the Department recommends a product to schools it is safe to be used by children.  How did it only come to light now?  Did the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine not tell the Department of Education and Skills?  Has the Department of Education and Skills been sitting on this information for a few days?  We need to know who is responsible.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this is just one of a number of debacles in the Department of Education and Skills in recent months.  Six weeks ago, we sent the Minister a copy of our policy document, Keeping Schools Open, in which we set out the issues which had to be addressed in order to ensure that schools could remain open safely and sustainably in the long run.  I regret many of these issues still remain.  One issue we identified was testing and tracing.  I am concerned about some of the reports I am receiving.  There is a concern, particularly among school staff and parents, that a different approach is being taken in this area.  Certainly the timelines are not adequate.  The approach being taken or the criteria being adopted when it comes to tracing in schools is not of the same standard as it is generally.  When the app tells teachers they have been with a close contact, it does not count and the teacher in question must go to the school principal.  In recent days, because the tracing system collapsed, they got a text message instead.  That has manifested in a number of other examples as well.  School staff have spoken to me about it and they are concerned.   It is not good enough.  I want to see confidence restored in the system.  We will do that with an adequate system of tracing and testing.  The Minister talked about a dedicated system of tracing and dedicated school teams.  She mentioned this briefly on the 1 o'clock news but we have heard nothing else about it.  What will these teams do?  What will their work involve?  To what criteria will they be working?</p>  <p>  If we are to have school specific teams, we need to have people involved who understand the dynamic involving schools because it is not as static as it was before, even with the pods and all the rest.  I want to see schools continue to stay open but we need to do an awful lot more to ensure they do.  One measure we must take is to ensure confidence in the system.  Getting tracing right and ensuring school staff and parents see that it is done properly, have confidence in it and know that they will be tested when they should is essential.</p>  <p>  We have done nothing in terms of space.  It just is not good enough.  Our school system was difficult to get back open because our system is underfunded, understaffed and overcrowded.  Nothing has been done to create additional space to ensure an ability to achieve social distancing.  That urgently needs to be addressed by the Minister if she wants to ensure full confidence in the school system and it stays open in a way that is safe and sustainable.</p></speech>

That is new for them and something to which they are not used.  It is not new in this jurisdiction, however, because elective surgery is cancelled all the time.</p>  <p>  Last year, University Hospital Limerick was in full capacity protocol for over 90% of the year.  When full capacity protocol is brought in, it means that elective surgeries are cancelled, people are placed on trolleys in corridors, emergency departments and in extra wards and there is aggressive discharge of patients.  This might be new for other jurisdictions but it is not new for us. In fact, that is how the Government runs the health service.  It is short-staffed, overcrowded and so forth.  As pointed out by NPHET, we all know the reasons it was necessary to go to level 5.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>It is because we do not have capacity within our health service.  The NVRL will be closed this weekend due to unavoidable staff shortages.  We have known for years that our hospitals are routinely overcrowded and the infection risk that poses.  We have known that since the last time Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  We represented nurses at the time.  The Minister and his party knows that.  It is still widely known but they do nothing about it.  Other countries are probably experiencing this for the first time.  In Ireland it is not news. </p> <p> The level 5 plans contain a great deal of emphasis on fining individuals for individual actions.  I see that the T&aacute;naiste has released one of his wee videos encouraging people to work from home.  Where are the sanctions for employers who do not let their staff work from home where they can?  One example can be found in an office not far from where we are now.  When the country went into lockdown in March, five laptops were ordered for the five senior managers, who then worked from home.  Other staff were advised to get on public transport and come into the office to work.  The Minister is very big on individual fines, individual responsibility and individual shaming, but there are no sanctions for that employer.  It is all very well to encourage people to work from home.  What are the sanctions for employers who do not allow it?</p></speech>

The health of our nation is paramount.  We have taken these measures out of necessity to protect the health of our citizens.  We are facing into the bank holiday weekend.  A couple of weeks ago, I suggested continuing with summer time this winter due to the scenario we find ourselves in.  Unfortunately winter time will begin this weekend.  That will have an impact.  The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Mary Butler, is doing a very good job in that area.  However, the evenings will soon get dark at 4.30 p.m.  That will bring its own significant challenges.  It would have been common sense to continue with summer time and enjoy a significant stretch of light in the evenings that much sooner in February and March.  That would have been of great benefit to mental health.</p>  <p>  I would like to make a couple of points about the restrictions and what needs to be done to make them fair.  First, I would like to discuss large retail outlets.  During the previous lockdown, large retail outlets were open to sell essential goods.  They operated their stores as normal, selling clothing, toys and other goods.  We are now entering the festive season, when toys are big sellers.  It is essential that retail outlets on the high streets of towns and cities throughout the country have a level playing field.  The regulations signed yesterday clearly state that large retail outlets can only be open for essential items.  That must be enforced.  I do not say this to be a spoilsport, but to ensure fairness.  If a shop on the high street that specialises in sports goods or toys cannot trade, it is only fair that large retail outlets are treated the same way.  The regulations are in place.  It is essential that they be enforced to ensure fair play.  When we hopefully emerge from these restrictions on 1 December, the lift in retail spending will benefit all retailers alike.  There will be pent-up demand and every retailer will benefit accordingly. </p>  <p>  The second point I want to make is about a sporting issue, namely, coursing.  It is a rural pastime that is hugely important in my part of the country.  The season is a very narrow window of only three and a half months.  Those who partake have now been told that coursing will be prohibited for six weeks of that season by Covid-19 restrictions.  I received numerous calls yesterday from people involved in the industry.  It is a leisure industry and does not involve significant money.  People do it for the love of the sport.  They cannot comprehend the fact that other sports, particularly greyhound racing, have been allowed to continue.  It is hard to understand why one activity involving greyhounds is allowed to continue while another, which takes place in the open air, is prohibited.  Like other Deputies, I lobbied intensively for a bit of common sense to prevail yesterday.  The regulations should be interpreted to allow various greyhound activities.  Unfortunately, that interpretation has not been adopted and coursing is to be halted for the next six weeks.  Last year, people had serious difficulties obtaining their licences for this sport.  Yesterday I was asked if practitioners should continue to breed dogs at all if obstacles will always be put in their way.  They feel they are being unfairly discriminated against.  They feel that their open air sport could have been treated similarly to horse racing and greyhound racing.  This restriction is going down very badly in rural Ireland.  Coursing is a minority sport, but it is hugely important for those involved in it. </p>  <p>  I have also received a large volume of calls about gyms.  Many people have signed petitions saying that gyms should be open.  These are not used by elite athletes by any means.  They are people who use the gym before going to work in the morning, or retired people who use it to maintain their physical well-being.  It has a huge effect on mental health.  Yesterday I received calls from two employers with significant numbers of young employees.  The vast majority of these workers go to the gym before coming to work two or three mornings each week.  One employer said his productivity would suffer.  People need this physical exercise, especially people of a certain age.  They will leave work in the dark.  They need the outlet that gyms offer.  Gyms were operating well under level 3 restrictions.  There have been no reports of Covid-19 clusters coming from them.  I appeal to the Government to consider what we have introduced and consider what can be safely amended.  Some of the restrictions should be altered to ensure that people out there will be able to feel good.  They are worried about the effect of the restrictions on their mental and physical well-being.  Some common sense would help to get public buy-in for the level 5 restrictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300041#PP00300"><p>Not everybody will agree with the Government's decision on Monday to move the country to level 5 restrictions.  However, not everybody was privy to the reasoning, methodology and science the CMO and NPHET used to support their call for a six-week period of level 5 restrictions.  Both the Government and society are better conditioned and prepared to meet the severe demands of level 5 than they were two weeks ago.</p> <p>There are differences between the current lockdown and the complete lockdown in March.  For example, it is a welcome change to have schools open.  Significant progress has been made with regard to children attending school.  Those attending college can take classes online.  Remote working is growing and becoming a welcome trend and reality.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that stricter enforcement measures are necessary to implement the various aspects of the restrictions.  It may be that if enforcement powers similar to those proposed in the Bill had been in place for levels 2 and 3, there would have been greater success in curtailing the spread of the virus.  In a functioning democracy, one must have respect and regard for the authority vested in the Cabinet, the Government and the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>The financial provisions introduced in March, July and the budget and the provisions brought in last Monday can, should and, it is to be hoped, will be the sort of financial measures that assist workers, retailers, businesses and industry.  The &euro;20 billion investment by the State gives the economy an opportunity to survive.  It would have been regarded as unprecedented and even unimaginable by many people some months ago, but it has been a lifeline for our combined future and has the prospect of continuing to be such a lifeline.<br/><br/>The sense of solidarity earlier in the year and through the summer was commendable.  It made us all very proud and engendered a great sense of patriotism.  It has been a significant challenge to have gradually opened the economy but then have to re-enter a period of severe restriction.  The challenge is great, but its success is dependent on the buy-in of all in society.  Success is dependent on the right supports being provided for the economy, healthcare, education and other public services, but it is predominantly dependent on the buy-in of the public.  It is also dependent on the buy-in of public representatives.<br/><br/>The provision of definitions of essential retail and services by the Government on <i>gov.ie </i>is a genuine attempt to be appropriate and reasonable while seeking to stem the rise of cases and to reduce the R-number.  People need to study and appreciate those details and apply common sense to the provisions. The 5 km restriction, for example, is not a hard and fast rule.  There are acceptable deviations from it.  If people genuinely acknowledge, apply and live by the restrictions, we will have a chance of achieving the goals set out by the Government last week.<br/><br/>I expect that the promised review in four weeks' time will assess the progress that has been made.  If sufficient progress has been made, then surely the Government can look afresh at variations to the protocols that have governed many of the issues about which Members have spoken this week, such as in respect of gyms, marts, golf clubs, sports other than elite sports, retail outlets other than essential retail outlets, hair dressers, spa therapies, showjumping, coursing, tennis, music schools and other matters.  However, if people flout and show disregard for the guidelines and the spirit of the guidelines, we will be in trouble.<br/><br/>From speaking to other Deputies this week, I have garnered that there is genuine worry and trepidation.  To be brutally honest, compliance with levels 2 and 3 had waned.  Apathy and fatigue set in, which unfortunately created an opening that has been exploited by the virus.  I am worried by conversations I have had with constituents in recent days.  A draper in Tullamore rang me yesterday evening to highlight that larger stores were open because they stated they were selling workwear, for example.  Today, a shop in Portlaoise was displaying two rows of fluorescent jackets, but all the products behind those jackets were also available for purchase by the general public.  One must state clearly what is outlined in the legislation.  It states that only essential goods should be on display and not those goods that should not be made available.  Supermarkets have massively reduced the price of drink offerings, which indirectly encourages gatherings and parties.  I spoke to the chief executive of Shaws department stores today.  Its tagline through the years has been &quot;Shaws - almost nationwide&quot;.  It will be almost decimated if other parties flout the spirit of the law.  The company has 1,000 employees and invested &euro;100,000 in being Covid-ready.  It has respected the trust of its employees and committed to the restrictions in order to make progress.  The actions of certain other retailers are not in line with the spirit of restrictions.  Such action is unfair and it is breaking the law.  It will not get the R-rate down or bring the numbers in the right direction.<br/><br/>Whether people agree with the decisions made is irrelevant.  The Government, in conjunction with public health experts and advice, has made its decision, as is its duty.That decision will not be reversed.  Let us try to ensure it works.  If it does not, the review in four weeks' time will do nothing more than add another six weeks of pain and restriction, which would have a severe and detrimental impact on business and, of course, condemn Christmas to becoming another casualty of this terrible Covid pandemic.</p></speech>

Six weeks on, there have been two upward movements in levels and four Government scandals, but the funding is still not available.  The only response I have received to multiple parliamentary questions I have tabled on the funding shortage is that it will be announced shortly.  I have spoken to the Minister personally on this matter and I raised it in the House.  The funding for these groups that badly need it was announced six weeks ago, but there is still no sign of it.  How much longer must these groups wait?  Will they get their money before Christmas or afterwards?  Many of them have limited funding.  They are expected to make their services Covid-19 compliant and to get PPE in order to be able to continue to provide services.  The Minister of State announced that support would be made available, but where is it?  I ask the Minister to announce today, or next week at the latest, where the support is and when people will get it.  These groups badly need it.</p>  <p>   Last Monday, I contacted the Minister to seek clarification on whether addiction groups and services and recovery groups could meet under level 5.  The groups had serious issues during the first lockdown, which they got over.  We have since gone through levels 2 and 3 and are now in level 5.  The groups deal with people in recovery who need to meet in person.  These are essential services.  They are health meetings that people need.  Does the Minister realise the suffering those in addiction services or recovery services are going through?  Some people have asked me if the Minister is out of his depth or whether the issue is a lack of caring.  I care.  That is why I am standing here and again raising the issue of those in addiction services and recovery.  I will continue to do my best to highlight these issues.  I wish to work with the Minister on them because these people need support and clarity.</p>  <p>  Earlier today, I raised with the Minister for Health my serious concerns regarding tracking and tracing.  In early September, I attended a meeting with HSE officials for Cork and Kerry, at which I referred to their announcement to hire 60 staff for tracking and tracing.  I stated that I did not believe 60 staff would be enough.  Some 96 staff were originally redeployed to tracking and tracing for the area.  I could not understand how 60 new staff can replace 96 staff who must go back to their original jobs by 2 November.  Only 30 new staff have been taken on so far.  At the meeting, I outlined my concern that if a second wave was coming, more staff would be needed for tracking and tracing.</p> <p>I do not know if the work was done to plan for the second wave.  What were we doing over the summer to ensure that we had all the proper procedures, guidelines and supports in place when this second wave came?  Based on what happened at the weekend and based on what I went through with my own family, I do not believe it was done.  Many people suffered during the first lockdown and we had a chance to build capacity and bolster our health service.  Only two additional ICU beds were added in Cork since May.  We are talking about being prepared for the virus and the second wave.  How can the Minister stand over two additional ICU beds for Cork?</p> <p> There are serious concerns about Mount Cara residential nursing home in Cork city, a facility with a bed capacity of 25.  Serious issues led to it closing in January.  There is an attempt to privatise it.  I have written to the Minister, the Taoiseach, the board of management and the HSE.  No community-based residential care centre should be privatised or sold off.  Now is the time when we need to support communities.  I ask the Minister to step in and ensure that happens.</p></speech>

It is a pity that the Minister is not here for these comments.  I do not know if some excuse was given.  It is unfortunate because spokespersons want to raise a number of issues and it would have been good if we could have done that with the Minister.</p>  <p>  We have repeatedly rehearsed the reasons we find ourselves needing to go into level 5.  It is unforgivable in many ways that so many elements of what we were supposed to have been doing were not done properly.  The key element of the response to Covid is testing and tracing and we now see serious problems with both elements of that.  Given that that is the linchpin of the Government's response, it is very hard to understand how that has not been sorted out by now.  For various reasons certain things have not been delivered as promised.</p>  <p>  We now have no choice but to take radical action to try to drive down the levels of the virus.  That radical action is playing havoc with everybody's mental health, their well-being generally, their lives, their livelihoods and so many other things that we used to take for granted as normal life.  It is hard to support an approach like that which entails such severe lockdown.  It is doubly hard to do that while wondering why on earth we have got to this stage and why things could not have been dealt with as it had been promised they would be.</p>  <p>  About three weeks ago I raised with the Taoiseach the question of the clocks going back.  I suggested that he consider the possibility of us not changing the clocks and keeping with summer time.  That is not a straightforward thing, but on balance it would have had many benefits, not least an extra hour's light in the evening, which would have been really important from the point of view of people's well-being and also people working during the day having some opportunity to get out in daylight and so on.  Generally, it would have helped in a small way in lifting people's mood.  Since I raised it, there has been a very strong response from across the country.  Many people and particularly older people have asked why we cannot do that.  The case is all the stronger given that it looks like there will be a move at European level for us to change next year.  It would have been an opportunity to try that out.  It is not something drastic because we may well be doing it next year anyway.  This year in particular, given the major difficulties people are dealing with it is regrettable that it was not done.  I think we will rue the day that suggestion was ignored as we go into the coming weeks and as the evenings get progressively darker from Sunday on.  It is a pity that did not happen.</p>  <p>  It is very hard to understand why the issue that arose today with the sanitiser happened.  It is more difficult to understand, given that it came to light on Tuesday, that school principals were only told about it very late last night.  That resulted in some schools closing today because they could not get organised in time to find an alternative product.  I heard suggestion on the radio today that the same product, which is regarded as being dangerous, was not only used in schools but may have been supplied to other facilities including nursing homes.  It is important that we get clarification on that.  While I do not want to give it legs if there is not a basis for it, we need to find out if there is any basis for it.</p>  <p>  What is the HSE doing now?  The priority must be to get public health advice out to people.  I am sure many parents around the country are wondering if one or other symptom their child might have is related to that sanitising product.  For that reason, we need a public statement on that from a public health perspective.  We also need an assurance about the product having been withdrawn from all the places it was supplied to and also whether it is actually being sold anywhere.  Steps must be taken to withdraw it.  We are somewhat left in the dark on this.  There has been no further clarification since this story broke in the last 24 hours.</p>  <p>  The next issue I want to raise is rarely mentioned here.  I have not heard the Minister refer to ventilation.  Increasingly in taking steps to drive down the rate of the virus, the role of ventilation seems to be very significant.  I am not aware of any action having been taken in that respect or any minimum standards having been set down.  It comes up frequently.  Professor Orla Hegarty raises it frequently in terms of construction.  Other experts talk about it in the media.  Many machines are available, including some that have been developed in the past year, which filter air to a very high quality.  It is not clear if that message has been taken on board.  Has anything been done and have any standards been set over ventilation in nursing homes?  That needs to happen.  I would like to hear the view of the Minister for Health on that.</p>  <p>  I have a real fear that we will repeat the mistakes of earlier in the year in high-risk settings such as nursing homes and meat factories.  We had disasters in both earlier in the year, largely because both sectors have large numbers of poorly paid staff with poor conditions, in precarious employment without entitlement to sick leave.  It happened with disastrous consequences with people having symptoms of Covid or who thought they might have Covid, but they could not risk taking time off work because they could not afford to do that.  That greatly contributed to the spread of Covid in nursing homes with awful results and also in meat factories and the subsequent spread back into communities.  I cannot see that anything has happened to avoid a repeat of that disaster in both those sectors.  We will not be forgiven if history repeats itself in respect of those two issues.</p> <p>That is why regardless of any commitment to do something about a national scheme next year, there must be some kind of emergency provision at this point for workers in those two settings.  </p> <p> I refer to testing and the type of testing that is being done.  A point made regularly is that the PCR testing in Ireland seems to be done to a much higher level of sensitivity than is required or used elsewhere.  That has never been explained.  We often hear people with expertise in this area talk of how we use this higher standard, which picks up minute traces of the virus that may be a few months old and the person concerned is not contagious, yet we declare those people to be Covid-positive.  Last week, at one of the few briefings provided for the Opposition, I asked the CMO to send the papers to me.  I have not received them yet, and I hope he does send them on, but no clear explanation has been provided.  It is a very basic question and I would like the Minister to respond on it.</p> <p> A specific measure in level 5 is the reduction in the number of passengers allowed on buses to 25%.  It is causing major problems for people who have to go to work, as many must do, including emergency and essential workers.  They are being refused onto buses and are having great difficulty getting to work in the morning and returning home, sometimes waiting an hour or longer to get a bus.  If we are going to do this, additional buses must be provided to facilitate essential workers to go back and forth.  That is one way we can show them some bit of respect.</p></speech>

Many people are doing the right thing by washing their hands, wearing masks and reducing contacts while businesses have spent thousands of euro modifying their premises to protect their staff and customers.  They were all stunned when they realised that no matter how hard they tried, the virus had taken control and seems out of control.  We owe it to those good people and businesses to work very hard for the next six weeks to eliminate transmission of the virus before it is too late.  We have come to learn that we must find a way to live alongside this virus but we need to trust people if we are to protect jobs and the economy.  I want the Minister's assurance that communications will be clear over the next six weeks.  We cannot have the confusion we had in March when our offices were inundated with queries about how everything would operate.  I have received many queries from businesses already as to how they might operate in a completely different way this time.  There was confusion about who and what should open.  Hopefully, we are all working together at this stage and we are on the right road.</p>  <p>  I welcome that 2,500 garda&iacute; will be on duty at any one time to ensure compliance with the public health guidance.  People need reassurance that those who have always abided by the rules will be protected.  I have sought clarification on the ability of garda&iacute; to enter homes without a warrant, but that is not provided for in the by-laws.  </p>  <p>  None of us wants fines.  They are a last resort, but they are necessary.  I have spoken to families in recent weeks, and my mother is 85 years.  People in my family have bad underlying conditions, as do children some of my friends.  These measures were needed today.  None of us wanted it but we need to make sure that in six weeks, we can say to our constituents that they can have a nice Christmas that we could go to something like a normal life.  I voted for this today because I know that garda&iacute; will explain, engage and encourage before they issue fines.</p>  <p>  I am concerned that I have not seen evidence of hard plans outlining what this lockdown will serve.  Massive backlogs are becoming apparent in healthcare as a direct result of the same level of restrictions in spring.  We do not seem to have learned anything.  I am not sure that we have gotten on top of it.  I have heard fixing the health service in Ireland likened to fixing an airplane while it is flying.  From the outside, it looks like the plane is crashing and we are trying to fix it mid-air.  We have to tell the people why we are spending and what we are spending it on.  Although ours is one of the youngest populations in the OECD, we spend much more than average per person on health.  We should get more for our money, and we should come out of this lockdown only spending money where it is needed.  Despite spending millions of euro, we still do not seem to be getting it right.  Many people have contacted me who are waiting on hip replacements, cataracts and other smaller hospital procedures and who tell me that they cannot wait.  Even in level 5, we must ensure that these procedures, especially the urgent ones, should go ahead.  </p>  <p>  I am glad that disability and mental health services will continue under level 5 and that jobs have been protected in this sector but we must see an end to this soon.  We need to know that everything is okay especially in the vital weeks leading to Christmas.  We must ensure that we do all we can to protect the potential earnings for business at that time and people's lives. </p>  <p>  At a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response a month ago, I asked if the HSE was hiring contact tracers, as announced, and was told they were.  Constituents told me they had tried to apply but they were told the jobs were being staffed internally.  I have asked about this and since been told that the posts were being filled externally.  We must ensure that people who have come home to answer Ireland's call, including the great front-line workers such as doctors and nurses, are hired.  There is also a language barrier.  It is important we give them the jobs when they apply.</p>  <p>  This week we learned that the contract tracing staff in place were overwhelmed and exhausted.  They are doing their best but the system is under-resourced and understaffed.  If people do not go back to work, there will not be a functioning economy, health service or Civil Service.  We need to get back to work while this virus lives with us.  To do so, we need tracing teams in place.  Earlier this week, I raised an issue regarding a local school, which was told not to alert families of pupils about a case as it would cause panic.  Had they not gone against this advice, there could have been a major outbreak in a small county such as Carlow.  Panic is exactly what we need to do.    </p>  <p>  There were reports of lockdown eve parties online and queues outside shops.  Towns around the country were packed.  People might be more inclined not to do this if they knew that this type of interaction might expose them.  If cases in our communities are being withheld because of lack of resources in our contact tracing, it seems we have not being able to keep up with the virus.</p> <p>My fear is that the six-week lockdown will extend far into December and the new year.  The business owners making plans for the next six weeks will struggle to cope if the lockdown is extended.  We would be facing into the prospect of a very serious recession and having to deal with a lot of health problems in the population.  We need to tell the public that we are ramping up tracing, increasing hospital staffing levels and working with nurses and other medical professionals to provide the service that is required.  People need to hear some good news.  We have all gone through so much and we are all worried about our families and the people with whom we work.  We are all worried that the lockdown will not work but it is our job to deliver for the people of this country.  One way to do so would be to ensure there are more voices from different sectors in NPHET, which would help to give a more rounded approach.<br/><br/>I met the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, earlier this week.  Her departmental team is dedicated to keeping our schools open.  To that end, she is setting up a direct schools team, with the assistance of HSE and public health personnel, to assist schools to stay open and to tackle the virus should it enter a school.  This initiative will protect teachers, students, other school staff and parents.  My understanding is that the plan will be rolled out after the Hallowe'en break.  This is the type of aggressive action we need.  I spoke to a parent yesterday who told me that her child takes food into school for a classmate who is very vulnerable.  What happens to a child like that when the schools are closed?  We need to protect and nurture such children and provide a safe place for them.  Our schools are currently the safest place for children as we continue to fight the virus in our communities.  I appeal to colleagues to do all they can to stamp out the virus and stop it spreading in the community.<br/><br/>Will the lockdown be reviewed after four weeks?  Will there be a reassessment of the restrictions for counties that have reduced their rates of infection?  Will we allow certain sectors to reopen?  In other words, is there a short pass out of level 5 if the rates decrease in some areas and sectors?  People need that type of guidance.  What considerations will be factored in if there is a review after four weeks?  What is being done to ensure that businesses can reopen and everybody can get back to normality as soon as possible?  Now more than ever, we need clear communication on these issues.  Indeed, the greatest part of my conversation with the Minister today was taken up with the communication aspect.<br/><br/>The other issue I wish to raise is one that is relevant to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Last night, the D&aacute;il passed the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020, which seeks to preserve information and records in order that they may be used to support future information and tracing services.  This morning, my office has been bombarded with telephone calls about my support for the Bill.  I have never experienced anything like the abuse I am getting on Facebook.  Councillors in my area did not bother to come to me to ask what exactly I voted for last night.  To be clear, I voted to preserve information.  I did not vote to lock away information for 30 years.  There has been talk from different parties that the effect of the Bill will be to lock away information in such a way that people will not be able to access it.  That is not what I voted for.  I voted to ensure the information will be there and will eventually be accessible to people for tracing.  I voted to make sure people can  access records that could have been destroyed.<br/><br/>I read today in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>that the Data Protection Commissioner believes there are problems with the Bill.  Another reason we voted for the Bill was to protect the privacy, under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, of people who gave information to the commission in the past, before I became a Deputy.  We need clarity in this matter and an end to the confusion.  If there is a problem with the Bill, I am asking the Minister of State to stop its progress through the Seanad today, where the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Gorman, is dealing with it.  I have been contacted by a large number of people who are very upset.  I am upset for them.  We must look after the families who have had a horrific time over the years.  The Government must be there to protect them, not to lock away information that should never have been locked away.<br/><br/>Can the progress of the Bill in the Seanad be halted in order to get clarification on this issue?  I know from speaking to my colleagues that none of us voted to lock information away for 30 years and make it inaccessible.  We voted to preserve information and ensure the records would not be destroyed.  I am pleading with the Minister of State to talk to the Minister.  If there are problems with the legality of the legislation, as reported today in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, we need to stop the whole process and ensure no information is locked away.  I did not vote for that and I will stand over my intention to preserve information and ensure it is not destroyed.  I cannot stress strongly enough how upset people are today.  The families in Carlow and Kilkenny to whom I have spoken, along with families throughout the country, cannot believe what is happening.</p></speech>

County Meath is in the eye of the Covid-19 storm, with a 14-day incidence number of 1,287, which is 660 cases per 100,000.  The people of my county have endured and suffered a great deal, none more so than Mary Bartley Meehan, whose husband, Ultan Meehan, and son, Adrian Bartley, both died during the pandemic.  I call on the Government to engage with and support Mary in her quest for information and truth.  The people of Meath are anxious but ready to play their part to get the numbers down.  The vast majority of people in the country are doing their best but the Government and its agencies have been failing in their responsibility to protect them.</p>  <p>  I have been getting a lot of telephone calls about delays in testing and - an issue that is just as significant - delays in notifications of positive test results.  We all heard what Dr. Cillian de Gascun of the National Virus Reference Laboratory had to say in this regard earlier today.  I have also been inundated by calls regarding delays in tracing.  The tracing process was already hugely delayed and then it stopped altogether.  There have been Covid outbreaks in schools in Meath and the experience of school management has been that they cannot access advice, support and information.  That is not good enough.  Instead of creating capacity and increasing resources to deal with the crisis, the Government's answer has been to divert resources.  This week, the school immunisation programme was suspended in County Meath.  It is simply not good enough.  The Government is robbing Peter to pay Paul instead of investing urgently to provide the resources that are needed.</p>  <p>  People working in a range of sectors are looking to the Government for help.  Business owners and workers throughout the country are crying out for support.  I understand that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be in the House later.  He must, in the first instance, address the situation of mart owners and the issues they have raised.  Deputy Cowen outlined those concerns earlier.  Travel agents need access to the Covid restrictions support scheme and not just at level 5, as do private bus operators.  I have been contacted by a number of essential workers whose work has dried up but who say they are being denied access to the pandemic unemployment payment because they are essential workers.  I have heard that from driving instructors, taxi drivers and others.  There must be progress to allow self-employed workers to stay on the PUP and earn up to &euro;480 per week.  The Government must deliver on its clear commitments in all these areas.</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to express my condolences to the families whose loved ones have passed away and to offer my support to the people in hospital who are struggling to get back to full health.  There has been much criticism of the Opposition from speakers on the Government benches.  There is not one person in this Chamber who does not want the measures to succeed and to ensure this is over as quickly as possible.  Everybody supports the public health guidance on hand-washing, physically distancing and wearing a mask.  That is what the vast majority of the people of this State want to do and are doing.  However, our job is to hold the Government to account.</p> <p>That is what I will do.  I have listened to hundreds of people in my constituency talking about the current guidelines over recent days.  They are confused.  We have had seven long months of this.  There was an opportunity over the summer, when the number of new cases daily was down to fewer than ten.  We knew there was going to be a flu season and that people would go back indoors because of winter.  There are now more than 1,000 people per day testing positive for Covid.  What did the Government not do?  It did not recruit the number of doctors and nurses required to deal with what was to come.  CPL, however, got millions to employ people on temporary zero-hour contracts.  I listened to nurses on the radio who had come home from Australia, New Zealand and Britain to work in our health service but who are still awaiting a permanent contract.  Contact tracing has also been mentioned time and again.  We still have not got a hold of this issue.  It is now out of control and the system is not working.</p> <p> Only today, I was contacted by a person who was talking about the bus system.  Capacity was reduced from 50% to 25% and the system is now in chaos.  Hundreds of people are unable to get to work or to school.  There was no plan in place for this reduction.  Several months ago, at the beginning of this crisis, 25% capacity was fine because the schools were not open and most businesses were closed.  That is no longer the case.  Children are in school and construction sites and other businesses which were not open in the initial stages are now open.  This needs to be dealt with now because we are losing the people.  We cannot afford to do so because more and more people will die.</p></speech>

I will speak to one particular issue.  My party colleagues have spoken about the measures introduced today.  We have supported the measures, although we do have reservations.</p>  <p>  I will speak in the main on the issue of hand sanitisers.  I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is due to make a statement to the House shortly, during this time slot.  I appreciate that the schedule could not be changed and that we cannot have a discussion back and forth on the issue.  I know the D&aacute;il schedule does not allow for that.  Perhaps the Minister of State might suggest to the Minister that a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be necessary next week, if one is not already scheduled.</p>  <p>  At 11 o'clock last night, schools were informed of an issue with a hand sanitising product that may have been in use in those schools.  Let us take a moment to consider how hard our school communities have been working for the last two months.  In fairness to the Government, schools would not have opened if it was not for the package presented at the end of July in order to facilitate the opening of schools but it also would not have happened if it was not for the work of everybody in every school community, from the boards of management down to principals, teachers, special needs assistants, secretaries, caretakers and school wardens.  All did their best.</p>  <p>  Students, the young people who have been getting such unfair criticism over recent months, have been the ones maintaining goodwill and doing their best to keep schools open.  They have been hit with issue after issue with regard to the leaving certificate and there are now issues with contact tracing.  There is contradictory advice from the HSE to various schools as to how to handle this situation.  They have had to reconfigure school buildings and have had to show goodwill in a system in which goodwill has been in short supply because of the issue of two-tier pay, the lack of basic employee rights for school secretaries and caretakers, the poor management of the redeployment of the special needs assistants, SNAs, and the other issues through which schools have been working over recent months.</p>  <p>  It now transpires that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had information about a defective hand sanitiser being used in schools on Tuesday.  Children went to school on Wednesday and Thursday while this knowledge was within the Department.  It was not until 11 o'clock last night that school principals were told that they needed to assess whether they could open in the morning.  From a Department that has been bouncing from crisis to crisis comes another source of unnecessary anxiety for a system in which anxiety is already heightened.  The Department knew on Tuesday that defective hand sanitiser was being used in schools throughout the State and did not pass this information on.</p>  <p>  The hand sanitiser that was made available is harmful to children and young people.  Some of the repercussions of using it on a prolonged basis are quite serious and include respiratory problems.  If the Department knew this on Tuesday and let children go to school on Wednesday and Thursday before deciding to tell people on Thursday evening, does this not again give the sense to the greater public and every school community that the Department of Education and Skills does not know what it is doing?  It is firefighting all of the time and is not in a position of control.  It is not demonstrating partnership and will just stumble from problem to problem.  I appreciate that the Minister will speak to the House but if it transpires that the Department - I am sorry, I am having difficulty concentrating because a conversation is going on to my left.</p></speech>

There needs to be some accountability for that.  We are all learning as we go and doing our best.  Schools are doing their absolute best to keep children safe and to remain open under very challenging circumstances.  I urge Government to be as open as it can and to find the facility for questions to be asked and answered on this matter.  If this is how the school system is to be managed, there will be heightened anxiety within the system and people will worry that children are not safe and that there is not a level of partnership between the Department and schools.  People will worry that we are again going to move from crisis to crisis.</p>  <p>  While I have time, I will address the Government on the wider issue of the measures that were passed today.  We cannot bring people with us without a level of leadership from the political system.  We cannot bring people with us if the message from Government is one of fines and Garda intervention.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>There is a small but, I fear, growing resentment organisation weaving different strands of extremist ideology, from anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant sentiment to anti-public service broadcasting sentiment, into these measures.  We need to watch that and to be very careful it does not use what will be passed in the D&aacute;il today and the Oireachtas as whole in the coming days as another weapon to try to get more soldiers to its flag.  There have been political elements within these Houses who have been far too willing to give sympathy to conspiracy theorists over recent years.  Examples are the anti-5G element and the promoters of the anti-vaccine view.  Certain Members in this House, who shall remain unnamed, were quite happy to align themselves with the conspiracy theorists until it became unpalatable for everybody to align with certain ex-journalists and their extremism.</p> <p>  As a country, we are facing a difficult winter.  As a society, we need to ensure the measures voted in today will not be used against any particular part of society, demographic or age group and that they will be a last resort.  Fundamentally, what we are trying to say to the people is that this is all about keeping all of us safe, and the best thing we can do is stay at home and stay safe.  We can suppress this virus and ensure that, when Christmas comes, we will not have an empty chair at the table.  On that, the Government has the Labour Party's full support as we continue to try to do what we can in the national interest.</p></speech>

On reflection, I should have put it to the House to agree it because other Deputies were waiting and had made decisions based on the debate moving quicker.  I apologise for this.  I have upset a Deputy but it was inadvertent.  The next time a Deputy misses a slot and wants to be fitted in, I will put it to the House for its agreement, or else the Deputy can go to the end of the list.  I will move on to Solidarity&ndash;People Before Profit.  Is Deputy Paul Murphy now taking the ten minutes?</p></speech>

He sends his apologises.  He had to go because of the change of the slots.</p><p>The Government's plan is called Living with Covid.  It would be better off renaming it the yo-yo strategy because that is the truth about what it offers to people with its plan.  It offers a future of yo-yoing in and out of lockdown until a vaccine is found.  It offers a year, two years or longer of going in and out of lockdown repeatedly.  That is what its strategy is, and it is an absolute nightmare for people.  The Government is going to come under sustained political pressure to give up that strategy and adopt an alternative, a zero-Covid strategy.  I argue for a zero-Covid strategy with socialist policies to ensure ordinary people do not pay the price for it.  I will outline later some aspects of such a strategy.</p><p>Blunder after blunder by the Government has put us into the current circumstances, whereby people are facing six weeks of lockdown and its impact.  The most recent blunder, for which the Government has gotten off lightly in this House, is the one made two and half weeks ago.  The decision made to ignore the public health advice was scandalous.  It is a decision whose consequence will be people dying; that is the unfortunate truth.  It is a decision with the consequence of more damage to the economy and further outbreaks in nursing homes.  In this regard, consider the difference between the figures when NPHET was first saying we needed to go to level 5 and that a graduated response would not work and the figures when the Government moved.  With regard to almost every single metric, the figures more than doubled, including the incidence rate per 100,000 members of the population and the number of outbreaks in nursing homes.  The number of cases in nursing homes now is far more than double that from the preceding two weeks.</p><p>The <i>Financial Times</i>has published a series of graphs in the past week.  All the evidence shows that if damage to the economy is to be limited, the virus needs to be dealt with and the number of cases needs to be reduced to zero, if possible.  Moreover, if there are cases, they need to be tracked and traced so the system will not be overwhelmed.  The impact of the Government's approach is to cause more damage to people's livelihoods, mental health and the economy generally.  That is the most recent blunder but there are others, such as in the summer, when the Government sped up the reopening of the economy under pressure from private-sector lobbyists and Fine Gael, including Deputy Varadkar, who was trying to look good before handing over to the current Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It was a huge mistake, a blunder of incredible proportions involving the turning of a blind eye to what was happening in the meat plants and not introducing sick pay.</p><p>It is so clear this week that the time was wasted.  Unfortunately, this is not the first wave of a pandemic this Government has faced.  This is the second wave but the time was wasted.  Plans were not made and resources were not put in place to ensure we could avoid a repetition.  This is so obvious where contact tracing is concerned.  When the virus gets out of control, with a very high incidence rate as a result of government decisions, the tracing infrastructure collapses.  What happened over the summer was that the number of people employed to do tracing was reduced.  We did not put the resources in place; instead, there was an attempt to employ people on zero-hour contracts, with no sick pay, as contact tracers.  When this was revealed by Deputy Boyd Barrett, whom I am sure would have spoken about it, it was regarded as a mistake all of a sudden and it was said that there was never meant to be a zero-hour contract.  This is incredible.</p><p>At the heart of a proper plan to deal with the coronavirus is a first-class mechanism for finding, testing, tracing, isolating and offering support.  When a second wave hits, it should not be the case that our tracing infrastructure is completely overwhelmed and people with coronavirus are left in a situation where they are meant to contact their own contacts.  It is completely unacceptable and demonstrates that the Government did not put the plans in place.  The Government responds by saying there were so many cases that it was inevitable that we would be overrun.  It is the same Government that chose to ignore the public health advice of NPHET over two weeks earlier, thus leading to the circumstances I have described, and did not put resources in place in terms of contact tracing. </p><p>The problem is that even when the tracing infrastructure is working at its best, it is still completely inadequate.  Based on the best examples around the world, there is a need to be able to trace backwards to find out where people got the disease and identify the super-spreader events, which are a big part of the spread of coronavirus.  When it is working at its best, the tracing mechanism in Ireland looks back only 48 hours from the point when a person's symptoms arise.  Therefore, we need far more investment in finding, tracing, testing, isolation and support mechanisms to ensure we do not have more disasters of the kind we saw this week.</p><p>Many people around the country are hearing the unfortunate news about the events in the nursing home in Galway yesterday and the one in Westmeath today, and they are wondering what nursing home they will hear about in the news tomorrow.  They fear a repetition of the horrific stories we heard a number of months ago, involving the majority of nursing home residents and staff contracting coronavirus and not getting adequate support.</p> <p>Why is it the case that the lessons were not learned?  Why were contingency plans not put in place to avoid this?  Why has the HSE been recruiting nurses from nursing homes to other areas of the health service?  Why is it that most agency workers still do not have access to sick pay, meaning that, understandably, in addition to the obvious reason that people will not go into a nursing home because of the coronavirus, they cannot afford to get sick either?  Why do we still have this patchwork of private for-profit nursing homes throughout the country?<br/><br/>I want to make a point on the argument for a zero-Covid strategy and an argument to avoid the recurring lockdowns that the Government offers us.  The Government has chosen, and the Taoiseach on Monday night chose, to misrepresent what zero Covid is.  He said it is about getting rid of Covid altogether and that it is completely utopian.  It is about eliminating community transmission, which is the transmission we cannot trace because we do not know where it came from.  There is a very good quote from Professor Susan Michie of University College London:</p><blockquote>	I could use the analogy of fires.  In Ireland ... there is a zero fire policy, which means we want no fires and we take every measure we can to ensure, as much as we can, that there are no fires.  However, we know fires will occasionally break out and  we have systems in place to jump on those fires quickly so they do not spread into the awful examples we saw in Australia last year arising from large forest fires.  That is what elimination and zero-Covid means. </blockquote> <p>To do this, we need to be able to quarantine and isolate people when they come into this island and we need to massively invest in our track, trace, isolate, support and find mechanism.  We also need to invest in our ICU and health capacity generally, in particular, public health.  We need to invest in building a national health service.  We need to incorporate, and not rent, the private hospitals, take them into public ownership and bring them into a national health service.  We also need to provide supports for people.  I thought it was striking during the week that the repressive powers are being extended until next year but the ban on evictions is being stopped on 13 December.  The Government needs to provide supports for people in terms of the pandemic unemployment payment, small businesses, evictions and a moratorium on mortgage payments to enable people to do what they want to do.</p></speech>

I also think it is important that we keep a broad understanding of where we are as a country in trying to resolve these issues and measure our approach to the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  It has to be pointed out that there is a second wave of Covid happening throughout Europe.  We are not unique in respect of this matter.  If we look throughout Europe, whether it is Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France or Spain, we can see that the number of positive tests of Covid-19 has been rising significantly in the eight weeks since the beginning of September.  It is also important to point out that if we were here a number of weeks ago, people would have been praising countries such as New Zealand and Australia but they would also have been mentioning Germany as a European example of a country that was doing particularly well.  However, we can see this is a virus that moves very quickly, and no matter what great measures a state has in place to ensure it is kept suppressed, it cannot be fully controlled.  This is what we see from what has happened in Germany in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  We also need to recognise that Ireland has to be realistic about what we can achieve in our response to the pandemic.  I listened to Deputy Paul Murphy speak about the elimination strategy, not necessarily getting the rate to zero but trying to eliminate the transmission of the disease.  My assessment is this is not feasible.  If we look at what we did in western Europe during this year, we can see it is most unlikely to occur.  Throughout Europe we had the first phase, which took place in March, April and May, and then in most of Europe we got the figures down very low in the summer months of June, July and August.  They rose again throughout Europe in the autumn months.  What it reveals to us is that this is an extremely contagious and infectious disease and no matter what efforts are put in place by the Government, it is extremely hard to control it.</p>  <p>  People now refer to what is happening in Australia and New Zealand as being examples of countries we need to follow.  It is instructive to note, however, that although New Zealand had significant successes, in recent days there have been cases of Covid there.  We need to have a broad perspective that this is a disease that will be with us and we will not be able to eliminate it, in the same way as we have not been able to eliminate other diseases such as the flu, even though we have a vaccine for it.</p>  <p>  It is always important when discussing how the country is coping with the virus that we do not concentrate exclusively on the cases.  As we know, significant numbers and percentages of people who test positive for Covid-19 are asymptomatic and are not in any way what could be described as sick.  Nonetheless, there is obviously an importance to knowing about these figures because these cases can transmit the virus. It is much more important to look at how many sick people there are in the country at present arising from the Covid pandemic.  To do this, we have to look at the number of people who have been hospitalised.  Today, the number of people in Ireland who are in hospital with Covid is 311.  Of these, 37 are in intensive care.  Let us look at where we were a week ago.  There were 244 people in hospital with Covid issues and 31 in intensive care last week.  Let us look at where we were two weeks ago.  There were 179 people in hospital with Covid-19 two weeks ago, of whom 31 were in intensive care.</p>  <p>  The reason I refer to this is that while it is very unfortunate that these people are in hospital, and I wish them a speedy recovery, we need to recognise that the rates of increase in hospitalisations and ICU admissions are different from what they were in the first wave.  Two weeks ago, there were 31 people in ICU with Covid, whereas today there are 37.  Let us go back to March and April when the disease was at its most dangerous until now.  The day we were told to stay at home was 27 March.  On that day, there were 380 people in hospital with Covid, of whom 68 were in intensive care.  The week after that, there were 704 people in hospital of whom 137 were in intensive care.  A week after that, on 11 April, there were 856 people in hospital, 155 of whom were in intensive care.</p>  <p>  What is apparent in this country and throughout Europe at present is that although the cases are significantly larger in number than they were in the first phase, the number being hospitalised and, more importantly and fortunately, the number of deaths is not at the same level as it was in the first phase.  Every death from Covid is a very traumatic event for any family member, and I pass on my condolences to anyone who has suffered a bereavement as a result of Covid, but when we look at where we were in April, 1,176 people died of or with Covid in that month.  To date in October, approximately 67 people have died of or with Covid.  We are dealing with a different strain and impact of the virus in this second wave than we were in the first wave.  There are more cases but the number of people being hospitalised, the number in ICU and the number of deaths are considerably lower.  This is a factor that has to be taken into account when we come to assessing what public policy measures we should put in place to respond to the virus.</p> <p> New restrictions came in at midnight on Wednesday when the country went to level 5.  That was a very difficult decision for the Government but it was a decision that was made by the Government.  I am a Government TD and I recognise it is a decision the Government deserves support on from its TDs.  It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that level 5 works but it is also important to point out that people in Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties are entitled to express their own views.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate, there is a danger in the fact that every party in the D&aacute;il seems to express the same policy in respect of the restrictions.  I support what the Government is doing but we must be very careful, as a political body, that we do not allow groupthink to enter into our deliberation.  We need to keep our horizons broad.  We need to consider whether this is the correct strategy and we need to probe strategies in this legislative assembly so that we can achieve what all of us want to achieve, which is the best outcome for the Irish public.</p> <p> My concern about the restrictions and going into a level 5 lockdown, which probably will reduce the numbers by 1 December, is that inevitably they will rise again and we could find ourselves going back into another lockdown in February.  That is not a sustainable solution.  It is not acceptable for the people of this country to be exposed to lockdowns every three or four months.  It is not consistent with what we are trying to do in this House.  What the Government and all of us are trying to achieve is that we can live with this virus which, unfortunately, will be with us for quite a period of time.</p> <p> The reason I am concerned about the impact of level 5 restrictions is that they have negative consequences.  The point about the virus is that we can see immediately the negative consequences that arise from it.  We see it in the approximately 1,800 deaths.  We see it in the hospitalisations.  We can see immediately the consequences of Covid-19 on the community and on people in nursing homes and care homes.  What we do not see at present, however, are the consequences of the restrictions.  They are something we need to consider because one of the functions of a politician is to try to see ahead so that the consequences of any decision we make can be assessed.</p> <p> As I mentioned previously, I am extremely concerned about the consequences the restrictions will have on the mental health of people in our society.  I am also extremely concerned about the consequences the restrictions are having upon the lives of young people.  I have mentioned that repeatedly in the D&aacute;il.  I mentioned it as far back as the beginning of May.  In effect, we cannot ignore that the education, employment, entertainment, travel and relationships of young people have all been affected.  That is not to say restrictions should not be in place but they are certainly factors that should be taken into account.  There are people who have started their university experience.  Their university experience is that they are sitting at home looking at lectures online on their laptops.  </p> <p> With regard to employment, youth unemployment in this country is now at 37%.  We need to recognise that a significant number of the people who lost their jobs from Thursday morning were young, low-paid workers.  I do not believe we can sustainably continue in the long term with repeated policies that are damaging to the lives of young people.  That is something we have to factor into our deliberations.</p> <p> There is also the economy.  When people talk about the economy they sometimes think we are balancing the economy against individuals' health.  I am not, and anyone who talks about the need to protect the economy is not either.  The important reason we need a functioning economy is that we can pay for a health service and ensure all the other vital services are provided.</p> <p> We need to consider the repercussions the restrictions are having that may not be evident today but will become evident into the future.  What we must do, however, is ensure that we protect the vulnerable and the elderly who are the people who have suffered the most as a result of this pandemic.  In particular, we have to ensure our nursing homes, care homes and the elderly in our community are protected.  Irrespective of whether we are at level 2, 5 or 25, we have to try to do that because there is no point in saying we have gone to level 5 so that means the elderly are protected.  They will not be protected.  We need to ensure that care homes and nursing homes across the country are fully protected and we need to put in place a protocol to ensure the elderly people in them are so protected.  The reality, however, is that we will never be able to fully protect people from this dangerous virus.  No country in the world has been able to do it and I do not believe we should place unrealistic goals before us when we know they cannot be achieved.</p> <p> Political controversy has arisen because of the dichotomy and divergence between NPHET and the Government.  In fairness to the people in NPHET, it is important that we emphasise that it is a body of advisers.  They are civil servants within the Department of Health and the HSE who provide advice to the Government, and in particular to the Minister for Health, on the issues pertaining to Covid-19.  They are also responsible for co-ordinating our response to Covid.  It is wrong, however, to allow NPHET to be presented in the political realm as the decision making body.  It is not.  The Government is the decision making body.  It is a group of advisers.  We need to recognise that and the public needs to be informed of that because if we do not do that resentment will grow among the public against NPHET, which is an unaccountable body.  We need to see more of the Minister for Health, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is in the Chamber.  They need to be leading it.  The politicians need to lead the public face of this because it is politicians who are accountable and they can be removed by the public if we fail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1555" speakername="Chris Andrews" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300049#XX00200"><p>I want to put on the record that the decision last night by the Government to seal the records of the survivors of the mother and baby homes was both sad and shameful.  It will go down as one of the most uncaring acts by this Government in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  History will not look kindly on this Government.</p>  <p>  With regard to Covid-19, reducing teaching staff while increasing class sizes to more than 30 students is not only a disgraceful move by the Department of Education it is also reckless.  The reduction of the four first class groups to three in St. Louis Infant School, in Rathmines, will see the pupil-teacher ratio hit 32:1.  A pupil-teacher ratio of that size is unacceptable in the middle of a pandemic.  The Government gave a commitment in its programme for Government to reduce class sizes, not drive them up higher.  Aside from the negative effects of such a ratio during normal times, to increase those classes to more than 30 students during the pandemic and a level 5 lockdown is a reckless move by the Department of Education.  Rathmines has one of the highest 14-day Covid-19 incidence rates in Dublin.  St. Louis Infant School appealed this decision but the board of appeal ruled against it.  In the ruling it cited that the board could consider only criteria which were drawn up pre-Covid, therefore, none of the real concerns relating to the increase in class sizes during the pandemic could be considered.  We are not living in normal times.  The board of appeal must be able to take into account this pandemic and the impact its decisions may have on the health and well-being of those children, their teachers and their families.  The Minister must reverse this decision and bring common-sense to the situation.  She must prevent the pupil-teacher ration rising during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  When the level changes from 3 to 4 or down to 2, there will be confusion about who can play sport and the facilities and shops that can remain open.  However, we have a situation where off-licences can remain open but gyms must close.  Why are off-licences deemed to be more essential than gyms or playing golf?  The closure of gyms is confusing.  For the past 40 years, the first thing one sees when one walks into a gym is a bottle of disinfectant and the blue paper for customers to wipe down the machines they have used.</p> <p>Sweating is not a new concept in gyms.  They are designed to operate safely in these conditions.  Under health and safety guidelines, a treadmill must have a minimum of 1.5 m of space behind it in case someone falls off, so social distancing is built in.  Gyms are designed for social distancing and gym etiquette revolves around good hygiene.  Gyms have done everything that has been asked of them.  Every gym I have encountered has introduced extra cleaning, more distance between machines and has done anything else that has been asked of it.  Gyms are so important to our physical and mental health, yet they have to close.  Mental health services are stretched to the limit so gyms and sport are more important than ever in the personal battle against anxiety and depression.</p> <p> The make-up of the return to sport expert group is much too narrow.  This group has representatives from the GAA, soccer and rugby, which is right and proper, and beyond that there are three members from the Department responsible for sport and five from Sport Ireland.  Where is the diversity?  Where is the voice on that group for tennis, hockey, golf, athletics and swimming?  The basis for decisions should not be a secret.  We need transparency and clarity on gyms and that is not forthcoming.  Why can the Government not sit down, produce a clear and concise rationale for the closure of gyms and sports like golf and tennis and explain it to the public?  We deserve to know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300050#YY00200"><p>I spoke on 14 May last about contact tracing and said at that time that the HSE was playing with figures.  I said the system was not working and that members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann were being fed &quot;organic fertiliser&quot;, that is, manure, about what was going on with contact tracing.  I went on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	The Government cannot ask people to continue to make such efforts if the truth about the consistent delays in contact tracing and informing people of their results are being hidden from them. </blockquote>  <p>I also said, &quot;we cannot allow, under any circumstance, a second wave of infection&quot;.  I had no great premonition about what was going to happen but I was looking at the facts as they were being presented to me.  I was absolutely speechless when I heard that the HSE has now abandoned its contact tracing system and told people via text message to do their own contact tracing.  We are asking older people to click on links they receive in a text message, to download information from a website and to make contact with their close contacts.  We are asking people whose mother tongue is not English to do the same.  We are asking it of young people, who by their nature are going to have to restrict what they can do significantly if they must take the time to tell their contacts they have been confirmed positive for Covid-19.  It is absolutely ludicrous for those three categories and yet the Minister came into the House earlier and defended that decision.  This should not come as a surprise to anyone.</p><p>Over the last month, I have raised the same issue with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, the chief executive of the HSE, the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Defence.  That is a third of the Cabinet.  I refer to the scandal whereby existing front-line therapy staff, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists were involved in contact tracing for the last seven months instead of interfacing with young people who desperately need those services.  I ask the Aire St&aacute;it to address that specific issue when she is responding because it affects her constituents and mine, including 1,000 children across Roscommon and Galway.  Surely having these therapists doing contact tracing should have set off warning bells across the Cabinet because there was obviously something fundamentally wrong there.</p><p>I put a very simple proposal to the Government, which was that current or retired Defence Forces personnel would take over the role of contact tracing.  Some 623 former members of the Defence Forces sought to re-enlist to help out during the pandemic and were not taken on board by the Defence Forces for various reasons.  They are ideally suited to carry out contact tracing but not one of them was contacted about it.  Deputy Berry and I brought an amendment forward on 26 March to ensure the reserve members of the Defence Forces could be used to support the contact tracing efforts.  They have not been used.</p><p>Yesterday, I got a phone call from a very senior health professional who had been stopped at a Garda checkpoint and asked where he was going.  He was travelling to work.  There were 14 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on that particular checkpoint.  He made the point that that will have absolutely no impact on the spread of this virus, but the skills members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have would be very useful in dealing with the contact tracing backlog.  It would have been far more useful if they had spent their shift doing the contact tracing for those older people, young people and those whose mother tongue is not English, rather than standing on the side of the road asking people where they were going.</p><p>I ask the Aire St&aacute;it to come back to me on this next matter as well.  Last June, I wrote to the Minister for Health, the chief executive of the HSE and the Secretary General of the Department of Health pointing out the desperate situation in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, where 10% of the beds were lost because of Covid-19.  The hospital was very proactive.  It put forward two very specific proposals seeking two modular buildings.  One would be for an accident and emergency department so it could segregate Covid and non-Covid patients, and the second modular unit would separate the outpatient department from the main hospital, which makes logical sense.  It could then convert the old outpatient department into single isolated beds to replace the capacity lost to Covid-19.  We still have no indication as to when those facilities will be put in place as we head into the second wave.  We are trying to manage a situation in the busiest hospital across the midlands that has 10% less capacity than this time last year and which had many hundreds of patients on hospital trolleys throughout last winter.  I hope the Minister of State can respond to that issue.</p><p>While we are on the subject of the Minister of State's and my patch, on Wednesday the Taoiseach told us that we had learned from the first phase of the pandemic as regards nursing homes.  We have learned very little, given what went on in my constituency yesterday.  I know this nursing home well, in fact my late grandmother was a resident, and it has provided an exceptional level of care in that community.</p> <p>Yesterday, I pointed out to the T&aacute;naiste that while I wanted the issue relating to that nursing home to be addressed, I did not want it to be repeated in any other nursing home in the country, regardless of where it was.  A panel needed to be put in place that could deal with the situation instantly when a problem arose.  Speaking later, I suggested that we should have a crack squad within our Defence Forces, of medical professionals, cooks and cleaners, that could step in immediately in such circumstances.  The difficulty with this nursing home was that 90% of the staff were told on Tuesday evening that they had to isolate for the next 14 days and there were three staff left to run that nursing home the following morning.  We needed staff immediately.  There was always going to be a challenge with getting agency staff at such short notice.  People were not going to rush into a situation such as that.</p> <p> In this instance, within 30 minutes of that nursing home having issues, there are more than 800 Permanent Defence Force personnel who would be quite willing to provide that service on a short-term basis and they should have been put in place until other medical staffing was put in place.  I was subsequently informed by a senior health official and a member of the Government that such a plan is in place and there is a cohort of Defence Forces personnel who can do that, but the Defence Forces have not been asked to establish that crack squad that could go into nursing homes.  They had not been asked to do contact tracing as I had requested.  The Reserve Defence Forces have not been called up.  Why is that the case?  The only conclusion that I can come to is that we have senior staff in our health sector who are involved in a face-saving exercise.</p> <p> We need to remember that the Department of Health has a bigger budget than NASA in the United States.  NASA can put a man on the moon and we cannot put two nursing staff into a nursing home in the west of Ireland.  We cannot put a system in place so that we can contact people who are positive for Covid-19, find out who their contacts are and make contact with them.  This state of the art app that we launched, with significant fanfare, is redundant, because unless the phone call is made to the individual and the pin code from the contact tracing team is given, that app is of no use.  We spent hundreds of thousands of euro and had a substantial marketing budget.  All of us here and a huge proportion of the population downloaded the app which is now worthless because we cannot get the phone call to get the pin code to release those numbers.  The frustrating thing about it is that the most basic requirement of a public health official in this country is to be able to conduct contact tracing.  It is their bread and butter.  Vaccinations and so on are supplemental to that.  That is the one thing that they are all trained to do and our public health management and officials cannot do it seven months after the initial surge.  It is unacceptable that that is the case.</p> <p> I have in my possession an email from a nurse who was so frustrated about the reports in the media last night regarding our local nursing home.  She is registered with Ireland On Call.  She has worked in nursing homes over the last months during the pandemic and has not been called to do this work.  The staff are clearly there but we are not connecting the dots.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300051#ZZ00200"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this issue again.  I sometimes get confused.  Listening to the debate in this House and in other countries that have been similarly affected, one can come to a different conclusion.  For instance, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden have all been held up as examples of how to deal successfully with this virus.  We in public life, certainly on the Government side, were advised, by the Opposition more often than not, to copy that and that we would then be okay.  The answer was that that was wrong.  They all had their problems.  The difference in those countries was that the Government was not blamed.  Efforts were made to try to correct, identify and meet the virus head-on.  Let us not forget that they had more than one attempt and they are still fighting hard to hold their position in order to hold up the virus.</p>  <p>  The virus is a bit like a forest fire.  It has started and it has spread.  Several mini-fires have spread now.  I did not hear anybody speak in the House in the last two days to identify any signs that they saw what might have contributed to this recurrence and resurgence of the virus.  Maybe my constituency is different.  We had a second lockdown ourselves some time ago.  It had the effect of slowing, but not preventing, the virus.  Let us not forget that it did not prevent the virus from recurring.  It was always pointed out that as the economy recovered, there would be more outbreaks of the virus, for obvious reasons.  Of course we would all aspire to have air travel restored.  It is part of business.  I do not know how possible that is, or whether it is possible at all.  I do not know how the isolation of people for ten or 14 days after air travel will work.</p>  <p>  I want to address the comparison with New Zealand.  It is chalk and cheese, or apples and oranges.  There is no comparison to be made with a country with vast areas with very little population and little air travel compared to our situation.  We live in a country with a capital city with an airport with the second highest level of activity in the world.  That is a stark statement.</p>  <p>  The telephone calls that I have received are from businesses, mostly small businesses and small shops, which have observed the letter and the spirit of what they were supposed to do in the course of the restrictions.  They have pointed out numerous instances in their own localities where observance of the restrictions did not take place to the same extent.  That is where the unfairness arises and where people begin to get cynical.  In the past month, I have received, as have many Members, telephone calls about widespread disregard for wearing of masks and social distancing.  A 1 m distance was not being observed, never mind 2 m.  There was a lack of hand hygiene and use of disinfectants and so on.  There has been much talk about tracing and testing.  I can predict one thing.  We can have all the tracing and testing that we want from here on, but if there is not serious observance of the regulations, it will all be to no avail.</p>  <p>  What has happened is that the outbreaks throughout the country have started to converge on each other.  When that happens, the tracing system will be overwhelmed.  For those who think otherwise, let us wait and see.  It is not possible to reverse the virus simply with tracing when there are numerous outbreaks around the country and they start to converge on each other.</p>  <p>  It is all very fine to blame the Government.  In this country, there is a tradition of that and that is maybe the way that we are.  One Member tonight spoke at length about employment and the need to shut down various employment-providing ventures throughout the country.</p> <p>Everything could be shut down unless there is strict observance of social distancing, social interaction and the degree to which ordinary members of the public, ourselves included, converge on each other's space and, as a result, create the conduit that allows the virus to continue.  We can talk about it forever.  I can blame the Opposition, the Opposition can blame the Government and there can be protest marches and many other things, but we must get one thing straight - the virus requires contact.  It needs people not to observe the regulations, the hand hygiene and the social distancing and to converge in congregation with each other.  That is what the virus needs, and that is why there has been such a sharp resurgence.  There was a modest drop in the numbers reported this evening.  Hopefully, that will continue, but it may or may not.</p> <p> NPHET has been referred to as unnecessary, comprising civil servants and so forth.  They are experts in their fields.  They can work out, and have worked out, mathematically exactly what will happen, and when and how it will happen.  It can do so again.  We all know the members.  They excel in their respective fields, so we can ignore them as well and blame it on the Government.  We can ignore what NPHET has to say, but it repeatedly comes back to the same question: how do we encourage most of the people to observe the regulations?  The theme is that we will go back to where we were.  We will draw a deep breath, hold it for some time and we will return to a situation where everything is all right.  It will not be that way.  It could be months, a year or more.  We will have to observe the distancing regulations to a far greater extent than we have heretofore.  We must try to restore our economy to some extent at the same time.  It is going to be a difficult task.  It is a difficult call, but it is a matter for ourselves.  We can then blame whom we like if it does not work, but it will work if the distancing regulations are observed.  There is no doubt about that.</p> <p> I have listened to various sides of the argument in the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, the Joint Committee on Health and during debates in the House.  We have to recognise the cause of the spread of the virus, the conduit.  That conduit is the degree to which people have converged and mixed together.  That brings me to the telephone calls.  People have rung me at all times of the day and night to ask why hordes of people are converging in certain areas, with nobody wearing a mask or observing social distance.  We then ask how we get isolated outbreaks at various locations in the country.  They were all identified and found.  It was possible to find out where they started.  However, it came back to the same thing again - people congregating.  It may well have been for a good cause, but that does not matter.  When people are brought together, all that is required is one person in the group to be the carrier.  We know the story about one person who infected 54 other people.  It need not have stopped at that.  It could be more, even 500 people.  We still seem to continue to point the finger at other issues.  They are not as relevant as they appear, but they offer the opportunity to blame the Government.  That is an easy option.</p> <p> I am not suggesting that the Government does not have responsibility.  It does, and I expect it to take its responsibility seriously.  I believe it is doing so.  It is responding to the threat as it arises.  However, it does not matter how seriously the Government does its job, if the general public does not come with it.  It has been suggested that the public has lost faith and does not trust the Government.  I heard that argument put forward in the House today.  Oscar Wilde famously said, "Duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself."  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recognise that, given the part of the country from which she comes.  The fact is that everybody has a role to play, at whatever level it is.  We must play that role to the best of our ability and with one thing in common.  We do not have to shut down the country or turn the nation into an unemployment black spot if we do the simple things such as observance of social distancing.  There is no reason we cannot be six or seven feet apart and wear masks.  While we do not want to wear masks or to be seven feet apart, we can have a conversation of some type in that environment, albeit different from what it used to be.  We must remember that we are not going back to where we were in the short term.  At all times over the next year, and it might be longer than that, we must accept that we are under threat, and that we can only get respite when the vaccine is discovered or the virus is defeated.  I do not believe it will be defeated readily or quickly.</p> <p> My final point is that we should not add to confusion.  We should identify the issues.  They are simple to identify because they have been repeated many times.  Drawing up ancillary issues that are not intrinsic to the issue we must deal with is not helpful.  We all extend our sympathies to those whose lives were lost during this pandemic.  Sadly, there will be more.  I hope that during the current partial lockdown there is sufficient support among the people to trust and follow the simple advice for themselves.  If they do not interact, do not break the social distancing rules and observe hand hygiene and all the other things the experts advise them to do, they have the ability in their hands to defeat the virus regardless of what the Government or anybody else does.</p></speech>

We have been told the Minister will come to the House during this debate.  However, I am disappointed that he has left it to almost the last Government speaking slot, when there is no opportunity for Sinn F&eacute;in or other Opposition parties to respond.</p>  <p>  The questions that were put on the record still stand.  I hope the Minister will provide answers to those questions, particularly regarding what the Department knew, and when, about the product in question, when other members of the Government were informed and, crucially, why there was a gap of two days in the information being disseminated, considering the chaos it caused.  The final question I hope the Minister will answer in this regard is who will be held accountable for this.  There have been too many debacles and messes throughout this crisis to have another in which it appears that nobody is held responsible.  We only became aware of this issue due to EU counterparts informing the Department.  Questions must be asked as to why we do not have the procedures in place to ensure that the products our children are using are safe.</p>  <p>  The Minister must also address the many concerns that have been raised about the situation in marts.  The Government decided at the onset of this pandemic, and rightly so, that food production would remain an essential service and area of work that would continue.  We have seen that in some areas.  The meat factories have continued operating.  Despite outbreaks in the factories, they have continued operating notwithstanding the issues that have arisen in respect of their treatment of workers or otherwise.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The only aspect of food production that has been shut down is the one where farmers themselves have control, namely, the marts.  We heard Fianna F&aacute;il representatives say this evening that the marts need to be open.  They are in government, so they should make sure that whatever safety measures and regulations that need to be put in place are put in place so that we can allow farmers to try to make a living during these times.</p> <p> We have all heard commendations for those who work in the health service.  A set of very important workers continues to give their all during the pandemic and they do not even get a pat on the back.  If anything, they get a kick in the backside.  They are our student nurses, who are expected to work as hard as anybody else in the health service and not receive remuneration for it.  From the very outset of this pandemic, Sinn F&eacute;in and in particular Deputy Louise O'Reilly, have been consistently raising this issue with the Government.  An answer needs to be found.  Many student nurses in normal times manage to keep themselves going through other part-time work but they cannot do that on this occasion because we are in the midst of a pandemic.  My appeal to the Government is to ensure that student nurses are remunerated adequately for the work they do.</p> <p> I am pleased to see the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, will respond to the debate on behalf of the Government.  I commend the Government on the financial package provided for disability services.  While it does not go as far as is required, I hope it is a statement of intent on the part of the Government to address the inadequacies in disability services.  It is in that vein that I want to ask again in this House about the group home for people with disabilities in Carrickmacross that has long been sought.  The families of those who will benefit from it have been campaigning for it since before 2006, if I recall correctly.  In late 2006 the HSE agreed that there was a need for this home.  It took another ten years for the home to be built and it was completed in 2016, but it has been lying idle ever since because the HSE has not released the funds.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, give an indication to the House this evening as to when the heartache of these families will come to an end and when the group home will be open?</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice and I are bringing proposals to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, who said he will consider them.  When we raised the matter with the Taoiseach, he said that there could be no special provisions for any interest group and that is what I really want to focus on in this contribution.</p>  <p>  Some of those who are involved in the training of various elite sporting activities are able to go about their work.  Those who are involved with Greyhound Racing Ireland in the training of greyhounds are able to go about their work.  I can understand the epidemiological advice.  Training greyhounds does not necessarily involve a huge amount of interaction with other people, and greyhounds are elite animals.  Likewise, Horse Racing Ireland personnel are able to go about their work and we have elite athletes on elite beasts when it comes to Horse Racing Ireland.  I respect that.  The two things that they have in common is that there is a huge interest in the gambling industry in both.  They are sports in which a lot of money is washing around.  There is another group I wish to mention, namely, Horse Sport Ireland.  It is not able to train at the moment.  They are also elite athletes on an elite beast.  I would like to see the epidemiological advice.  We are told that this is all about epidemiological advice that differentiates between Horse Racing Ireland where lots of money is washing around and Horse Sport Ireland, where a lot less money is washing around, but from an epidemiological perspective.  Surely this is all about epidemiology.  That is what the Government is constantly telling us.  Give me the advice that differentiates between the two, or else let Horse Sport Ireland go about its work.  While I have the greatest respect for people who train horses or greyhounds for racing, Ireland has never been represented in the Olympics by a greyhound.  There is a team that is trying to prepare for the Olympics.  The fact that we get to the Olympics with the meagre funding Ireland is able to provide for Horse Sport Ireland is a huge achievement.  The fact that it does it on a lot less money and that it does not attract the same interest of the gambling industry should not be something that hinders it.  We should give them their chance.  The Olympics have been put back for a year.  We should allow them to prepare for it.</p>  <p>  I will use the last ten seconds to hammer home one point I have consistently made, and which I and many Deputies from the west have constantly stressed, which is that the western seaboard has been disproportionately affected by the measures that were introduced by closing the aviation and tourism sectors.  Let us guess what the Central Bank talked about tonight.  It was the detrimental effect this is having especially on the western seaboard.  I ask the Government to address it please.</p></speech>

I ask him to respond to the questions about the marts.  Damage is being done to farmers and to those who want to sell from an economic point of view, but another angle is that it provides a physical outlet for people to go to.  Not everyone can attend the mart online because they are not adapted to that or because there is no broadband in many areas.  Several mart sites crashed yesterday and the price of cattle fell through the floor.</p>  <p>  The Minister might also tell me what is going on with coursing.  Licences were pulled on Tuesday evening for coursing.  Men and women had been training their animals and had netted the hares.  They nurtured the hares, inoculated them and looked after their welfare and they were looking forward to coursing in the big fields, on the plains of Kildare and in the Golden Vale.  Coursing clubs in south Tipperary include Newcastle, Knockgraffon, Kilsheelan and Clonmel.  I think also of the coursing clubs in east Cork and east Limerick.  It is a huge part of their culture, heritage and d&uacute;chas.  It is good for man and beast.  It is good for the children and the adults to see the flora and fauna on the open land.  The hares are protected by the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service.  It is a devastating blow to the coursing clubs.  Some of them had grounds taken.  Some of them did not get their licences this year because of the situation with the rabbits.</p>  <p>  There is murky business going on in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Certain officials have a vested interest and they are destroying this industry.  We should remember that it is a business for many people.  Thousands of jobs are involved and millions of euro.  This must be sorted out.  I plead with the Minister to allow coursing events to go ahead.  It is amuigh faoin sp&eacute;ir, where we should all be, out in the fields.  That is as far as we can go.  We cannot go further than 5 km on the roads.  I urge the Minister to listen to what I have said.</p>  <p>  Regarding the handling of the Covid crisis by the Minister for Health and the Department of Health, the testing and tracing system has been proven to be a shambles.  We see again today that UCD cannot cope with the number of tests.  This week I was contacted by a young man in Tipperary, a grandson of the late Deputy Michael Ferris, whom I am sure you knew, a Cheann Comhairle.  Shane Ferris works for a company in Cork, Cobots.  I have gone to see the robots they have, which can carry out testing.  They are doing it in universities in Northern Ireland and in England but the company cannot even get an interview with the HSE.  The people in the HSE have their arms around it and they will not let any new people in.  The robots can do the tests safely and there is no danger of infection to any personnel.  It is amazing.  I could not believe it when he mentioned it to me until I saw how it could be done in the yard in front of his house.  The company cannot get a meeting.  We are working on this now for seven or eight months but there is a blockage.  One can talk about procurement, but they do not want it.  It is like a reserve for the wild animals of the HSE.  It is their ground and nobody can come in as they do not want them.  They say they can manage the situation themselves, but they cannot manage it.  They have not managed it.  It has been an abject failure.</p>  <p>  Some 17,000 people offered to Be On Call for Ireland but a minuscule amount of them were taken on.  We are told that there are 3,500 new personnel yet there are 200 fewer nurses in the HSE than it had in February.  What is going on?  Some 640 retired soldiers offered to Be On Call for Ireland but not one of them was taken on, yet we have failures and we have a lack of response.  An elite Army team could have been put into the nursing home in Roscommon yesterday or anywhere else there was an outbreak but that did not happen because the HSE is out of control.</p>  <p>  I am like a broken record in saying that the former taoisigh, Ahern and Cowen, told me they were disbanding the HSE because it could not be managed.  Instead of that we are giving it &euro;1 billion every year, on top of &euro;1 billion for the past seven or eight years and now we are giving it &euro;3.6 billion more.  We could give it &euro;20 billion more, but it cannot manage.  It is not able to manage, full stop.  There is something seriously wrong there.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has left the Chamber but I hope she is listening.  We do not have a single mental health bed in Tipperary and money is being put into the old St. Michael's unit now to convert it.  The sum of &euro;2 million is being spent but we cannot have any mental health patients there.  A neighbour of mine ended his own life at the weekend and he is being buried tomorrow.  It is so sad.</p> <p>He was a young man with three young children.  It is happening day in, day out.  St. Brigid's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir, a wonderful institution, has three hospice beds which were bought through fundraising by the community.  They were taken over for Covid but they are empty with the lights off.  The Government will not give them back even on a limited basis.</p> <p> Home help is not available.  The Government can throw money at the problem but we cannot get the carers.  Thousands of people have offered to help but they are frustrated.  The Government has lost the propaganda war and the faith of the people.  We are supposed to lead the people but one cannot do so with inept institutions.  NPHET has professional people but it needs to be revamped.  If the model is not working right, one revamps it, puts some business people into it, along with mental health specialists and a wide range of different expertise.</p> <p> It is not NPHET leading the country but the Government.  We have feeble and meagre leadership.  There needs to be a changing of the guard.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have dropped the ball spectacularly, which is sad.  The people answered the call.</p> <p> Community garda&iacute;, like Sergeant Ray Moloney and Garda Noel Glavin in Cahir, the GAA clubs, the women's clubs and other different organisations got together to set up help lines.  They will do it again if they have to.  That is the nature of the Irish people, the meitheal spirit.  However, the Government is all confused and draconian legislation has been introduced.  The Government is depressing the people and leading them into the dark of winter.  We will get old time this weekend.  It is old time that the Government got things sorted out and showed the leadership people expect.  There was an old adage in the Penal days, "where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows".  The Government needs to start leading now and showing people hope, vision and a roadmap for the future.</p> <p> The Government needs to cool it on the media.  It needs to turn off RT&Eacute;.  We do not want to be bombarded all the time with bad and negative news.  It needs to put on a few light-hearted shows and a few comedians.  The Government needs to give us a bit of hope.</p> <p> The Government should allow the people to go back to church to pray, for God's sake.  Prayer is a solace for all of us.  Many of us believe in God.  It is important to allow people to have that.  The Government should not be threatening to lock up priests if they go out to do a public mass.  That happened in the Penal days.  We have a mass rock in Newcastle at which we have mass every year to remember what happened in the Penal days.  We are back to those days with &euro;2,500 fine or six months in jail for a priest if he says a public mass.  What good is it to say it online if the people cannot receive it in their homes because they do not have broadband or do not have the tools to watch it?</p> <p> We need a HSE team fit for purpose.  Sadly, ours is not.</p></speech>

Biocidal products, including hand sanitisers, may only be marketed and used in Ireland once they are registered with the Department and are entered on the biocidal product register in accordance with Regulation No. 20 of SI 427/2013.  The process for registering biocidal products aims to ensure that their use does not result in harmful effects on human animal health or the environment.  The approval process also checks that applications comply with all legislation on contents and efficacy.</p>  <p>  The hand sanitiser, Virapro, was approved by our biocide unit and placed in the approved register of biocide products on 21 April 2020.  The product had been registered on the basis of a documentary application, including a technical specification that it contained 70% ethanol, a common standard for hand sanitiser products, and fully complied with regulations.</p>  <p>  OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, notified the Revenue Commissioners regarding the import of a hand sanitiser product from Turkey to Ireland from the same supplier of a product that had been tested in Denmark.  It was found to contain excessive levels of methanol.  The Revenue Commissioners notified the Department of this information on 25 September and arrangements were made to test the consignment, along with several other consignments imported into Ireland from the same supplier.  All consignments tested were detained pending the results of the laboratory analysis.</p>  <p>  Concerns regarding the sanitiser related to varying and inadequate levels of ethanol in the product, as well as the detection of methanol at varying levels in some samples.  Inadequate levels of ethanol would render the product ineffective.  More importantly, frequent use of a hand sanitiser containing methanol can cause nausea, dermatitis, eye irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation and headaches.  Departmental officials took samples of batches of product at different storage locations between 30 September and 2 October.  These samples were submitted to the Department's own laboratory in Backweston on 2 October.</p>  <p>  Preliminary results were received on 8 October.  While these results had to be viewed as indicative only, since the test method was still in the process of validation, they gave sufficient reason to believe that this product should not be released on the market pending further investigation.  On 8 October, compliance notices were issued to all four of the warehouses that had product from the identified consignments requiring them to retain all products on site.  Six additional samples of product were taken for testing, covering all product, irrespective of source, from the company bearing the name Virapro.  All six of these additional samples were submitted for testing to the Department's laboratory on 9 October.</p>  <p>  It became clear that some of this product was not alcohol-based and, therefore, had not been approved for use by my Department.  Following a necessary period of validation of the test method of the laboratory, results were received on 16 October and showed the products did not meet the standards for approval, particularly with regard to the presence of methanol.  The company was immediately instructed to retain all product in its possession and recall all remaining product under the Virapro name from the market or in use by the public.</p>  <p>  On 20 October, Virapro hand sanitiser was removed from the Department's biocide register.  On the same day, officials had informal contact with the Department of Education and Skills procurement service on the matter.  On 21 October, my Department contacted the HSE with results relating to Virapro product samples from the earlier consignments which were owned by HSE.  The primary responsibility for the withdrawal of products rests with the company concerned.</p>  <p>  On Thursday, 22 October, yesterday, it became evident on the basis of communication from the company that the recall of products had not yet commenced.  At that point, my Department took the additional step of issuing a statement outlining the possible risks posed by Virapro and advising members of the public not to use it.  It also issued formal notification to the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  The Department is taking this matter seriously and will continue to follow up investigating the matter.  I was informed of the situation yesterday for the first time.  Having reviewed the matter today, I am clear that it would be much more appropriate for my Department to have followed up with a public notice and communications with other Departments immediately upon issuing the withdrawal notice to the company on 16 October.</p>  <p>  Some of the products Virapro were supplying were working off a PCS registration number although it had not received approval from my Department.  Accordingly, I directed my Department this evening to follow up further with all Departments and also to make it clear to the public that anyone with any Virapro product should not use it and withdraw it immediately.</p>  <p>  I am conducting a full review of the handling of this particular issue to ensure our system of regulation is robust and lessons are learned in terms of the communication of it over the past several days.</p></speech>

Our approach is unbalanced.  Today we introduced draconian legislation under which we will impose fines and jail sentences if ordinary citizens do not comply.  I did vote for it but begrudgingly.</p> <p>However, the State does not always keep its side of the bargain.  We expect ordinary citizens to do it, but the obligations of the State and its various agencies are often not properly or fully discharged.  Sometimes they are not discharged at all.</p> <p> We have seen the debacle of the tracing system.  I will not go into the matter because we have heard many Deputies speak of it today.  Instead of putting a robust and accountable tracing system in place, we outsourced it to an agency offering zero-hour contracts.  We received a report from the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response on our nursing homes and we believed that this time we would support them.  We have enough personal protective equipment, PPE, and we have a testing regime, but we have no system to support individual nursing homes. </p> <p> I am sorry that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, had to leave.  He is obviously very busy.  I wanted to bring to his attention an issue that I know Deputy Fitzmaurice will also raise.  I refer to a Central Bank report stating that the western counties have been hit harder by Covid-19.  It finds that counties in the west and along the Atlantic economic corridor suffered a greater initial employment shock when Covid-19 restrictions were introduced this year.  The report states that Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo took a greater hit because they rely more on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  The adverse impact on jobs was not surprising, with greater numbers availing of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  The report also found that the same regional variations have emerged on the reintroduction of fresh restrictions.  As a result, the Central Bank has concluded that policies to support firms and household incomes will be essential for western counties as long as theses restrictions remain.  It is a pity the Minster is gone, but I know this will be relayed to him.  We have evidence that Covid-19 is impacting different regions differently.  According to the Central Bank, that region will take a greater hit than the rest of the country unless a package of measures is put in place to support households and businesses.  This is evident already.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Carthy on raising the issue of Virapro.  My understanding is that it has been known about for a while.  I will let Deputy Carthy talk about that.  I would also like to refer to the issue of PCS numbers.  We raised this at the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine.  Companies have been waiting a hell of a long time to get their PCS numbers.  Today, the company that supplies this product said it has an alternative product which it can supply straight away.  I do not know how another product can be supplied straight away, since the PCS number does not automatically jump from one product to another.  It would be interesting to see how many products the PCS number was attributed to.</p>  <p>  The Minister is not here, so I do not know who I am talking to - perhaps the lights or the walls.  I wanted to ask if he could confirm that the people who review applications for PCS numbers, which are the be-all and end-all where this issue is concerned, are all working separately.  I have spoken to a person who liaised on Ireland's behalf in this area seven or eight years ago.  Those reviewing the applications must be brought together to evaluate the product in order to ensure a scientific detail is not missed.  We are not doing that at the moment and that is a problem.  People are working from different angles.  New applicants are trying to bring in new products that have been tested and evaluated, but they face a six-month backlog of evaluations.</p>  <p>  I have another question for the Minister.  Since the beginning of Covid-19, have we been awarding PCS numbers to everything that comes along and rushing it out the door without looking at it?  Is this the consequence of that practice?  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to do this for everything, including sprays, Domestos and other products.  I need those questions answered.  I would like them to be put on the record of the D&aacute;il in order that we get answers.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Carthy for highlighting it.  We certainly need answers.  This news will be quite disturbing for many people.  It is amazing.  A neighbour of mine in west Cork, Mr. Pat McCarthy, has been telling me for a while that products we have been rubbing on our hands are highly dangerous.  I did not listen to him, but I will certainly listen to him from now on.  When I go back to west Cork, he will put me in my place.  I am very disappointed that the Minister had to leave.  This is a very important issue and it is very important that he addresses it, particularly as it affects the children in our schools.</p>  <p>  We are going through a very difficult time.  People are living under level 5 restrictions, with the threat of fines and penalties.  I said earlier that I have been inundated with emails from students and their parents asking me if they can go home this evening.  The Members of this House can.  I will have a five-hour journey but I can certainly get home this evening.  Students are being told that they cannot.  People's livelihoods are in serious danger.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is definitely needed here for a proper debate on the crisis currently facing marts.  People are losing massive amounts of money in marts throughout the country.  The Minister seems to be running scared on this issue.  I urge him to come back to the Chamber this evening to discuss it.  It would only take five minutes of his time.</p>  <p>  The Chair of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, Deputy Cahill, is doing everything in his power to reconvene the committee for an emergency discussion on this in the next few days.  It is an emergency situation, with farmers losing masses of money.  They can ill afford this with Brexit over our heads and an ongoing agricultural crisis.  I ask the Minister to look at the commonsense proposals which would allow people to safely socially distance inside sheds.  That is mostly where marts are held.  People could very safely implement social distancing, almost as if the mart was being held in a field.  If this issue is not resolved, it will drag on.  I see that we will be discussing it later.</p>  <p>  The very heart of democracy is being hit.  Some people cannot even attend their church.  I do not know if we have ever seen the like of this since the Penal Laws.  It is incredible.  No other country in Europe has allowed this to happen.  Ireland has become such a dictatorship that people cannot even attend their churches.  It would be great if the Minister could return to explain the situation regarding the marts.</p></speech>

I have taken note of the points they raised and, as is my practice when wrapping up, I will address the concerns raised by Deputies who are still in the Chamber as best I can.</p><p>Deputy Michael Collins has spoken twice this evening, which is unusual, but, needless to say, I welcome his contributions.  On education, he raised the same issue with me twice, namely, that students and other constituents of his wish to know whether the students may travel home.  The answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  Of course, they can return to their place of residence.  I recommend that the Deputy visit the section of <i>gov.ie </i>that deals with Covid.  It lists the various level 5 restrictions, including those relating to domestic travel and retail.  I encourage him to download that information and send it to his constituents because the Government does not wish for people to worry unnecessarily.</p><p>The most important thing to which Deputies need to have regard is the language they use.  We need to be very clear and uniform in our language because we need to ensure there is public confidence.  We must tell the public exactly what is in place and guide them in the proper way.  It is incumbent on every Member of the House, regardless of whether they agree with the Government, to ensure there is public confidence in terms of level 5.  My colleague, Deputy Cowen, and Deputy Durkan rightly commented on that.  People sometimes wonder how we have ended up at level 5, but we must understand that everybody needs to work together to protect those who are vulnerable in communities.  We need to ensure that, as an Oireachtas, all Members work closely together to ensure that happens.</p><p>Deputy Naughten raised the issue of modular units for Portiuncula University Hospital, which is in my county.  That forms part of the winter capital plan.  I am glad to state that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, will be meeting me in the coming week to address progress on that matter.  It fell under the very welcome &euro;600 million winter plan that has been announced.</p><p>An issue that was repeatedly raised is that of HSE contact tracing.  The recruitment process for 800 contact tracers has begun.  Many Deputies referred to the Defence Forces.  Some 50 of its members are already working in contact tracing and 70 new cadets will begin contact tracing next week.</p><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for acknowledging the budget allocation for disabilities.  It was fought for and delivered.  Of the &euro;120 million allocation, &euro;100 million is being added into the base and &euro;20 million is a once-off allocation.  The Deputy also raised the issue of a group home for Carrickmacross.  This issue has been going on for many years.  The people of Carrickmacross and my Oireachtas colleagues can rest assured that I am organising a meeting with the HSE to expedite the long-term arrangement required for the provision of nursing and medical care, as well as addressing the funding required to ensure the house can be opened.  My ambition is that that will happen in 2021.  Plans are already afoot in that regard.</p><p>The issue of meat plants was raised.  It is important for Deputies to know that there have been just three new outbreaks in meat plants this week.</p><p>The issue of a nursing home in Galway, my constituency, was raised.  It is important to understand the sequence of events there.  The HSE has been in direct contact with the nursing home in east Galway, near the Roscommon border, since 18 October and tested all its staff and residents on 19 October.  The HSE is providing expert advice on the ground and its outbreak control team, to which Deputy Naughten, referred is in place.  There is a stable staff in place for the coming days.  The HSE is actively involved in that situation.</p><p>A Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy asked about Alcoholics Anonymous, AA.  It has been approved for inclusion on the special list of additional services that may continue to operate.</p><p>Those are the outstanding issues.  It is important to put on the record that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, could not be present this evening as he is meeting the 221+ patient support group.  It requested that meeting yesterday.  If the Minister did not have to attend it, he would be here to answer Deputies' question.</p><p>I thank my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, for coming to the House to deal with the issue of hand sanitisers which was raised by several Deputies.  He answered their questions, so I do not need to revisit the issue.</p><p>I thank Members for the productive and timely debate on the situation currently facing the country.  From the outset, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has tried to be as clear and honest as possible about the gravity of the situation we are facing.  We are dealing with a medical emergency while lacking the kind of tools, such as medicines and vaccines, on which we would normally rely.  We are not without hope.  We have got this far.  The virus was under control once before.  We can and will get it under control again.  However, all indicators of disease incidence and severity have continued to worsen in recent weeks.  In the past week, there have been almost 9,000 cases.  The national 14-day incidence rate now stands at 291 cases per 100,000 population. </p><p>In response to the rapidly deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country, this week the Government had to make some very difficult decisions to protect public health.  It did so by moving the entire country to level 5 of the plan for living with Covid for the next six weeks.  It is important to remember that we are not alone.  The World Health Organization, WHO, is currently reporting more than 40 million cases of Covid-19 detected across 235 countries.  Tragically, it is also reporting that there have been more than 1.1 million deaths from the disease.  This week, it reported that the European region had seen the highest increase in cases and deaths thus far, at 25% and 29%, respectively.  I wish to pass on my sympathies to all families that have been impacted with the loss of a loved one.</p><p>Europe has reported the greatest proportion of new cases globally.  What we are seeing in Ireland is, unfortunately, part of a concerning trend across the Continent.  We can expect that the increase in the number of cases within the community will lead to the virus becoming more prevalent among vulnerable populations.  The increase will also, in turn, lead to more people being admitted to hospital and intensive care units.  Unfortunately, the sad reality is that we can expect more people to die as a result of Covid-19.</p><p>That is why the Government decided to move to level 5 restrictions this week.  It did so to interrupt the chains of transmission, get the virus back under control and put the country back into a position whereby the public health system has sufficient capacity to manage the reduced case numbers we hope to see.  The measures we have put in place are very much in line with what is happening elsewhere in Europe.  In fact, there are more severe restrictions in place in certain countries.  There are curfews in Belgium and parts of France and a ban on the sale of alcohol after 8 p.m. in Belgium, while restrictions have recently been tightened in Italy.  Wales has entered a circuit breaker lockdown, while several areas in the north of England have been placed into the highest level of restrictions available under the regime in place there.  The virus is also surging in parts of North America and elsewhere.</p><p>It is clear from the way the virus is spreading rapidly that we are a long way off achieving herd immunity against Covid.  It is important that people remember the three &quot;Cs&quot;, namely, crowds, close contacts and close spaces.  That message has not changed since Covid arrived in Ireland in February.  The three things that have been asked of people since last February continue to be required.  We need to wear a mask, keep our distance and wash our hands.  Deputies need to stay on message when speaking to the general public.  We need to keep the people with us.  Most importantly, as an Oireachtas, we should be unified in how we deliver our message on keeping people safe.</p></speech>

I also greatly appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, being present for this debate.  This is an issue that she and I have discussed at various fora in the past few extremely difficult weeks and months.  I know this has been a particularly difficult week for the entire country as we deal with this rising pandemic and the new restrictions that regrettably but necessarily were introduced.</p>  <p>  I listened to quite a bit of the previous debate.  With the restrictions under level 5, there are so many things that people are rightly questioning because they are concerned.  Sometimes they are even picking holes to find ways to get around restrictions.  People are raising very real concerns over the impact of these restrictions on all aspects of society.</p>  <p>  One of the great differences between the previous lockdown and now, as the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, said in his earlier remarks was the fact that so many more medical treatments and services are remaining open.  People will still be able to get in to get those essential services, which is vital.  However, this one is a bit closer to home.  I pay credit to Deputy Cairns and my Fine Gael colleague, Senator Currie, who have raised the issue in this House and in the Seanad many times.  It is something very personal.</p>  <p>  On 5 May at the height of the first lockdown, my wife and I very happily welcomed our second child, a daughter, into the world.  It was a bizarre situation as I found myself in a row of 12 cars on Merrion Square waiting.  As my wife was in the maternity hospital under wonderful care from the doctors, midwives, supporters and everybody else, I was sitting outside waiting.  As I said, it was our second child.  When we had our first child a couple of years ago, I was there for the entire 26-hour process.  I do not expect any sympathy, nor do I deserve any.  However, this time I was left outside to wait, to worry and to hope that the phone call would come in time for me to be able to be there for the birth of my second child, my daughter.  Thankfully, I was.</p>  <p>  However, that process and everything that has gone with it, including the inability to attend prenatal appointments was extremely stressful.  I am talking about my own personal experience, not looking for any sympathy but trying to paint the picture of what is happening to couples and individuals around the country every day.</p>  <p>  Despite the guidelines, which I have gratefully received from the Department, there is still considerable concern that birth partners will not be able to join their partner for the birth of their child.  I deliberately say "birth partner" because it does not necessarily have to be a husband or wife.  It could be a mother, a sibling or anyone.  Going into labour on one's own is a very daunting process, as is going to those very difficult appointments such as the 20-week scan and others one one's own.  They must also face the postnatal care alone, trying to understand what the doctor is saying.</p>  <p>  We need to have absolute clarity.  As I read it, level 5 allows the visiting policy to be suspended, aside from critical child-centred and compassionate circumstances.  Everything about those appointments prior to the birth, during the birth and after the birth are critical, child-centred and compassionate.  We need to have clarity that every maternity hospital in the State will ensure a birth partner will be there, not just for the delivery but for the appointments before and after the birth.  It is vital and we need to ensure over the next six weeks that expectant mothers around the country do not need to go in on their own and, crucially, that the father, when it is fathers, have the right to attend the birth of their child.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300057#FFF01200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I congratulate him and his wife on the birth of their second child, a daughter.  Having been through maternity three times, I fully endorse what he has said.  It is not just for the arrival of the baby.  From a female perspective, of course the mothers want their partner, husband or wife with them at that time.  They need that support because they do not know what news they might be facing after any scan.  That is why it is important, and I take on board what the Deputy said.</p>  <p>  I have a particular answer from the Department, but that does not mean I do not have empathy and understanding of why the Deputy is raising it and why constituents of his and constituents of all of ours around the country are raising this issue.  We will continue to raise it on behalf of our constituents because there is can be anxiety attached to it at a time that should be joyous and memorable.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for bringing this important issue before the House.  The Department is aware of how difficult these restrictions have been for expectant mothers and fathers.  I fully acknowledge the worry and concern they have caused.  As the House will be aware, maternity services are core, essential services that need to be able to provide 24-7 care throughout the country, as we continue to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  While it is, of course, desirable that the impact on the experience of women is kept to an absolute minimum, unfortunately, to protect women, babies, staff and, indeed, our maternity service as a whole, it has been necessary to reduce footfall in maternity hospitals.</p>  <p>  This has been achieved in a number of ways, including through remote appointments and expanded community services.  Visitor restrictions were also introduced, which, unfortunately, included limitations on access of partners to maternity wards, theatres and appointments.  I assure the House that these decisions were not taken lightly.</p>  <p>  Significant variations in caseload, complexity and infrastructure exist across the system and decisions on restrictions were made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level to ensure local flexibility to account for different circumstances in different maternity units.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there have been no Covid maternal deaths in this country, and we have had a relatively low incidence in pregnant women.  In that regard, it is clear that, to date, our maternity hospitals have continued to keep women, babies and staff safe, while delivering quality care in very challenging circumstances.</p>  <p>  The issue of visitor restrictions has been kept under review.  I am pleased to inform the House that last week the HSE issued guidance regarding attendance at acute hospitals, including in maternity hospitals.  The guidance notes that a partner should generally be facilitated to accompany a woman in labour and childbirth, and that while most hospital inpatient stays in maternity services are of short duration, it is generally appropriate to facilitate visiting by a partner through this period.  The guidance further advises that parents should be facilitated to visit an infant who is in the neonatal intensive care unit, with due regard for the need to manage the risk to all infants in the unit.</p> <p>However, we cannot become complacent.  The virus is still transmitting in the community and we must be on high alert.  An outbreak of Covid-19 among staff or patients would have a severely negative impact and reduce our ability to provide maternity services. </p> <p> Maternity hospitals wish to facilitate support from partners as far as possible.  I welcome the easing of some of the restrictions in maternity hospitals.  I am assured that maternity units and hospitals are working towards compliance with the HSE&rsquo;s new guidance.</p></speech>

When things are written in black and white they can seem so stark, particularly during a stressful time.  It will be of some relief to so many couples and people that the Minister of State and her colleagues understand.  I pay tribute to all our maternity hospitals for their work in keeping the virus out and being so supportive during this difficult time.</p>  <p>  I have a real difficulty with the term "reducing footfall".  Birth partners should not be considered footfall because they are much more important than that.  A Deputy, whose wife is expecting their fourth child in the coming weeks, made the point that his wife would see him as her voice through the whole process, not just during the birth but during the appointments, tough scans and postnatal care.  I have spoken often of postnatal depression.  Something a psychiatrist tells a new mother might not be remembered.  Access post birth is only being allowed to neonatal ICU visits.</p>  <p>  I do not want to personalise this but sometimes personalising issues makes it easier to get a message across.  For the first five days of my daughter's life, I only saw her through FaceTime.  I could not visit the hospital.  I do not think that is right.  It is not right that women who have gone through a traumatic birth then go through the immediate recovery on their own.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this issue back to her officials and through the maternity services.  It is not only about the minutes and hours - sometimes many hours - of labour but also the appointments beforehand and the time afterwards.  A mother should be accompanied at those times, whether by the baby's father, her partner, wife or mother.  No woman should have to go through this alone.  We are fighting a vicious global pandemic but we need to get that point across.</p></speech>

The introduction of pods and bubbles this week was very welcome.  Maybe we can discuss with the hospitals if they are open to the idea of having bubbles or pods.  It is important, however, that my message is clear tonight and I do not want to confuse it.  These decisions are not taken lightly and hospital front-line staff and management are acutely aware that it is very important that mothers are supported by their partners at the time of the birth.  It is important that we continue to do everything in our power to protect mothers, babies and staff in our maternity hospitals.  However, we must not forget that the virus is still prevalent in our communities and we must remain vigilant at all times.</p>  <p>  The HSE has said it is hopeful that the new guidance it has issued and the commitment of maternity services to its implementation would help address the very significant concerns of expectant mums and dads across the country.  I will convey the Deputy's concerns to the Minister.</p></speech>

When the Republic of Ireland originally went into lockdown in March, public worship was suspended.  From the beginning, church authorities have worked with the Government to develop safe worship guidelines, including placing hand sanitisers at entrances, one-way systems of movement and social distancing, as well as a limit in the number allowed to attend each service of public worship which restarted in June.  There is now disappointment, after all the work that went into the parishes reopening for public worship, that the authorities have again moved to ban people attending mass.</p>  <p>  There is no evidence that going to church increases risks more than any other activity currently permitted under levels 3, 4 or 5.  This highly restrictive and punitive measure completely fails to take account of potential alternative ways by which the church may gather while also implementing precautionary practices against the spread of Covid-19.  That means that even if the country returns to level 3 restrictions after the current lockdown, public worship in churches would remain prohibited.  Even the Irish Council for Civil Liberties believes that public church worship should be permitted under level 3 restrictions.  The Government's effective ending of church worship is completely inappropriate.  It deprives many people of the holy sacraments and leaves many feeling even more lost, disoriented and in need of help and solidarity.  The Government restrictions on church worship take no account of the fact that those attending mass and services are the most compliant.  Most churchgoers in Ireland are older and more attentive to the safety measures and exercising great caution and care.  However, they are being treated with the same broad-brush approach as every other group.  </p>  <p>  The measures introduced in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2020 this week mean someone who attends a mass or a priest who celebrates a public mass will face fines of up to &euro;5,000 or six months in prison.  This is an outrageous attack by the Government on religious worship.  It is truly shameful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300058#GGG00500"><p>Under the new Covid restrictions, a priest can be fined, imprisoned or both for saying a mass in public.  The same applies to any minister of any religion who holds a public ceremony or act of worship.  This is drastic, draconian and unacceptable and raises questions about the constitutionality of the measures taken today.  It is totally disproportionate.  The regulations state that no person shall leave their house or place of residence without reasonable excuse and lists 25 exemptions or reasons persons are allowed to leave their home.  A minister of religion, priest or any member of the clergy can only leave his or her house in the line of duty, to lead worship online, to attend sick calls or to conduct a wedding or funeral service.  There is no list of exemptions for members of the public to attend a church or other place of worship.</p>  <p>  We have introduced penal offences for breaching these regulations.  It is drastic.  In Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries in Europe, the number of people who can attend a religious service is limited to 30.  Only three countries in the world, Saudi Arabia, North Korea and mother Ireland, have banned religious services in public.  We cannot do enough to attack the church and destroy the people's faith.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Government.  Churches and church institutions have to be heated and must have Covid measures in place.  I salute the parish councils, priests and volunteers.  They need financial support because they do not get contributions when people are unable to attend for worship.  They need support from the Government like any other business.

Earlier this week, the Government took the decision to move the country to level 5 of the framework for living with Covid-19, as outlined in the resilience and recovery plan.  This decision took account of a variety of factors, including the views of the National Public Health Emergency Team on the current epidemiology of Covid-19 and the need to take decisive action.</p>  <p>  The Government remains united in its resolve to tackle the spread of Covid-19.  The disease prevention and control strategy that we have adopted seeks to prevent the virus spreading among our population to the greatest extent possible.  The Deputies may describe this as a ban; we call it protection.  The basic public health advice and regulatory measures aimed at blocking the transmission of Covid-19 from person to person remain vital.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>From the beginning of the pandemic, we have emphasised the many simple measures that can be taken to do this.  These include keeping a distance, washing hands, wearing a face covering where required and avoiding crowds.  Such measures do work.  The resilience and recovery plan provides us with a framework to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible.  Inherent in that framework is a prioritisation of activities.</p> <p> The pandemic has had an enormous impact on society in Ireland, as it has throughout the world.  Many people have lost their businesses or jobs.  Others, unfortunately, have lost family members or friends.  I would like to express my deepest sympathies to those families and friends in these very difficult times.  Deputy Richmond spoke earlier about partners not being able to attend antenatal scan appointments with their loved ones.  We have now had more than 54,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.  The Government is concerned that, if left unchecked, this number will only increase further.  I assure the Deputy that I am extremely conscious of the burdens that have been placed on all members of society as a result of the restrictions that had to be imposed.  Many people have been unable to live their lives the way they normally would or participate in the usual rhythms of their communities.  For very many people, being able to go to their local church to attend mass with their family and friends is a major source of comfort and solace at what is a very difficult time for our country and, indeed, for the world.</p> <p> Unfortunately, as we all now know, the environment within which Covid-19 spreads most easily is indoors where a group of people are gathered.  At this particular time, when we are doing our utmost to break the transmission cycle of the virus, we must, regrettably, make every effort to reduce such gatherings.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work the Catholic Church and other faiths have done to put in place comprehensive guidelines to protect their communities, as Deputy Mattie McGrath noted, in compliance with the HSE's public health advice.  As we are able, we hope, to move back down the restrictions from level 5 in the near future, these efforts will assume ever greater importance.  However, consistent with the level 5 restrictions applying at this time, religious services have moved online and places of worship are open for private prayer only.  There are exceptions for funerals and weddings, which may be attended by 25 people.</p> <p> It is important to note that under the regulations, ministers of religion are permitted to travel outside the 5 km limit to perform a service online, minister to the sick and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.  I discussed this issue with my local parish priest, Fr. Michael, this week.  Monsignor Cathal Geraghty in Loughrea has also spoken about it.  In my local deanery, seven out of nine priests are over 65 years of age, with some of them over 70 and others over 80.  This is a problem for many parishes in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.</p></speech>

She said that for very many people in Ireland, being able to attend mass in their local church with their family and friends is a major source of comfort.  That is certainly true but the problem is that people are not allowed to do so at this time.  Ireland is the only country in Europe that has banned mass and the same restrictions apply to the activities of other religions, including the Methodist Church and Church of Ireland.  These restrictions are a shocking mistake.  Parish councils throughout the country did a great deal of work to ensure that everything was done right.  My daughter has been working in our local church, ensuring that everybody sanitises his or her hands and keeping people safe.  Fortunately, I am not aware of any instances of the virus being spread through attendance at the church.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath is correct that the clergy and the churches have been forgotten in any compensation package.  They are in the same position as many other businesses and this is something that should be reviewed.  The Government must at least consider allowing masses to take place.</p></speech>

However, under the restrictions imposed by the Government, public worship is now a penal matter.  We are going back to the time of the Penal Laws and the pre-Famine period.  I salute the Franciscans in Clonmel, including Fr. Michael Toomey, Fr. Brendan Crowley and my own parish priest, Fr. Garrett Desmond, who have made Trojan and Herculean efforts to get mass services online, with the help of volunteers.  This is a very trying time but we cannot just walk all over the Constitution.  What kind of Government does so?</p>  <p>  People are entitled to go to their church to worship.  They do so for solace, which they have never wanted more than they do now.  We have a wonderful friary in Clonmel, as I said, and a shop adjacent to it which sells mass cards and mass bouquets.  The church is open, fortunately, for private prayer but the shop cannot open.  It is an essential service for people to be able to get a mass card or mass bouquet for a loved one whose funeral they cannot attend.  There has been no thought for people in that situation.  The Government must put some sort of package in place to support the churches.</p></speech>

The Government appreciates that people have been severely affected by the restrictions imposed this year.  We have provided a range of supports to individuals, businesses and other sectors of society to limit the impact on livelihoods and businesses.  The Government remains united in its resolve to tackle the spread of Covid-19.  As I said, there have been more than 54,000 confirmed cases in Ireland.  More immediately, there have been extremely concerning increases in the numbers of new infections being reported in recent weeks.  There have been 1,000 to 1,200 cases per day for most of the past week.  The Government's view is that this level of community transmission is too high and decisive action must be taken now to limit the growth of the virus.  The evidence is clear that it is the vulnerable in society who are most risk from Covid-19.</p>  <p>  We in Ireland are not alone in being impacted by the virus.  There have now been more than 41 million cases worldwide and 1.1 million deaths.  Many other countries have imposed very restrictive measures to limit the further growth of the virus.  This Government has consulted with a number of churches and faiths on the response to the pandemic.  This has resulted, for example, in the production of an information booklet entitled A Guide for the Bereaved during the Covid-19 Pandemic.  The Catholic Church and other faiths have guidelines in place to protect their communities, in compliance with HSE public health guidelines.  That effort is welcomed.</p>  <p>  I remind Deputies that we each have the power to limit the impact of the virus by adhering to the public health guidelines.  We succeeded in doing so earlier this year, thanks to our collective efforts, and we can do so again.  I appeal to all colleagues to show leadership on this issue and promote adherence to the public health advice.  This is not a partisan issue but one on which we must all work together.</p></speech>

Duodopa is manufactured by AbbVie, which has a number of manufacturing plants along the west coast.  It seems we are very good in this country at manufacturing new medicines but we lag behind when it comes to making those medicines available to people living here.  This medicine has taken 26 months to go through the reimbursement approval process.  The HSE's drugs group approved it for reimbursement in February but, eight months later, we are still waiting for it to be sanctioned.</p>  <p>  There was a big announcement in the budget of an allocation of &euro;50 million for new medicines.  In fact, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, singled out Parkinson's disease when speaking about that allocation.  Duodopa is used to treat advanced Parkinson's disease when no other medicines have worked.  I am aware of a person who has been in hospital for more than a month awaiting the go-ahead to be treated with the drug.  I will not name the hospital in question in case it might identify the patient.  This person cannot leave the hospital and every day must be like a week and every week like a month as progress is awaited.  I really hope the Minister of State can offer me good news by giving a date for the sanctioning of Duodopa under the reimbursement scheme.</p></speech>

The Act specifies certain criteria for decisions on whether the State will reimburse medicines.  The Minister for Health has no role in this statutory process.  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The NCPE conducts assessments on behalf of the HSE and then makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in making a decision.  The HSE strives to reach a decision on drug reimbursement in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant moneys involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, often leading to a protracted deliberative process.</p> <p> On 14 June 2019, the NCPE completed an assessment of the drug for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and recommended that it should not be considered for reimbursement unless its cost-effectiveness could be improved compared to other existing treatments.  This recommendation is available to view on the NCPE website.  Following this recommendation, the HSE entered into lengthy pricing negotiations with the manufacturer.  When these concluded, the reimbursement was formally considered by the HSE drugs group over two meetings, the second of which was held in February, as the Deputy indicated.</p> <p> The Minister wishes to make it clear to the Deputy that Duodopa was not approved for reimbursement in February.  Instead, it was at that time that the drugs group made a positive recommendation to the HSE executive management team.  This was in the context of the recognised unmet need, the clinical evidence, and its cost-effectiveness.  The drug is one of a number of medicines with a significant budget impact awaiting a decision by the HSE executive management team.</p> <p> The HSE has yet to make a final decision on this specific reimbursement application and the statutory process is still ongoing.  However, the House will be aware that an additional &euro;50 million, which Deputy Harkin mentioned, was allocated to the HSE in budget 2021 to enable the approval of new medicines.  The Minister understands that the reimbursement of Duodopa will be considered in that context.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, she did not give me a timeline or a date.  It was very clear from my question and from what I have said that this is what the family are waiting for.  This is a 26-month process.  The Minister of State has quite rightly pointed out that it was the drugs group that made a positive recommendation last February.  What has been the hold-up since then, especially since the Minister made all of this extra money available for new drugs and specifically spoke about drugs for Parkinson's disease?  This family sees other families able to access this drug.  They know it works and that it is the only thing that will work for their loved one.  They are glad to see others receiving it but they are still waiting.  The Parkinson's groups in the north west and in Mayo are waiting to hear what the Minister of State has to say on this because there is no other drug that will fit the bill.  I ask the Minister of State to make her very best effort, as I know she will, to speed this process up as much as possible.  I am disappointed, not for me, but for the person I know who is waiting and who is listening to this debate.  I honestly thought I might have heard some positive news.  I will leave it with the Minister of State.  I would appreciate it if she would come back to me as soon as she can.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to mention the Parkinson's group in Galway as well.  In his note to me, the Minister stated that he hopes that the final decision on this reimbursement application concludes shortly for all concerned.  This comes from his note.  I will follow up with him on foot of what we have discussed.  The Deputy might let the family know that.</p></speech>

The Deputy wishes to discuss due recognition of the bravery of Irish Defence Forces members at Jadotville, an issue in which the Irish public has had a great interest for some time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-23a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102300060#JJJ00500"><p>In issuing the Jadotville medal in December 2017, the State took the first step towards righting a 56-year-old wrong against the men of A Company 35th Infantry Battalion, who served with distinction under fire in the Congo in 1961.  Shortly before the medal was presented to the surviving men and to the families of those who had passed since the men returned to Ireland in 1961, one of the survivors, John Gorman, said:</p> <blockquote> 	The families of the deceased members worry me because they should get an apology from the government for what was done.  Their fathers and brothers went to their graves branded as cowards. </blockquote>  <p>We should be thankful that, due to the efforts of John Gorman, other soldiers, supporters, the publication of books on the episode and Richie Smyth's brilliant film &quot;The Siege of Jadotville&quot;, based on Declan Power's book, nobody can be in any doubt about the scale of the bravery and courage of the 158 men under the leadership of Commandant Pat Quinlan when besieged by several thousand members of the Katangese forces.  Neither would anybody be in any doubt about the unworthy man who was a UN official at the time, Conor Cruise O'Brien.  The collective bravery of the men of A Company and the foresight of Commandant Quinlan ensured that no soldier lost his life during the four-day siege and that, in fact, the unit inflicted great casualties on the attacking forces, including 300 dead and nearly 1,000 wounded, no thanks to Conor Cruise O'Brien and the UN, who were supposed to have their back.</p><p>I am asking the Minister of State to intervene because next year marks 60 years since the attack on this small UN force stationed in a small outpost at Jadotville in the then Katanga region of the Congo.  The citations from Commandant Quinlan recommended the issuing of 27 distinguished service medals and five military medals for gallantry.  It is worth remembering the circumstances of what occurred.  The unit of 158 soldiers included many teenagers.  John Gorman was 17 at the time and he recalled the chaplain, Joseph Fagan, giving the soldiers the last rites in the defensive trenches they had dug around their outpost.  In the understatement of the century, he has said it was &quot;a bit scary&quot;.  The detachment was ill-equipped for the mission and abandoned to face a vastly numerically superior force.  As another survivor, Noel Carey, recalled, after four days in the 100&deg; F heat under fire:</p> <blockquote> 	We had to work very hard on morale to try and get some of the lads together because it was probably the biggest shock we had.  We didn&rsquo;t expect to be attacked, we didn&rsquo;t expect to be mortared, we didn&rsquo;t expect to be machine-gunned but by God we never expected that we were going to be attacked by a jet aircraft. </blockquote>  <p>Noel Carey also quotes Captain Liam Donnelly as saying, &quot;There was just chaos in the beginning&quot;, and: &quot;The NCOs were brilliant and they were able to retaliate and fire back.&rdquo;  Carey has also said:</p> <blockquote> 	[We] were having a pretty heavy night.  It was the first time the lads had been under fire.  They were jittery </blockquote>  <p>That is the context but Noel Carey also said afterwards: &quot;Pat Quinlan saved all our skins and brought all his troops safely.  He just didn&rsquo;t get the credit he should have got.&quot;</p><p>This was a reflection of good military training, discipline and leadership and a testimony to the calibre of the men in question.  They did not deserve the disrespect they got when they returned, their second abandonment.  As Regimental Sergeant Major Noel O'Callaghan has previously stated, we should &quot;have the moral courage to right this wrong of the past&quot;.  It is time to issue these much-deserved medals to at least the 32 men recommended by Commandant Quinlan.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is unable to be present due to previous commitments and has asked me to respond to the Deputy.</p> <p> The siege of Jadotville was a prominent event that occurred during Ireland's peacekeeping mission in Congo in September 1961, as the Deputy outlined.  A Company 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3 September 1961.  On 9 September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and, early on the morning of 13 September, A Company came under attack.  From 13 to 17 September, they endured an almost continuous attack.  They were taken into captivity on 17 September and remained in captivity until 25 October 1961.</p> <p> With regard to the men of A Company 35th Infantry Battalion, the issue of the award of medals was addressed in 1962 and again in 1965.  A properly constituted medals board considered the various cases presented.  The board did not award any medals whose citation mentioned Jadotville.  The then Chief of Staff considered the decision of the board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, the question was raised in a letter to the newly appointed Chief of Staff.  He forwarded the letter to the original medals board and asked that it reconvene and review its decision.  The board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and it was not prepared to alter its findings.</p> <p> A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case.  This board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Infantry Battalion be given recognition.  In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of A Company and the 35th Infantry Battalion as a whole to the UN peace-support mission in the Congo.  Recognition of their contribution over the years includes a presentation of scrolls to A Company in 2006 and portraits of Lieutenant Colonel McNamee, 35th Battalion Commander, and Commandant Quinlan, Company Commander, A Company, were commissioned in 2006.  In July 2010, the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo, there was commemoration at a highly publicised and well-attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  A nominal roll of A Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the siege of Jadotville, a unit citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of A Company was issued.  This was the first time a unit citation was awarded within the Defence Forces.</p> <p> Furthermore, on 13 June 2017, the Government committed, as an exceptional step, to awarding a medal known as "An Bonn Jadotville", or the Jadotville medal, to each member of A Company 35th Infantry Battalion, and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the siege of Jadotville.  This specially commissioned medal was procured to fully recognise and honour their courageous actions during the siege.  The words inscribed on the medal, "cosaint chalma" and "misneach", meaning "valiant defence" and "courage", were carefully chosen to pay tribute to the courageous men of A Company. </p> <p> With regard to inquiries about additional medals, the award of distinguished service medals and military medals for gallantry are provided for in Defence Forces Regulation A9.  This regulation sets out the criteria for such medals.  It is important that, in order to maintain the prestige of such medals, the criteria be adhered to strictly.  The introduction of any change to the regulations or the criteria for the award of distinguished service medals and military medals for gallantry is not a straightforward matter, and there are many associated complexities.  Robust consideration must be given to any potential unintended consequences arising, such as those associated with maintaining the integrity of the award-of-medals system and the implications for previous decisions of properly constituted military medals boards.</p> <p> The availability of documentary evidence and official records also represents a challenge in this case.  It has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award medals will be considered.  At this juncture, with no new information having come to light, there would not be a cause for the matter to be re-examined.  Notwithstanding this, the issue is receiving further consideration.  The Chief of Staff is currently considering the matter in the context of the award of medals and the possible implications for the integrity of the award-of-medals system.  It should be noted that the Secretary General of the Department of Defence is meeting retired Commandant Leo Quinlan shortly to discuss these matters and has requested that if he has any new information on the matter, he should submit it in advance of the meeting or bring it with him so it may be considered further.</p></speech>

I knew in advance that this was the type of answer I would get, that is, that there were two properly constituted medals boards convened by two chiefs of staff and that issuing the deserved medals may undermine the prestige of the medals or have unintended consequences.  That is the same trash that is quoted continuously.  Regarding unintended consequences, the authorities have had nearly 60 years to come up with a way to address them.  Not so long ago, the Government and Houses of the Oireachtas found it to be within their ability to pardon deserters from the Defence Forces who joined the British Army during the Second World War.  Surely it is not beyond us, therefore, to give due recognition to the bravest of the brave, as recommended by the late Commandant Pat Quinlan.  How can the prestige of the medal be undermined by giving it to the very men for whom it was designed?  It was designed after the incident.  It should not be beyond the military authorities to accept that they made and make mistakes.  It does not undermine their authority or command structure.  It still allows for military discipline and comradeship.  It should never be seen as a sign of weakness.  In fact, it should be seen as a sign of strength to admit an error.  Correcting the record is better than living a lie.  I ask the Minister of State to announce that the medals will be issued soon before any more of the ageing men pass away without deserved recognition from the military authority, which should, in the first place, have saluted them when they returned to Ireland rather than turning their back on them.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that he would refer to a contribution made by me as trash considering that I spent a lifetime believing that the members of our Defence Forces are some of the bravest people and that they defend our country in all circumstances.  They defend it on peacekeeping missions and have defended it at home for many years in support of the civil power.  Having acknowledged fully many of the concerns the Deputy raised, I believe it is regrettable that he would refer to my contribution or parts of it as trash.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding all the situations I outlined, the matter is receiving further consideration.  As I said, the Chief of Staff is currently considering the matter in the context of the award of medals and the possible implications for the medals system.  I mentioned that the Secretary General of the Department of Defence is meeting retired Commandant Leo Quinlan to discuss the matter.  It is important to realise that action is being taken.  On behalf of the Minister, I take this opportunity to recall the valuable contribution made by all who served in the various Irish contingents in the Congo between 1960 and 1964 during the UN peace support mission.

Large areas of planted land in forestry totally changes the landscape and is a permanent development that has a real impact on communities, the environment and local infrastructure, and it has a broader county and regional impact.  Even the smallest development requires planning permission such as the change of use of a building, making a new entrance onto a roadway or building wall or a fence.  The most positive developments, large and small, need planning permission but forestry, which grows 40 ft tall and has a massive visual and environmental impact, is outside the planning system.  This anomaly needs to be addressed and that is what the Bill intends to do.</p>  <p>  I want to make some general comments about the forestry system in Ireland because many people are not aware of how it works.  Most of the land being planted is marginal in parts of the west and north west, where heavier soils and a wetter climate mean profitable agricultural options are limited.  Many experts point out that this land is simply not productive farmland and forestry offers the best return to the farmer, mainly due to the grants, and also solves the country's carbon sequestration obligations.  Some of this may be correct but closer examination reveals negative realities that also must be addressed.</p>  <p>  The general model of afforestation in the State is large blocks of Sitka spruce trees, which are relatively fast growing conifer plantations, and a small mix of broadleaf species is planted around the perimeter.  The trees are planted very close together in rows with open drainage shores running between them.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine grants cover the full cost of the planting and fencing of the land under the scheme and the land owner receives an annual payment of approximately &euro;500 per hectare for the first 15 years.  If farmers plant their own land, they will continue to receive the basic payment or entitlements they have under the CAP, which is usually another approximately &euro;200 per ha on top of the forestry payment.</p>  <p>  The first thinning of the forest happens after between 16 and 19 years, when every other row of trees is removed by specialist machinery and mainly used for wood pulp and wood chipping.  The landowner gets paid for this timber at a rate per tonne.  That second thinning happens seven to ten years later.  This is better timber and gets a better price.  Then clear fell happens after 35 to 40 years, so it is a long-term investment when all is cleared out.  Replanting is one of the conditions of clear felling.  The final timber product is used as a valuable sawn timber for the construction industry.  Currently, clear fell timber can return up to &euro;8,000 per hectare for the landowner.  Overall the return for forestry is very good and it is all tax free.</p>  <p>  The reason for the generous Government assistance for forestry is to encourage it as a means of reaching our commitments on climate change, as trees are viewed as the only way to absorb and store carbon, which is disputed by many.  For a small farmer struggling to make a living on wet poor land in the west, it is an attractive option, as it is for investment companies and pension funds where the land can be bought cheaply and with the security of State funding for the planting and 15 years of payments.  As a Government policy, grant aided monocultural afforestation has been successful in getting more land under trees.</p>  <p>  The permanent change of land use is one of the clear consequences of this policy and for communities living in areas where forestry is replacing farming as a model of land use it has negative impacts.  There is little labour involved in growing Sitka spruce.  It closes down the entire countryside.  The activity involved in traditional farming has a significant economic spin-off in the local area, with services being provided to the farm and products and materials traded with the farm.  Normal farming activity creates opportunities and, in turn, this creates activity.  The farm that is planted with Sitka spruce never needs new gates or fencing or anyone to cut fodder, bale it, gather it in, plough it or reseed it.  There are no animals to feed or to care for.  There is no vet to come to look at an animal or anyone to do any maintenance of the habitats or hedges, or anyone to come to fix the tractors or the farm machinery, or to maintain the sheds.  Above all, the farm that grows Sitka spruce needs no farmer.  No farmer will go to the market to meet other farmers or call on neighbours when they are in need because there are no needs.  The planted farm becomes deserted and goes wild and uninteresting.  The rural community that once survived on the microeconomy that the activity of farming delivered in an area also suffers decline and becomes deserted.  The economic activity created by planting, maintaining, thinning and processing the conifers is very low as it is an industry that is highly automated.  There is approximately one full-time job per 1,000 ha of forestry.</p>  <p>  The look of these dark blocks of forestry on the landscape is not very appealing and for many people who live next to the forests they are a real eyesore of lifeless black deserts towering over their lives.  The plantations grow tall and dense, and there are many disputes between local residents and forestry companies about the blocking of views and the shading out of light by the trees.  Planning permission is not required for forestry, although it grows and becomes a permanent feature that dominates landscapes and breaks the horizon with immense visual impact.  Many of our most beautiful picturesque views have been blocked out with conifers forests dominating the landscape, with farm after farm being planted in an area, leading to a concentration of forestry, particularly in County Leitrim and other areas.  This has major environmental and visual impacts that have been ignored up to now, while the genuine complaints of local people are drowned out by a chorus from State agencies that we must meet our afforestation targets for climate change reasons.</p>  <p>  When marginal land comes up for sale, local farmers depending on suckler cows and sheep find it difficult to buy it as the forestry companies, backed by hedge funds and pension funds, can always outbid them.  This brings this brings us to another problem created by the afforestation policy, which is the change of land ownership from local farmers to international corporate interests that have the forestry maintained for them and thinned by forest management companies.  The timber industry in Ireland has been built around the Sitka spruce model of forestry with the harvesting machinery for conifers and the transport and handling equipment in sawmills all developed for this type of timber.</p>  <p>  There are also serious problems with the road damage from thousands of tonnes of timber being extracted over a few weeks.  Local councils are always in conflict with forestry companies.  If the planning process was used, these issues would be dealt with in the beginning and conditions could be put in place for forestry development.  Making progress on our climate change obligations is the reason offered for the high level of grants and tax-free status for forestry.</p>  <p>  There are also worries about the efficiency and effectiveness of the Sitka spruce forestry model as a carbon sink.  In general, pine trees with needles are up to 30% less effective at absorbing carbon than broadleaf trees.  The model of plantation in Ireland, whereby the Sitka spruce are planted very close together, is designed to produce timber with fewer branches and, therefore, fewer knots on the timber, as the trees grow straight up with most of the foliage at the top.  This means only one third of the tree has carbon absorbing foliage and the canopy of dark needles shuts out the light, making the floor of the forest almost bare underneath.  While evergreen, the spruce needles shed and are replaced.  The dead needles are quite toxic to other plant life on the floor, again eliminating biodiversity.</p>  <p>  For most people this is news because for them forests are good and healthy open spaces.  This is the way it should be for everyone.  Local people should want to live near forestry and should have a say and a real input into the process of large developments in their area because forestry is a large development.  The Bill is about providing this opportunity to people and officially recognising the reality that everyone sees, which is that forestry is a development.  The existence of a forestry licensing system is not the reason to exclude this development from planning, any more than the licence for a quarry does not exclude it from planning.  A wind farm needs a licence to generate power but still needs planning permission.</p>  <p>  The Bill states there has to be more than 5 ha of forestry for it to require planning permission.  This is because I recognise that many farmers who want to plant some of their land would have 5 or 6 acres.  This would not require planning permission.  At present, the Government recognises that forestry of more than 50 ha needs planning permission, so this is recognised as a development, but where I come from, and I have looked at much of it in my parish and neighbouring parishes, farm after farm is planted.  In one area I counted more than 200 ha of forestry in one block, comprising several farms that were planted over a number of years.  This has a major impact on the environment and the landscape.  To break it down, if we have planning permission for 5 ha of forestry, we can ensure we can do something about this.</p>  <p>  When I was elected to Leinster House, I recognised several serious issues that needed to be dealt with in my constituency.  One was having planning permission for people to build houses in rural areas.  In most of Leitrim, people who want to build a house on their own land cannot get planning permission for it.  However, they see forestry covering the entire place and pushing out the people.</p> <p>I brought forward a Bill to deal with that.  I also recognised that forestation was a big problem and I brought forward this Bill to deal with that.  Every Deputy in this House is elected from a constituency and most of those constituencies will have their own small issue, whatever it may be, that is particular to that constituency.  I recognise that this issue is one that is very much particular to my constituency but if we are to be true to ourselves we will have to do something for our own people.  I would support any Deputy who raises an issue in this House that is affecting the community in their area to ensure they can do something to help them.  I hope I will get the same support from every Deputy here when it comes to this Bill to put planning permission in place for afforestation for every area in the country but particularly in areas like County Leitrim, which have been devastated by afforestation.</p> <p> The Government should allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage where we can deal with any legitimate issues or concerns that may need to be considered.  If the Government rejects this Bill it will be seen as a Government rejecting rural communities.  I ask it please not to do that and instead support my genuine effort in this Bill to give people, particularly those in County Leitrim, some say and some hope for their future.</p></speech>

I concur with many of the comments he made, many of which relate to broader forestry issues and are probably beyond the scope of the Bill.  However, I thank him for them.</p>  <p>  It is only a short while since we were in this Chamber debating the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, which sought to align some aspects of the forestry licensing process with the planning process.  As mentioned then, I and this Government are ambitious for Irish forestry.  It can continue to deliver multifunctional benefits for our society, the rural economy and our environment.  That will be key to delivering on many of the Government strategies and also on programme for Government commitments in this area.  If that is to be achieved it will have to be underpinned by an appropriate regulatory regime.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that I fully support a robust forestry licensing system.  As we as a society balance our need to plant, build roads and fell trees we must protect our landscape and our shared environment.  However, that does not mean we should have two parallel consent processes for the same development, which is what this Bill is proposing.  If there were some obvious deficiencies in the current consent procedures for forestry licensing applications greater than 5 ha I would be the first to address them.  I have seen what is currently involved in receiving approval and obtaining a licence.  It is a comprehensive and rigorous process.  Some would say it is too rigorous.  I do not agree with that and I am glad we have a consent process that demands stringent assessments of forest licensing applications.</p>  <p>  I will briefly reflect on what is involved.  All applications to build a forestry road or plant a woodland must be completed by professional foresters.  These applications must comply with detailed scheme conditions and requirements and they must be accompanied by maps and supporting documentation.  Scheme conditions for afforestation have evolved over the years.  Many of the concerns addressed by Deputy Kenny are reflective of previous policy.  The commonly held view that planting does not take any account of landscape or the need for diversity in planting no longer holds true.  All new planting must have up to 15% of open space and a minimum of 15% broadleaves.  I believe we planted more broadleaves this year than ever before.  That is a radical change from the legacy planting which is familiar to many people across the country and in Deputy Kenny's constituency in particular.  These new conditions will make for more amenable woodlands into the future.</p>  <p>  As everyone in the House is aware, the possible impact of forestry projects, or any development, on sensitive European sites must be carefully judged.  In the past 18 months, the Department has developed and introduced a suite of robust appropriate assessment procedures.  This needed to be done.  We have a well-resourced ecology unit within the Department to deal with appropriate assessment cases.</p>  <p>  As we look to the possible impacts on European sites we look to archaeological impacts also as we must protect our unique archaeological heritage.  In cases where a site is more than 50 ha an environmental impact assessment, EIA, is mandatory.  In cases where a site is less than 50 ha the Department will carry out a sub-threshold screening for an EIA.  If we were to ask for planning permission, what would that add to the process?</p>  <p>  The reason my Department is the competent authority is precisely because it has the expertise to adjudicate on what is a unique development, and forestry is considered a development.  We have had to change the way we do things to respond to European Court of Justice judgments and we have shown a willingness and an ability to do so.  Jim Mackinnon, who carefully reviewed our approval process, said that one clear strength of Ireland's approval system is that we use qualified foresters to assess licence applications.  He pointed out that this is not always the case in other jurisdictions and that a lack of that silviculture knowledge can lead to problems, something we do not have here, thankfully.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Kenny's proposals I must point out that forestry in this country is treated as a development and regulated in that fashion.  It is a consented activity and much more regularly assessed than crops such as horticulture, for example.  I believe that adding a second planning authority on top of the work of my Department would not add any benefit other than additional cost to and a regulatory burden on farmers and other applicants.</p>  <p>  It is important to note also that the decisions on licences are not taken in isolation.  The Department's spatial systems identify projects that need to be referred to prescribed bodies.  These include inland fisheries, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, An Taisce and the local authorities, which are widely consulted in many forestry applications.  We also refer cases, as appropriate, to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for its views.  I am pleased that local authorities have a direct influence on individual applications and I support that.</p>  <p>  The views of the public also play a crucial role in any consent system which may impact the environment.  The Aarhus Convention protects the public's right to access information on environmental matters.  This allows them to have their say in decision making.  The forestry licensing system respects that right.  Every forestry development, no matter how small, even one as small as 0.1 of a hectare, is open to public consultation.  The neighbour next door is able to send in a submission to the Department outlining any concerns he or she may have.  That also applies to environmental groups or any other interested party.  Ireland has the strongest public participation in forestry decision making in Europe.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that I recently introduced the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to this House.  I am pleased to say that it has been commenced and regulations to give effect to its provisions have been introduced.  The main purpose of the Act was to improve the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee.  I remind Deputies that any interested parties may appeal a decision of the Department to the Forestry Appeals Committee.  The committee is entirely independent of the Minister in terms of deciding upon individual appeals cases.  Again, it seems that there would be little sense in having two such appeals bodies, which would be An Bord Plean&aacute;la, should we have a planning approach to it, deciding on the same or similar matters, which is what the proposal in this Bill outlines.</p>  <p>  One clear message I am getting is that most people want immediate improvements to the appeals process and quicker turnaround times.  It is well known that we have faced challenges in issuing licences and that the Forestry Appeals Committee had a backlog of appeals.  We have taken steps to address both of those delays.  It would be a great shame if an unnecessary extra level of bureaucracy was now introduced, which undoubtedly would frustrate the process.</p>  <p>  Let us consider what is at stake here.  There are ambitious programme for Government commitments on forestry.  I am committed to making all efforts necessary to deliver on those commitments.  To do so we must have a responsible and responsive consent system.  The delivery of more than 8,000 ha of new planting and the construction of 125 km of forest roads per year, as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2019, is challenging enough.  Putting further barriers in that path for no discernible added value is at the very least undesirable in the current climate.</p>  <p>  No one can be immune to the effect of the current delays on the forestry sector, particularly on sawmills.  This is an industry which provides jobs and supports rural economies at a time when the economy is under pressure.  All of us use the wood products produced as a result.  As I mentioned, we are working hard to improve that situation, deliver quicker approvals and improve the appeals system.  That is why we cannot afford to support a Bill which in all likelihood would negatively impact on the delivery of licences for no discernible benefit.</p>  <p>The proposals being put forward today would be a disincentive to potential applicants.  There would be an increased level of complexity in dealing with the two consent authorities and additional costs would be incurred in paying for submission fees and, potentially, appeal fees.  Appellants would be affected as well because they would not know which of the consent authorities to apply to, and might even have to apply to both.  This would again involve additional costs for those who wish to take part in a consultative process.</p> <p> I have heard nothing from the proposer addressing the likely impact on local authority planning departments if this Bill were passed.  Those departments would face significant additional cost and resource burdens and there would be a duplication with the resources necessary in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to issue licences.  It is estimated that between 1,000 and 2,000 extra planning permission applications per year would go through local authorities.  This goes way beyond forestry issues and could displace other urgent development applications.  Has any consideration been given to the impact this could have on citizens who await other decisions from local authority planning departments?</p> <p> I confirm that the Government opposes this Bill on the grounds that it brings no added value to the forestry licensing system.  On the contrary, I believe it would add cost, complexity and further delays to an already overburdened process. </p></speech>

I thank Deputy Martin Kenny for bringing this Bill forward as it is worth debating.  We must decide what kind of system we are going to have.  Will we have a system with the councils or have the joke of a system that we have at the moment right around this country?  The Government talks about forestry but we do not have forestry in Ireland at the moment.  I will give the Minister of State a statistic.  Some 25,000 tonnes of timber logs have been imported from Scotland in the last month.  That is a fact.  That is the same as 200 ha of fully-grown timber coming into Ireland.  That is happening because the system here has just failed everybody.</p>  <p>  Since 2010, the Department has never hit a target.  Between 2016 and 2020, it only hit 56% of its so-called climate change targets under forestry.  The show goes on, the joke goes on, and 12,000 jobs are being lost.  The target number of felling licences to be issued in August was 75 and we achieved 56.  In September, it was 120 and we achieved 60.  We will be lucky if we get 2,000 ha done this year.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kenny introduced a Bill about septic tanks for one-off rural housing, which I support.  If someone applies to a rural local authority for planning permission, it can do an EIA and screen things out.  At the moment, applications are going into the Department and I do not know what it is doing with them.  Maybe the officials are making little paper planes out of them and flying them across to each other but they are there for a year or two and some of them are there for four or five.</p>  <p>  I was not going to bring up the Mackinnon report but the Minister of State mentioned it and spoke about what Jim Mackinnon said.  On 13 October, Deputy Sherlock asked if the Government was going to implement the Mackinnon report.  We have documentation that shows the former Minister, Deputy Creed, had the procurement done to appoint a person, whose name we knew.  The procurement document was put together by the former Minister of State, Andrew Doyle, and the then Minister, Deputy Creed.  At the moment, there is no Minister in control of forestry.  The same people have been at the same thing for the last ten years.  If I was involved in the job, I would have left it because I would be ashamed of the results we have had.  In its answer to Deputy Sherlock, the Department said that the chairperson will look at the feasibility of implementing the Mackinnon report.  I am not blaming the Minister of State or any other Minister for this because none of them are in the job long enough to be blamed.  The Department is saying it will keep control of forestry.  The politicians will come and go and the Department will do what it wants.  We should not be talking about broadleaf or narrow leaf, spruce or biodiversity, because this circus has gone on too long and no one can shout stop.  All I am saying is that we should be allowed decide whether permission is sought through a planning authority.  In fairness to every planning authority in this country, if one of them is beside a designated area or within 20 km of it, it is the appropriate authority to screen something out.  The planning authorities do it for houses day in, day out.</p>  <p>  I do not know about all the other box-ticking exercises because the applications for forestry licences are so complicated now, one would want about ten people ticking boxes.  There is one drop-down box where, if it is ticked wrong, 600 more questions come up.  That is how we have made them, to make sure we slow everything down.</p>  <p>  The timber is coming in now.  Timber is going to come in from Germany and Paddy in Ireland will be looking at the trees growing with no money in his pocket and the timber coming in as per usual.  The same is happening with the peat we are bringing in through Drogheda for mushroom compost.  That is the Ireland we live in now.  This is green Ireland, the great Ireland and great environment we are going to create.  I do not see any reason this Bill cannot go to a committee where we can tear it apart and flitter it but we need to do something.  We have no forestry programme in this country because we have closed our eyes and constantly believed the Department was going to do this, that and the other for four or five years.  I am not blaming Ministers for this but by Jesus, if we do not cop on, soon we will not have any industry in this country.  Some poor devils with payments of &euro;200,000 a year are about to lose their machines. </p></speech>

I support it as it is an important Bill.  I listened to the Minister of State and it was difficult to know exactly what she meant.  On one level she seemed to agree with the principle of what Deputy Kenny was proposing but on another level, she claimed it was too complicated and would be a parallel system, etc.  She spoke of a system that was working and of forestry policy, but we do not have a forestry policy.  We have state aid, grant aid and tax incentives.  We follow the money, not the policy, because we do not have policy.  We are told we need to plant more trees, as if that in itself would solve the problem, without thinking at all about the settlement patterns we have in this country.  We cannot imagine that it is like Scotland, France or the vast areas in certain countries where nobody lives.  We need a proper forestry policy that takes into consideration where people live.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke of 15% broadleaf.  When the European Commission approved the state aid requirement in order that people could be paid grant aid to plant forestry, it requested 30% broadleaf.  Up to a year ago, the Government was telling the Commission that it would be 30% so I am fascinated to hear it is now 15%.  I raised the issue of Sitka planting in Leitrim with a very senior EU official and he said that Leitrim is a national sacrifice zone for Sitka spruce, which is a phrase I have used many times and needs to be said again.  Those were his words, not mine, and they are as powerful as one can get.  One of the reasons we need planning permission for forestry is that in 2019, two one-off houses were granted planning permission in County Leitrim.  I do not know how many hectares of forestry were involved, though I am sure Deputy Kenny would, but hundreds if not thousands of hectares were planted the same year.</p>  <p>  Staying with the EU, the Minister of State mentioned the environmental impact assessment directive. </p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>One thing we do not do here is look at the cumulative effects.  As the Minister of State knows, the Commission wants to take Ireland to court for that, which is once again an indication that we have no policy.  I am fascinated to hear a Green Minister of State say that the Aarhus Convention is working.  I spent 15 years in Brussels and all I ever heard from citizens was that there was no proper access to justice and that part of the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p> We have no forestry policy and that has created two groups, those who are totally opposed to planting and those who fully support it.  They cannot find any middle ground and there needs to be middle ground because we need to plant trees for many different reasons.  We need to keep our sawmills moving and plants such as Masonite in Leitrim need timber.  Equally, we need to involve farmers and to promote agroforestry, especially under Pillar 2.  I believe that is what the Minister of State will do.  When we talk about planting more trees, we need to take into consideration where they are being planted and the impact that they have on the landscape and the people who live there.  The reason there is such a visceral hatred of trees in parts of Leitrim is because people's homes are being surrounded by Sitka spruce.  They are marching across the landscape and people feel as if there is nothing they can do.</p> <p> The Minister of State has a significant job ahead of her.  Planning permission for forestry will form an important part of that proper forestry policy that takes into consideration where people live and who will be involved, such as farmers, and that the incentives will go to farmers.  The Ceann Comhairle is being generous with time.  I cannot impress enough on the Minister of State that she has a difficult job to bring these groups of people together.  If she can manage that, she will do a good job, and Deputy Martin Kenny's proposal is a good place to start.</p></speech>

At the time, it was lively.  The Rural Independent Group was assured by the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, that the Bill would strengthen the present system, allowing more people to look at the licence system without delay.  In reality, nothing has happened.  I understood that the forestry appeals committee was to immediately split into divisions so that multiple appeals could be dealt with simultaneously, and nothing has happened.  I understood that oral hearings were to cease and that there was to be an appeals process without oral hearings, and again, nothing has happened.  I understood that additional resources were to be allocated to increase the capacity of the FAC.  I understood that the rapid acceleration in the rates of appeals being processed was being taken on board.  The Government needs to enact the legislation.</p>  <p>  I call on the chief forest service inspector to explain why this has not been enforced.  How do we clear the backlog?  There are currently approximately 20 appeals heard per month and time is wasted on oral hearings.  Sawmills have run out of timber.  No planting programme is in place for the year ahead.  Staff are being laid off throughout the country.  The industry is in crisis.  I want answers as to why nothing has happened.  Who is responsible for the failure of what the Minister of State said was being enacted three weeks ago?  Is it the senior chief forest service inspector or does the responsibility lie with her or the Minister, Deputy McConalogue?  This industry is in crisis.  I call on her to set a target of 30 appeals per week to clear the backlog and to try to get confidence back in the industry.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies have asked about planning commissions.  Limerick is no different from any other county.  Planning permissions are being rejected all around our county because they are using the 2040 plan.  If the Minister of State does not get her act in gear, she will have destroyed forestry in this country and 12,000 jobs.  The buck stops here.  Who is responsible for the jobs?  Who is responsible for the forestry?  Who is responsible for results?  If the persons who are responsible cannot do their job, they should get out of it.  We can see the failures in certain Departments on delivering on issues such as this across the country.  I ask that if people cannot do their job or enforce what they are supposed to enforce, they should get out of it and give it to somebody who can actually do it.  When it comes to the 2040 plan, all it has done is stop the building of houses in rural Ireland.  That is what it has stopped in Limerick and other counties, because of the environmental impact.  If the Government cannot get that right, how does it expect to get forestry right?</p></speech>

It is only a few weeks ago that we were discussing forestry here in great detail.  The Minister of State was not prepared to take any amendments at the time.  It looks like she is in the same frame of mind right now, that it is her way or the highway.  Does she realise that there are 12,000 jobs at risk in rural Ireland?  Forestry and timber are critical for anyone who cares about rural development and rural jobs in Ireland.  There are 500 jobs in my own constituency with GP Woods in Enniskeane in west Cork and its associated companies.  This is a &euro;2.3 billion industry.</p>  <p>  The industry estimates that 2 million tonnes of timber are held up in the appeals and licensing application process in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is enough timber to build 100,000 houses.  Timber shortages are close at hand.  There will be an immediate problem for Ireland's housebuilding programme when timber starts to run short.  Imports are expensive and hard to come by right now, with strong demand for timber worldwide.  GP Woods has managed to source some supply and it will start to arrive next month, which goes against everything they have stood for.  It is being shipped across Europe, there is an environmental impact and it supports jobs outside our own country.</p>  <p>  The appeals debacle is also holding up many afforestation projects and farmers are the collateral damage.  They are stuck in the middle.  They cannot plant and they cannot harvest.  The Government and the Green Party cannot hit their tree planting targets while all this is going on.  Delays are killing the tree planting programme.  Imagine that 1,500 ha will be planted this year when the Government's target was meant to be 8,000 ha per annum.  The impact on our climate change goals is substantial.  Tree planting is a key weapon in the fight against climate change.  The difference will be millions of tonnes of CO2 left in the atmosphere because the trees have not been planted to soak it up.  We need to use more wood and the way that we get it is to plant our own forest and to stimulate more use of wood in our built environment.  It is critical for legislation to be implemented quickly and then backed up by resources.  The Department must be ready and able to implement the reforms contained within the Bill immediately once it is approved by the Oireachtas.  There can be no delays in making this happen.  Will the Minister of State assure us that this is under way?</p>  <p>  The fee is critical and must be introduced immediately.  She must ensure that all necessary resources are in place to make the reforms work.  Legislation is no good unless people are hired to enable the output of the FAC to increase.  I understand that the committee is in the process of hiring additional personnel.  It is critical for this to happen immediately and for the numbers to be sufficient.</p> <p>There is a belief in the sector that at least ten extra people are needed.  The forestry appeals committee, FAC, should be targeting getting through more than 20 appeals per week instead of the current 20 appeals per month.  The concept of the FAC meetings in divisions is critical.  The running of multiple divisions in parallel is what will achieve the throughput.  The other important reform is the removal of an automatic right to an oral hearing.  The FAC should decide that oral hearings are required in only a minority of cases.</p> <p> In the longer term, we must move away from the licensing system in forestry and change the regulatory model.  It should not be necessary to apply for a new licence at every stage in the process.  That is a waste of time and resources, and it is inhibiting the development of the sector.  In other countries there is greater reliance on a forest management plan that is approved, implemented and monitored.  It is a far more efficient system.  The Department has failed the industry badly in this area for the past number of years.  This industry is coming through the Covid-19 crisis well, yet it is being damaged by our failure to provide an adequate regulatory platform.  Without the platform being right, the industry cannot grow and prosper.</p> <p> The reason I stayed in the House tonight, because I have to return to the Mizen Peninsula, is that I want to fight tooth and nail for 500 jobs in west Cork.  There are 12,000 throughout the nation.  GP Wood has run an excellent company in the past number of years in west Cork.  It is employing people from Bandon, Dunmanway, Drimoleague, Skibbereen and Bantry.  There are also the suppliers and the lorry drivers.  These jobs are in jeopardy at present, yet we are talking about importing timber into the country.  That is phenomenal.  I also support every farmer who has suffered due to serial objectors.  Their intention, I presume, was to save forestry, but they have had the opposite effect.  Only 1,500 ha will be sown this year in this country instead of 8,000 ha.  The people who are objecting should hang their heads in shame, given what they have cost us in this country.  Farmers have been great supporters of the growth of trees, but they are totally opposed to it at present until all these measures are rectified.  With jobs on the line as well, I certainly will support this Bill.</p></speech>

Make no mistake, he represents the views of the people of not only County Leitrim but many other communities.  That has been well and fairly articulated by his constituency colleague, Deputy Harkin, tonight.  The Minister of State is new to the job and I know she has an interest in this area, but she appears to have made the same mistake that many Ministers make when they arrive in a new Department.  She believes the officials in her Department are acting in good faith.  The Department, particularly the forest section, has made an absolute hames of forestry policy in this State.  We learned this week in the agriculture committee that the native ash tree, one of the trees synonymous with our country and which is associated with one of our most popular national sports, is likely to become extinct.  Some genius thought it was okay to allow the importation of ash into Ireland.  Who would believe it?  Not only that, it was imported from countries that were known to have a prevalence of dieback.  That was imported into the State as part of our so-called forestry policy and, according to the evidence provided to the committee this week, will more than likely ensure there is no ash at all in this country.  That is a travesty, and just the latest in a long line of travesties when it comes to forestry policy.</p>  <p>  I am a massive advocate for forestry.  Forestry can play a crucial role on many different levels.  I have said that on numerous occasions and I will continue to say it because there are opportunities in it for rural economies.  We have heard other speakers talk about the jobs involved in local forestry.  When forestry policy is carried out correctly, it can be a vibrant industry, not something that is just left sitting for up to 30 years after which a couple of large multinational corporations come in, take the benefits from it and destroy the local roads while they are at it.  It can be something that can thrive and keep a local timber production industry going and keep people employed in its administration and maintenance.  When forestry is carried out correctly, there can be an associated tourism benefit with it.</p>  <p>  Forestry policy should be good for the environment, but what have we done in the constituency of Deputies Martin Kenny and Harkin?  We have allowed forests to be planted on bog land.  This is the ingenious forestry policy employed by the Department.  We have damaged the environment by planting forests.  The land was more beneficial to the environment before it was touched than when it was planted.  That should ring alarm bells for the Minister of State.  An entire local community is up in arms, and rightly so.  I have walked the roads of the communities along with Deputy Martin Kenny in my capacity as a Member of the European Parliament.  I have walked them not only with local representatives and communities but also with international forestry experts.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the European organisation, Fern.  Deputy Martin Kenny and I took its representatives to County Leitrim.  They addressed public meetings and spent days on end doing what I hope the Minister of State will do some day, which is looking at the forestry and what it means for biodiversity, local economic development and for community buy-in.  Fern included County Leitrim in a publication as an example of worst practice, so all over Europe, governments and agriculture Departments are shown an example of how not to do forestry.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State accept there is a massive failure in policy?  That would be a good place to start, whether she comes from that position or she thinks that what we have is broadly okay and just might need tweaking.  Too many of her predecessors have thought the latter.  If she accepts there is an absolute failing, she must make a decision on where she should look for the answers.  She will have to make a call as to whether she looks within her Department and to the people who have stood over and allowed this situation to develop.  If she decides to do that, we are on the road to nowhere.  Some 1,500 ha was mentioned with regard to what will be developed this year.  That is a stark, clear statistic.  If the Minister of State does that, we will continue with failed policies, perhaps tweaks here and there and thousands of jobs and opportunities lost.</p>  <p>  If, however, the Minister of State comes at it from a different angle, which I hope she will, where she accepts there is a failing and that it has to be addressed, who will she look to for answers?  There is nobody better than Deputy Martin Kenny and the community he represents with this legislation.  This is a choice.  Yes, there is a licensing regime in the Department, but local communities do not trust the Department in this regard.  They do not believe it has their interests at heart.  They trust their local authority to a far greater degree.</p> <p>That is because their local authority is made up of people who actually come from their communities, live in their communities and who have planning experts in place.  They say they are probably more frustrated than anybody because they see bad planning practices happening all the time.  They see big land grabs taking place where local farming communities are denied the opportunity to purchase land because big pension funds are coming in and purchasing the land or big agri-businesses and blanket planting it with Sitka spruce in order to offset emissions that they are building up somewhere else.  That is not what forestry should and could be used for.  I hear all the time about the proportions that need to be in place of 15% broadleaf but 15% does not come close to what we need.  It is not even a fraction of what is needed.</p> <p> We have invasive species in forests that are not suited to the Irish environment.  I mentioned that I go through forests.  I love forests.  There is nothing I love more than walking around Rossmore Park or D&uacute;n na R&iacute; forest park or Lough Key Forest Park.  Anywhere I go I love to walk around a forest.  A forest is something that people should want to visit and it is something people should want to live beside.  When the people who live beside forests are telling the Minister of State that they feel the place is suffocating them and is taking every piece of life out of their community then there is a problem.  I urge the Minister of State to do something bold and imaginative and to show a bit of vision in allowing this Bill to go to Committee Stage.  Let us have a debate on it and if there are genuine issues then let us thrash them out.  If the 5 ha should be 6 ha or 10 ha, let us thrash that out but I urge the Minister of State to show a bit of vision where her predecessors did not.  This is a massive opportunity for the Minister of State and I fear that she is just letting it slip by, and that she is just going along the route the officials have set out for her.  She will be gone in five years' time and the officials will still be in place and they will still be pursuing the same failed policy.  I believe that would be a travesty.</p></speech>

I could see from the comments that were made that there is a shared vision.  I would like to think I share that vision with them of a much better forestry model, one that is good for the environment and where communities will want to live beside forests and be surrounded by the right type of forests.  That is my intent and my vision for forestry.</p>  <p>  Deputies Harkin and Carthy highlighted the 15% minimum target for broadleaves.  I agree that it is a minimum and that it could well be more.  That is certainly something I will look into.  This year so far, of the trees planted, 36% are broadleaf so we have done quite well, even in a bad year and I hope we can improve on that in the future.  There is a wider context here in that the State is facing a very big challenge at the moment.  We have testing and uncertain times and the demands on public services and the public purse are substantive.  To introduce another layer in terms of a requirement for planning permission for forestry when we have a system in place to deal with forestry would involve unnecessary duplication not only of effort but of resources in particular at this time when neither would be good practice.</p>  <p>  My Department has a cohort of experts to deal with licensing applications.  I am on the record many times acknowledging the problems of the past; the poor planning decisions; the poor ways we planted trees that were, for example, too close to rivers and too close to homes.  Members should be aware that it would not happen today.  The system has changed, even in the past 18 months, and it is something I want to improve further in the future.  The licensing system has improved in recent times and is robust.  The resource implications of looking at the issue from a planning perspective as well as a licensing perspective is a highly unnecessary duplication.  As I indicated in my opening statement, we engage widely with a number of bodies, including local authorities.  Currently, local authorities play a significant role in many forestry applications.  They are consulted if there is a question of a scenic area being affected or if a proposed forest is close to a Natura site, so it is not as if local authorities have no part to play in the process currently.  They play a very useful part.</p>  <p>  As part of the forestry licensing system, all parties have direct access to the appeals committee.  The Bill proposes that parties would have to access the forestry appeals committee, FAC, and also An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The question is which they would choose.  That is another unnecessary layer.  We have worked hard to improve the system within the FAC.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy O'Donoghue's comments, the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was enacted on 8 October.  We have three committees now ready to hear the scheduled hearings.  That shows how quickly we have moved since the enactment, which is only a couple of weeks ago.  I hope that will result in a turnaround in the number of appeals heard.</p>  <p>  Open and transparent access to information is an important part of the planning process and the forestry licensing process.  We will shortly echo the access that exists for planning applications in the forestry licensing process by the launch on our website of a forestry licence viewer.  This online portal will make available easily accessible information on forestry licence applications in alignment with the current planning process.  If we accepted the Bill we could potentially have two systems whereby applicants would have to look at the planning site and the forestry licensing process.</p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned the Mackinnon report, as I did in my opening statement.  I have plans to implement further changes as soon as possible.  I intend to look anew at the Mackinnon report.  The purpose of appointing a chair is not to implement the report but to advise the Minister on implementing the report.  I certainly will look at that very shortly and I look forward to doing so.</p>  <p>  Turning to the future of forestry in Ireland, the licensing system is integral to it.  We face many challenges but we also have a vista of new opportunities.  We want to build a model that is more sustainable, which attracts farmers, holds the attention of businesses, is good for communities, is good for the environment and biodiversity and is good for local rural economies.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, if we do introduce more complexity and cost at this stage, it will strongly hamper our efforts.  Therefore, I reiterate our opposition to the Bill.</p></speech>

I am most interested in her notion that planning departments in local authorities throughout the country would be swamped and unable to cope.  In my parish in County Leitrim, only two houses have been built in the past ten years.  The planning units will have absolutely no problem coping with the workload.  The last time the Green Party was in government, it worked hand in glove with Fianna F&aacute;il to support developers to cover the country in houses.  We had nothing but ghost housing estates all over the place.  The planning authorities were able to cope then and they will have no problem dealing with the forestry issue.  Indeed, they want to do it.  I spoke to somebody in Leitrim County Council in recent weeks about what happens when there is a consultation on a licensing application.  The person told me the applications are always replied to and sent in, but the council staff know it makes no difference.  They know they will not be listened to.  He said the only reason they send the applications in at all is that if somebody checked, there would be blue murder if the council had not made any response.</p> <p>They know it is not listened to.  They are totally discounted and have no say in the situation whatsoever.</p> <p> The Minister of State spoke about the licensing process.  Everybody knows it does not work.  The forestry policy does not work.  There should be a planning policy first which would then consult with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine rather than the other way round.  That is the problem.  I suggest that planning is put first.  The local authority not only looks at afforestation but also at every other development in the region, along with the environmental, societal, tourism and other impacts.</p> <p> The Minister of State would be against ribbon development, as I would be against it in most cases.  She would not like to see one house after another along roads stretching out through rural communities.  Nobody has any problem, however, with ribbon development of forestry with townland after townland covered in trees and no people left.  That is the reality for many people living in many parts of County Leitrim.</p> <p> Recently the Minister of State's party colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Noonan, came to Drumkeeran in north Leitrim to visit the site of a landslide near the Dawn of Hope Bridge.  That landslide was caused by afforestation.  A landslip occurred on the top of a mountain that was covered with blanket bog.  It had been planted with forestry when it should not have been touched for a whole range of environmental reasons.  The local authority staff on site told us that if they had any say in it, they would not have allowed that forestry to be planted there.  However, they had no say in it.  It is still the same today.</p> <p> The Minister of State can try to hoodwink me and everyone to the effect that, somehow or other, it is going to be different this time.  We all know it is going to be no different because the same people will be in charge.  All they care about is the timber production industry and feeding that industry.  They do not care about the people or the damage they do to the rural environment.  They care about nothing else but timber production.</p> <p>The Minister of State indicated that local authorities have got some sense of being able to have a duplicate of a process and that there would be two processes happening.  Somehow or other, it is felt that if the local authorities were doing it, they would not have the expertise.  They have the expertise, however, for every other kind of development that arises.  If somebody wants to put up wind turbines or install a farm of solar panels, the local authorities have the expertise.  A local authority has to dig deep, find the expertise and provide it.  In general, they do it very well, yet the Minister is not prepared to trust them with afforestation.  That just baffles people.</p> <p> The reasons the Minister of State put forward for opposing this are basically nonsense.  Everyone knows that the process that the Minister of State is putting forward as the one that works is the process that has failed.  It has failed rural communities, biodiversity and everything to do with the environment.  The only people who have profited are the small handful who make all the money.  The Minister of State wants to continue with that process.</p> <p> As my colleague said earlier, it is time to do something bold.  It is time to stand up to the people in the Department and say that we want to do it differently.  There has been much controversy about the mother and baby homes and another Green Party Minister, for whom I have  a great deal of respect, is being led by the nose on that matter as well.  The Minister of State should not be like that.  She must do something bold and different.  She must stand up and have a little bit of gumption in respect of this matter.  Ordinary people will appreciate it if she makes a stand.  Even if she thinks she will be unpopular among the handful of advisers around her for doing so, it will pay dividends for her.  If she bends over, is pliable and goes with the flow, as everyone who gets into government wants to do, she will not be there very long.</p> <p> That is a travesty because I understand that green politics are international.  Many young people have a huge gr&aacute; for the environmental process and what the green movement is about throughout the world.  However, when the Greens get into government in places like Ireland, they cock it up.  The Greens should not do proceed to Committee Stage where we can debate it and work it out.  We can then make progress because we want to work with the Minister of State and not against her.</p> <p> Please do not set us up for another failure.  The Minister of State should not say to the people who live in rural County Leitrim, who have been failed for so long, that she is going to preside over further failure.  Do not do that; do something bold.  She should support this Bill to go to Committee Stage.  We will work with her and will try to do the right thing because I want to see afforestation that is positive for my local community.  I want to see jobs in my local community but what we have is not that.  The Minister of State said that it is historical.  I can tell her that it is right now.  I can bring her to places where farms and lands have been planted with thousands of acres of forestry.  There is nothing else there for people.  That is wrong and it should not happen.  There needs to be a better process.</p> <p> The Minister of State should do the right thing, in her own interests and in those of her party.  She should show people that she is prepared to do something different.  She should show that she will not be led by the forestry industry and its people in the Department who are driving this.  She should stand up for the ordinary people who are the victims in all of this.  She has that opportunity and I hope she takes it on this occasion.</p></speech>
