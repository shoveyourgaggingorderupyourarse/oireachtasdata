    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700003#A00300"><p>Tairgim: "Go l&eacute;ifear an Bille don Dara hUair anois."</p>  <p>  I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>I am hoping it will be third time lucky for my Thirty-seventh amendment of the Constitution (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Bill.  We debated it first in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il in May 2015, then in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il in March 2017 and now in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il today.</p>  <p>  Why do I keep resubmitting this Bill for debate?  It is because of its importance to our human rights.  It is because of the constitutional protections we would have, namely, the right to adequate housing, to join a trade union of our choice, to health and mental health, to participate in culture and to benefit from scientific progression.  All of those are very important human rights, but even more so in the shadow of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I keep resubmitting this Bill in the hope of some light bulb moment where the majority of Deputies would realise that it is right to do the right thing.  I do so because we signed up to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1973, ratified it in 1989, and have done nothing on it since.  It is because a previous Government set up a Constitutional Convention which, in its final meeting in February 2013, discussed this exact issue and 85% of members voted in favour of amending the Constitution for inclusion of these rights, to be realised progressively and within available resources.</p>  <p>  I am not naive enough to believe that the Government will accept this important human rights Bill this time around.  To think that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would accept a Bill that would mean legislation would be based on human rights is laughable.  I have heard all the arguments against accepting the Bill over the years and still none of them stack up.  If anything, this past year of unprecedented times in a global pandemic has shown us that this Bill is important now more than ever.</p>  <p>  Over the years, most of the Opposition parties and groupings have spoken in support of the Bill and voted for it.  I note also that, in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, when the Green Party was on the Opposition benches, Deputies Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin, who are now Ministers, supported this Bill.  Does that mean that the Green Party will ensure that the Government will accept the Bill and that all of its Members will support it this time around?  What arguments could they possibly have against it, although they have changed their tune regarding the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and seem to be haemorrhaging members?</p>  <p>  In fairness, the Labour Party originally introduced this Bill back in the 2000s and then again in 2012 but by the time they were in government in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il and I attempted to bring it forward, they had found reasons to vote against it.  I note that now that its Members are on the Opposition benches they have returned to their original policy stance.  It is amazing to see how policies and priorities change once a party gets into government.</p>  <p>  The economic, social and cultural rights initiative, ESCRI, was a coalition of over 60 civil society organisations that supported strengthening the protection of economic, social and cultural rights in the Irish Constitution.  More than 60 organisations, including Amnesty International, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Children&rsquo;s&rsquo; Rights Alliance, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and many others, were involved.  In 2017, the ESCR initiative held a conference in the Mansion House in Dublin entitled Making Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Meaningful.  The event brought together a range of stakeholders to discuss how enforceable economic, social and cultural, ESC, rights such as housing and health would impact on individuals and groups in Ireland, drawing on experiences from other states where ESC rights have been given legal protection.</p> <p>Imagine having legal protection.  There was much momentum and goodwill behind this important campaign.<br/><br/>In preparation for this debate, I contacted some of those civil society organisations and also Mr. Aiden Lloyd, who was integral to the initiative.  To my dismay, Mr. Lloyd told me that they &quot;wound up the ESCR Initiative a few years ago as it was clear that the Government had no intention of implementing the recommendation of the Convention on the Constitution&quot;.  Mr. Lloyd continued, stating &quot;prior to winding up we had spoken to ICCL about taking on the brief, but they are already operating with meagre resources to fulfil their civil and political rights objectives.&quot;  Based on his years of campaigning, Mr. Lloyd said &quot;I think there is good support among some politicians and civil society groups for ESC rights to be written into the Constitution but unfortunately without resources it was impossible for us to continue as an advocacy group.&quot;<br/><br/>It is a pity to see dedicated and active campaigners and organisers become so despondent with Government policy that they cannot continue their fight.  The Minister of State will say that some of the things the Government brought about included the referendum on marriage equality, but that happened because of people power, public readiness and willingness for that campaign and people sharing their stories and mobilising in their communities.  He will also say that the Government made history when it declared that members of the Traveller community are an ethnic minority.  Do not get me started on how this and previous Governments have and continue to let down members of the Traveller community in the most heinous ways.  I will come back to this point.<br/><br/>Amnesty Ireland still has an informative section on its website relating to the campaign for economic, social and cultural rights, which had been funded through the Atlantic Philanthropies.  Amnesty's website states:</p><blockquote>	We are working to strengthen the protection of economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights, like the rights to health, housing and to an adequate standard of living in Ireland.  By putting ESC rights into Irish law the Government would be guaranteeing everyone in Ireland a life of dignity to the extent that our resources allow. It would mean decisions made by the Government must contribute to the delivery of these rights.  This includes a guarantee that every single one of us can access, at the very least, an adequate standard of living. </blockquote> <p>There is also a useful section relating to frequently asked questions and other resources and information that can be used to bust myths, including fallacious claims about the separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary and that the Oireachtas would lose powers in respect of taxation legislation.  I have been in touch with Amnesty, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the European Anti-Poverty Network and others because in non-Covid times we would have held a press conference and a photocall and tried to raise the profile of this important Bill.<br/><br/>I will outline reasons why I feel so strongly about the need for this Bill.  When the troika went to Portugal, it was not able to destroy its public housing system because it is constitutionally protected.  We need that here.  The right to join a union should not be left to the whim of a political class that has always danced to the tune of big business.  The Convention on the Constitution scrutinised this provision.  Some 85% of the members of the convention - ordinary, everyday people - agreed that these rights need constitutional protection.  Why have successive Governments failed to act on the will of the people?  It is the people's Constitution after all.<br/><br/>This Bill would be an anchor for the rights to housing, health and education to be provided for on the basis of need at all times.  It would give Irish citizens a strengthened right to hold the Government to account for how the State manages affairs and would put the people of Ireland at the centre of Government.  The right to a home is fundamental to happiness and the foundation for so much else in society as it gives people stability to plan and participate in an active, positive life.  The separation of powers argument does not hold water.  More than 11 countries, including such radical places as Germany, Portugal and Finland, have these rights protected in their constitutions.  Why can we not do it here?<br/><br/>As a nation, we are renowned for our contribution to music and the arts.  Being able to enjoy both is an important part of a fulfilling life.  It should not be the preserve of the rich.  Everyone should have the right to take part and enjoy cultural life.<br/><br/>Covid-19 has brought devastation to our island and to the world but it has given us an opportunity.  I believe that we need to follow a zero Covid strategy and use the time this would give us to plan and reset.  The Constitution is used as a barrier to much progressive legislation by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il but in March of last year we saw a different type of governing.  The pandemic and the global crisis showed that steps could be taken for the majority and not just the few.  Evictions were stopped, rents were frozen, private hospitals were taken into the public service and there was new-found appreciation for the front-line workers in our supermarkets, food delivery services and the eye-watering demands that are placed on the health service.  Communities came together.</p> <p>We were told that we were all in this together and people believed it, until the Government faltered.  While formation of the grand coalition took place, it actually led to the falling apart of the governing of our country.  Egos got in the way of public good.  Personalities wanted to be to the fore to make big announcements and some went off to Clifden to celebrate the lockdown with golf and a dinner.  The difference with the elite classes and the idea of there being one rule for them and another for us started to grate.  Residents of nursing homes died as the virus spread so quickly.  Residents in direct provision were also left behind.  Workers in meat factories were made to work, which led to Covid-19 outbreaks.  It is happening again now.  </p> <p> The property rights in the Constitution are constantly used and regurgitated as reasons we cannot have an effective solution to the housing crisis.  Yet, the Minister will say there is no need for a right to housing in the Constitution, because the Government should be trusted to provide legislative measures to ensure there is sufficient and affordable housing.  The housing and homeless crisis is of the Government's making.  It is the fault of the present and previous Governments that there are thousands of children who are forced to experience homelessness, that people have died by suicide because of their housing situations, never mind their inability to access timely mental health support.  It is the fault of the present and previous Governments that more homeless people have died on our streets in the past year than in many other years.  This crisis and these tragedies are of the Government's making.  Then the Government asks the Opposition and the public to trust it, tells us we do not need constitutional protection and that it will look after us all.  It only looks after the rich and the landlord classes, the real estate investment trusts and those who profiteer from this basic human right: the right to shelter, to an adequate place to live, to a home.  Last week RT&Eacute; investigated an issue which some of my colleagues have been raising here consistently.  That is the difference.  I will talk about it later but that is why I will not be accepting the amendment the Government is putting forward.  I do not believe it is well meant.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; seo an tr&iacute;&uacute; huair uaidh chun an Bille seo a chur tr&iacute;d an D&aacute;il.

Is &eacute; sin an m&eacute;id at&aacute; i gceist.  N&iacute; rud radacach ach rud thar a bheith r&eacute;as&uacute;nta agus bun&uacute;sach at&aacute; i gceist.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic and I thank my colleague, Deputy Pringle for his persistence and hard work.  It is the third time he has put this Bill before the D&aacute;il.  On the last occasions he did not succeed but the blame certainly was not on him.  It was on the two Governments that failed to support it, notwithstanding our very serious obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  That covenant was signed and arose out of the horror and the pain of the Second World War.  It was introduced on 16 December 1966, and came into law in 1976.  We signed it on 1 October, as my colleague said.  We signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  We took our time until we ratified it.  We waited until 1989, I believe, 16 years later.  We signed the optional protocol in 2012 but we did not ratify it.  This is very important because without ratifying it, there is no recourse for the citizen who is affected by the failures of various Governments.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that later today, we will be asked to sanction the appointment of two new members to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, one of whom is Emily Logan, a much respected woman.  I am singling her out because she was a commissioner in the Irish Human rights and Equality Commission that made a very strong submission on the last occasion we were examined by the UN committee on how we were implementing this covenant.  I read as much as I could of the submission, which runs to over 100 pages.  It refers to the Constitutional Convention that recommended that we amend the Constitution and look at implementing it in national legislation.</p> <p>That recommendation has been ignored.  Ms Logan, together with her small, hard-working team of colleagues at the time, drew attention to many issues, including the harsh impact of the austerity cuts on services and supports for the most marginalised.  She referred to the absence of the incorporation into our legislation or Constitution of rights that would give a basic threshold below which any Government could not go when it is implementing austerity cuts, some of which are still in being.</p> <p> I have read the Government amendment and it is an insult.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Pringle, will come back to this.  The Government is proposing that the Bill be deemed to be read a Second Time in 18 months without any explanation as to why that postponement is necessary.  We are not asking the Government to rush through legislation in the manner in which it has rushed through so many Bills in the past year.  Against our better instincts on occasions, we helped the Government in that regard and stood in solidarity with it for the greater common good.  This Bill is for the greater common good.  Why it would be put back for 18 months is beyond my comprehension.  I struggle to understand why the Government would do that.  The amendment suggests that it is to give time to tease out the "complex issues concerned".  There is nothing complex about basic human rights in the matter of social, economic and cultural issues.  Certainly, the implications of the provisions in the Bill may have consequences for any Government that it would not like.  I can understand that part, but the rights themselves are not complex.  We talk about rights all of the time.  The Government is going to put the Bill back for 18 months and, in the meantime, the Department is going to look at it.  I have no faith in that proposal whatsoever and I am not sure how the Green Party can accept it.  I really do not want to bring parties into this but I have to bring in the Green Party because its Members supported my colleague's Bill on the previous occasion.  How has its position changed and why do we need another 18 months of a window to consider the Bill?  It is just not acceptable.</p> <p> Many countries have not only signed and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights but they also have ratified the protocol to the convention.  We are talking about 171 parties or signatories.  I mentioned the Convention on the Constitution back in 2013 and 2014, where the members voted in favour of amending the Constitution to strengthen the protection of economic, social and cultural rights.  They also recommended that there should be a constitutional provision to the effect that the State would provide progressively - I ask the Minister of State to listen to that word - not overnight, but progressively, for those rights.  That is provided for in the wording of the Bill that Deputy Pringle has before the D&aacute;il today.  It sets out that the Government would progressively realise the economic, social and cultural rights of citizens and that this duty would be cognisable by the courts.  The Convention on the Constitution went on to identify a number of specific rights in regard to housing, social security, rights for people with disabilities and cultural rights, which it said should be enumerated in the Constitution.  The difficulty of not having them in the Constitution is that the courts, which rightly have a great respect for the separation of powers, do not want to be seen to make law.  On many occasions, they have pointed the finger back at the Government in this regard.  It is the duty of legislators to bring in legislation in order that the courts can enforce it.  Unfortunately, Government has utterly failed in that regard.</p> <p> We are talking about economic, social and cultural rights in a context where - I had to check the figure myself because it is so startling - 56 people died in the first 11 months of last year in one homeless situation or another.  At one stage, we had 10,500 homeless people in the State; the number is slightly fewer than that now.  There is still not recognition that this is a direct consequence of our policies on housing and health.  Indeed, in the case of the pandemic, the consequences of it are much worse because our public health system was not fit for purpose.  We knew that beforehand.  All we are asking the Government to do today is to make our Constitution mean something in terms of social, economic and cultural rights.  We all acknowledge that it can only be done on a progressive basis and we ask that the Government take it from here.  Putting the Bill back 18 months is not good enough.  I hope that the Minister of State will have a little sense in this regard.</p> <p>T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh ciall cheannaithe aige - tuigfidh s&eacute; an t&eacute;arma &quot;ciall cheannaithe&quot; - agus go bhfuil rud foghlamtha aige agus ag an Rialtas &oacute;n bpaind&eacute;im agus &oacute; na ciorruithe tromch&uacute;iseacha a cuireadh i bhfeidhm in 2010, 2011 agus 2013 at&aacute; f&oacute;s ag lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh.  T&aacute; na ciorruithe sin ag d&eacute;anamh idirdheal&uacute; idir na daoine boichte agus na daoine is saibhre.  Indeed, we saw recently the figures on the billionaires who have increased their percentage of wealth over the course of the pandemic.  Words fail me regarding the amount of wealth they have.  What if all that falls on deaf ears?<br/><br/>Perhaps we can look to Professor Eoin O'Sullivan of Trinity College Dublin, whom I believe co-authored the book <i>Suffer the Little Children</i>with Mary Raftery.  They have not been thanked in the manner they should have been.  Professor O'Sullivan highlights that even if a government does not buy the humanitarian argument, there is an argument that what I propose is just more cost-effective.  According to him, while it is difficult to obtain an exact figure - I am not sure why it is because we are able to put a price on everything, and we are not able to put a value on anything - it costs between &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000 per year to keep someone in emergency accommodation in Dublin alone.  I could go on but my time is up.  The same figures apply to our failure to deal with mental illness, housing and health.  T&aacute; costas i bhfad n&iacute;os tromch&uacute;is&iacute; i gceist nuair a theipeann orainn d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar chearta daonna.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1573" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700007#E00200"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <blockquote> 	To delete all words after &quot;That&quot; and substitute the following:  	D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that the Thirty-Seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Bill 2018 be deemed to be read a second time this day eighteen months, to allow for greater analysis of the complex issues concerned and for such considerations to be taken into account in further scrutiny of the Bill.  </blockquote>  <p>I thank the Independent Deputies for facilitating this debate and, in particular, Deputy Pringle, the sponsor of the Bill.  The issues we are discussing today involve every Department.  I will endeavour to address them on behalf of the Government.</p><p>Some of us will recall previous Private Members' debates on this Bill.  The position then, as now, remains that the matter is immensely complex, involving a huge breadth of policy areas right across government.  On the latest occasion, the Government indicated that the Oireachtas housing committee would be asked to consider the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution, which examined the question of economic, cultural and social rights.  The convention report noted that more than 40% of convention members believed the issue should be referred elsewhere for further consideration of the implications of possible reforms.  Unfortunately, the Oireachtas housing committee, which has been particularly busy over the past few years, did not have an opportunity to undertake the analysis requested so the need for such detailed scrutiny remains.  While this is undoubtedly a short Bill, it has potentially very significant consequences.  The amendment proposed by the Government would allow time and space for detailed analysis to take place while ensuring the Bill can come before the House again in 18 months.  It is my hope and expectation that when the Bill returns to the Legislature, we will be in a better position to debate it, hopefully with the pandemic, which by necessity dominates so much of the work of the Government today, behind us.</p><p>The Bill proposes to incorporate the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights into Article 45 of the Constitution and to mandate the implementation of the covenant, subject to maximum available resources, under the supervision of the courts.  The covenant, as Deputies will be aware, is a covenant of the UN.  Implementation by UN member states that have ratified it is monitored by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a body of 18 independent experts that has been operating since 1985.</p><p>Ireland ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 8 December 1989 and reported to the UN committee on its domestic implementation in 1996, 2000 and 2012.  Next month, the Cabinet will consider its fourth report on implementation before submitting it to the UN committee for its consideration.  When compiling the fourth report, all Departments were required to have an input and public consultation took place.</p> <p>In addition, consultations were undertaken with the Department of Foreign Affairs committee on human rights, which comprises representatives of NGOs, academic institutions and other stakeholders, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  All feedback was considered in the drafting of the report.</p> <p> Deputies will be aware that, following submission of such a periodic report, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights convenes hearings where states are robustly examined and at the end presented with the committee's recommendations on issues that require to be addressed.  Therefore, it is important to acknowledge there already is a monitoring mechanism in place in regard to our implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and one that lacks the rigidity of a courtroom setting.  The periodic nature of reporting allows for changing circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in at this moment.  Indeed, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights proactively highlights areas in which it wishes to see improvements in Ireland in terms of our implementation of the covenant. </p> <p> In this connection it is fair to say that Ireland's periodic reports to the committee have demonstrated a clear trajectory of progress across the gamut of economic, social and cultural rights.  Our fourth report will highlight the legislation and policy developments in the period from 2011 to the end of 2018.  It details initiatives ranging from the migrant initiative strategy to the national broadband plan.  It sets out information on a number of important whole-of-government strategies, including the national disability inclusion strategy, the national strategy for women and girls, the national youth strategy and the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  It highlights important legislation including the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016, the Electoral (Amendment) (Policy Funding) Act 2012, the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 and the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  In addition, it sets out implementation plans for major initiatives, including the sustainable development goals, and commits to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p> The programme for Government contains a large number of measures to promote economic, social and cultural well-being.  In particular, it commits to developing a set of indicators to create a broader context for policy-making to include a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded holistic view of how our society is faring and a balanced scorecard for each area of public policy, focused on outcomes and the impact those policies have on individuals and communities.  Initially, this will be focused on housing, education and health.</p> <p> As part of budget 2021, the Department of Finance has published a paper on well-being and the measurement of broader living standards in Ireland.  The paper investigates the options for national well-being measurement in Ireland, with a view to the commitment in the programme for Government 2020 to develop new measures of well-being.  This work is being taken forward by the Departments of the Taoiseach; Finance; and Public Expenditure and Reform and will be further developed through the analysis of the experience of other jurisdictions that have developed similar measures in recent years through consultations with experts drawn from the public service, academia, NGOs and the private sector.  The programme for Government states that, once developed, we will ensure it is utilised in a systematic way across Government policymaking at local and national levels in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress.  This will be an important complement to the existing economic measurement tools.</p> <p> Furthermore, the programme for Government commits to examining the introduction of a new grounds of discrimination based on socio-economic and disadvantaged status into the employment equality and equal status Acts.  This follows on from an initial debate on this issue in the House during the previous D&aacute;il.  In addition, a broader review of the equality Acts is planned.  This work is being taken forward by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p> Our programme for Government also commits to a referendum on housing and a referendum on Article 41.2 of the Constitution informed by the work of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality.  Moreover, the issue of the environment including water and its place in the Constitution is to be referred to a relevant joint Oireachtas committee for consideration.</p> <p> In short, the current programme for Government, which sets out a five-year work plan for this Administration, contains an ambitious and complex range of commitments that are relevant to the substance of the issues which will be debated today.  Time is needed to map these commitments in the context of economic, social and cultural rights and the relevant UN covenant as well as our existing body of rights and laws.  To establish a constitutional referendum is the right course of action.  This timed amendment allows for the necessary care to be taken when assessing the proposal in this Bill.  I know the Deputies speaking today will make a valuable contribution to the further analysis of the proposals at the heart of this Bill.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, while we do, of course, need to give some domestic effect to economic, social and cultural rights, there have been a number of recent decisions against Ireland the failure to address which has very much damaged our standing.  We as a State have always prided ourselves on adherence to human rights and support for human rights.  That has been one of the cornerstones of our international foreign policy, yet the manner in which we have treated decisions both of the economic, social and cultural rights committee of the Council of Europe and, on occasion, of the European Court of Human Rights has left much to be desired.</p><p>We have a dualist system in Ireland; international law does not have domestic effect unless it is specifically incorporated.  I do not necessarily have a problem with that <i>per se</i>, but I do have a problem with using that as an excuse to fail completely to address a breach of rights in Ireland.  An example is the EuroCOP case taken against Ireland, where it was found that Ireland's treatment of garda&iacute; was a breach of their economic and social rights and that has not been addressed in any meaningful way.  A similar decision was made in respect of members of the Defence Forces, which stopped short of saying they had a right to strike.  I do not think it will surprise anybody that they do not have a right to strike, but they have a right to be represented in collective bargaining decisions, which they are not.  While there are considerable limitations on members of the Defence Forces and their direct representative bodies expressing their views, it appears that that failure to represent them has had a considerable impact on morale in the Defence Forces.</p><p>Likewise, the failure to give garda&iacute; a more meaningful voice has damaged morale in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and we are all quite aware of how that has played out in terms of blue flu and so on.  It is very difficult to coerce people into providing their labour, as the Government recently found out to its detriment.  More important, it has also been to the detriment of children with special needs, who have a right to education.  While that right to education is enshrined in Irish law, at least in regard to primary and secondary education, there is not a right, as the Court of Appeal has found, to third level education.  We need to vindicate that right and it is a matter of urgency that it be vindicated.</p><p>Going back to the mechanism, it is important that there be a mechanism such that if Ireland is found to be in default of its international obligations, it must come back before the court.  If it is in default of its obligation to provide economic and social rights, and if the social rights committee makes a decision in respect of Ireland, it should automatically and repeatedly over a period be referred to the Oireachtas for action.  Likewise, if there is a declaration by the domestic courts of incompatibility with the requirements of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, that should automatically be referred to the Oireachtas.  Even so, many committee reports that are automatically referred to the Oireachtas die on the shelf.  There has to be a mechanism for repeatedly bringing up such findings.</p> <p>It is not good enough that we take our turn to be on the Human Rights Council, or indeed on the Security Council, as we are now.  We talk about human rights on the Security Council while we do not do enough to ameliorate breaches of rights in our own State.  We cannot have it both ways.  It is a bit like our failure to deal with immigration or document the undocumented in Ireland while being euphoric that Joe Biden will somehow do something for the undocumented Irish in America.  That sort of hypocrisy, because that unfortunately is what it is, considerably detracts from the force of the argument we would make in America for our undocumented.<br/><br/>Likewise, our inability to address decisions of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights against Ireland detracts considerably from the force with which we can argue at a UN level for adherence to human rights standards and especially our delay in dealing with decisions made against us by the European Court of Human Rights.  The O&rsquo;Keeffe <i>v</i>. Ireland case in the field of education and abuse in our education system is one notable example.  I was a Member of the D&aacute;il at the time.  I since had a four-year hiatus from the D&aacute;il and may well enjoy another, longer, hiatus the next time but in that period however, little has been done to implement the O'Keeffe decision.<br/><br/>I very much welcome the measure proposed by my colleague, Deputy Pringle, in this regard.  It is an important issue.  As a D&aacute;il and, perhaps, an Oireachtas, we do not have sufficient regard to economic, social and cultural rights.  They are quite difficult to implement because it costs money to do so.  Of course, the Irish courts and Mr. Justice Declan Costello in particular, of whom I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will be well aware, enunciated the clear division of responsibility between the Legislature on one hand and the courts on the other.  However, simply because we found that it is not for the courts to supervise public spending, which is determined here by the elected representatives of the people, that does not mean the elected representatives do not have a heightened example to look at the effect of the decisions they make on the rights of people and to look at the fact we are celebrating 100 years of this State.  What is the purpose of a State in the modern era?  Surely, it is to vindicate rights.  If we, as a State, have been found to have failed to vindicate rights then we have a heightened duty as a Legislature to address it.  That sometimes involves difficult choices one cannot reasonably expect a court to make because it is not elected by the people to make those choices on their behalf.  They are, however, choices that need to be made by necessity if we are to vindicate the rights of people, as well as important economic and social rights.  Unless and until those particular rights are adhered to, then in a way, access to some of the other rights sometimes becomes elusive.<br/><br/>Our court system and access to the justice system is problematic in Ireland because it is expensive.  Therefore, either a person has a lot of money, in which case a bill for tens of thousands of euro for a High Court case might not affect him or her, or a person has no money at all, in which case a similar bill does not affect him or her.  The vast majority of people in the middle, however, cannot take a case.  I will give an example.  A number of cases are regularly taken against the Department of Social Protection and many are successful.  It is absolutely correct and right that those cases be taken because they have ultimately been vindicated by the fact the plaintiffs won their case.  Few cases are ever taken against the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That does not mean the Department is acting any more lawfully than the Department of Social Protection.  In fact, I suspect from observations of my own it is considerably less so but farmers cannot afford to take a case against it.<br/><br/>We need to look at access to justice and how we adjudicate economic, social and cultural rights, which need to be adjudicated and which, if we are found to be in breach, need to be addressed.  We also need to look at breaches of civil and political rights in this State and at how we ensure people can access courts without being crippled for having done so.</p> <p>I support the motion and thank Deputy Pringle for putting it before the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700011#J00200"><p>I commend Deputy Pringle and we will be supporting this motion.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a long track record in advocating for the rights of people.  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has been a key treaty in progressing the rights of people around the world.  In 1989, Ireland ratified the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens and agreed to be legally bound by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  This international treaty sets out the right for all people to self-determination but these rights to self-determination are only partially recognised in our Constitution and are further restricted by Article 45, which seeks to further limit this treaty by explicitly stating that the principles of social policy are intended for general guidance of the Oireachtas only and are not recognisable by law.  It is important that all Deputies support this motion.  We must act to protect Irish citizens' economic, social and cultural rights and enshrine that protection in law.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that this Bill seeks to strengthen the right to adequate housing, the right to be free from hunger, the right to an education and the right to an adequate standard of living.  Contained within this treaty are the right to earn a living, the right to enjoy a safe and healthy work environment and the right to attain the highest standard of physical and mental health.  In those categories alone, I imagine there are a huge number of people who are not earning a decent living, who do not have a safe and healthy work environment and who are suffering with their mental health.  Our track record in this country shows that we do not deal with that issue in particular.  As for the right to an affordable home and the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity, free of discrimination, these essential social rights must be protected and strengthened.</p>  <p>  There is little doubt but that we are in the middle of a housing crisis, a crisis that has emerged through years of neglect by successive Governments.  What we have allowed is for the Irish property market to be placed in the hands of companies seeking to maximise profit rather than to provide homes.  It is a property market based on greed.  What we see in practice is that those looking for a home are continually pushed out into a rental market that is prohibitively expensive.  For anybody who can qualify for the housing assistance payment, those houses are nearly impossible to find and then totally unaffordable when one can be found.  Our housing spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has continuously raised in this House the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s appalling housing policies.  It is now more important than ever to realise this treaty in law.  Housing cannot simply be determined by the Government of the day.  Our approach must be bigger and it must be enshrined in our laws.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a poor track record in ratifying international treaties.  In 2017, we were found to be in violation of our citizens' human rights in respect of a failure to ensure the right to housing and an adequate standard of living for people in social housing.  Several reports by UN bodies, notably in 1999 and 2002, stated that, despite substantial recommendations, no steps have been taken to date by Government to incorporate or reflect this treaty in domestic legislation.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s inability to ratify the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has not only caused enormous upset in Ireland, it has also drawn huge criticism from various advocates and representative groups.  That is an issue I would particularly like to highlight.  We have called continuously, as have many other parties in this Chamber and all the advocacy groups that deal with people with additional needs, for that protocol to be ratified.  The reality is the Government has not ratified it because that will give people a right and they will be able to take the Government to court on all of the inaction, waiting lists and failures.</p>  <p>  These two cases demonstrate that we must act to bring Ireland&rsquo;s law in line with international norms.  The importance of economic, social and cultural rights must be recognised by this House and I ask that all Deputies support this Bill.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in is a strong advocate for economic, social and cultural rights, all of which are covered by different aspects of this Bill.</p> <p>Enshrining economic, social and cultural rights within our Constitution is a progressive step, and one which, I believe, all parties should support.  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was ratified by Ireland in 1989.  Thirty two years on, its principles have not been acted upon.  This Bill is an opportunity to make up for lost time.  This Bill covers the right to have one's economic, social and cultural rights recognised in the Irish courts.</p> <p> The right to housing needs to be enshrined in our Constitution.  Everybody has the right to a home and to have a roof over his or her head.  Let us take, for example, the homelessness crisis across this State - families living in emergency accommodation, children growing up in homeless hubs, rough sleepers, young families rearing their children in overcrowded conditions and a locked-out generation of young people who will never own their own home.  It is an absolute disgrace.  It is a failure of this State to protect our most vulnerable.  A referendum on its own will not cut it.  We need houses, and lots of them, but the current Government seems more concerned about lining the pockets of developers than providing a roof over our most vulnerable.</p> <p> This Bill will also strengthen workers' rights in that it provides for workers to join a trade union of their choice.  This Bill will deliver for workers.  We see workers treated unfairly every day of the week.  Their wages and working conditions are constantly under attack.  There is no such thing for working people in this country as a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  A two-tier pay scale exists in our schools and the Government permits this.  We only have to look at how the Government has treated our student nurses in recent weeks to get an idea of its views on workers' rights more generally.  The Minister of State should pay our student nurses.  The failure to introduce the living wage is another example of where the Minister of State and the Government have let down workers.</p> <p> Covid has changed everything.  It exposed all the wrongs inflicted on working class people in housing, health, education and work, which are basic human rights.  We have a chance to restart everything once we get out the far side of this virus and this Bill will improve people's lives.</p> <p> If the Minister of State amends the motion today, that will be disgraceful.  I ask him to support the Bill and to support the ordinary people of Ireland.  I commend the Regional Independent Group again on bringing this before the D&aacute;il and I fully support its passage.</p></speech>

In particular, I commend his persistence.  I believe this is his third time introducing an economic, social and cultural rights Bill.  It has been voted down each time by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, yet here we are again hoping that the Government might finally do the right thing for its citizens and allow the legislation to progress.</p><p>Last year, Fianna F&aacute;il's election slogans saw it looking for &quot;An Ireland for All&quot;, while Fine Gael was &quot;Building a Republic of Opportunity&quot;.  Unfortunately, we have neither.  The Inequality Virus report released by Oxfam yesterday shows that the fortunes of Ireland's billionaires has increased to &euro;3.3 billion since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of ordinary workers with less than half the household income they had a year ago due to the pandemic.  We also have thousands of workers on the minimum wage whereas we should be working on a credible plan for a living wage.  It is like <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>- the best of times for the haves and the worst of times for the have-nots.  It is the spring of hope for a few and it is the winter of despair for many.</p> <p> For a hundred years, the Government parties have built an Ireland of two tiers.  Take our health system, for example.  It is only accessible in an acceptable timeframe to those who can afford to pay hundreds of euro in consultants' fees.  Not only do we have a two-tier health system, we also have a two-tier education system.  Parents and students have been in contact with me to say that they are on long waiting lists for school places next September.  The Minister's answer to this is that it is probably due to duplication.  There is no plan to identify whether this definitely the case or to find a solution.  Meanwhile, private schools are available for those who can afford extortionate fees.  We also have a two-tier housing system.  Housing assistance payment is seen by councils as the only show in town.  It is the subsidising of private landlords who can pick and choose their tenants.  It is not acceptable as a solution.  The only solution is to build housing, namely, public housing on public land.</p> <p> These three basic rights of health, education and housing need to be defended from the privatisation agenda of the Government parties.  These are fundamental rights and need to be protected.  Access should not rely on the ability to pay.  As my colleague stated, Ireland ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1989, thereby agreeing to be legally bound by its provisions.  Nothing but lip service has been paid since, however.  It is time for the Government to dust off the 2015 report of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on Ireland on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  It should even have a look at the headings of the report which discussed the rights to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, access to justice and the scope of legal aid, the equal rights of men and women to the enjoyment of economic and social rights, the right to an adequate standard of living and the protection of families, mothers and children.</p> <p> The Government is failing in all of these areas.  We need an Ireland of equals - a fairer Ireland.  We should not have red tape tying up treatments such as patisiran that keep people alive.  We should not have the housing and social welfare system discriminating against single fathers like a young gentleman and his son who I have been assisting in my constituency.  I urge Teachta&iacute; of all parties and none to support this Bill and I again thank Deputy Pringle for introducing it.</p></speech>

Anyone who studies politics will know Sinn F&eacute;in has a long track record of supporting, proposing and bringing about legislative reforms to enhance people's economic, social and cultural rights.</p>  <p>  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is an extremely important document.  As many Deputies have already pointed out, however, it has no real legal standing in the eyes of the law in this State.  It is hard not to conclude, given the efforts made by Teachta&iacute;, that this is not actually a deliberate tactic on the part of successive Governments.  Like all charters, covenants and treaties that concern economic equality and social justice, it is not directly enforceable in the courts.  The reason such charters to ensure economic social and cultural rights are never incorporated into law is because successive Governments know the depth and scale of inequality that exists in the State.  They also should be aware of their culpability for the depth of inequality that exists in our State.  We know there is inequality at both ends of the scale.  Too many have too little, while many have, what any reasonable person would class, as too much.</p>  <p>  The Inequality Virus, a report published by Oxfam on Monday last, indicates that Irish billionaires have increased their collective wealth by &euro;3.3 billion since the beginning of this pandemic.  This exposes the myth that we are all in this together during the pandemic.  The truth is contained within the pages of the report.  Since the global pandemic began, billionaire wealth has increased by $3.9 trillion.  Closer to home, Irish billionaires have enjoyed a dividend of &euro;3.3 billion.  At the same time, workers have found themselves overworked, underpaid or laid off.</p>  <p>  The UN Secretary General has stated that this pandemic is like an X-ray, exposing the fractures in our society and our economy.  In Ireland, it has further underscored a broken housing market, an economy built on low pay and a level of the underprovision in the context of public services.</p> <p>While so many are struggling, the richest are flourishing.  They are doing so well.  They are having a fantastic pandemic.  Those who are on ordinary incomes, those who are dependent on social welfare, those who get up early in the morning and work ten or 20 times harder than the billionaires are not having a good pandemic.  The billionaires are though.  They are getting a dividend from this pandemic, while most ordinary people are going to emerge from the aftermath of this global health crisis with more debt and probably more insecurity with regard to their housing, while having lost out on the capacity to take annual leave while they have been in work.  All of this will happen to them.  The good news for those who are on the side of the elite is there is a massive dividend for billionaires in this pandemic.  Let us think on that.  There is a dividend for billionaires in the middle of a global health crisis.</p> <p> The economic impact of this virus has been disproportionately felt by those on low pay, women and young workers.  The pandemic has laid bare the market's inability to reflect the true value of essential services and the workers who deliver them.  Oxfam's report also revealed the opportunity that has been presented to the mega-rich, an opportunity that, of course, they have exploited.  That billionaires have enjoyed their massive dividend windfall on the back of suffering and insecurity is pretty much a grotesque indictment of how our economy is structured.  While billionaires have recovered and prospered since the pandemic began, Oxfam warns of a lost decade for workers and families.  It is the job of the Government to deliver economic justice.  As Irish billionaires enjoy a Covid dividend, now is the time to introduce a progressive wealth tax on net assets above &euro;1 million.  Workers and families have borne the brunt of this pandemic.  Now, the richest must pay their fair share.  As we see this grotesque increase of wealth, ordinary people look on and see a broken housing system, underfunded public services, no statutory sick pay scheme, no living wage and no sign the Government will deliver one.  The right of workers to collectively bargain has still not been delivered.  The economic right to earn a living and to just and favourable conditions at work are, to my mind, pretty much basic fundamental rights as are the right of everyone to get organised, to join the trade union of their choice and to have the right to strike and withdraw their labour should they need to.  If people think that governments composed of conservative parties will afford them economic social and cultural rights, they really need to think again.  The rights we currently have, from the five-day week, annual leave, the right to access abortion and even the right to vote, were not given from above.  They were fought for and they were won on the ground by workers and ordinary people.</p> <p> The social rights that could be delivered by the insertion of this clause into the Constitution are extremely important.  When I say them out loud, it is infuriating that anyone would be denied these, or that a State would be so unequal that these issues exist to such an extent.  The right to social security, the right to an adequate standard of living, including food, clothing and housing, the continuous improvement of living conditions, the right to be free from hunger and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health are some of the most basic things a person should expect and yet so many go without.  The Government amendment states very simply, loudly and clearly that people should be let wait and that now is not the right time to do the right thing.  It states that ordinary people can wait.  The billionaires do not have to wait for their dividend because it has already happened.  They are getting a nice little bump off the pandemic but the people who need the very basic fundamental rights that are contained in the motion can wait.  The amendment states now is not their time, and that it is for the future, to be put off and to hit the can down the road.  It states it is a conversation we should have and it is action we should take but not now, in a while and maybe later.</p> <p> They hear what the Minister of State is saying and it really resonates with people when they see that inequality has been deepened during the pandemic.  It was already awful and it is getting more awful for some.  The attainment of basic human rights, as outlined by Teachta Pringle, has to wait.</p>  <p>That has to wait but the dividend for billionaires does not have to wait.  A wealth tax on people who are worth more than &euro;1 million has to wait but the billionaires get their dividend now.  People see and hear very clearly what is going on.<br/><br/>I ask all Deputies to support this Bill.  I ask the Minister of State, even at this stage, to please withdraw his amendment.</p></speech>

I want to thank Deputy Pringle for again proposing this very sound and progressive initiative.</p>  <p>  The pandemic, as has been enunciated by a succession of speakers, has revealed some very deep inequalities, and revealed much about the very nature of this country, how this State is organised and who it prioritises.  Truths that have been apparent to me all my life, but probably less so to many others in this House, have been revealed in very stark relief.  At its core, our society and economy operate on a very structurally unfair basis.  Ireland is unequal and the world is unequal.  The State's response to the Covid-19 public health crisis and the associated economic crisis has, of course, been unprecedented but it has been unprecedented because it needed to be.  The State's response has also been revealing in many ways.  Our collective response, as a community, has shown the very best of us.  It has demonstrated an extraordinary degree of solidarity, of community and of neighbourliness across the country.  However, the pandemic has also revealed, as we know, a public health service that is gravely short of beds, a two-tier labour system and labour market, and a vulnerability across society that was literally brought into stark relief overnight at the end of last March and into early April.</p>  <p>  Those of us who are students of history know that pandemics and global crises like that which we are now experiencing have, over the centuries, brought forward radical social and economic change.  If anything collectively good is to come out of the death, the trauma and the tragedy of the Covid pandemic, then it ought to be a fairer and more economically and socially just society that has a commitment to decency and justice at its very core.  That is why this proposition before us today, brought to us by Deputy Pringle, is particularly timely.  It really should generate a broader and more informed &ndash; I use that term deliberately - debate about the kind of country we want post-pandemic Ireland to be.</p>  <p>  I know what it should not be and I know what it should be.  It certainly should not be a country where obscene amounts of wealth are concentrated in the hands of those who inherit their wealth and do nothing of value with it, in my view.  It should not be an Ireland where who you are, where you are reared or where you are from dictates where you end up.  It should not be an Ireland where people are destined to live insecurely and unsafely because they do not have the resources to buy their own home.  It cannot be a case of, "Here is the new Ireland, the same as the old Ireland" and we go with a business-as-usual approach.</p>  <p>  The Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, is a foundational document which has shown itself to be capable of progressive amendment when the need and the demand arises.  It is an evolving, organic, living thing.  It is the property of the people, fundamentally.  When it was written and endorsed by the Irish people, this was done as an expression of the values and principles of this State.  It was an expression at the very highest level of who we were, who we are, who we wanted to be and how we wanted to be viewed by the world, and the values and the principles we stand for.</p> <p>Ireland has changed and it will change even more.</p> <p> We signed up to the convention in 1989 without explicitly including the terms of the charter in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Politically, we managed to pioneer and legislate for some significant changes to the social, economic and cultural life of our country.  Those who will oppose amending our Constitution to include the amendment from the Constitutional Convention, as referenced by Deputy Pringle, will do so on the basis that the allocation of resources is a matter for democratically elected parliaments such as this.  They are, to an extent, right.  That is how matters stand at the moment.  The allocation of resources and debates about political policy, etc., and how decisions are made are rightly argued and justified here in this, our national Parliament.  What we are talking about here, however, is what I might describe as a floor beneath which no one should be allowed fall, and enshrining that principle in our Constitution.  It is about a basic guarantee of rights and minimum standards, importantly, subject to available resources.  That last point is important.  Only those who fear the demand for the fairer allocation of resources are the only ones to fear from such a move.</p> <p> That said, we have heard here, particularly in recent years, descriptions of Ireland being something like a disaster zone.  Some people serve their own political purposes in saying that.  There are, however, many things that this country does very well and there are lots of significant economic, social and cultural changes that my party pioneered and was involved in at the front line over many decades to enable us to make this country much better, much fairer and more progressive.  There is much more that we need to do, however, and we all need to be conscious of that.</p> <p> Emblematic of the way this country has historically dealt with questions relating to economic rights is our failure to properly prioritise the principle of collective bargaining.  This country is deeply unequal economically and the most scarring form of inequality is economic.  I have absolutely no doubt about that.  The best way to allocate the resources won by hardworking people is to ensure that they not only have a right to join a trade union but the right to be represented by that trade union for the purposes of collective bargaining.  It is an observable fact that countries which have strong, robust trade union representational systems and collective bargaining systems do best socially and economically.  In that context, who should fear the introduction of strong, robust collective bargaining and trade union laws?  That is an open question.  It is amazing that we still have not grappled with that key principle which has bedevilled us for many years.  Our Constitution as it stands - in terms of the interpretation put on many questions before judges over many decades - prioritises the interests of private property rights over the collective common good.  That is a bizarre situation and one of the things that Deputy Pringle's Bill seeks to address in the context of introducing constitutional amendment on progressive cultural, social and economic rights.  The Labour Party is happy to support that principle and to support Deputy Pringle's initiative.</p></speech>

They guarantee basic dignities, including workers' rights, protection for families, and recognising the importance of cultural activities.  These rights are a legal and moral tool to fight endemic injustices in our society, to address homelessness, to cut health care waiting lists, to end direct provision, to give all people with disabilities the dignity they deserve, and to seriously respond to the climate crisis.</p><p>Former President and UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	A culture is not an abstract thing.  It is a living, evolving process.  The aim is to push beyond standard-setting and asserting human rights to make those standards a living reality for people everywhere. </blockquote>  <p>This Bill is a manifestation of those words.  Its purpose is to give citizens the opportunity to decide on this matter.  I thank Deputy Pringle for bringing it forward for a third time.</p> <p>While the two main Government parties seem to oppose economic, social and cultural rights, it is astonishing to me that they would defy people the right to vote on them.  Again, I have to ask whose interests does this Government serve.<br/><br/>Over the past two weeks this House has discussed the catalogue of abuses endured by survivors of mother and baby institutions.  The report, despite its many flaws, presents an account of the crimes and abuses carried out by agents of this State and of religious orders: abduction, concealment of death, illegal adoption, assault, gross neglect, not to mention years of denial, as well as the disgraceful hostile treatment of victims and survivors by public services.<br/><br/>The mother and baby institutions are a very real and very Irish example of why we need stronger rights.  These institutions of horror were allowed under our current Constitution and by laws passed by our predecessors.<br/><br/>Part of our response to the mother and baby homes report and the pleas for justice from survivors must be to put in place the legal structures to ensure that people get real justice and that this can never happen again.  Irish history and current affairs are a testament to the need for more robust rights.  Regrettably, the actions of the current Government underline the need for these rights.<br/><br/>It is only the general data protection regulation, GDPR, that has guaranteed survivors of mother and baby institutions rights to access their own information.  Before Christmas, people who were in these institutions and their families had to endure weeks of confusion and insults as the Government, which had not engaged with them, passed a Bill that made no mention of survivors rights and did nothing to alter the so-called sealing of records.<br/><br/>It was thanks to survivors' bravery and massive public outrage that the Government acknowledged survivors' rights to their personal data.  However, it was only GDPR, that is, EU law, that legally guaranteed that.  Without these rights the Government would have continued - it is still trying to continue - to hide behind outdated laws.  That is the reason we need economic, social, and cultural rights and it seems this is why the Government has opposed these rights for so long.<br/><br/>Constitutional recognition of the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights can help resolve the many injustices that we face in Ireland today.  Housing is one of the clearest examples.  Ireland has been experiencing a sustained housing and homelessness crisis for almost a decade.  Despite Government announcement after announcement and hundreds of millions of euro going into the housing assistance payment, HAP, we still have more than 8,000 official homeless people, including almost 2,500 children as of November.<br/><br/>Within a single generation, a consistent housing emergency has been created by Government policy.  This current policy is denying people the right to a home.  Thousands of families need a right to housing to move beyond rhetoric to reality.  Surely, as a society, we consider it more important that children have a permanent home rather than developers making more money.  State policy must have the goal of building affordable housing to buy and rent at the heart of it.  That should not even need to be said in this House.<br/><br/>When the parents of my generation bought homes, the average price was three times the average annual income.  Within a generation, that has slipped away, and the average house price has climbed to nine or ten times the average annual income.<br/><br/>A right to a home, made real by policy, and the elimination of homelessness should be a core aim of the Government.  The present Government and its predecessor have proven month after month that it is only a constitutional right that will force the Government to provide the thousands of homes needed to end this crisis.<br/><br/>The UN covenant has strong provisions on decent and secure work.  Work, for too many people, especially younger people, is insecure and low paid.  That has a disproportionate impact on people with disabilities, migrants and women and is a large contributor to our shocking gender pay gap.  <br/><br/>A right to do decent and secure work is a fair aspiration.  A right to decent work would start with a living wage, as the minimum.  The programme for Government mentions promises on a living wage but no practicalities.  There is zero urgency from the Government to address the widespread prevalence of low pay.  In fact, the Government rejected a Social Democrats motion on workers' rights last year.  It is an uncomfortable truth that many of the jobs deemed most essential in this pandemic fall on people who are paid too little and experience job insecurity or those who are paid nothing at all.<br/><br/>Economic, social and cultural rights will also help realise just climate action.  We need a clear path and a clear timetable on cutting carbon emissions.  That needs to be treated as a national emergency, not as an afterthought and political football.  We need a genuinely just transition, which changes every aspect of how we organise our economy.  Making individuals responsible for climate action will not suffice when the big polluters need to be tackled and real structural change is so blatantly required.<br/><br/>The Earth our young people will inherit needs to be a liveable planet.  If the next generation could vote now, I suspect there would be a more meaningful attempt to tackle the biggest emergency imaginable.  We need politics to be for the next generation and not just the next election.<br/><br/>The explicit recognition of cultural rights<b></b>would help address our national hypocrisy regarding the arts.  Our rich heritage and culture is celebrated by Governments and used to attract tourists but dependable jobs for artists and musicians are practically non-existent, our built heritage is allowed to crumble away or be sold to developers and our arts education is disgracefully underfunded.  An enshrining of cultural rights would help our arts and heritage to get the support they deserve, would value our traditions and creative expression and would help artists and musicians make a living in Ireland.<br/><br/>The Government has voted against extending maternity leave, improving workers' rights, and giving proper pay to front-line healthcare workers.  The Government is failing to take real climate action and give real justice to survivors of institutional abuse.  We need stronger rights to prevent these injustices.  Recent changes to the Constitution like marriage equality and abortion rights have demonstrated that people are ahead of the Government, in significant numbers, and when we could, we voted to ensure a more progressive and equitable society.  When this question is put to the people, it will pass in a similar fashion.  Our citizens recognise the importance of rights to housing, healthcare, better working conditions, justice and our cultural identity.  These are important rights to ensure we have the type of society of which we can all be proud, where people have a roof over their heads, can earn a fair day's wage and can access healthcare and where music, art and heritage are truly valued.  It is up to the Government to allow the people to have this choice.  I hope the Government parties respect our citizens and democracy enough to make this happen.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Pringle on putting it before the House.  The Government amendment is disgraceful.  There is no need for an 18-month delay in examining the issues.  It could start immediately if it were serious about enshrining this covenant and the rights of people in this country in the Constitution but it is not serious about it and hence the opposition from the Government.  It is the same foot-dragging it engaged in when it came to the issue of rights for people with disabilities.  Terrified that people might be able to vindicate their rights in courts or ensuring that those rights would be enshrined in the Constitution might mean that people would no longer accept the failure of the State to deliver on the rights in the areas that are mentioned in the covenant such as trade union rights, migrant rights, the rights of asylum seekers or the one aspect I want to focus on, which is housing.</p>  <p>  Article 11 of the covenant states: "The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family [I have problems with that gender description] including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions."  It hardly needs to be said, however, that this State has failed to allow its people to access adequate housing.  Various Ministers in the past three Governments, from Deputies Kelly, Coveney and Eoghan Murphy to the present incumbent, failed the people of this country.  When the history books are written, the current housing crisis will be the single biggest stain on our recent history.  The craven facilitation of developers, building interests and financial speculators has resulted in an ongoing nightmare for many thousands of our citizens.</p>  <p>  We have the obscenity of people sleeping rough, a scene that has become accepted by us, and the obscenity of rents that are impossible for the average earner to cover.  We have the obscenity of the absence of affordable housing or apartments that are semi-permanent features.  Minister after Minister comes into this House and waffles about the market, the supply and how their plan will tweak the market and solve the complex problem.  The only real housing policy we have had is to bend over backwards for real estate investment trusts, vulture funds, investment firms, developers and speculators and ensure that their profits and wish lists become whatever passes for a housing policy.  The results are to be seen everywhere in this State.</p>  <p>  I refer to one of the latest obscenities, which is the rash of applications for co-living that were put in before the Minister banned them.  He flagged it in October and banned them in December.</p> <p>In my constituency, the old Player Wills and Bailey Gibson site is one of the biggest such obscenities.  That application was lodged well before the issue was flagged up.  There is the area of a parking space in a bedroom for co-living.  More importantly, we have to look at what being called a strategic development site entails.  The definition of strategic housing in the context of a housing crisis should be that it is strategic to build housing that is accessible, affordable and sustainable but this is not.  It boosts the profits and returns for developers in order that they have to build high and rent out at very dear costs indeed.  It is not strategic or sustainable and it is not right for landlords to build to rent in areas that are not appropriate.  This is what the people in the area of Dublin 8 are furious about with regard to co-living.  The Player Wills and Bailey Gibson site will rise to a height of 19 storeys and the scale and size of this development is tantamount to a small town.  The build to rent model is a business plan, not a plan to deal with the housing crisis.</p> <p> We will be dealing more with this issue in this House.  I thank Deputy Pringle for tabling this Bill.  It gives us a chance to show what is wrong with not just the policies on housing but also in respect of workers' rights, migrants' rights and the plethora of areas in which the Government has failed.</p></speech>

Some 133 included the right to healthcare and 81 include the right to housing.  The Irish Constitution refers to the right to private property.  This has been used to deny union recognition.  One has the right to join a union but not to be recognised.  It has been used to weaken anti-eviction legislation and so on.  It would be a step forward for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to be inserted into the Constitution.  It would not transform Irish society but it would give stronger legal argumentation for those who campaign for these rights.  That is precisely the reason Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael-led Governments over the years have not taken this step.</p>  <p>  Last Friday evening at 6 p.m., Deliveroo workers took strike action.  These precarious workers are denied guaranteed hours and guaranteed income.  They are also denied access to sick pay, holiday pay and pensions.  They have taken the first and most important step.  They have begun to organise and to feel their own power.  I believe they would benefit from this convention being mentioned in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  Next Wednesday marks the 300th day of the Debenhams dispute.  This week, these workers turned on their phones and televisions to find out that the Debenhams brand has been purchased for &euro;55 million but not a single job is to be saved.  It is vampire capitalism.  They are campaigning for the &euro;3 million offered to them by the State for upskilling to be converted into cash and made part of a just settlement offer to resolve the dispute.  The friends of the Debenhams workers will back this motion in its unamended form and their opponents will not.  That, with many other reasons, is a powerful reason to support this motion, which we will do.</p></speech>

We seek a prosperous Ireland where, when one works hard, takes risks and invests time, effort and resources, one receives a fair economic return for that work.  We understand that there must be a spark in the economy, an incentive that will drive people to achieve for their family.  We also seek a safety net for families with regard to housing, healthcare, education and income when times are tough.  We seek a society that is cohesive, which is important to who we are.</p>  <p>  Globally and in Ireland there is an increasing shift of wealth into the hands of the few.  Unbelievably, 2,153 billionaires across the world hold as much wealth today as 4.6 billion people who make up about 60% of the population of the planet.  This is a radical shift and concentration of wealth into the hands of the few.  It is a major injustice and a significant destabilising element in societies around the world.  Housing is one manifestation of this growing inequality.  The provision of the  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR, that stood out to me was the comprehensive and substantive right to adequate housing.  Inherent in this right are adequate privacy, space, security, lighting, ventilation, basic infrastructure and an adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities, all at a reasonable cost.  This seems like a pipe dream in many people's lives in this country.  It also entails protections and commitments to eliminate homelessness and to provide safeguards against forced evictions.</p>  <p>  A number of weeks ago, I raised the fact, for the first time in this Chamber, that nearly 60 people who were homeless had died in Dublin alone.  I also brought the fact that people from outside Dublin who were homeless in Dublin were being refused services and told to go back to their own counties despite the fact that these individuals were told to adhere to Covid regulations and not travel.  We saw the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, from Fianna F&aacute;il, appear on "RT&Eacute; Investigates" weeks after that debate in Leinster House and simply shrug his shoulders when confronted with this shocking practice.  The Minister promised an investigation into the deaths of those people who died while homeless in Dublin.  Where stands that investigation?  No information has been circulated in that regard.</p>  <p>  We see house prices spiralling again and the building of houses grinding to a halt this year.  A whole generation is trapped in spiralling rents.  It is amazing that there is a situation in Dublin where the average rent is &euro;2,044.  If one is on the minimum wage, one's gross income in a year for a 40-hour week is &euro;3,000 less than the average rent in Dublin, and that is the figure before tax.  It is startling.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland confirmed what people understood to be true.  It said that the cheapest accommodation that one can buy in Dublin is &euro;375,000.  It indicated that one has to have an income of &euro;100,000, either as an individual or a couple, to get that cheapest housing unit in Dublin.  After ten long years under Fine Gael, one has to have an income of &euro;100,000 a year or more if one expects to own accommodation.  It is incredible and shocking.  It obliterates all the spin about housing that we have heard from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in recent times.  It puts into sharp relief the reality of Government policies in these people's lives.</p>  <p>  Aont&uacute; is committed to justice in the workplace and the right of workers across Ireland to a fair wage for fair work and to allow for decent living conditions.  Low pay and precarious work affect the lives of many workers across Ireland.  Ireland has many laws about workers' rights but inadequate enforcement of these rights.  We need a strong, well-resourced agency to inspect compliance with labour legislation, including practices related to minimum pay, contract work and rights to parental leave and sick pay.</p>  <p>  Aont&uacute; also believes in self-determination for the Irish people.  Self-determination was a key driving force behind the revolution here 100 years ago but Brexit has shown that self-determination of the people in the North of Ireland is still ignored.  The Tories took the democratic position of the people in the North of Ireland with regard to Brexit, scrunched it into a ball and threw it into the wastepaper basket.  Self-determination is being withheld from the people in the North and there is a debate growing across Ireland about Irish unity.  Covid has been another driving force in that debate.  The inability of the Administrations, North and South, simply to co-operate for the protection of people's lives has been startling.  Despite this debate, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party refuse to remove their heads from the sand in respect of this issue.</p> <p>Aont&uacute; is a pluralist movement built on the philosophy of Wolfe Tone, according to which all citizens have a right to be who they are to the fullest extent, without fear or favour from the State.  Ireland is a fiercely orthodox and uniform State.  The politics of Ireland has radically changed over the last 30 years, but the intolerance of differing views is as it always was.  Establishment Ireland wears the clothes of diversity and declares that all views are welcome on the full spectrum of opinion, as long as they conform with its own views.  Group thinking and herd mentality are the curse of Irish society.  The credit and property crisis of 12 years ago is the perfect example of this.  People who criticised the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il at the time were demonised.  Open and respectable debate is critical in rigorously holding the establishment to account.  Open and honest debate is not the enemy of a functioning democracy; it is a pivotal part of democracy.  This uniformity is not helped by an overly concentrated media market, which is dominated by RT&Eacute;.  Shockingly, Aont&uacute; is the only political party in this House that supports the universal right to life.  It is the only party in the House that believes that everybody has the human right to life and that everyone's life should be protected, even the most vulnerable.  Universal means everyone.  If a section of humanity is removed from those rights, it is no longer a universal right; it is only a sectional right.  </p> <p> I am delighted that Deputy Pringle has brought this debate to the table.  It is an important issue that we must focus on in this time of Covid.  While Covid eclipses most other issues currently, due to the enormity of the crisis, there lie dozens of significant crises within society that also need our attention.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Pringle and the Independent Group for giving us the chance to do that.  Since becoming an elected Member many years ago, the most predominant problem that presents on a daily basis is housing for people.  In Kerry there is a great housing department in the local authority, which does its level best to look after those who present for social housing, and continues to do so in tough times when there is little funding.  We seem to be doing very well, but funding is an issue all the time.  Up here, we continue to fight their case to get more funding.  Housing is very important and it is right that people should be housed.  We must ensure that people have proper homes to live in and in which to bring up their families.</p>  <p>  The other important issue that is causing an awful lot of problems currently concerns medical and health services.  As we know, people are being denied services in our county and indeed right around the country.  This includes simple procedures such as the removal of cataracts to prevent people from going blind.  It is an indictment on the HSE and our health service that we have to take people to the North of Ireland so that they do not go blind and continue to suffer pain.  It is like the agony in the garden when they suffer with pain in their hips and knees and so on.  It is wrong that people have to wait for years to get simple procedures done.  In spite of all the money the HSE gets, it is still unable to provide a proper service.</p>  <p>  Work is important.  People who want to work should be given the chance to do so.  I applaud both small and large employers, who, despite all they have to face, employ people.  They are going through a lot just to be allowed to do that.  There are so many regulations and rules they must adhere to and the cost of insurance and red tape makes it hard for them to create jobs for people.</p></speech>

I would like to thank Deputy Pringle and his colleagues for bringing it forward.  Many people's human rights and culture are being violated.  Sometimes our own culture is being violated in this State and needs looking at.  One thing that is for certain is that we must look not the issue of citizenship in respect of those who have come into this country, settled, lived happily and who have worked hard.  There is a lack of urgency in the Department of Justice on the issue of citizenship.  It is a debacle and it has been handled very poorly.  Applicants who have applied for citizenship and have all their paperwork in order still wait years to get citizenship.  Some of these applicants are also front-line workers.  It is an important point.  These people must be treated in a fair manner.  It is time for the process to be speeded up for all involved.  Surely, in a world where everything is done online, there should be no need for long delays in the processing of applications.  I know a significant number of people who are front-line workers and who need their applications processed.  Their human rights are being violated to a point because it has been put off for a number of years.  These people have helped to save lives in Bantry Hospital and other hospitals throughout west Cork.</p>  <p>  Previous speakers raised the housing issue.  It is quite serious and it has been neglected.  The other day I spoke to a gentleman from Sudan who is living in east Cork.  I presume it would be the same no matter who he was.  He is living in squalid conditions because he cannot get a house.  It is fine to say "C&eacute;ad M&iacute;le F&aacute;ilte" to those coming into our country, and then violate their human rights by letting them live in almost squalid conditions.  The man I spoke to is desperate to get a home for himself and his children.  These are issues that come before us on a daily basis.  To be honest, people's rights are being violated.  We can touch on the issue of direct provision.  I spoke on it last year and there was a lot controversy afterwards.  My point was misconstrued, of course, and people made of it what they wanted.  There should not a situation in which people come into this country and are treated horribly in direct provision centres.  It must be sorted out.  People cannot live in the misery that they are currently.  I was justified in saying what I did at the time, but nobody wanted to listen.</p></speech>

I would like to highlight a specific issue that has not been touched upon yet today regarding people's human rights.  I am one person present here, but so far today, I have received three calls on this issue.  It concerns a basic human right.  People who suffer horrific injuries, whether it is through the likes of a stroke, or through accidents or injuries, might end up needing to avail of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  I have already asked the Minister why this scheme is not progressing.  I will provide an example of the injustices that are done to people.  At present, in Ireland, people think that scheme is open.  They think that they can fill out the form and apply for the primary medical certificate.  However, the truth is that they cannot.  If the scheme is going to be suspended, the Government must come out and say that applications will not be processed.  It must be open and tell the people that they are stalling that scheme.  At the moment, people with serious injuries are waiting.  They are trapped in their homes.  I spoke to a lady on my way into the Chamber who told me that she cannot physically manage her husband or take him out of the house without the specialised car to which she is entitled.</p> <p>Her application to the scheme is not being processed.</p> <p> I want the Minister of State and the Government to tell people why this injustice is being done to them.  I am sorry for concentrating on one issue but my colleagues have spoken, rightly, about housing and other issues and I did not want to repeat that.  I wanted to deal specifically with this matter.  I know Deputy Pringle will not mind me doing so.  This is an injustice that affects people's human rights to get out of their homes, to be able to go for healthcare and to be able to travel by means of the specialised vehicles that would have the seats and other adaptations needed for them to travel as a passenger or as a driver.  I want the Government to deal with that.  When the Minister of State is replying, I want him to be honest, open and forthright and to tell people why those who are ill and those with disabilities are being denied that basic human right.  All I am asking is that he tells the truth.</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, has set out the ways that we can monitor Ireland's implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as detailing some of the programme for Government commitments that marry with the objectives of Deputy Pringle, the Independent Group and other Members who support this Bill, and for which the Government has to be held to account to ensure we deliver on them.  We are determined to deliver on those objectives.</p>  <p>  I have looked at the Bill we are discussing today from the point of view of someone who is a solicitor, a parliamentarian, a Member of the D&aacute;il and a Minister of State.  Article 45 was very carefully constructed by the former Taoiseach, &Eacute;amon de Valera, and the drafters of the Constitution and, indeed, it was carefully considered by the Irish people who ratified the Constitution in a referendum.  It was carefully constructed in the context of the separation of powers that underpins the Constitution.  We have three branches of government and the Judiciary is separate entirely from the Parliament and the Executive.  The latter two are of course separate but they are not as separated as the Judiciary is from the rest of us.  Article 45's objectives - I will not say prescriptions because that is not what they are - could be called the directive principles of social policy to which we can all subscribe.  They are expressly defined in the Constitution as a guide to us in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and as not cognisable by the courts.  There is a good reason for that.  What was intended by the framers of the Constitution reflects a belief that decisions on the allocation of finite resources are a matter for this House, comprising the representatives of the people, rather than the courts, because we are answerable to the people for the decisions we make.  We are accountable on a regular basis in the D&aacute;il for decisions we made on the spending of people's money.</p>  <p>  It is appropriate at this time, in the context of this debate, to reflect on the Government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is worth noting that this response, not just in Ireland but across the western world, has been markedly and welcomely different from the response to the banking crisis ten years ago.  The Department of Finance has advised that the total fiscal support provided to date amounts to nearly &euro;38 billion or almost 20% of national income.  Ten years ago, the argument was that the support should be given to the banks.  There were arguments made that it was necessary to do so.  None of us wanted to do it, that is for sure.  It is fair to say that the focus now is certainly on the people who have been affected by the pandemic.  As a result of this extraordinary level of governmental intervention and stimulus, the end-year Exchequer returns show a deficit of &euro;12.3 billion in 2020.  This represents a &euro;13 billion deterioration on the surplus for the previous year.  We have a general government deficit of 5.5% of GDP, which is a &euro;21 billion swing from where we were in 2019.  A lot of money has been borrowed to keep the show on the road for families and small businesses, in particular, throughout the countries.  The situation is difficult and the money provided will never be enough, but the intervention is unprecedented.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2021, the distributional impact of the main tax and welfare measures were estimated and published on budget day, demonstrating that the budget package was broadly progressive.  This was a key aim of the Government and certainly a key aim of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  People in the lowest four income deciles benefited the most as a proportion of disposable income.  That is what we wanted.  It should be noted that work on equality has been ongoing with the help of the OECD since 2018.  It is great that this is firmly on the national and international agenda.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has shown that Ireland's tax system has done more than any other country in the EU to reduce inequality.  That is a fact.  People can dispute it if they want but the facts are that we have done more in our tax system to reduce inequality than any other member state.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700020#S00400"><p>Our inequality levels have reduced thanks to the progressive policies of previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  I am glad to see our influence on this Government.  We have moved mountains in seeking to help and support the most vulnerable in society.</p>  <p>  Health expenditure has amounted to &euro;19.8 billion, including additional funding of &euro;2.5 billion to maximise capacity in the system and allow for the purchase of necessary equipment such as personal protective equipment, PPE.  The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to routine health services and has necessitated a singular and urgent focus on one priority.  However, the winter initiative has seen significant extra resources put into our health services over the winter period.  If those resources were not there, services would be in a deeper position of difficulty than they already are because of the pandemic.  At the same time that all of this is going on, dealing with a pandemic and trying to make sure we are prepared for winter, work is ongoing to implement Sl&aacute;intecare reforms this year, with &euro;1.3 billion allocated for that purpose in budget 2021.</p>  <p>  Housing is a key issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, referred to the programme for Government commitment to introduce a referendum on housing.  The programme also contains a significant number of other housing commitments, including to increase the supply of public, social and affordable homes and to increase the housing stock by more than 50,000.  The Government is going to establish a commission on housing to examine issues such as tenure, standards, sustainability and quality of life issues in the provision of housing.  Later this year, a fresh housing plan, called housing for all, will be published and I really look forward to that.</p>  <p>  I know that the issue of workers' rights is of significant interest to Deputies, including Deputy Pringle, as it is for all of us.  Work has commenced on progressing to a living wage commitment as outlined in the programme for Government.  I welcome the fact that some companies are already doing that.  The T&aacute;naiste has engaged with the Low Pay Commission and with employee and employer representative bodies on this issue and the commission will start work on it shortly.  The Government has agreed to introduce a mandatory sick pay scheme, with a general scheme to be published by March and a Bill enacted by the summer.  The Low Pay Commission has also been asked to examine the programme for Government commitments on a universal basic income.</p>  <p>  In respect of education, the programme for Government's headline vision for education sets out inclusion in, and access to, education as the foundation for a more just and equal society.  I am particularly proud of what Fianna F&aacute;il has done in terms of the expansion of education.  &Eacute;amon de Valera, when he looked at drawing up the Constitution, established primary education as the only socio-economic right that is justiciable.  The right to a primary education is not part of Article 45; it is set out in a separate provision and is the only right that is justiciable before the courts.  That was relatively unique at the time in Europe and also at a time, let us not forget, when it was not automatic that everybody finished primary school.  Donogh O'Malley subsequently brought free second level education into operation.  Patrick Hillery's role in education was not only in guidance counselling but also in setting up the regional technical colleges, which became the institutes of technology and are now technological universities or on the way to becoming such.</p>  <p>  We need to continue that tradition because the education system is the one sure way out of poverty and the one sure way to help people, and the country, to advance socially.  The delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, plan sets out a vision for delivering interventions in the critical area of disadvantage.  A total of 887 schools are in the DEIS programme and there is a &euro;125 million spend on it.  The decision in the programme for Government to establish the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science should see a new vision, not just for excellence in higher education but for access and inclusion in that excellence.</p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, work in government has continued on the establishment of a new anti-racism committee.  The Department of Social Protection has been provided with &euro;10.4 billion of additional funding in 2020.  That is a big sum but it will never be enough.  We will always have cases of people who need more, but the State is providing a massive amount and it is up to us to spend it as efficiently as possible to get as much as help as possible directly to the people who need it.</p>  <p>  As the programme for Government acknowledges, every citizen has a stake in a strong, responsive social protection system that assists in the cost of raising children, helps those in need or who have fallen on hard times and provides for us in old age.</p> <p>The Covid-19 emergency has illustrated the resilience and responsiveness of our system.  Overall, expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;18 billion more than in 2019.  This is an extraordinary level of support, and it has been continued into 2021.  In the programme for Government, we made a commitment to a post-Covid economic recovery that is fair and balanced, that includes everybody and that prioritises policy actions that protect the most vulnerable.</p> <p> Our Constitution guarantees certain fundamental rights but it does not dictate budgetary priorities; that is why we have elections.  The separation of powers allows the Government and Legislature to care for the needs of people in ordinary times and to respond quickly and flexibly in extraordinary times, such as those in which we find ourselves.  We should reflect carefully on these matters before eroding the separation of powers and involving the courts in budgetary decisions but I realise these are matters that should and must be open to regular, rigorous and transparent debate.  I look forward to that process continuing.</p></speech>

As mentioned, this is my third attempt to have this Bill passed by various D&aacute;ileanna.  I thank all the parties and groups that put forward speakers to debate the Bill and I thank them for their support in this regard.  I will deal later with the Government's response to the Bill.  I thank my former parliamentary assistant, Councillor Jodie Neary, now of the Social Democrats, who worked diligently on this Bill over previous years.  I thank my current staff, particularly Ms Ber Grogan, for the work they have done on my contributions today.  I also thank those in my office who have been trying to raise awareness of this important Bill recently.  I hope there will be an Uplift petition so the public can get behind an ESC rights campaign in the lead-up to the vote on my Bill.  I also hope that the Bill will at least be considered in Government ranks.</p>  <p>  There has been so much awful news over the past year, and so much loss, grief, heartache and change, that this initiative would be a wonderfully positive one to introduce.  I am not saying the referendum will have to be this year but it should be discussed on Committee Stage and held alongside a referendum on a right to housing in 2022.</p>  <p>  During this pandemic, we have seen the importance of, and the strength in, union representation.  Some of the industries and services with functioning unions and significant union membership were able to influence the course of action of the Government.  Others on the front line, working in some of our supermarkets, may be paid above the minimum wage but they are not allowed to organise.  Debenhams workers have been treated atrociously by the Government despite being unionised.  This is why the right to organise and join a union of one's choice needs to be a constitutional right.</p>  <p>  I want to mention the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  In 2011, much fanfare was made of the Government's decision to sign the optional protocol.  Much like the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights would provide for a complaints procedure for individuals who believe their economic, social and cultural rights have been violated.  The Government press release of 5 March 2011 stated the complaints mechanism "is in keeping with the spirit of the many independent complaints, monitoring and inspection bodies that are currently in place in Ireland."  The Government stated: "In signing this Optional Protocol, we continue to affirm our determination to achieve full respect for human rights in practice."  I despair; I really do.  In the case of the UNCRPD, much was made of ratification, but it was decided not to implement the optional protocol because, God forbid, the Government would be held accountable for the promises it made.  In the case of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the relevant Government had a photo opportunity and fanfare in New York, but the small print was that "Ratification of the Optional Protocol is a separate step and will be considered in due course."  Signing the optional protocol means nothing without ratification.  When will this be ratified?  </p>  <p>  Ireland last undertook a periodic review with the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in June 2015.  On the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, there is a list of written responses to questions from that committee "which were unanswered due to time constraints during the third periodic review of Ireland, Geneva, 8&ndash;9 June, 2015".  A quick scan of the contents page of that submission shows that we have much work to do.  Chapters cover access to rural broadband; collective complaint to the European Committee of Social Rights; Magdalen laundries; the national women's strategy; employment legislation; the national minimum wage; exempted categories of employees under the national minimum wage; comparisons between the national minimum wage and the cost of living; zero-hour contracts and temporary and informal contracts; the provision of childcare; corporal punishment of children; positive parenting; the right to education; the intercultural education strategy; Traveller education; diversity of patronage; the admissions Bill; social welfare &mdash; decision-making and appeals, including legal representation at appeals; the habitual residence condition and victims of domestic violence; youth unemployment and the Youth Guarantee; poverty trends; mortgage arrears; and child and adolescent mental health services.  These all have to be addressed.</p>  <p>  In their responses today, both Ministers said there is no real need to proceed as I propose because we are already doing so in Ireland.  That is telling.  It was stated that the matter of the consideration of economic and social rights was referred to the housing committee but it has not been debated in the past four years.  That shows how much the Government prioritises the matter.</p>  <p>  The Minister said the Government has already considered the matter fully.  The Government responds to the UN committee regularly so there is already full consideration within all Departments.  The Departments have to compile the answers as to why they are not complying.  Obviously, they are considering the matter and know what it is all about.  The Government's response is damning, therefore.</p>  <p>  The Minister said the Government considered the question of failures of the Constitution.  Maybe that needs to be addressed.  Reference was made to how the Constitution already provides for what I propose and it was stated there is a reason the Government did not act on it.  However, the Minister's colleague stated the last time this matter was debated that the Government looked to Article 45 of the Constitution because there were objections from businesses regarding inclusion in Article 44.  Maybe that shows that our Constitution, as it stands, needs to be examined.  If everything is so right and everything the Government has done is so in line with economic, social and cultural rights, why has it a problem with adopting the measure?  The Ministers have outlined a whole list of measures that are commendable and work well, yet the Government will not accept that people have a right to have the rights in the Constitution.  That is telling in itself.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who was then a Minister of State in the Department of Health, said "the potential impacts of the Bill are immense and require very careful and informed consideration."  That was disingenuous then and it is disingenuous now.  Why would the Government have signed the optional protocol in 2012 and why would it have ratified the international convention at all if it was such hassle?  The then Minister of State at the Department of Health also said: "As elected representatives, we remain answerable to the people."  It is a people's Constitution.  Let them have their say.  We are answerable to them and they should be given the opportunity to vote on this issue in a referendum.  That is the most important thing.</p>  <p>  The enshrining of economic, social and cultural rights in our Constitution is something to hope for and to mobilise around, and its possibility allows us to show residents of Ireland that we will have a "new normal", a better normal.  We can do it.  There just is not the political will to look after our most vulnerable, or there has not been to date.  This is an opportunity for members of the Cabinet to vote again to show how they can actually do in government what they did when in the Opposition benches.   It is not going to happen, unfortunately.  What we need is a change - a complete change.</p></speech>

January has proved to be the most deadly month of this pandemic and, naturally, people are anxious, fearful and worried for the future.  Families have been bereaved, people are sick and people's lives are on hold.  Indeed, there are many who have not seen a day's work in almost a year.  Businesses are to the pin of their collar in a struggle for survival.  People feel the burden of this crisis like never before and so yesterday all looked to Government to deliver a clear and concrete plan of action and to indicate that it had a handle on this crisis.  Instead, we got a Government that is clearly at sixes and sevens with no idea of how to proceed beyond 5 March.  We got a Government that has yet again failed to prepare, failed to consult and failed to plan.  Instead of a real plan, the Government has presented half measures that do not go far enough.  At the Government press conference, contradiction and confusion between Ministers was rife and clarity and certainty were in scarce supply.  This absence of urgency, leadership and plain common sense has caused huge alarm for many people.</p>  <p>  One group that is particularly distressed is this year's leaving certificate students.  They are under enormous pressure.  They need to know what is happening now.  They have made their position clear: they want fairness, choice and an alternative method of assessment alongside the option of the traditional exam.  It is time for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education to make absolutely clear that they will facilitate this choice for those students and give them the clarity they need.  </p>  <p>  The biggest mess from the Government's announcement yesterday is undoubtedly its proposal on international travel.  What it announced not alone goes against public health advice; it goes against common sense.  It is not a system of mandatory quarantine; it is, in fact, one of voluntary self-isolation.  The Government proposes to send people back to homes and other accommodation with other people who may be going to work and who will go into shops and stores and, therefore, risk the spreading of this virus.  That is absolutely crazy.  People were shocked by the footage on the television last night of people returning home from places like Lanzarote.  That was clearly non-essential travel yet the Government's proposal places all hope in people's discretion to self-isolate.</p>  <p>  The plan is also unenforceable and, listening to representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this morning saying the Government has failed to consult with them, there was an echo of all the Government's previous behaviour.  They are in disbelief at what has been announced.  This half measure plan will not work.  It will also, the Taoiseach tells us, take weeks, if not months, to implement.  Overall, it leaves people on our island exposed.  The right measure is a system of complete and universal mandatory hotel quarantine for travellers onto our island.  That is the only thing that stands a chance of helping us achieve the maximum suppression of this virus.  This, of course, has to happen as part of an all-island approach that ensures no airport and no port on this island is left without the protection we need to stop the importation of this virus and any new variant.  Decisive action like that would say clearly to our people and people beyond that this Government means business when it comes to protecting our people.  I ask the Taoiseach to turn away from the half measure he announced yesterday and to implement a proper quarantine regime.</p></speech>

Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families of those who have been bereaved by this deadly and dangerous virus, which constantly evolves and is causing devastation to people's lives and to societies across the world.</p>  <p>  I want to make it clear that there will be no half measures from me as Taoiseach or from Government in ensuring a prolonged suppression of this virus.  We will do whatever it takes to keep the numbers down once we get them down.  We and the Irish people are achieving that.  Case numbers are falling steeply as we speak.  The swift introduction of level 5 over Christmas and, critically, the adherence of the Irish people to those guidelines is resulting in a steep decline in numbers.  That said, the key reality for front-line healthcare workers, who have been performing heroically on behalf of us all for a prolonged period, but particularly during this critical phase of Covid, in assisting all who get Covid and are hospitalised, is that we have to get the numbers of hospitalisations and the number of people in intensive care down.  When we get them down, we can never allow them back up to the levels they are at now.  That is clear, as far as I am concerned.  That will mean prolonged suppression of the virus in this country.  That will mean, for everybody in this House, that I do not want people coming to me again after 5 March with special pleading for this, that or the other sector.  We simply have had too much of that.</p>  <p>  I get that there are issues relating to education and I get the necessity to deal with and provide for special needs children.  The Minister for Education is engaging with all the partners.  We should allow space for the partners in education and the Minister to facilitate the return of children with special needs to our schools and to deal comprehensively and in a clear way with the situation facing our leaving certificate students.  They have gone through a difficult period because they were in fifth year last year and suffered as a result of school closures.  They have suffered this year again as a result of the pandemic, coming out of the Christmas period and the schools are closed.  Provision will be made for them.  The Minister is working with the partners and the national advisory committee on the exams, which has the voices of students, teachers, management and the State Examination Commission, which has a key role in this, and she will come back in a comprehensive way to present options for the leaving certificate students of this year.  </p>  <p>  However, in terms of the evolution of this, what we have now, which we did not, have last year is the vaccination roll-out.  The evidence base for the vaccines is that they prevent mortality and illness.  That will give us choices towards mid-year, when we will have significant numbers vaccinated.  However, the strategy, as far as I am concerned, is very clear: it will be a prolonged suppression of the virus.  The introduction of mandatory quarantine and the additional capacity that will be provided to the State to extend that if necessary is also there as an additional measure.  However, the key measure is human behaviour.  That is what stops the spread of the virus.  Thankfully, the Irish people have responded very, very effectively to this latest phase and the numbers are dropping steeply.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right that this virus is devastating and deadly and we have a hard road ahead of us.  Most people are compliant.  Some will not be but the reality is that for us to maintain maximum suppression we, of course, rely on human behaviour.  One behaviour that cannot be countenanced is unnecessary international travel.  That is one behaviour we need to knock on the head.  The most effective way to do that and the most powerful message that can come from Government at this time is one of universal quarantine.</p> <p>In other words, if a person comes to any part of the island of Ireland, he or she should face a 14-day mandatory quarantine.  That is what is required at this time.  Astonishingly, the Government has not opted for that.  It has opted for a system that relies on people's best discretion and judgment in self-isolating in their own homes.  Furthermore, the Government did not even consult An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which now says it fears for the health and safety of its members.  This is not the way to go.  This is a mistake and it is a mistake the Government should remedy now.  It should recognise what is required and what has the support of the people.  The people will walk those hard yards but they expect their Government to lead from the front.</p></speech>

The problem with the Deputy is that, unfortunately, she has been on the fence for much of this and has clung to the fence for as long as possible.  I remember a headline on the 18 September edition of the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>, which stated &quot;Mary Lou: Open all the pubs&quot;.  The Deputy was quoted as saying there was no reason that all the pubs should not open again.  That was her view then.  Whatever was fashionable, whatever was the trend, she jumped on board.  That has been her consistent approach to this - jumping on the bandwagon when it suits.  Her statements on Northern Ireland over the past two days were brazenly untrue.  She should speak to her colleague, the deputy First Minister, who will tell her that we have worked earnestly and in a proactive way with the Northern Ireland Executive-----</p></speech>

We will continue to work in a constructive fashion with the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>  <p>  The measures on travel will not take weeks to implement; they will be implemented very quickly.  It is time for consistency all around, from all sections of the House, including the Deputy's party, on this matter.  As I said earlier, prolonged suppression is what is required.  We will introduce legislation in respect of quarantining capacity and we look forward to the Deputy's support on that.</p></speech>

It is obvious the public are way ahead on this matter and understand the risks from the variants, including higher mortality rates, the potential impact of reinfection and the effectiveness of the vaccines.  I also acknowledge the terrible and sad milestone we reached yesterday.</p><p>There is an understandable fear among members of the public and a desire on their part for the Government to make decisions to keep the country as safe as possible.  Earlier, the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated on <i>Morning Ireland</i>that international travel is low risk.  Where is the evidence for that?  How is it that the UK variant is now dominant and how did it get here?  How is it that the South African variant is now confirmed to be here and how did it get here?  Is it still a working assumption of the Government that international travel is low risk?  The Minister, on behalf of the Government, went on to say the vast majority of people are complying with the relevant restrictions.  Less than a week ago, I raised the possibility of quarantine of international travellers with the T&aacute;naiste, who told me that it would be unworkable and that the majority of people were undertaking what he called essential travel.  I quoted figures provided to me by the Minister for Health which showed that 49% of international travellers, over a month-long period, even after several attempts, did not provide addresses.</p><p>Where is the evidence of compliance?  How will changing the guidance to a mandatory requirement to quarantine at home change that?  How will this be enforced?  Has anyone talked to the Garda Commissioner about this?  Do we have a sufficient number of garda&iacute; to do what needs to be done or what is being demanded of them?  I also wonder whether, when he was responding to me, the T&aacute;naiste was aware that some of the limited number of flights that are arriving here are coming from holiday destinations such as the Canary Islands.</p><p>It is welcome that the numbers are falling.  We need to keep working collectively to ensure that they continue to fall, not least because our hospitals are under extreme pressure and because they are now high-risk environments for catching Covid.  I find it hard to comprehend, from the measures announced, what the Government's strategy is.  It seems that the starting point is what cannot be done, with a reliance on the default position of employing lockdowns until the vaccination programme is rolled out as we hope, but that is not certain by any measure.</p><p>Is the Government still of the view that international travel is of low risk?  Has it talked to the Garda Commissioner?  What is the strategy for the remainder of the year?  To what extent does the Government anticipate rolling lockdowns?  Does the Taoiseach accept that high-profile non-compliance, such as international travel, undermines broader compliance?</p></speech>

The Government's view is very clear: people should not travel for non-essential reasons.  There are very few reasons that people should travel.  The Deputy is correct in saying that a significant number of people who have been travelling out of Ireland have, since the Christmas period, been going on holiday and coming back in.  That clearly needs to stop and that is why there is additional enforcement at the ports and airports.  Anybody who travels abroad is breaching level 5 rules and that is a fact.  They are in breach of level 5 rules and that carries with it consequences.  There will be an increase to the fixed penalty for breach of the rules relating to international travel, from &euro;100 to &euro;500.  There will be increased Garda checks and enforcement activity relating to people travelling internationally who are in breach of level 5 rules, while the existing regulations relating to having to have had a PCR test prior to coming in will be extended to 5 March.  The range of mandatory quarantine measures will also be introduced, some by means of regulation this week and others that will give us powers in respect of EU citizens will be dealt with through primary legislation.  The principal Act has to be amended to enable action in respect of such citizens.  Also, we will have the capacity under that legislation to extend the measures if we need to.</p>  <p>  All aspects of human behaviour carry risk, including international travel in the context of variants, which we are obviously very concerned about.  As already stated, prolonged suppression of the virus has to be our goal.  The numbers are coming down, but once we get them down, we have to keep them there.  The key to that is human behaviour, both on the island and through significant restriction of travel into the Republic, as well as additional measures for any violations of level 5 by citizens who travel from the North into the Republic.  There will be measures in that regard as well to deal with that and to ensure there are no breaches of level 5 rules and obligations by Irish citizens in Northern Ireland who come over the Border.</p>  <p>  Taken cumulatively, the significant range of measures will have an impact on travel.  The requirement in respect of PCR tests has already resulted in a reduction in the numbers travelling into the country.  There will always be a need for essential workers to travel into the Republic.  The category of essential workers is being narrowed as well in order to reduce the numbers who can come into the Republic.</p></speech>

That is why people are looking not to punish others but to be protected.  It is for this reason that the focus is on issues such as international travel in the context of the variants.  There is a public understanding of the risks involved.  That is why quarantine is being sought, not as a punishment.  It is unacceptable that people are going on holidays and, on a television programme last night, we saw students arriving into the country.  I cannot quite comprehend why families would want their children to be travelling here when, apart from anything else, there is a very dominant strain of the virus in play.</p> <p>This did not arrive on a south-easterly.  It arrived on a flight or on a boat.  That will be the means by which the other variants arrive as well.  That is why this is so important.  What if quarantine is introduced in the UK, for example?  Will we follow on then?  Will that be where the all-Ireland approach will be adopted?  Has the Taoiseach talked to his UK counterparts about that recently?</p></speech>

The numbers have collapsed to very low levels in terms of people coming into the Republic and we must maintain that over the coming period.  That is the reality.  The Deputy is correct in terms of identifying the variants as the significant factor now in how we deal with international travel.  There is a lot of fear and anxiety out there.  Bar some Deputies, this is the first time a call has come from different parties for mandatory quarantining universally.  That has not been said before by some of the parties that are saying it now.  That is fair enough; people can evolve in their positions.  The numbers, however, are way down and will remain very low given the additional measures we introduced and announced yesterday and any further measures that will be required regarding the variants.  There have been discussions between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State in the UK but they are at a preliminary stage.  I have had preliminary discussions with the British Prime Minister.  North-South discussions between officials from the Executive and our Government have been conducted in a constructive way in terms of sharing of data and so on.</p></speech>

This scheme has been in place for more than 40 years to resurface public roads not in the charge of the local authority.  I am talking about public roads, not private roads.  To qualify for the LIS, there must be at least two landholdings.  I know of several roads that have anything from eight or nine landholdings and five to 20 or more houses.</p>  <p>  County Kerry's new 2020 list started out with 707 applications that were prioritised.  We got just enough funding to do ten roads last year, leaving 697 more to be done.  If we only do ten roads each year it will take 69 or 70 years to complete our list.  Our last priority list of 2007 had approximately 350 applications.  We were doing fine up until 2012 when the scheme was suspended.  I know the Department of Finance is against this scheme because it believes the taxpayer is paying for the surfacing of private roads.  We are not talking about private roads, however.  These are public roads.  The people I am talking about are on public and not private roads.</p>  <p>  The scheme was suspended in 2012.  After being elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2016, I made several representations and requests in the rural affairs committee to the then Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, to reactivate the scheme, which he did in 2017.  I thank him for that and for giving us funding to finish off the 2007 programme.  From 2007 to 2012, Kerry County Council accepted 118 new applications, which were kept on file and are now also included in the 707 applications on the 2020 list.  Imagine applying in 2007 to get your road upgraded.  We are still waiting in 2021 and will perhaps wait for several more years.</p>  <p>  Will the Government be fair to the people in rural Ireland?  Many of these people are elderly, and perhaps sick, and carers and home help workers are trying to get in and out on roads that are in a desperate state.  People living on these roads are entitled to a good road to their door, the same as the people in Dublin 4.  I say again that these roads are not private; they are public.  I know the Department of Finance was trying to stop funding on that basis back in 2010.  These people have paid their motor, property and income tax and their insurance.  In most cases, they have their own water supply and septic tanks and do not even have broadband.  I believe they are entitled to a reasonable road surface to their homes.</p></speech>

I will ask the Minister to correspond with the Deputy about the details, however.  I take on board what the Deputy said about the challenges facing many people in terms of accessing funding for this over the years.  The Government has been in office just over six months and has identified investment in rural Ireland as a key priority.  That is clear in the programme for Government, particularly in terms of renewing our regional towns and villages and creating hubs of sustainable development.  Road infrastructure and investment in roads is key to that as well as the overall issues of infrastructure from broadband to wastewater infrastructure and so forth.</p>  <p>  We will be creating opportunities for local involvement in terms of development in rural communities.  The additional capital funding was provided this year through the Department in almost every area including road building, particularly minor roads.  We will do whatever we can to assist rural communities in County Kerry and across the country to have a faster acceleration and implementation of that programme for the people involved who have been waiting a considerable time to have funding sanctioned.  I will pursue that issue with the Minister and revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Again, I want to make it clear that this scheme was suspended for five years from 2012 to 2017, which is why we have a savage amount of applications now.  Some 697 applications are still waiting to get funding.  Many of these have been waiting since 2007.  I appeal to the Taoiseach.  The amount of money we got last year was something in the region of &euro;700,000.  That is not enough.  Like I said, if we continue in that vein of doing ten roads each year, it will take us 70 years to exhaust the list.  That is not fair on these people.  They are good, honest, hard-working people who are trying to exist where their fathers before them lived.  They want to continue living in these places.  They are, however, entitled to a good surface on their road, the same as the people in Dublin 4 are getting.  These people should not be left behind.  They contribute to this scheme.  They pay 20% of the cost and the Department has always made up 80% of it.  Do not let these people in rural Ireland down.  They vote for the Taoiseach as well as everyone else.  I am appealing to him.  These people need to be seen after and we need four times the amount of money we got last year to keep up.</p></speech>

As I said, a new scheme has been announced and I believe applications are due in before 26 February.  I will check that and ask the Minister to engage with the Deputy on this matter.  I will certainly talk to the Minister about the allocation and whether that can make a meaningful inroad on a serious backlog that has developed over the years because of the suspension of the scheme between 2012 and 2017.  I will make further inquiries in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700025#X00100"><p>On 22 October last, I submitted my first freedom of information, FOI, request to the Department of the Taoiseach on Covid-19 and a zero Covid-19 strategy.  I wrote to the Taoiseach's Department, the HSE and the Department of Foreign Affairs seeking all records of correspondence between them and their relevant counterparts in Northern Ireland, Britain or both in respect of: the co-ordination of a response to the Covid-19 pandemic; the adoption of an aligned Covid-19 strategy; and specifically, the adoption of an aligned zero Covid-19 strategy.  Three months have passed and it was only yesterday that the Taoiseach announced a whole-of-island approach.  However, little evidence of arrangements with either Administration has been properly provided by the Government.</p><p>The replies to my FOI requests were delayed but some were finally made available in recent weeks  Shockingly, the existence of documents relating to a zero Covid-19 strategy was not evident in any of the responses I received.  The possibility of a zero Covid-19 strategy was not discussed at all up until the dates included in my FOI requests.  I am being facetious here because I was not shocked at all.  The Government has been spinning one thing in the media about such a strategy being too difficult or not manageable.  The reality is, however, that the Government has not even discussed the possibility of adopting a strategy of this nature.</p><p>The Department of the Taoiseach finally replied to my requests on 14 January, almost two months late.  I had to appeal the decision of the Department because it did not comply with requirements set out in the Office of the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendations.  Specifically, I was informed:</p> <blockquote> 	- There is no detail provided in the decision makers letter as to the extent of the searches that were conducted.  I therefore am unable to properly consider whether the decision maker has conducted adequate searches.<br /><br />- The decision merely states the subject of the particular exemption being relied upon.  The decision maker has not outlined the particular adverse effect that they believe may arise or details of the specific factors considered, having regard to the specific contents of the relevant records.<br /><br />- No schedule of records has been provided.  Therefore, in relation to the documents retrieved the response does not contain:  	1. An itemisation of any records or parts thereof being refused<br /><br />2. A description of their contents<br /><br />3. A corresponding citation of the relevant exemptions applicable to those records or parts. In consideration of the appeal I referred to the investigation report produced by the Office of the Information Commissioner entitled, &ldquo;The Freedom of Information Act - Compliance by FOI Bodies&rdquo; - January 2020. </blockquote>  <p>It is absolutely ridiculous that a public representative has to go through such rigamarole in order to try to get information about our Covid-19 strategy.  It is no wonder that the public has lost faith in this Government.  There is no transparency, honesty or accountability.  There is just spin and, unfortunately, lies.  I updated my FOI requests and resubmitted them on 22 January last.  We then had the so called public announcements by the four men who are leading our Government's response yesterday evening, even though everything had already been leaked.  The Government's press calls should be renamed leak confirmation calls.</p><p>Let us see how much the Government has done in respect of an all-Ireland Covid-19 strategy over the past three months.  If that information is forthcoming, will it, as I suspect, emerge that there has been more dithering on the part of this ineffectual and apparently rudderless Government for the majority of the period in question.  The Taoiseach went against NPHET's advice in December and opened the economy for Christmas.  This led to hundreds of unnecessary deaths.  Our hospitals are operating above capacity and our hard-working front-line health service staff are at the end of their tethers.  Will the Taoiseach provide a full and detailed report to the D&aacute;il on the negotiations and discussions with both jurisdictions in pursuit of an all-Ireland Covid-19 strategy?</p></speech>

He is aware that the roadmap for living with Covid-19 was published a number of months ago and we are now at level 5 of that roadmap in the context of suppressing the numbers.  The numbers are falling steeply but there is enormous pressure on our hospitals.</p>  <p>  As already stated, our policy is clear.  It is a policy that involves prolonged suppression of the virus and getting the numbers down and keeping them there.  We will be assisted in that regard with the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  So far, we have been in a position to vaccinate the residents of nursing homes and the staff who work in long-term healthcare facilities, as well as up to 78,000 front-line healthcare workers.  The next phase will be to complete the first dose of all front-line healthcare workers.  We have commenced administering the second dose in 27 nursing homes.  That is a key part of our approach to managing and suppressing the virus.  That is why the level 5 restrictions have been extended to 5 March.  People have responded to those restrictions and their response is driving down the numbers.  That will help to relieve the pressure on the front-line healthcare workers who are doing extraordinary work in our hospitals and intensive care units.</p>  <p>  The possibility of a zero Covid-19 strategy has been discussed.  We have never received public health advice to pursue a such a strategy.  We debated the matter in this House and views were expressed.  However, the implications of such a strategy have never been fleshed out.  I am willing to debate it at any time in the context of the period for which the country would need to be locked down.  New Zealand will be locking down for a further 12 months.  That is its decision but its geography is somewhat different.</p>  <p>  The Deputy talks about the all-island strategy as if it is all the Dublin Government's fault.  That is a false and untrue fallback position that has no substance.  The Dublin Government does not run the Northern Ireland Executive.  There are five parties on that Executive and they have taken their decisions over time in respect of Covid-19.  The two chief medical officers have agreed a memorandum of understanding and they engage with each other.  We have had meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council and I have spoken on a number of occasions to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister on alignment.  The Deputy knows the political issues in the North as well as I do but he does not call them out either because it suits him and others to blame the Dublin Government for everything.  That tends to be the fallback position when, as he knows, the reality is different.</p></speech>

People always ask me what I think of the responses I receive on Leader's Questions and I say I never listen to them because they mean nothing.  The Taoiseach's response shows that to be true.  I would advise him to listen back to this debate because he has not responded in respect of what I asked him about.  The Taoiseach stated that he spoke to Northern Ireland representatives about Covid-19 and the response to it.  Where are the records of that?  There are no records.  I put in an FOI request specifically asking the Department for the records.  None were supplied and I was told that there are none.  The HSE came back to say that there are no records.  What has happened here?  Are these conversations taking place in a phone box or something?  The Government has civil servants sitting there making notes of these meetings.  If such notes have been made, the Government should publish them.  I would love to be able to come in here next week and say to the Taoiseach that I am sorry and that I was wrong.  I would love to be able to do so but I would say that I will not have to.</p></speech>

I will always listen to other Deputies' perspectives and  respond to them.  I do not dismiss them like the Deputy does and I am not as cynical as him that he does not even bother worrying about or listening to the reply any more.  He should not be putting the questions if that is his attitude.</p>  <p>  The Deputy knows I have spoken to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister and he knows what the attitude of the members of the Executive is on alignment with the Republic.  Unfortunately, one of the barriers to North-South alignment has been that there is a political dimension to it.  That dimension relates to both travel and alignment.  We are now in the position of being in alignment on the island in the context of the majority of measures we are taking.  We are at level 5 and Northern Ireland is at its highest level of lockdown as well.  We extended the lockdown until 5 March and not just until the end of February in order to maintain that alignment.  There is not full alignment on travel, however.  Those are the realities.  The Deputy knows that in his heart but it suits him to blame the Dublin Government.</p></speech>

I am not exaggerating when I say that the Government is using the Covid pandemic to gag the Opposition and minimise the opportunities for the Opposition to hold the Government accountable at a time of national emergency when people out there are asking questions about the strategy around Covid, around the state of our health services and all the different knock-on issues that are profoundly affecting our population.  One of those opportunities, which is being denied to us because of the severe curtailment - we accept there has to be some curtailment - of D&aacute;il activity is Taoiseach's questions.  We have asked for this for weeks.  The Taoiseach's questions slot, that normally comes after Leaders' Questions, is where the Taoiseach is questioned about the matters under his Department, all the various subcommittees that deal with Covid, etc.</p></speech>

That is not acceptable, as far as I am concerned.  It is a 40-minute slot.  We have asked for it for the past two weeks and it is being denied.  That is not accountability.  That is not leadership on the Taoiseach's part.  It does not give the public the opportunity to ask really urgent questions they have of Government.</p></speech>

There was a consensus at the Business Committee to try to get business done, obviously, in a shortened timeframe because of Covid-19 and the current levels that we are at.

I do not want to waste the D&aacute;il's time by calling votes, particularly if I am not getting support from others.  Nonetheless, I will make the point that we have six and a half minutes to question the Minister for Health tomorrow because the Government insists on limiting the time to debate with and question the Minister.  We have raised this repeatedly over the past few weeks.  It is unacceptable.  We have a raging debate about the refusal of the Government to even take seriously the calls for zero Covid.  We have a desperate crisis in our health services in terms of sickness of health workers, the situation in ICU, the vaccine roll-out and so on.  By the way, we asked that the debate would be about Covid response and not just about vaccines.</p></speech>

I presume that will not stop the Deputy from asking other questions either and the Minister from responding.  Then the Minister for Social Protection has 135 minutes on Covid-19 and then the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage for a fixed debate lasting 135 minutes on the Department's response to Covid-19.  The whole day is dominated by Covid so we should not give the impression that Covid is being marginalised.  It is dominating the day.</p></speech>

Students are in a position now where it is unclear when they will return to the classroom.  This year's sixth years are doubly disadvantaged because, of course, their fifth year studies were hugely disrupted last year and now they find themselves in a hugely pressurised position where their learning has been absolutely disrupted.  They have made clear that they need clarity at this point.  They need to know that there will be fairness at play and that they will be afforded a level of choice to sit the traditional examination if that is possible in the summertime or to have an alternative continuous-assessment grading system also.  The Taoiseach is now honour bound to make clear to students that that level of choice will be granted.  Any pretence now that we will have business as usual come the summer has absolutely zero credibility.  These young people have really suffered and they are suffering now with the lack of clarity and with the anxiety that they are experiencing, as are their families and the teachers concerned.</p></speech>

That creates real difficulties and challenges for the students concerned.  The Minister consistently has engaged with all the partners in education in relation to this, including the students' representatives, and is listening very carefully to the voices of the student representatives and of students more generally as they are articulated across the country.

Ten months later I have yet to receive a response.  Unfortunately, this is emblematic of the lax attitude and a deeper malaise at the heart of the Government in terms of contrary views on how the pandemic should be managed.</p>  <p>  The Government, however, has now accepted the Labour Party's proposal that checks should be set up 5 km from the Border with Northern Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House as to when the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will sign those regulations and what sanctions will be contained in them?</p></speech>

Given that the mother and baby homes commission has reported on mass disappeared infants' and children's remains in unmarked graves, there is a legal obligation for inquests to be carried out for each deceased individual.  We know this relates to a large number of coroners in every relevant district and would be unprecedented in the use of resources.  There is a legal obligation, however.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that coroners carry out their duty to ensure that survivors get justice?</p></speech>

There are clearly legal obligations but that in itself is an enormous challenge going back to the early decades of the State from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.  The 1940s in particular saw an appallingly high infant mortality rate in mother and baby homes.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is developing a broad base response to the commission's report.  How to deal with this will form part of it.</p></speech>

However, we should ask ourselves what makes money.  What makes money is work and the productivity of people who carry out that work.  The Debenhams workers will be 300 days out of their jobs next week.  After an arduous 300 days, they are left with no compensation according to the collective agreement.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach commit to translating the &euro;3 million that was recommended to bring them back to school, to send them back to education, into actual cash so that these workers and their families can have some peace of mind and some justice from the 300 arduous days of struggle they have carried on?

The Government is the only party which has honoured its commitments in respect of the workers concerned.  The Deputy is correct about the deficiencies in whatever collective agreement had been previously entered into at the time.</p>  <p>  We have gone through this with the representative bodies and the trade unions every way we can and we have pursued every avenue.  That &euro;3 million is not statutory redundancy.  It is a measure to provide some recognition to the workers of the challenges they face as a result of being made redundant.  We have a broad statutory redundancy scheme that applies to all workers who become redundant as a result of company liquidations.  We have been clear and consistent from the outset as to what we could do within the legal framework available to us.</p></speech>

Most of the Deputies present may not be aware but it will only require one injection rather than the usual two.  Were it to be approved, it would greatly accelerate and simplify the vaccine roll-out process.  The US Food and Drug Administration is likely to approve this vaccine candidate in the next ten days or so.</p>  <p>  From his European contacts, does the Taoiseach have any visibility as to when Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson will submit its literature concerning this vaccine candidate to the European Medicines Agency for approval?  If the Taoiseach has any thoughts on this, it would be much appreciated.</p></speech>

From my understanding, it will be early April when it comes to authorisation by the European Medicines Agency.  It could happen that it comes earlier but that is the timeline that I have right now.  It may improve.</p>  <p>  The European Commission's engagement with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson is a professional one and one with which it is satisfied in terms of the engagement with the company, its commitment to delivery schedules and so forth.  There is no doubt that it is an important development in the mass vaccination of our population.</p></speech>

Since the start of the pandemic, I have raised the issue of utility companies and pass through charges.  Every business, from hairdressers to big hotels to shops, which is closed is paying a fortune on these charges to utility companies.  One businessman wrote to me, telling me he pays &euro;4,000 a month on gas and electricity, just for the privilege of them coming to his door.</p>  <p>  Why does the Taoiseach not pass legislation in emergency measures to stop these companies robbing these businesses?  They cannot pay the money when they are closed  - they are d&uacute;nta and obeying the Government's advice.  Numerous businesses, such as shops and hotels, those with one employee to those with hundreds of employees, are closed but paying these charges.  Big business has been raping this country for years and getting away with it but we cannot pass legislation.</p>  <p>  We have a regulator who is asleep at the wheel.  We must have legislation to stop this happening.  These businesses will be broke.  They are broke as it but still paying this money that they cannot earn.  They have been closed by the Government.  They should be allowed to have respect from these companies which they deal with in good faith at all times.</p></speech>

The thresholds across the country are supposed to be reviewed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as it is its responsibility.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that this review takes place?  There is no way that a married couple which earns &euro;30,000 per year, or even &euro;40,000 a year, could buy a house in Donegal with their own means.  The only option for them is the council housing list which they are disbarred from because of the Government's policy.</p></speech>

That said, we have many people on the social housing list which is why this year the Government has allocated a record &euro;3 billion to housing and announced a record programme of social house building for the next 12 months.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, that has been impacted by Covid and level 5 restrictions.

We are all aware that the Northern Executive Minister of Health, Robin Swann, has been looking for this information and this issue to be dealt with since last March.  We have heard from the Department of Transport and members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, that there is a GDPR issue.  I welcome that the Taoiseach said something rather positive about his interaction with the Northern Executive.  Will he tell me what is the update and what is the lie of the land on this so we can cut off things such as the back door through Belfast and provide a proper all-Ireland response?</p></speech>

The Northern Ireland Executive wants us to share data on passengers coming in through Dublin Airport and who transit on to Northern Ireland.  We are working to provide this.  There was constructive engagement.  Sometimes I am somewhat surprised by the public statements because they do not reflect the private conversations that have been had.  I will put it that way to the Deputy.  I raised this issue at meetings with the First Minister and deputy First Minister and said we want to engage constructively.  Our officials have engaged constructively on this and we want to find a resolution as quickly as we possibly can.  The decisions we took yesterday will accelerate this.

However, 60% of the cases now being diagnosed are of the UK variant.  Last year, I told the House more than once that the virus was not growing in the back yard of pubs and rather that it was coming in on airlines.  The Government did nothing about it.  The virus did not walk across the Irish Sea.  We are an island country.  I have to say that people are dead and some people will never again be the same after having the virus.  Special needs schools are closed.  Is the Government's belated attempt to do something about the virus coming into this country a charade or only an attempt to cover up for not doing what it should have done all along?  It is very easy to close down pubs.  It is very easy to close down the country and that is what the Government has done.  It was not the virus that did it.</p></speech>

That was proven to be grossly untrue because of the facts.  The pandemic grew out of control when all of the public houses were closed.  At the same time, the spin from the Government was to victimise, demonise and put down our public houses because of some reason best known to the Taoiseach and the Government.  I would like the Taoiseach to answer this charge if he could, please.  I want to know what set had the Government not just against rural publicans but urban publicans also?</p></speech>

I know that in earlier stages of the debate Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Mary Lou McDonald and others called for the pubs to be opened, saying they should have been opened a long time ago.  Have you learned anything from what has transpired?  Human behaviour in all settings affects the spread of the virus.  We do not blame publicans at all <i>per se</i>.  In some cases, there were people who in certain settings breached the regulations and the rules.  People in this House know that.  Across the country, guidelines were not adhered to and rules were not adhered to in many settings, not just in public houses and hospitality but in many settings.  We did not open wet pubs prior to the Christmas period because the evidence was there that it would be a contributing factor to the spread of the virus.  The virus spreads through the congregation of people in many different settings.  Yes, travel has to be dealt with also.</p></speech>

It is one of only 13 projects specifically mentioned to progress during the national development plan.  Furthermore, 30% of the project has already been spent, that is &euro;17 million out of &euro;58 million, with advanced works already concluded.  We can see that works have been done.  Page 26 of the programme for Government states the process of review of the national development plan and updating of the national planning framework will not frustrate or delay existing projects.  One of these existing projects is the Coonagh to Knockalisheen road.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, is delaying signing off the project.  It is vital.  It was part of regeneration.  It was introduced by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government.  Is it a commitment in the programme for Government and will it be signed off so it can be completed?</p></speech>

That meeting with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, took place and there is only one word to describe it, which is disastrous.  He walked into the Moyross community and told them what was best for them and did not listen to what they said.  This road is critical infrastructure for the regeneration programme in Limerick.  We are now in a situation where if this road is not delivered the whole project will be torpedoed.  The community feels abandoned and totally disrespected and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, did himself no favours on Friday.  The Taoiseach said he would speak to him.

When we start to plan our recovery we need to make changes to embed better environmental approaches, particularly on climate action.  I remind the Taoiseach we have lost a lot of ground on this.  Only 3% of the promised electric vehicle charging points for public use have been rolled out in the past 15 months.  Retrofitting has collapsed.  My question to the Taoiseach is whether we can ensure some of this work is included because it is safe to put electric vehicle charging in public places, even under level 5.  When will we see a new climate action plan?  Can we publish a retrofitting wave early so that large swathes of our cities and country could adapt better environmental practices in their homes?</p></speech>

I will pursue the issue on electric vehicle charging points in the current situation.  I will make inquiries in this regard.  The Minister is anxious to proceed with the new climate action plan as quickly as possible.  There will be a series of Cabinet committee meetings in respect of this issue and, of course, considerable progress has been made on the wider legislation following engagement with the Oireachtas.  There will be further amendments to ensure as progressive a framework of legislation as we can possibly have in this area.  With regard to retrofitting, I do not accept that it has collapsed.  In fact, we have invested strongly in the midlands, for example, for a significant, expanded programme for retrofitting.</p></speech>

One family home has already been abandoned and 600 ha of farming land and livelihoods are under water.  As I stand here, two additional family homes are under immediate threat of flooding.  These are the homes of an elderly couple in their 80s and a mother in her 70s.  So far, a hosepipe at both homes is the only thing protecting them from these floods.  What as public representatives are we doing here today when elderly people in their homes are at risk of flooding?  This has gone beyond a joke.  These homes are under immediate threat.  I ask the Taoiseach for action, not for meetings or reports but action.</p> <p>I want to see the OPW-----</p></speech>

The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that people can no longer be discriminated against on the basis that they are from a disadvantaged socio-economic area, background or accent.  For example, if this Bill is enacted, employers and service providers could not discriminate against a job applicant or current employee because of their accent or the socio-economic status of the area they come from.</p>  <p>  Over the past 20 years, there have been countless reports and many recommendations have been made for this inclusion.  In 2019, Paul McKeon, on behalf of the Institute of International and European Affairs, noted in his work that the continued exclusion of socio-economic status has created a hierarchy of equality in Ireland, where the State sends a message that it has protections against some forms of discrimination but allows others.</p>  <p>  During the previous D&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il looked to pass a similar Bill and got support from Sinn F&eacute;in and the Greens.  I hope that support will be returned for this Bill, which will address the concerns Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party had then.</p>  <p>  On the topic of lived experience in parts of the Dublin South-East constituency which I serve, this is a systemic issue that dates back generations for people who live in local authority flat complexes and who report high levels of generational and present-day social exclusion and discrimination, which is directly and indirectly due to their social and economic background.  In one example, a young constituent from a flat complex, who had a master&rsquo;s degree and is a fluent Portuguese speaker, reported to me that after submitting a video application for a job in a multinational company, he was later contacted by a concerned employee of that large multinational company.  This employee informed him that fellow employees had joked and mocked the young individual&rsquo;s inner-city Dublin accent, with one questioning how and where "the knacker" picked up Portuguese while reviewing his video application.</p>  <p>  On a final note, this Bill is an important step in sending out a message to society and to those who are affected by this type of discrimination that it is unacceptable.  I believe the Government can, and will, support this Bill.</p></speech>

We know that any true measure of a society is how it treats its citizens, especially the most vulnerable, the young and the old, regardless of their socio-economic background.  We must ensure that discrimination of any kind is called out and that those who experience it have somewhere they can go to make a complaint and have their rights defended.</p>  <p>  Current legislation provides for discrimination on the grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability and race, and against members of the Traveller community.  What is missing is the same kind of protection against discrimination on the grounds of socio-economic status.  The need for this legislation has been well-documented in various reports from human rights and equality groups, particularly in the past decade as we see poverty increase.  Ireland now falls behind other EU member states on this issue, and this legislation is long overdue.  An ESRI report a few years ago highlighted that this form of discrimination is likely to be unreported, which suggests we also need to have an awareness campaign, particularly for employers and for the workplace, and to really put out the message that discriminating against someone&rsquo;s social class or economic background will no longer be tolerated.</p>  <p>  Where people are from, their address, their accent, their economic situation or their social position should not be a barrier to employment, education, housing or any other services.  This is about class discrimination, which is systemic, and it will need more than this legal remedy to stamp it out.  Right-wing social policies are part of the problem that makes it difficult to break the cycle of poverty and much more needs to change.  We need a Sinn F&eacute;in-led Government to effect this change but, for now, recognising that this kind of discrimination exists and adding socio-economic status as a form of discrimination to the legislation is an important step.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s well-intended Bill back in 2017 was unnecessarily blocked by the Fine Gael Government on Committee Stage.  Claims that the definitions were problematic were not credible.  International examples of how this is done are readily available.  It was a poor excuse by Fine Gael then and it is a poor excuse now.  It is time to get on with it.  I hope others will support the passage of this Bill and that, today, we take this important step towards breaking the cycle of systemic discrimination against people with a socio-economic disadvantage or a particular accent, or because they come from a certain area.</p></speech>

On a weekly basis, I get representations from my constituents, from Ongar right across to Tyrellstown and down to the Navan Road and the Royal Canal area.  Many members of our community, including those who ride these dangerous bikes in our communities, have been seriously injured and, tragically, some have lost their lives.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to extend the powers of garda&iacute; to seize and detain quad bikes and scramblers used unlawfully in public places, including public parks and green spaces.  The Bill will establish an offence of driving a quad bike or scrambler in a public place and will provide for penalties or a fine and-or seizure of the vehicle and-or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months.  The Bill will finally close a loophole that has allowed those terrorising our communities to openly ride scramblers on our green spaces and parks.</p><p>I was very disappointed that the Government did not include proposed legislation for this term.  This does not tally with its promise on 18 November, when the Minister stood in the D&aacute;il and said:</p> <blockquote> 	The seriousness with which the Government takes this issue is reflected in the programme for Government commitment to &ldquo;Enhance powers available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to limit the use of scramblers and quads by those engaged in anti-social behaviour and enact legislation to add to those powers if needed.&rdquo; </blockquote>  <p>If the Government was genuinely concerned about the issue of scramblers in our communities, I would not have had to move this Bill today.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it overwhelmingly affects working-class communities and that is why I believe no action has been taken on it to date.  Scramblers and quad bikes are also a nuisance to local communities across the State.  We have seen greenways and sports pitches ruined by the skid marks and tyre marks of quad bikes and scramblers.</p>  <p>  While this might seem the least concerning problem with the use of these vehicles, it is now a concern for residents of urban housing estates.  Community members give up their time to ensure sports pitches and sports clubs are maintained properly.  Folks use their precious leisure time to ensure that our kids have facilities and sports fields.  For those who give up their time, it is extremely disheartening to turn up on a Saturday or Sunday morning and see the damage done by these vehicles.  These bikes cause thousands of euro worth of damage annually.  Pitches have to be relaid at great expense to clubs and schools in terms of both time and money.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have told me they are given instructions not to chase quad bikes when they are driving around council estates because of the safety risk to themselves, to the drivers and to people walking around the area.</p> <p>Unfortunately, sometimes the age of quad bike and scrambler users is cause for great concern.  Road Safety Authority, RSA, statistics show that 48% of incidents resulting in death or injury on scramblers involved people under the age of 18 years.  Children do not know, nor should not be expected to know, how to maintain a vehicle.  Last spring, garda&iacute; in Limerick stopped two youths who were operating scramblers in the canal bank area of the city.  Neither was wearing protective equipment and neither bike had working brakes.  There is no requirement to register these vehicles in general and no minimum safety checks are performed on the vehicles.</p> <p> Safety concerns around scramblers are nothing new.  Unfortunately, there have been a number of deaths and serious injuries as a result of their use.  As far back as 2007, there was tragedy in Limerick when a young girl had an accident in a field when using a scrambler.  </p> <p>I am concerned by two particular aspects of the use of the vehicles in urban settings.  One is the age of the operators.  Scramblers are often bought as Christmas presents for children.  Children should not have access to motorised vehicles.  They do not appreciate the grave dangers these vehicles pose to themselves and others.  Their use in an urban setting is very irritating to other residents who endure the constant sound of engines revving.  They must be alert to the presence of these vehicles on footpaths as well as roads and green areas.  It is simply not fair.  Concern about the use of quad bikes and scramblers is not new, but Covid restrictions brought home to many the sheer number of these vehicles in urban areas.  People who were confined to their homes witnessed and heard these disruptions 24-7.  </p> <p> I commend the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  It calls for non-contentious and logical steps to ensure proper regulations of these vehicles.  It would give garda&iacute; the necessary powers to seize the bikes and detain the users where the vehicles are being used in a dangerous and reckless manner, extend the legal definition of "public space", and extend the national vehicle database.  </p> <p> For clarity, there are people who use quad bikes and scramblers very responsibly.  Those people must also be protected.  This Bill is not aimed at people who use them properly in sport.  </p></speech>

Covid lockdowns have seen many welcome new pets into their families, which has caused the price of pets to increase radically in that time.  My family has a pet dog called Rua.  He is a fantastic dog with a great temperament.  He is a cross between a golden retriever and a red setter.  We bought him for &euro;50 13 years ago.  The same breed of dog is now advertised online for &euro;1,500.  There is a radical increase in the price of pets across the country, which is driving a very lucrative market that pet thieves are tapping into.  Professional gangs are making big money from this market.  Many stories have circulated of thieves marking up concrete outside people's gates with chalk or tying string to gates during the day, and then returning in the cover of darkness to steal these pets.  Recently, garda&iacute; found 32 stolen dogs worth more than &euro;150,000 in Baldoyle.  It shows that there is a viable market for criminal enterprises.  Many of the stolen dogs in that case were pregnant so the criminal gangs made extra profit from the pups.  Many pups are sold online and for cash.  This makes the Garda investigation even more difficult.  There have been many credible reports of stolen pets, quickly put on ferries and brought to Britain where they are sold.</p><p>I have conducted a good bit of research into this criminal market in recent years.  The figures are incredible.  Over the past five years, 1,000 incidents of animal theft have been reported to the Garda, mainly canine, ovine, bovine and equine.  They are only the reported thefts.  Many families do not report the thefts or think that their pet has simply disappeared so they are not included in the figures.  The reported figures are below the reality, which is far higher.</p><p>In 2020, the number of reported thefts in the State increased by 60%, despite the restrictions last year.  Some 196 instances of animal theft were reported to the Garda, of which only 40 resulted in charges or summonses, and, therefore, for every five instances of animal theft, only one results in a charge.  I have no doubt that garda&iacute; are doing the best they can on this but it is time legislators stepped up and ensured legislation reflects the reality for many.  I am glad to see the DSPCA and the Dogs Trust, which work with stolen animals daily, support the Aont&uacute; Bill and believe that politicians should get behind it so that it is enacted as soon as possible.  </p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to create a mandatory minimum sentence for theft.  The theft of an animal or pet is not the same as the theft of an inanimate object from someone's house.  One could steal a phone, laptop or stereo of approximately the same cost as a family pet but the penalty should not be the same because a cat or dog can be a member of the family and be central to the family.  When one loses a family pet, one can grieve over it because they are so important.  We believe that when people break the law in this area there should be a mandatory minimum sentence of ten months in prison.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700031#DD00150"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:  	Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Covid Restrictions Support Scheme) (Percentage Adjustment) Order 2021, a copy of which was laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 13th January, 2021. </blockquote>  <p>The resolution seeks the approval of the House for a draft order which provides for additional support under the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, to businesses that are forced to restrict access to their premises over the Christmas period.</p><p>I want to start by setting out the context for our debate, which is the unprecedented support being provided by the Government to assist businesses in Ireland through this pandemic.  The support has been economy-wide, and there has also been significant additional support for sectors that have been particularly and harshly affected by the pandemic.  For example, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has put in place a range of measures to support businesses through loan and loan guarantees, grant schemes and business training and advisory schemes.</p><p>Specific sectoral supports include the &euro;55 million tourism business support scheme put in place by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, the &euro;5 million provided for the tourism product development fund, and the coach tourism business continuity scheme, which is a &euro;10 million fund to provide coach tourism businesses with a direct financial contribution to help support them with future operational and continuity plans.</p><p>For arts and entertainment sectors, some &euro;25 million was provided last June, including &euro;20 million for the Arts Council, as well as additional supports for regional museums.  A further &euro;29 million was provided in the July stimulus plan, which included funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, our national cultural institutions, a fund for our music industry and supports for live performance.</p><p>Significant additional funding was announced in budget 2021, with &euro;130 million allocated to the Arts Council for this year and &euro;50 million for supports for live performance.  A total of &euro;5.5 billion has now also been spent on the pandemic unemployment payment, with nearly half a million people receiving a payment this week.</p><p>Under my own Department and the Revenue Commissioners, the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme have provided significant levels of support across our entire economy and society.  Almost &euro;3 billion was paid to 66,600 employers in respect of 664,500 employees under the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  As of last Thursday, the Revenue Commissioners had made payments of &euro;1.6 billion to over 43,000 employers in respect of half a million employees under the employment wage subsidy scheme.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have also assisted Irish businesses through debt warehousing schemes, with 70,000 companies putting tax liabilities of almost &euro;2 billion into these schemes.  The unprecedented effort that the Revenue Commissioners have put into the operation of these schemes should be supported.</p><p>Today, we are discussing the Covid restrictions support scheme, which has been an extremely successful intervention by the Government, aimed at providing support to businesses whose customers are prevented from accessing their premises because of public health restrictions.  Again, I want to acknowledge the work done by Revenue.  As of this morning, 56,700 claims for payments under this scheme of &euro;239 million in respect of 20,000 premises had been made and &euro;237.6 million of this has now been processed for payment.</p><p>On considering the approach to easing public health restrictions in early December, the Government decided that additional seasonal support in the form of a double payment would be provided through the Covid scheme to qualifying businesses that would remain closed over the Christmas period under the restrictions.  This was in recognition of the additional financial impact on these businesses of being closed during a very important trading period.</p><p>The relevant provision is contained in section 11 of the Finance Act 2020, which was passed by the Oireachtas and signed by the President just before Christmas.  It provides that the Minister for Finance may vary the scheme by order in a number of ways, including by varying the levels of payment - 10% and 5% of average 2019 turnover - for a specified period of time.</p><p>The legislation sets out a number of steps to be taken before an order varying the scheme can be made, including an assessment of up-to-date data regarding the economy and consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The assessment considered the scale of the Government's intervention in the economy to support vulnerable individuals and businesses and to ensure that the economy will be in a position to recover when the pandemic is under control.  It concluded that there was scope to continue the supports provided by the Government.</p><p>The live register data show that the Covid-19 crisis continues to have a significant effect on the number of jobs in our country.  The assessment concluded that the sectors which are affected by the changes to the restrictions announced since the start of December are disproportionately affected because of their reliance on this part of the year to support leaner times in other parts of the year.  Businesses rely on strong retail sales in December and it is proportionately the most important month for them.  Therefore, missing out on the expected stronger sales in December can be expected to have a significant effect on their annual turnover, with multiple implications for ongoing operation and survival.</p><p>The double payment for the three-week period is intended to mitigate the effects of the December restrictions on businesses.  A draft order to implement this was laid before the D&aacute;il on 13 January.  The final part of this process is that that order shall not be made unless a resolution approving of the draft order has been passed by the D&aacute;il.  This is what we are discussing today.</p><p>The Covid restrictions support scheme is a targeted scheme aimed at businesses which are forced to restrict access to their premises on foot of health regulations.  It is a part of the broad spectrum of Government supports being provided to assist businesses to cope with the devastating effects of this disease, which I referred to a moment ago.  The design and operation of the scheme is predicated on restrictions preventing or restricting access to business premises and it only applies to such businesses.  In designing the scheme, it was necessary to provide anchor points, including the concept of business premises, to which access is restricted.  This is because the public health regulations may make provisions in relation to restrictions in specific locations, such as a county or a region, or can operate nationally as is now the case.  Therefore, support could be provided to businesses which operate in a restricted location with reference to the physical location of their premises.</p><p>The scheme applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which require the businesses to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and which as a result are operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p><p>I appreciate that a number of businesses are not eligible for this scheme.  For example, they may not operate from a fixed business premises or they do not have customers coming into their premises to purchase goods or services.  Perhaps they provide goods or services to other businesses that are closed even though they themselves are open or they may be open but their customers cannot get to them because of public health restrictions.</p><p>The vast majority of businesses in the State are affected by Covid but this scheme is intended as a very targeted scheme rather than the general measure, which is the employment wage subsidy scheme.  This scheme was specifically designed to provide additional support to businesses that have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health regulations.  That said, the Government has provided significant and unprecedented levels of support to the economy and this level of support will continue for as long as is necessary to deal with the effects of this disease.  However, equally, it cannot continue indefinitely.</p><p>I do not propose to significantly amend the scheme.  The scheme is based on the business premises being located in a region to which public health restrictions apply and access to these premises being restricted.  It simply would not be possible to amend these parameters to allow businesses excluded by these criteria to become eligible.</p><p>The Government and I will continue to assess the effects of the pandemic on businesses and the economy and I will continue to work with my colleagues in government to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p> <p>In this regard, the T&aacute;naiste has asked his officials to look further at what additional supports should be provided to businesses that are not eligible for this scheme.  Additional funds for areas such as tourism are already in place.  With this scheme, we have a clear scheme in place where funds can be quickly and easily claimed by eligible businesses.  Clear guidance is to be found on the Revenue website.  This guidance is continually being updated, reflecting the types of questions that businesses are raising in relation to the scheme.</p> <p> This is a successful and important scheme.  It achieved what we set out to deliver.  It provides significant additional support to businesses located in regions or, as is now the case, in our entire country, which are subject to restrictions regarding access to their premises.  It does this quickly and simply and provides support which is broad and not sector-specific.  It is an advance credit for trading expenses and is operated by Revenue because of its tax base, as well as Revenue's efficiency in getting funds to businesses.</p> <p> The legislation allows certain limited flexibility within the parameters of the scheme relating to changes to the percentages of turnover, which are the subject of the draft order tabled for consideration today.  A draft order providing for an increase in the levels of payment to 20% of average 2019 turnover, up to &euro;20,000, and to 10% of turnover above that amount for the three weeks beginning 21 December, 28 December and 4 January has been laid before the D&aacute;il.  The resolution approves the order and I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad rud n&aacute; ba mhaith liom mo leas&uacute; f&eacute;in ar an r&uacute;n seo a mholadh sa Teach.</p><p>The motion is to approve the regulations made by the Minister to vary the level of payments made under the Covid restrictions support scheme during the Christmas period.  The percentage adjustment order was made in accordance with section 11 of the Finance Act, which allows the Minister to vary the payment under the scheme for a specified period.  There are a number of steps to be taken under the legislation before such an order can be made, including consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and for a draft to be laid before the House.  That draft was laid before the House on 13 January and the motion before us this afternoon is another step in that process for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to approve these regulations.  The order provides for a double payment for businesses for the three weeks over the Christmas period, starting on 21 December.  The level of payment for each of these three weeks is increased from 10% to 20% of average 2019 turnover up to &euro;20,000, and from 5% to 10% of turnover above that amount.  However, the &euro;5,000 weekly cap for payments remains in place.  For example, where a pub owner was eligible for &euro;1,300 per week under CRSS from 13 October, he or she was able to claim &euro;2,600 per week for the three weeks beginning 21 December.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support any measure that is reasonable and provides additional support and much-needed relief for businesses that have been forced to close due to public health restrictions.  Employers and employees are all struggling to keep their heads above water.  We have spoken to many of them.  The double payments that this order provides for were made in recognition of the fact that the financial impact for remaining closed over many businesses' most busy trading period in the year were, in our view, an appropriate and necessary measure to compensate for the losses brought about by the public health measures introduced by the Government.</p><p>Nationwide level 5 restrictions came into force on 24 December.  While the Covid restrictions support scheme has provided relief for nearly 20,000 businesses, thousands more have fallen through the cracks.  Those thousands are unable to avail of support due to restrictive eligibility criteria which exclude them.  The Covid restrictions support scheme came into operation on 13 October.  It did so with strict criteria in place for businesses which qualified for support.  For a business to be eligible, it must carry out its business activity on a fixed premises.  As the guidelines make clear, mobile premises or premises which are not permanently fixed in place do not meet the definition of business premises.  Businesses that fail to meet this definition include thousands in the tourism, hospitality and events sectors and they are denied support despite their turnover falling through the floor.  For a business to be eligible, it must be able to demonstrate that customers of the business are prohibited or restricted significantly from accessing those businesses' premises as a result of the Covid guidelines.  The Government's guidelines state:</p> <blockquote> 	It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its [business] activity. </blockquote>  <p>This means that suppliers to public-facing businesses do not qualify for this scheme despite the fact that their business and turnover is directly impacted by the Covid restrictions.  As a result, these rigid and narrow criteria lock out tens of thousands of hard-pressed businesses, including suppliers, event managers, companies, taxi drivers, the outdoor activity industry, businesses without a fixed premises and many others.  They are shut out and not able to avail of this scheme.</p><p>The failure to take account of the impact that Covid restrictions are having on supply chains in our economy is reckless and surprising.  The Central Bank warned of the economic shock of Covid-19 throughout domestic supply chains as far back as April last year.  The logic is not difficult to follow.  Firms that supply goods and services to public-facing businesses are immediately hit by public health restrictions.  The Central Bank found that suppliers' sales to businesses directly affected by social distancing policies that restricted the ability of customers to purchase from firms amounted to &euro;13.5 billion annually.  The Covid restrictions support scheme pays no attention to these suppliers and their importance to our economy.</p><p>The problems with the scheme are not new.  They have been pointed out to the Minister previously and have been ignored by the Minister and T&aacute;naiste previously.  These issues were raised with the Minister by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, when the legislation came before the D&aacute;il in November, while I raised them on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  I, like all colleagues, have been in contact with businesses which, despite seeing their turnover fall by 90% or more, cannot access this scheme.  They are locked out from it despite having non-payroll expenses and fixed costs to pay.  On 19 January, 17 businesses wrote to me stating that it came as a shock to them, when applying for the CRSS, to be told by Revenue that even though up to 90% of their customers could not trade, they did not qualify for the scheme.  This was despite their turnover being down by between 80% and 90%.  They concluded by saying that to be told that they do not qualify for support under the CRSS is soul-destroying and that they are appealing for additional support.</p><p>There are thousands of such businesses and they employ tens of thousands of workers in our economy.  The incomes and livelihoods of countless families depend on their survival.  One business I spoke to at the weekend said that if does not see a light at the end of the tunnel regarding access to CRSS then there is no point in it continuing, because it cannot continue to fill the holes.  To lock these businesses out of the scheme with no alternative in place is economically senseless.  It is a glaring problem that we have raised with the Government since the scheme was first introduced.  Many of these businesses are now borrowing to meet their non-payroll expenses and fixed costs.  Without additional support, this growing debt burden risks a wave of insolvencies and job losses that will scar our economy and communities for years to come.</p><p>Our amendment to the motion notes that the Covid restrictions support scheme has been a vital and effective financial support to many businesses that have been significantly affected by Covid-19 restrictions.  It also recognises that countless businesses, suppliers and those without fixed premises are excluded from the scheme.</p> <p>They are struggling to meet fixed costs and non-payroll expenses.  These businesses are crucial to our post-Covid recovery and staving off the scourge of unemployment.  Our amendment calls on the Government to remove the eligibility criteria that lock these businesses out of the scheme.  We completely dispute and refute the claim by the Minister that this cannot be done.  Of course, if can be done and it should have been done if the political will was there.  What needs to be done is to ensure that these businesses qualify for this much-needed relief.  The arguments against doing so, which were put forward by the Government in November 2020, were weak.  They are equally as weak, if not more so, today, given the economic environment and the continued restrictions that we are likely to face. </p> <p> When the scheme was introduced, the Government projected that it would cost &euro;80 million per week.  In fact, it has cost much less than that.  It has &euro;220 million since it came into operation, which equates, on average, to less than &euro;15 million per week.  This is less than one quarter of the projected cost.  Of course, the short-term costs are blown away by the long-term savings through business survival and reduced unemployment.  The Minister and the T&aacute;naiste have dithered on the issue of expanding the scheme and dealing with those who have been locked out of it for far too long.  It is symptomatic of a broader sluggishness in the Government's response - a sluggishness that has denied mortgage holders and SMEs much-needed payment breaks from their lenders.  Business, workers and our economy can no longer tolerate this sluggishness that is often mistaken for prudence.  The consequences are too grave.  Immediate action must be taken.  I, therefore, call on the Government and all parties and representatives in this D&aacute;il to support the amendment and to ensure that hard-pressed businesses are no longer excluded and locked out from this much-needed support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700033#FF00200"><p>I thank the Minister for bringing this important resolution to the House.  The CRSS has been an important lifeline for thousands of good, viable businesses across the country since it was introduced just a couple of months ago.  The Minister will not mind me taking the time to pay tribute to the hard-working officials in the Revenue Commissioners, and in his Department in ensuring, at least in my experience, a practically glitch-free implementation of this very important scheme, and other crucial supports that he outlined earlier, including the TWSS, EWSS and other supports.  The officials responsible for drafting such schemes are a great credit to our civil and public service, and represent the best traditions of that service.</p>  <p>  On the resolution itself, it is good that a double week payment has been applied.  That can also be applied to businesses which found themselves having to shut their doors on 31 December 2020.  If I am correct, it is being applied to the likes of gyms and other businesses in the leisure sector.  This is a very traumatic time for business owners and managers across the country, and indeed their staff.  I hope that these important measures and supports will help to sustain businesses through a very difficult period and ensure they remain viable to the point where they can flourish when the conditions allow and our economy starts to grow again.  The scheme will help, and has helped, on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis to provide supports to pay overheads that exist whether a business is in operation or not.  </p>  <p>  I note from Revenue information available on its very accessible website that, as of 21 January 2021, the total value of claims came in at &euro;221.5 million, covering 19,500 premises.  Almost one quarter of all premises involved provide personal services such as hairdressers and beauticians, and so on.  The highest payout, if I can call it that, involves the pub trade.  I guess that is not surprising.  The average time it takes to turn an application around - from application to payment - is three days.  That is impressive in anyone's language and needs to be acknowledged.  In my home county of Louth, the total number of premises covered is 820, with the total value of claims amounting to just under &euro;8 million.  </p>  <p>  Like other Deputies, I have raised issues with the Minister on the floor, particularly on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2020 in respect of the kinds of businesses that the CRSS does not cover.  For example, businesses providing food and supplies to the hospitality sector might meet all criteria to qualify for the scheme in respect of a sufficient drop in turnover, but they are excluded because their premises are still open, albeit operating a skeleton service to support, for example, takeaway businesses.  In addition, there are businesses with, for example, casual trading licences, or an on-course bookmaker's licence with a paid-for pitch, which will not qualify because they do not operate from what might be termed a "permanent" bricks and mortar premises.  This is an anomaly in the scheme.  I understand what the scheme is designed to do, but, nevertheless, it is an anomaly that I hope the Minister will consider addressing in some other way.  He has indicated that the T&aacute;naiste will be looking at other supports that might be more adaptable and targeted for specific kind of sectors.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment deals with that to an extent.  I raised the issue by way of amendment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2020, just a few weeks ago, albeit the amendments were ruled out of order.  </p>  <p>  We know that the restrictions currently in place will remain so at least until 5 March 2021.  For pubs and restaurants, the likelihood is that restrictions impacting on their businesses will remain for much longer.  I have no doubt that the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have run some figures and done scenario planning in that regard and in respect of the extension of this scheme for a further few months.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to extend, in effect, wage subsidy supports beyond the 31 March cut-off point.  Does he plan to do the same with schemes such as this, and the CRSS in particular?  Can he provide estimated costings if the scheme is to be extended beyond the cut-off date that was originally intended?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700033#FF00300"><p>I wish to share time with Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, for being here to listen to my plea.  I very much support today's resolution and the CRSS, but I have to use my time to point out an anomaly with it.  Before I do that, I would like to day the Government is extremely well-placed to adjust and increase supports, given, on the one hand, the better-than-expected performance in respect of corporation tax and Exchequer revenue generally.  Second, as alluded to by other speakers, when initially profiled, the cost of some &euro;80 million per week was foreseen, while we all acknowledge that those in receipt of the CRSS are most welcoming of it and it will certainly assist them in this never-ending misery in terms of their prospects for surviving.  As was also mentioned earlier, the cost of the scheme at the moment is less that one quarter of what was budgeted.  In addition, in budget 2021 we voted for a contingency budget, which is included.  The scope is certainly there and I appeal to the Minister to act on it.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 17 nationwide wholesalers relevant to supporting the on-trade.  There are approximately five in my area in the north-west, and they are spread throughout the country.  They employ up to 800 people and all are family-run.  Historically, they were known as wholesale bottlers.  Some 90% of their customers are closed and 90% of their orders are gone.  In practice, these wholesalers act as a credit line to the on-trade.  For example, in one instance, at the beginning of the pandemic, let us say, 15 March 2020, a wholesaler with an annual turnover of &euro;11 million was owed approximately &euro;1.8 million, and had to enter into payment plans for this.  That is a huge issue.  Of course, the other supports are available to them, but they are nowhere near enough.  They cannot compete and they do not supply the multiples directly.</p> <p>They only supply the on-trade businesses, including gastropubs, hotels and so on, which are not open.</p> <p> There are 17 family businesses in this situation, involving 800 people to whom we can afford to extend the scheme.  There are only 17 of them, as I said, and we should extend cover to them.  In my own area, for example, MCM Brands in Ballyshannon, County Donegal has 18 employees.  That is 18 pay packets every week and 18 families affected in a town that has suffered greatly, through many generations, from neglect by consecutive Governments.  Kelly &amp;amp; Co wholesalers, Gill's and G. McFadden &amp;amp; Sons, all in County Donegal, are in the same boat.  Drino Drinks in County Leitrim is another example.  These people are expected to stand still on the wage subsidy and, in effect, put their businesses at a complete disadvantage, without hope of recommencing supply to the trade after the fact.  Indeed, many on-trade pubs, having made their Christmas orders and with their stores full, had to close at Christmas, understandably, with the pandemic numbers the way they are, and the wholesalers are expected to take the stock back.  They do so, of course, because that is what they do.</p> <p> I urge the Minister to extend this scheme.  We have the money to do it, both by way of the extra taxation revenue and because the scheme is undersubscribed, as other Deputies noted, to the extent that only some &euro;20 million or less is being used on it per week.  As a colleague and a Government backbencher, I ask the Minister to extend the scheme for the small number of businesses involved.  There are 17 of them nationally and 800 families affected.  I ask that we give them the support from the CRSS that they deserve.</p></speech>

The majority of Deputies in the House today will welcome the announcement regarding the Covid restrictions support scheme, but a number of anomalies have been brought to our attention that need to be highlighted.  Like Deputy Nash, I commend the work the Minister and his Department have done on this issue, as well as the work of Revenue.  As Deputy Nash said, the turnaround times have been very good and the process has been very efficient, and that is to be welcomed.  At the same time, there are a number of issues and anomalies that need to be flagged.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on one of those issues.  I have been contacted by many constituents, specifically caravan and camping park owners, regarding their unfair exclusion from the CRSS.  It is my understanding that in early December, Revenue updated the scheme guidelines to exclude camping and caravan sites on the basis that they involve an outdoor activity and that such activities are not ordinarily carried out from a business premises, as defined for CRSS purposes.  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister's Department on this issue recently.  The response stated: "Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, such as a camping or caravan site or a boat charter business, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS."  I would like to make the counterargument on behalf of my constituents that many of these businesses do, in fact, operate from a fixed business premises.  They have fixed physical structures, including reception areas, shops, laundry facilities, kitchen facilities, toilets and shower blocks etc.  The business owners pay commercial rates, water rates and utility bills on those buildings.  Camping and caravan sites are registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and are approved accommodation providers under the Tourist Traffic Acts.  Revenue previously recognised caravan and camping sites as an accommodation provider under the stay and spend scheme.</p>  <p>  The reply to my parliamentary question also stated that one of the eligibility criteria for CRSS is that a business would be carrying on its trading activities during the period of restrictions but for the public health regulations requiring the business to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing its business premises.  Many camping and caravan sites remained open longer last year to try to recoup lost trade from earlier restrictions and reduced occupancy.  However, they were forced to close in October due to level 3 and level 5 restrictions.  As a result, their Hallowe'en mid-term business was lost.  Camping and caravan sites have been included by the Government along with hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, guest houses and similar accommodation providers during all the levels of restrictions and have not had the benefit of lighter restrictions and earlier opening dates that some outdoor activities, like golf, were allowed.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to take these points into consideration.  Camping and caravan business is very seasonal and it has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, like all other tourism accommodation provision.  Business owners are at their wit's end and do not know when they will receive an income again.  I ask that the CRSS criteria be amended to include caravan and camping parks because they are currently struggling to stay afloat.</p></speech>

I add my voice to that of my colleague, an Teachta Doherty, in support of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, which seeks the expansion of the CRSS.  Since budget day, when the CRSS was announced, Sinn F&eacute;in has highlighted the limitations within the scheme and has consistently argued that it should include all businesses that have seen their turnover fall by 75% or more.  Under the current scheme, only businesses with fixed premises and reduced footfall as a result of restrictions can qualify for the scheme.  Not a day goes by in which a business owner does not call or email my office asking about the scheme and why his or her business is excluded from it.  Most of them think it is a mistake by Revenue that they are excluded and they are shocked to find out that it is the Government that is locking them out of this much-needed financial support.  It is a testimony to the effectiveness of the scheme that there are so many people on the outside of it who want to get into it.</p><p>Last October, at the enterprise committee, I outlined the problems with the CRSS and called on the T&aacute;naiste to expand the scheme to cater for those businesses that are still excluded.  In November, Teachta Doherty highlighted the limitations of the CRSS directly to the Minister for Finance.  Following on from the debate at the enterprise committee, I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste restating my concerns with the scheme and outlining further the businesses and sectors excluded from the scheme that need to be brought into its remit.  On numerous occasions, Teachta Doherty and I have raised these matters on the floor of the D&aacute;il or through parliamentary questions.  We have pushed for the inclusion of companies such as suppliers, event management companies, businesses without fixed premises and many others that have fallen through the cracks within the scheme.  The fact that the scheme has not been expanded shows that it is Government policy to exclude certain suppliers, event management companies, businesses without fixed premises and many others from this scheme.  The CRSS is averaging a spend of less than &euro;15 million per week, compared with the expected cost of &euro;80 million.  This further reinforces that it is Government policy to exclude those businesses, which, in turn, puts them and, more importantly, the jobs they provide, at risk.  That is just not acceptable.</p><p>Despite our efforts, there has been little wider reform of the scheme to protect suffering businesses.  The Government's dithering on the matter is putting more and more businesses and more and more jobs at risk by the day.  I read with interest the T&aacute;naiste's comments, as reported in <i>The Business Post</i>at the weekend, about expanding the scheme.  I am glad that it is under consideration.  However, is this the speed we can expect from the Government in this regard?  We are four months behind everybody else.  If the T&aacute;naiste was as quick to protect businesses as he was to contradict the advice from NPHET, this matter could and should have been, resolved months ago.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Government need to stop talking about reforming the scheme and just go ahead and do it.  The need for reform is obvious.  It has been pointed out to them on more than one occasion.  In fact, the limitations have been pointed out consistently.  The Government expected that there would be a greater drawdown.  I ask the Minister to note that the fact there has not been is the result of an issue with the scheme.</p></speech>

However, we also support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment because too few businesses are qualifying for the scheme.  The current support scheme is limited to public-facing businesses, leaving many sectors badly impacted by the restrictions without the same safety net.  Businesses that are not public facing, such as suppliers or businesses without a shopfront premises, are not immune from the effects of the pandemic or the knock-on effect from public-facing businesses closing their doors.  We need to ensure that our supports are comprehensive in their scope.  We cannot turn a blind eye to certain sectors and simply hope that they will survive 2021.</p> <p>There needs to be a greater acknowledgement of how interconnected different forms of enterprises are.  Thinking of this nature seems to be absent in the qualifying conditions for the CRSS.  During Priority Questions on 17 December, I asked the T&aacute;naiste to introduce an enterprise and trade support scheme equivalent to other Covid-19 restrictions support schemes for businesses that are not subject to rates and that do not conduct trading activities from a fixed premises.  In his closing remarks, he accepted there will be companies that fall between schemes and that he would need to design a scheme to do something for them.  It also saw the article in the <i>Business Post</i>.  The companies were called &quot;orphan companies&quot;.  It is really disappointing that this is not being addressed today.  Essentially, there are people who will have to make decisions and do so very quickly.  As many companies as possible need to survive if we are to have a full and job-rich recovery.<br/><br/>Direct-marketing companies, tour operators, restaurants and pubs, in addition to ancillary businesses, are all critical to tourism.  We are aware that some sectors have been more affected than others, not because the companies in them have been badly run or because they are not good in their own right.  Some of them will not survive.  Companies require support.  It is short-sighted not to provide that support in a timely way.  It is really important that this anomaly, which is very big, be dealt with, be it through the CRSS or a new scheme.  I do not believe anybody minds what way it is dealt with; the really important point is that it be dealt with.<br/><br/>Consider the rules on taxes up to end of 2020.  In this regard, I refer to interest rates and where people had to postpone or warehouse their taxes.  There was a lower rate of interest and there were no penalties, or reduced penalties.  Obviously, it was to target sectors, but the arrangement does not seem to have continued into 2021.  It may well be intended.  The Minister might address this because such arrangements, the waiving of rates, the PUP and other payments have been incredibly important.  I acknowledge that a lot has been done but we cannot leave large groups behind, as is the case in the sector in question.<br/><br/>When responding, could the Minister indicate the timeframe that is being considered for the design of other schemes?  I am sure there is engagement between him and the T&aacute;naiste on addressing the needs of the group in question, which is not covered by the scheme.  Just as it is important to state it is being considered, it is important that people be given the timeframe in which it is being considered so there will be some certainty and so people can make decisions.  Some will have to make the decision not to continue.  I hope the number will be limited but people need to know the timeframe.</p></speech>

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Government has rightly done everything possible to support businesses, jobs and workers.  The CRSS allows business affected by Covid to claim support from the Revenue Commissioners of up to &euro;5,000 per week.  I understand that almost 20,000 businesses have availed of the scheme to date.  Could the Minister provide details for D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown?  He might forward them in time.</p>  <p>  The recent surge in Covid cases and the extension of level 5 restrictions will be of concern to many businesses.  They are worried about the future.  They are not worried about today or tomorrow but about the medium-term outlook for themselves and their employees.  A vaccine is being rolled out and the programme relating to it has been well debated in this House.  We will eventually return to a degree of normality.  It would be helpful if the Government used the next six weeks to review the economic circumstances and prepare a national restart plan.  A high-level advisory board should be considered to conduct a regional and sectoral review of the economy to pinpoint where the supports are required.  Consultation with stakeholders is essential.  A two-tier economic recovery must be avoided.  From talking to businesses in my constituency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, I am aware that some are doing well.  They are mainly international exporters but many businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector and SMEs are struggling despite the unprecedented Government supports.  We are aware that Irish SMEs provide the bulk of jobs in our economy.  They are worried about the future and need to be reassured that supports will continue beyond 31 March until the pandemic ends and that there will be a plan to restart our economy.  These businesses will need a considerable cash-flow injection to restart.  For some the future is very bleak, unfortunately, and some, even with the supports, may not survive.  These entrepreneurs need support to restructure their businesses or, in some cases, to wind up.  Examinership and liquidation should be reviewed to allow fast-track, low-cost wind-ups and restructuring to allow entrepreneurs a fresh start.  Local enterprise offices have made considerable efforts to advise businesses but businesspeople tell me that the system needs to be simplified, be it through a one-stop shop, a telephone line or a central website of some sort.</p>  <p>  More needs to be done for the orphan companies that fall between the existing schemes.  I refer to those affected in the tourism, transport, car rental and entertainment sectors.  The Minister will be aware that I previously raised the issue of Tom Duffy's Circus, an Irish institution in itself, and the generations involved in the arts, culture and heritage.  Such businesses are being left behind and need support.  I ask the Minister to redouble his efforts to support these companies and others.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the crisis has utterly transformed much of everyday life in Ireland.  I am conscious and deeply appreciative that a range of supports have been put in place to support businesses throughout the lockdown and that, in the main, they are proving very effective.  The reality, however, is that many businesses simply will not reopen and simply will not be able to function in a post-Covid era because, to smash a famous line of poetry, all has changed, utterly changed.</p>  <p>  I will focus briefly on a sector I hold very dear, the regional press, because it is where I pursued my career of choice for most of my life.  Sadly, Covid has fast-tracked the demise of the sector by a generation.  Young people now, my own children included, will simply will never purchase a local newspaper.  The old income model involving 80% advertisement and 20% newspaper sales is broken, and some of the titles that were founded in reaction to an imperialist presence in our country more than 100 years ago now face a perilous and uncertain future.  At the heart of these newspapers are the staff.  Many are friends of mine and many are sons and daughters of parents who devoted their lives to the industry.  There is ink in their veins, yet these are the same people who enthusiastically embraced the online revolution and have done everything asked of them by their employers to safeguard a vital community resource.  I appreciate it is not the Minister's remit.  The Future of Media Commission has been formed but, sadly, its formation gave little recognition to the regional press.  An urgent suite of supports is needed for the sector because we must rally behind the staff, many of whom have been laid off temporarily in recent days and now rightly wonder whether there is a future at all for a business and profession to which they are wholeheartedly dedicated.</p>  <p>  Our local newspapers are just a snapshot of a wider issue, namely the sweeping changes that have ripped through rural Ireland as a result of Covid-19.  The unrelenting conversion to online shopping and the suspension, through restrictions, of click-and-collect services have been the death knell for so many of our small traders and retailers.  These are the very lifeblood of our small towns and villages.</p> <p>We have a suite of Covid supports but the focus now needs to be on the supports that will be critical to getting businesses back open and that will help them through what will be a period of great uncertainty.  We have learned many lessons over the past year and many of them have been hard lessons.  We have learned what was needed to sustain these businesses through a prolonged period of closure.  Now we need to know that the focus will start to switch to reviving, sustaining and revitalising them, whether it is the local newspaper, the village shop or the bar on the corner.</p> <p> We passed a sad milestone yesterday, with 3,000 deaths as a result of Covid.  As Government and as legislators, we now need to work on the support packages to ensure we will not be tracking the number of businesses who fail to reopen or cannot reopen later this year.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios againn ar fad, agus athbhreithni&uacute; ar an sc&eacute;im &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn inniu, go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach breathn&uacute; ar an m&eacute;id a d'oibrigh an sc&eacute;im ach caithfimid breathn&uacute; chomh maith ar an m&eacute;id n&aacute;r oibrigh s&eacute;.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; roinnt gn&oacute;lachta&iacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair nach bhfuil i dteideal na sc&eacute;ime seo agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;ordheacair ar na gn&oacute;lachta&iacute; sin.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbreathn&oacute;idh an tAire air seo agus go nd&eacute;anfar rud &eacute;igin faoi mar n&iacute;l s&eacute; s&aacute;ch maith go bhfuil roinnt gn&oacute;lachta&iacute; amuigh ansin nach bhfuil i dteideal na sc&eacute;ime seo.</p>  <p>  I support the amendment by my colleague, Deputy Doherty, in respect of expanding this scheme to include those businesses which have not been included in it.  I also want to raise my concerns about the scheme.  The scheme obviously aims to support businesses during the higher levels of lockdown.  For those businesses in receipt of it, the CRSS is undoubtedly an essential source of revenue which is keeping them afloat during these difficult times.  However, many businesses are unable to receive payment under the scheme and, as a result, their future viability is on the line.  We raised this anomaly with the Minister previously during the course of the Finance Bill and I wrote to him on 5 January to highlight this but, unfortunately, nothing has changed.</p>  <p>  I was relieved to read over the weekend that the T&aacute;naiste and the Government are deliberating over whether to expand the CRSS.  It is high time to stop deliberating and act on this because these businesses are really under pressure.  We saw that when the scheme was launched in October, it was expected to cost &euro;80 million per week.  However, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, has highlighted that it costs, on average, less than &euro;15 million per week.  In other words, the scheme has cost approximately 18% of what was first estimated.  Surely, therefore, that means there should be a re-examination of those businesses that have been excluded to this point and which are struggling to keep afloat.  These are the businesses which do not have premises.  The guidelines on the operation of the Covid restrictions support scheme clearly state that "a business premises is [the] building, or similar fixed physical structure, in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on."  Therefore, boats, for example, are excluded on the basis that they are mobile.  However, boats that work as tourist attractions may appear mobile but, in reality, they are based in a specific place where they provide that attraction and do not move from there.</p>  <p>  One company based in north Connemara raised this issue with me.  I was informed that business was down by 80%.  The company is based in a rural area and employs ten people.  The latter makes it a key employer for the area.  The company is frustrated because while tourist attractions often encourage tourists to visit and stay in specific areas, it feels it has been completely forgotten and is not getting sufficient support to enable it to survive.  As the Minister can imagine, there is major concern regarding businesses of this nature and of the rural areas in which they are based, which simply need the jobs they create.  This anomaly needs to be addressed and I ask him to fix it as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700036#JJ00300"><p>When the legislation relating to the CRSS was passed by the Houses, I argued as forcefully as I could that it was unfair on people who did not have a premises, whose premises might be, for example, their taxi or van or whose livelihoods involved overheads in terms of loans or rents on premises that are not public-facing, such as musicians, people who work in the arts and many others who operate small businesses.  Those businesses and their employees have been devastated, most of them, particularly regarding taxi drivers, musicians and many others, far more than the 25% threshold which allows businesses with a public-facing premises to get the CRSS.  One only has to go out onto the streets to see the situation for taxi drivers at the moment.  Their ability to earn an income is down 70% or 80%.  They have car repayments, insurance costs and other ongoing overheads, yet they are excluded.  There is no justice to this.  It is completely unfair.  They need help.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of taxi drivers have also been excluded from the &euro;1,000 restart grant because people have to sign off the PUP in order get that grant.  A person cannot sign off the PUP at the moment with any hope of earning even a fraction of what he or she would normally earn for the obvious reason that people are not on the street because of Covid restrictions, and rightly so.  Why are taxi drivers being excluded?  They still have to carry the costs to which I refer.  The position is similar for people in music and the arts, and it is completely unfair.  It is precisely some of those who have been worst hit who are not included.  In the case of musicians and artists, they have been shut down completely since the beginning of the pandemic, yet many of them are excluded from these schemes.  It is not fair.</p>  <p>  I support Deputy Doherty's amendment.  These points were put to the Minister forcefully when the legislation was pushed through and I do not know why he is ignoring them.  Also in the context of taxi drivers, the electric vehicle grant is very limited in terms of who it is available to.  A car has to reach its ten-year expiry date in order for the owner to access this grant, which means that the vast majority of taxi drivers will also be excluded from that grant.  At every level, taxi drivers are being denied supports because their cars are their premises and their means of business, even though they have been more adversely affected than many of those who are availing of scheme and who are rightly getting paid.  I do not see why the Minister would not extend it to taxi drivers or to musicians, people in event-related areas, the arts and so on.  I appeal to him to do so.</p>  <p>  Some of the support given out to bigger businesses and the willingness of the Government to give this support contrasts sharply with the way it treats PAYE workers, who will now receive tax bills even though the wage subsidy scheme limited the amount by which employers could top up workers' pay to the net amount.  The limit the Minister imposed in respect of the wage subsidy scheme means that people have taken a pay cut and that they are going to be taxed subsequently on it.  That is completely unfair.</p>  <p>  Finally, I will say a word on the wealth that dare not speak its name.  Oxfam published a report earlier this week which shows that Ireland's billionaires have increased their wealth by &euro;3.3 billion during the pandemic.  Rather than exclude people who really need support from schemes, could we not impose a little bit of tax on the billionaires who have done well out of Covid in order to assist some of the workers and sectors which have been absolutely hammered by the public health restrictions?</p></speech>

In my constituency, 820 businesses have benefited thus far, to the tune of &euro;7.9 million, while nationally, notwithstanding the points made during the debate, more than 19,500 businesses are receiving supports worth &euro;221 million.  I come from a Border county, which is suffering greatly as a result of Covid and of the issue I wish to raise, namely, that the scheme does not extend to all businesses in the area.</p>  <p>  Carlingford Lough Ferry operates out of Carlingford and crosses the bay every day.  The ferry commenced operation in 2017 with a &euro;10 million private investment, &euro;2.5 million of which was invested in fixtures at Greenore, which included the construction of a reinforced slipway, fenders, car parking facilities and an office.  It is impossible for the business to operate without utilising its fixed premises at Greenore.  Since 2017, the business has carried more than 147,000 vehicles and more than 497,000 people across Carlingford Lough.  It is at an early stage of growth and has a bright future but it needs urgent help.</p>  <p>  As a cross-Border service, it is finding it increasingly difficult to access supports.  It is deemed ineligible for the Brexit loan scheme even though the company has been significantly impacted by Brexit, and obviously, Covid has devastated tourism in the Carlingford area.  The company is fighting hard and taking all the actions it can to survive the impact of both Covid and Brexit.  I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider the issue.  The company believes that one of the problems relates to the additional &euro;55 million the Government has allocated for tourism to deal with this issue, which will be administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Its understanding - I hope it is not a fact - is that the same criteria will apply to companies such as the Carlingford Lough Ferry and that, therefore, it will not be successful in its application for funding.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister is listening to this debate and I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's comments about change but it is essential that this business be supported.  It is genuine and it has spent the money.  It employs people, and while it is now obviously a significantly reduced business, it is the type of business we will need in the Border area once Covid is gone and restrictions are lifted, and to fight the impact of Brexit.  Companies like Carlingford Lough Ferry need to get the CRSS.  It is entitled to it and it has made the investment.  It is not a hide-and-seek company; it is there and it is a considerable boon to the local economy.</p>  <p>  On tourism, I have been approached by a tourism counsellor, that is, somebody who operates a tourism business but whose role is not customer facing.  Notwithstanding that such persons may get the pandemic unemployment payment, their businesses cannot survive without additional supports.  I urge the Minister to examine that issue also.</p></speech>

The demand for the scheme shows the importance of the role of the Government during this time.  As we head into an extended timeline of level 5 restrictions, it is critical that the Government continue to play a leading role in providing supports for businesses.</p>  <p>  While such a scheme is very costly, businesses need to have the certainty that they will continue to be supported, however long this pandemic may last.  The employment wage subsidy scheme is critical to ensuring that employer-employee relationships are maintained and that when businesses can reopen, they can do so quickly.  The CRSS will help businesses to get through level 5 and ensure that employees have jobs to go back to, that businesses are maintained and that livelihoods can thrive once again.</p>  <p>  Small businesses are the lifeblood of towns and villages.  If these businesses were to shut down permanently, it would have a very adverse impact on our towns and rural settings and the very fabric of rural society throughout the country.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the case of premises whose trade has been impacted by a reduction in customer demand because of Covid-19, such as travel agencies.  While the indirect nature of the reduction in business activity is recognised, the level of restrictions on movements, and now the restrictions on international travel, make a strong case for this area to be re-examined. </p>  <p>  Many people will have woken up this morning after having been faced with the news of continued lockdown until 5 March.  It is not the position in which, prior to Christmas, many of us thought we would be.  While these times may be very difficult, this is not a time to lose hope.  We can and should get through this.  Although some of these schemes may seem like figures on a page, the businesses they will help to support are not.  I urge the Minister to continue to support businesses, which are the backbone of this economy.  Many family-run businesses, unfortunately, will not survive this pandemic and that is a sad reality the Minister's Department will have to deal with when deciding how to allocate financial supports.  Above all else, however, we must be highly cognisant that if we allow too many businesses in rural communities, such as those in the constituency of Cork East where I am from, and on our main streets to die because of this pandemic, it will do irreversible damage to our economy and society, and to the well-being of people in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that point.  I have been working with many local businesses and it has been an enormous privilege to work alongside members of our local business community since I became a public representative.  Particularly during the pandemic, it is easy to see they are continuing to go through much difficulty, not least those companies that were undergoing financial restructuring, unfortunately, just prior to the emergence of the pandemic.  They have found it quite difficult to access supports such as the CRSS.  I ask that a continued and renewed focus from the Department be put into that.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister well.  The State has responded with urgency to some of the matters we have faced.  For example, we responded with the largest budget in the country's history.  The Opposition cannot be entirely critical, therefore, of the actions of the Government and of the Minister.  I ask him to continue to engage with local and small businesses and to bear in mind that we cannot afford to shut down main streets across the country.   It will be extremely difficult for those businesses ever to come back and they will face significant financial uncertainty and difficulty.  It is important that we support them in every way we can.</p></speech>

It is a vital amendment and it addresses the people who have not been able to avail of this scheme.  The continuation and adjustment of the Covid support scheme is vital work that we must complete and I echo the comments of my colleagues regarding the necessity of sustaining and amending it.</p>  <p>  Businesses have operated, or not operated unfortunately, for close to a year in the Covid-19 environment.  Regrettably, I have no doubt that many smaller businesses will be unable to sustain these prolonged periods of closure with near-zero income.  While others may have the economies of scale required to survive the pandemic, many SMEs and sole traders will not.  The support scheme is the safety net that has allowed many thousands of businesses to limp over the past ten months.   Thousands of businesses have registered for the scheme since November.  While many saw a return to trading, albeit brief, in the pre-Christmas period, this will not be enough to keep them afloat.  Payments data show that while the Christmas season led to spending reaching its highest point for the year, there has been a rapid reversal since restrictions were reintroduced and it is now close to levels seen in the spring of last year.</p>  <p>  The unfortunate but not unexpected news last night regarding the extension of current restrictions to 5 March will be met with despair by many business owners.  This continuation is necessary, given the high numbers presenting at our hospitals, and as such we must continue all efforts to get the virus under control.  Business owners and their employees appreciate this, but nonetheless last night's announcement was a punch in the gut to many of those who are struggling to keep their businesses afloat.  We know of the schemes, loans and supports that are available and I urge businesses to access them as appropriate.</p>  <p>  A walk to my office in Limerick lays bare the impact of the pandemic on local trade and commerce.  In Limerick, every morning is like a Sunday morning; businesses are shut and foot traffic is down to a trickle.  It is a depressing sight and it leads me to wonder how the city centre can recover without additional support for the affected businesses.  An overall review of the CRSS is needed to ensure that all those who need it can avail of it and that those who need it most will not continue to slip between the cracks.</p> <p>While adjustments and alterations to the scheme are necessary and appropriate, what we really need is an overarching plan of recovery, an entire Government consultation with the Opposition to operate in unison and fewer roll-outs and subsequent rollbacks by Departments.</p> <p> Unfortunately, like so many others, business communities have suffered due to the hesitation and doubt that has epitomised this Government's response to the pandemic to date.  We have had mixed messages regarding pubs opening, wet pubs versus dry pubs, the lack of support offered to our tourism sector and travel agents, the disastrous failure in implementing restrictions on foreign travel into the State during the pandemic and the delay in responding to the crisis in our nursing homes.  People have made huge sacrifices.  They are exhausted and need to see a fresh line, even if that is just the slightest glimmer of light in the distance.  All of the errors to which I refer contributed to the frustrations and concerns of the public.  All these missteps have led to the economy being closed again.</p> <p> We are discussing amendments and adjustments to the CRSS.  I fear that while the Government was procrastinating, the horse bolted.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is important.  I urge all parties to support it.  What we really need is an idea of what the eventual reopening of our economy will look like.  I look forward to hearing the Government's plan on this issue.  As already stated, Sinn F&eacute;in will be pressing this amendment and calling a vote at the end of the session.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1576" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700038#LL00300"><p>The CRSS, which was announced by the Government in November, is designed as a targeted support for businesses that lost most of their trade as a result of the level 5 restrictions in order to ensure that they could remain viable and ready to reopen their doors when the restrictions are lifted.  At the time, the Government estimated that the scheme would cost in the region of &euro;18 million per week.  Records that have been released show the scheme is costing considerably less than originally envisaged.  One of the main reasons for this is the overly-restrictive conditions relating to qualification.</p>  <p>  I ask that the scheme be reviewed with a view to supporting a much broader range of businesses that are directly affected by the level 5 restrictions and that have had their turnover collapse in the past year.  Since last March, I have highlighted the decimation of the tourism and hospitality sectors.  We also need to look, however, at those businesses supporting this sector, particularly the suppliers that were directly affected by the prolonged closures of their largest, and in some cases only, customers.</p>  <p>  Since the scheme was announced, I have been contacted by many different types of businesses that are excluded from it.  Mr. Gary Craven, for instance, is an independent trader based in Galway who has been supplying fish to hotels and restaurants exclusively for the past 30 years.  His business has completely collapsed since last March.  He does not qualify for CRSS simply because he delivers to his customers.  He is still in the fixed business class this scheme was intended to cover but unlike the customers he supplies, he receives no Government support.</p>  <p>  A large number of licensed trade distributors are based throughout the country.  Their main trade is pubs, restaurants and hotels - the so-called on-trade business.  These companies cannot compete in the off-licence trade due to the role of multiples and the delay in implementing the minimum unit pricing of alcohol element of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  Up to 90% of the customers of licensed trade distributors are not trading at the moment, which means they have lost to 80% or 90% of their turnover.  Their licence does not allow them to sell to the public so despite not being told close their business, they are struggling to survive and their future is uncertain.  In addition to not qualifying for the CRSS they do not qualify for any restart grants.</p>  <p>  The condition under the scheme whereby restrictions must prohibit or reduce access by customers to a business premises is overly restrictive.  It precludes a significant proportion of businesses that are suffering a massive loss of income and are now struggling to survive.  At the time the CRSS was announced, the Minister said that specific sectoral schemes were to be rolled out to support many businesses that might not qualify for it.  Unfortunately, many sectors are still not in receipt of any essential supports.  We cannot support some sectors and leave others struggling to survive and facing closure.</p>  <p>  In light of the lower than expected take-up of the CRSS and the difficulties being faced by many companies as a result of the level 5 restrictions, I recently sent the Minister a letter from J &amp;amp; C Kenny distributors, which was signed by Mr. Jackie Kenny and 15 other distributors from across the country who are affected by being excluded from the scheme.  I ask that the terms of the scheme be expanded to include businesses such as J &amp;amp; C Kenny and the other distributors which signed the letter to which I refer and also Gary Craven and the many other small business owners who have been affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700038#LL00400"><p>The CRSS was designed to bring some certainty to businesses in these uncertain times.  For those businesses that have applied and qualified for the CRSS, it has obviously proved a valuable lifeline.  It must be stated, however, that tying eligibility to apply to the scheme to the operation of a business premises has excluded many SMEs and service sector businesses.  Many have great difficulty in accessing other forms of Government support outside of wage supports, which are obviously not fully applicable if a business is closed.  Significant service businesses have been developed through great entrepreneurship and reflect the dynamic innovation we will be looking for post Covid.  I can think of catering companies, event managers, sound engineers and many other privately and self-employed for whom the CRSS payment is a closed avenue in the context of grant support.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to consider the many private small and medium business owners who have leasing and finance arrangements in place and those with rent and capital loan repayments for which they are receiving no support.  For these people, the decision is to either delve into hard-earned savings or take on additional debt.  This is the only way they are technically surviving in hope of a restoration of business demand.</p>  <p>  I mentioned certainty.  That is one thing Government can probably not fully guarantee.  It must signal, however, some extension of existing moneys and additional supports to cover the various business sectors I mentioned and many more of these businesses left without support.  There is a real challenge now for many owners in deciding whether to try to struggle on or call it a day.  Without adequate support measures being put in place, many of these business owners and their furloughed staff will end up on the live register and become a hard and extended liability on the public purse.  It is a well-known fact that it is easier to support an existing job than to spend money trying to create a new one.  I urge the Minister, the Government and the Revenue Commissioners to consider further their initiatives to support private sector workers.</p>  <p>  At some point, we hope to exit this Covid nightmare and we will need the resilient businesses we have supported to be ready again create economic growth and wealth.  The Government and the Revenue Commissioners need to listen to a far greater degree to the pleas of business owners and sole traders who have carried more than their fair share of tax burdens over many years.  The implications of ignoring them will be a further social and economic cost this State does not have to create.</p></speech>

The health of our citizens is obviously the paramount thing we must protect but financial well-being also has an impact on the mental health of individuals and is a huge cause for concern.</p>  <p>   In the past couple of weeks, I received numerous calls from constituents who are unhappy with the way the banks have treated them since this latest lockdown came into play.  Many people are struggling to repay loans, mortgages and lease agreements.  They need a break and should not have their credit ratings impacted as a result of this.  People were under huge financial pressure last summer.  We have an awful lot of people out there whose businesses have been closed for almost 12 months.  It will be 12 months come the third week of March.  Whatever reserves they had last year have been exhausted.  Whatever pressure we put on the banks last year needs to be increased.  They must adopt an even more compassionate and understanding approach.  A proper moratorium must be put in place for individuals and businesses which will not cost that individual money.  Banks should be offering breaks from repayments at the moment and extensions at the end when business returns to normal.  There should also be extensions to people's loans or leases, with no extra charges or payment increases.</p> <p>When businesses resumed trading at the back end of the year, banks came back looking for increased repayments from them and individuals.  That cannot be allowed to happen and banks have to put a proper moratorium in place.  This is the most essential work we need to do in the coming weeks.  People are under significant mental pressure and strain because of their financial situation.  Banks and leasing companies have to meet people and show them that they will share some of the financial hardship that Covid-19 is imposing on the.</p> <p> A number of building sites are closed.  Individual builders and building companies have started work on sites and have spent money on leasing machinery and so on for the sites.  They have to stop work and in a lot of cases they have to transport that machinery back to their home bases, which involves a significant increase in costs.  Again, the banks need to understand how these businesses are operating and give them a break without any affect on their credit ratings.</p> <p> I also want to talk about tourism operators.  Tourism coach operators have been among those worst-effected as a result of Covid-19.  Some &euro;10 million was allocated in the middle of last summer to be distributed through the bus tourism operators.  None of those bus operators have got any of that money yet.  I tabled parliamentary questions on this in recent weeks and it is disgraceful that this money has not been distributed to these hard-hit businesses.</p> <p> Another group I want to talk about is track bookmakers who are not eligible for the CRSS.  They have been told that because they do not have a permanent place of work, they do not qualify for the scheme.  This is a small group of individuals who bought pitches at various racetracks around the country.  It is their place of work and business and they have not been able to access that place of business since the third week of March.  I brought this issue up previously and I urge the Minister to re-examine this and allow track bookmakers access to this scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700039#MM00200"><p>I acknowledge the fact that the CRSS and other Government supports have been a saviour for many businesses the length and breadth of the country.  I am here to speak on behalf of the outdoor activity and adventure tourism businesses that have been left out of the CRSS.  They have not only they been left out of the scheme but because they do not have a fixed premises they have also been left out of the restart grant scheme.  We need to review that because these businesses were the wonder of summer 2020.  People from across Ireland flocked to the coast and other parts of Ireland and they enjoyed kayaking, boat trips and whale watching.  These were the scenes that filled our social media feeds and TV screens.  They were beamed internationally and enjoyed by audiences across the globe.  These businesses are the future of Irish tourism and we need to ensure that they are there in the future.</p>  <p>  Sea kayaking and night kayaking in west Cork is one of the most phenomenal activities someone can take up.  Boat trips in Kinsale Harbour or out to Bull Rock on the Beara Peninsula were the scenes of our summer in 2020 and one of the few positives that people had to enjoy.  We should have no doubt that Ireland can place itself as the future of adventure tourism across the globe.  We have the activities, scenery and coastline but we need businesses to be there post pandemic and the only way we can ensure that happens is by supporting them now because they are closed and they cannot open, facilitate people or bring them out onto the water.  I urge the Minister to review the legislation and bring these businesses within the scope of the CRSS.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to speak up on behalf of businesses such as those involved in entertainment that do not have a fixed premises and professionals and business owners who may not necessarily operate from a premises but still have insurance costs, public liability costs and tax liabilities to pay.  We need to step in there as well and support these businesses.</p>  <p>  I am sure that at this stage every Deputy has been contacted by employers that say their staff think they have undercut them somehow by putting them on the EWSS.  This is down to the lack of clarity and information being provided.  Some employees have been issued their tax liability for 2020 and they are not happy with how this has been handled.  It is something I wrote to the Minister about back in October to bring it to his attention that there was confusion and a bit of conflict between employers and employees around this.  I acknowledge that employees can pay this back through tax credits over a period of four years but it has come as a surprise to many to see that they owe money to Revenue.  Can the Minister clear this up and communicate with employers and employees on what is happening in this regard?</p></speech>

Mineral water distributors are not closed down but more than 90% of their customers are not buying from them.  In fact the distributors have to take back bottles at their own cost and dump the stuff.</p>  <p>  Taxi drivers in Killarney feel they have been let down.  Some of them can get the PUP and more of them who tried to operate cannot do so because they have no customers.  I went into College Street the other night and there was one taxi there.  I know that some of these taxi drivers will have to give back their taxis in the near future because they just cannot make the payments.  I am sad to see that those grand men and women who gave such sterling service in Killarney and outside of it will lose their way of life and will have to surrender.</p>  <p>  Coach operators were an important part of the tourism sector in Kerry.  It is sad to see yards full of buses, with up to 90 buses in some yards in Killarney, that have not moved in the past 12 months or more.  It is tough on these people, who gave such sterling service with their drivers and the type of buses they provided, that they have been left behind as well.</p>  <p>  I mention those who provide fish and vegetables to hotels.  Even though they are not shut down, 90% of their business is gone and they have been left behind in this scheme as well.</p></speech>

I welcome many of the support schemes that are in place and I appreciate the efforts of the Government and different Departments.</p>  <p>However, I must highlight also the inadequacies in the schemes, for instance, the number of people who contact me in my office on a daily basis with regard to the CRSS.  These people were impacted because they did not have premises and they were debarred from availing of assistance.  This has created an awful problem for many businesses that should be entitled to assistance but find themselves falling between two stools when it comes to applying for assistance and funding.  People in the music industry have seen their sector decimated.  In many cases, those people are struggling.  I have encountered situations where a person was working part time at music and part time at another job, and that other work is also gone.  Such persons are doubly impacted.  Of course, like everyone in the country, they are hurting.  Indeed, as we were talking about taxis, I had a Zoom meeting the other evening with a number of taxi people from Killarney town and other parts of the county where we discussed their issues, problems and difficulties.  I am very fearful for the future of the excellent taxi service people that we have, and both they and, in tourism, the coach operators and small tour operators whom I have dealt a lot with over the past number of weeks and months, are fearful for their futures, when, please God, things get back to normal, that they will be able to go back into business.</p> <p> There is great thanks going to the efforts being made but I do not want to see situations where people are falling behind.  That is why, with the new announcement by the Taoiseach yesterday evening, it is important that the Government redoubles its efforts and deals with the Department of Social Protection and all the other Departments in ensuring that we pick up and help the people and the different sectors and groups that are being left behind.</p></speech>

We are ten months into this pandemic.  If a scheme that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, estimated would cost &euro;80 million per week is costing &euro;15 million per week it is not reasonable to say, as the T&aacute;naiste did, that the Government is looking at new supports.  These businesses need supports now.</p><p>An example of the many companies that have contacted me is Drino Drinks Ltd, a Leitrim drinks wholesaler and family business for more than 60 years.  Fourteen members of staff cannot access this fund.  They have a premises but they are wholesalers.  Their customers are closed since March last.  The majority of their work is delivery.  They cannot access the EWSS or CRSS.  Another company, a wedding band company, cannot access these supports yet it has ongoing costs, such as vehicle insurance.  They will have to sell their musical instruments to keep going.  The Minister has done good work but there is a gaping hole in the supports available to these businesses and he can help to fill it.</p></speech>

However, as always, I believe he is doing the bare minimum.  He is continuing to choose to ignore the knock-on effect of the restrictions on others, because it would cost him money.</p>  <p>  The RT&Eacute; Home School Hub could explain supply chain management to the Minister.  Does he remember business organisation classes in school?  Products and services do not just appear.  They have to be manufactured, distributed and supplied and yet his blinkered attitude is to ignore those that do not strictly meet the narrow criteria.  For example, Deputy Connolly asked me to mention the boats doing tours of Killary Harbour that are excluded from the scheme because they do not operate from a fixed premises.</p>  <p>  Like other Members, a number of small family-run wholesale distributors have been in touch with me recently because they are shocked to be excluded from the CRSS.  They were told, "that the CRSS was never meant to be a general support measure for the entire economy as the country could not afford to do this ... but the purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations."</p>  <p>  For example, MCM employs 18 people.  They are not eligible, despite 90% of their customers being unable to trade.  Joe Kelly &amp;amp; Sons Limited, based in the Finn Valley in Donegal, is a family-run business in a similar situation.  These are not the big boys; they are not supplying the multiples to any scale.  While their market remains closed, they are effectively closed too.  The Minister will put them to the wall without providing support at this time of crisis.</p>  <p>  This affects other sectors as well.  Business is not as small and contained as the Minister's reply to MCM makes out.  As Minister for Finance, perhaps it is time to get out those books to which I referred, look at this and protect those businesses.</p></speech>

The Government's response will be with us for a long time and will hamper livelihoods and lives in this country for a generation because a shrinking economy, which has been intentionally shrunk by the Government, affects our health service and it affects longevity and life expectancy in every state.</p>  <p>  Like many, notwithstanding the Government closing premises and businesses, and that the latest tilting of the hat towards the zero-Covid approach will continue into the summer and affect businesses, in particular, tourism businesses across Clare, which had a disastrous year last year and will not remain open unless the Government is in a position to say that this scheme and supports will remain in place for tourism businesses throughout this year, I question whether it is in accordance with EU law to open our tourism sector domestically and not allow Irish people to go elsewhere or foreigners to come into the country.  It will be very tricky.  Even if the Government does that, there will be a huge deficit in many tourism businesses.  They need certainty and they need it now as they are facing into preparations for the season.  I hope the Government will be in a position to confirm that it will leave supports in place right across the tourism season as it will close it, and move away from the necessity for physical premises so that people who provide adventure tourism, for example, in water with horses, are able to keep their animals alive because that is where we are at at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700040#NN00500"><p>I heard all the Deputies speak with great concern about businesses that have been affected by the public health restrictions that are due to and necessary because of this terrible disease, the strain and anxiety that those who are running these businesses are experiencing at present and, of course, the huge effects that the loss of a job is having on those whom they represent.  I have been in the same meetings.  I have met the same businesses.  I have met so many people over the past year who have been affected in exactly the way described by all the Deputies who spoke but that is the very reason that this Government and the previous Government acted with speed and at scale to create certainty to support our economy at a time it is under such massive strain.  To hear Opposition Members speak about a meagre response and about schemes being successful because they are designed to exclude businesses shows that they either do not appreciate the scale of what this Government is doing or they do not care in their hurry to make political points at a time when worry is so high and employers and those who work with them are so concerned about their future.</p>  <p>  One figure that the House has not heard mentioned in this debate so far is the cost of all of this to the taxpayer.</p> <p>One heard Sinn F&eacute;in allege the money is there to be spent.  Over the past year and this year, we will see our national debt and the amount of money our country is borrowing increase by &euro;35 billion.  A share of that &euro;35 billion will go into our public health measures.  However, it will also go to support the very businesses and people raised by Government and Opposition Deputies this afternoon.  If one looks at that scale of support, the business and income supports alone across last year totalled &euro;12.57 billion.  That has been put into supporting income and employers at exactly the time that support is needed.  It has made a significant difference.</p> <p> Money that has been made available, due to having a well-run economy as well as the support of the European Union and the European Central Bank, has supported businesses at a time of massive strain.  I listened carefully to the points made by Opposition Deputies on the cost of the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme.  It is true that during the early weeks of the operation of the scheme, its weekly cost was lower than had been anticipated in the budget arithmetic.  However, I did not hear any reference to the fact that we now also must pay for having so many hundreds of thousands of people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  We have additional funding, which we are making available, for the cost of the employment wage subsidy scheme, a hugely important intervention to support hundreds of thousands of workers exactly when they need it.</p> <p> Additional money is being borrowed by the Government, as was announced on budget day, along with that coming through from our taxes, to support other schemes that are needed more now that will support income and employers exactly at the time they need this support.  When we look at the figures for the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme, which has cost over &euro;200 million and was money that has been well used to support employers, we must also acknowledge that we need to use &euro;1 billion extra to pay for the pandemic unemployment payment and employment wage subsidy scheme for this year alone.  We are able to do that because of where we were at before Covid hit.  We want to do it because of the need to support those who need help at a time of dealing with Covid.</p> <p> My colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, with whom I will work, have put in place funds to supports tourism, such as the coach tourism business continuity scheme.  I appreciate there are businesses outside the remit of the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme but there are also businesses availing of other available supports from the Government.  For those businesses not in a position to do that, I will work with my colleagues in government to respond to that.</p> <p> We will do all that in the context of &euro;12 billion being spent to support our economy at a time when our public health system is under such strain.  These are extremely large schemes which are working and are making a difference to income, to employers and to jobs at a time when our country continues to confront the significant challenge of Covid-19.</p></speech>

The Act also provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is appointed by the President following their nomination by the Government and the passage of resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas recommending their appointment.</p><p>In this regard, at its meeting on 6 January 2021, the Government nominated Ms Emily Logan and Mr. Hugh Hume.  I am pleased to recommend formally to the House that Members approve Ms Logan and Mr. Hume for appointment by the President to be members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>The need for these appointments arises from the expiry of the terms of office in December 2020 of two members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, namely, Dr. Kieran FitzGerald and Mr. Patrick Sullivan.  I would like to take this opportunity to express the Government's sincere appreciation of the contributions that both Dr. FitzGerald and Mr. Sullivan have made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's important and complex work.  I wish them both well in the future.  I would also like to pay tribute to Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, the chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, who continues to provide leadership and vision in that capacity.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has and will continue to play a critical role in the overall architecture of policing in the State.  Its independence is the guarantee to the public that complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be investigated without fear or favour.  Its three key operational principles of inquiry, independence and impartiality are the hallmarks of a policing oversight organisation of which we can be justifiably proud and which are vital in an advanced democracy such as we are fortunate to inhabit.</p><p>At the Government's request, the Public Appointments Service conducted an independent and international competition to identify candidates suitable for appointment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Almost 100 applications were received by the closing date.  Following a rigorous selection process, Ms Logan and Mr. Hume were each recommended by the Public Appointments Service for appointment.</p><p>Ms Emily Logan has been a leader in a number of important public sector fields.  She was chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission for five years until 2019 and clearly demonstrated her ability to be both impartial and inclusive.  Prior to that, Ms Logan served as Ireland's first Ombudsman for Children from 2003 to 2014.  She now serves as adjunct professor of human rights practice at the Irish Centre for Human Rights in NUI Galway.  Her ability to address difficult issues consistently and fairly, her experience in making complex issues easily understood by the public, as well as her deep-seated credibility, will be of benefit to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>Mr. Hugh Hume has been a member of the Garda Inspectorate since 2017.  Prior to that, he was a serving police officer in Northern Ireland, retiring from the PSNI at the level of detective chief superintendent and as head of the PSNI's intelligence and analysis service.  Mr. Hume's extensive experience in law enforcement and investigation will be of practical use to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, as well as his well-developed strategic, analytical and risk awareness skills.  He is adept at relationship building, which is an important facet of bringing about positive change.</p><p>Both Ms Logan and Mr. Hume are committed to serving the public to a high standard.  As with all new appointments, Ms Logan and Mr. Hume will bring fresh energy and a new perspective to the organisation, all of which is desirable in an area of activity as complex and challenging as that of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The House will agree that it is vital that the public has deep confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its system of oversight, of which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is a key component.  The considerable skills and experience of Ms Logan and Mr. Hume will serve to enhance the public's existing confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's role.</p><p>I am confident the House will agree that both Ms Logan and Mr. Hume have impressive track records and credentials.  Subject to the agreement of both Houses, the Department will make the necessary arrangements for the President to appoint Ms Logan and Mr. Hume as soon as practicable.</p> <p>The Government has agreed that they will be appointed to the ombudsman commission for a period of three years and six months, or such shorter term as may result from the enactment of legislation providing for the restructuring of the commission.  I hope the House will agree that the appointment of Ms Logan and Mr. Hume is to be welcomed.  On behalf of the Government, I am pleased to commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an r&uacute;n seo agus n&iacute; bheimid ina choinne.  I wish the new appointees well.  As the Minister of State said, they have considerable skills and experience and I have no doubt that they will be an addition to the board.</p>  <p>  The importance of the role of any Garda oversight body cannot be overstated, especially in light of recent events such as the death of George Nkencho in Clonee.  It is important that public faith in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is preserved and upheld.  Accountability on the part of our police service is a cornerstone of this.  The importance of the independence of GSOC cannot be overstated.  It must be independent and it must be seen to be independent.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a welcome commitment in respect of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  That report identifies a number of issues with the current arrangements relating to accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Recently, I spoke to a former employee of GSOC who identified problems very similar to those outlined in the report.  I want to speak on a number of issues which continue to challenge the efficacy of GSOC and which hamper overall efforts to maintain a good reputation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report and the person to whom I spoke both raise concerns about a lack of resources, a duplication of roles and responsibility in GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate, the training of investigators - in that only a few investigators are actually accredited - and the powers of GSOC being insufficient to cover the necessary investigative work.  All of this means that many investigations are outsourced back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through what is known as the gear&aacute;n system.  Of course, these members do their utmost but there will always be issues when they investigating their colleagues.  Justice has to be done and it has to be seen to be done.  I have heard about low morale among staff and I am told many have left.  Even where cases are managed by GSOC, many investigators, former male and female officers with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and police services abroad, will naturally see things from the perspective of a police officer.  Many investigators are trained in Templemore, alongside the garda&iacute; they will be investigating.</p>  <p>  I note from some media reports that a new office of the ombudsman for police conduct will be established by legislation being drafted by the Department of Justice.  I have tabled a parliamentary question asking about this process, which is mentioned in the report, and I look forward to seeing it.  Any police oversight body must be independent of the State and the police force and should be answerable to the justice committee.  We need a new model, appropriate training and critical care teams.  The current model is borrowed from the UK, which is changing its system.</p>  <p>  There is one recommendation in the commission's report that must be reflected in the forthcoming Bill, which is that the new body must be able to look into historical problems and complaints in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including retired investigating officers.  The recent High Court declaration in favour of Joanne Hayes and her family, the woman at the centre of what was referred to, mistakenly I believe, as the Kerry babies case, was a stark reminder of the wrongs of the past.  Joanne, her family and her lawyers have long maintained that the case should have been known as the "garda&iacute; in Kerry case" or the "Kerry garda&iacute; case".  What people tend to forget is that the tribunal was established to discover how Joanne Hayes was charged with murder.  An apology has been given by the State but an apology for what?  What is the State apologising for?  While the tribunal was allowed to be used as a forum for discussion of social mores in the 1980s, it never explained how four or five different members of the Hayes family, in different rooms of Tralee Garda station at around the same time, came up with practically the exact same statement, including in respect of things that were scientifically impossible.  Some of the statements were preposterous and there is no other conclusion but that some of the statements were prepared by members of a police service that lacked accountability in the 1980s.  The people in north Kerry supported the Hayes family and knew that the statements could only have been drafted by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that members of the family were coerced into signing them.  This case had an enormous effect on trust in garda&iacute; in Kerry.  There was hardly a conviction in a contested jury trial for 15 years afterwards if there was an issue with Garda credibility.  As I have said, some of the findings of the tribunal were preposterous and were seen as an attempt by the State to bury the truth, but the truth will out.</p>  <p>  We cannot afford a repeat of cases like this, particularly in view of the consequences for the administration and trust in justice.  The new body, the ombudsman for police conduct, is a step forward.  It does not mention the name of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The recommendation that the word "independent" be included was not followed.  If this is a portent that some investigations will continue to be outsourced it is not positive.  The training of investigators in Templemore is not appropriate and cannot continue.  Other issues that must be addressed in legislation are policy and resourcing.  We have a chance now at this crossroads to have a system of police accountability that is the envy of the world and I hope the forthcoming Bill will be the start of building this system.</p></speech>

A requirement of democratic society, therefore, is to have robust and effective oversight bodies to ensure these powers are always used proportionately and properly and as is expected by the Legislature.</p>  <p>  I campaigned to have a Garda ombudsman established since my involvement in the noughties with events concerning policing in Donegal and issues relating to the McBrearty case.  It was crystal clear to me from that point that we needed to have an independent Garda oversight body.  I campaigned to have the Northern Ireland model, a single ombudsman, established.  The response of the Government at the time was not to do that but to initially establish the Garda Inspectorate, which did not meet the requirements, and eventually the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, comprising three members, was established.  My honest opinion is that it has not worked as well as it should or could.  The actual transparency of its working since the ombudsman commission was established has lacked what was desired by all of us in pressing that legislation.  Obviously investigations take some time, and obviously they have to be done in a degree of secrecy because people's reputations are at stake, but there needs to be an ongoing explanation to people as to what is happening.  The recent killing of George Nkencho will require not only a robust independent investigation but also an explanation, as matters unfold, so that it is not simply something that is under investigation and we hear nothing more for a protracted period.</p>  <p>  I support, and I have no difficulty with, the two nominees to be added to the current Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The Minister of State has set out Emily Logan's credentials impeccably and Hugh Hume, a former PSNI officer, will be an important addition.  Of course, they are being appointed to a body whose very existence is about to end, and the far more important issue for us now is to get the next iteration of an independent oversight body right.  I ask the Minister to listen carefully to the views of many of us who have been involved in policing issues over a protracted period and to discuss it with us, and not bring us a finished product that we have very limited scope to alter.  I echo Deputy Daly's view that this is rightly a matter for the justice committee.  A lot of open discussion should happen in the pre-legislative stage before the recommendations of the commission on policing are transcribed into a Bill for us to examine.</p> <p>We certainly need very careful analysis of how we are going to progress with the new iteration of a policing authority, the new iteration of a Garda oversight body, a Garda ombudsman and the other crucial recommendations that have flown from the commission report.</p> <p> In supporting these two nominees, I am delighted they came through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, system, the establishment of which I championed in my own time in government to ensure that everybody appointed to State boards is vetted by an independent process.  It is a very good thing that we are going to continuously get very good candidates by that process.  While I have no difficulty supporting the two excellent candidates being put forward, the much more important issue, as I said, is what we do next to ensure there is absolute public confidence in the administration of justice and that we have an oversight body that is fit for purpose for policing in this State.  That cuts both ways.  Many members of the Garda are dissatisfied with the operation of GSOC and their input has to be taken into account in a balanced way, so we get a proper oversight body that the public have complete confidence in, the people we give powers to in the Garda have complete confidence in and we, as a Legislature, have complete confidence in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700043#QQ00200"><p>I want to note that the two board members, Emily Logan and Hugh Hume, are very experienced people.  Hugh Hume has a long track record in policing as a member of the Garda Inspectorate since 2017 and, prior to that, he was a long-term member of the PSNI at a very senior level.  Emily Logan brings a huge level of experience from her background in human rights, having been the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I wish them well in their work and note that this has come through the PAS system.  I echo that this gives a degree of confidence in how the process works.</p>  <p>  It is always worth remembering that policing occurs in a social and economic context.  GSOC is an important part of the current regulatory framework within the criminal justice system.  It is important and right that there should be a healthy tension between GSOC and the Garda but I think it is more than that, which is why changes need to be made so it is not more than a healthy tension and that both work effectively, whatever way it changes in the future.</p>  <p>  I can recall the debate 16 years ago before GSOC was established.  There was quite a lot of resistance, particularly within the force, and there was a lot of public criticism about guards investigating guards.  We can see that, in those years, this was an important aspect but it can only be an important aspect if GSOC is allowed to function correctly and if there are the resources to do the work and the investigations in a timely way.  That is important from the point of view of public confidence, and confidence within both organisations as well.. </p>  <p>  Policing by consent is very important.  There are different policing models around the world but there is a high degree of confidence in the Garda by virtue of that culture.  It is not that there have not been problems because, clearly, there have been, but that is a culture we need to reinforce.</p>  <p>  Other work is carried out by GSOC, including in regard to misconduct by members of the Garda and there is also the question of acting in a timely manner.  I echo what Deputy Howlin said in regard to the importance of communication so people do not feel they cannot have ongoing information, where they have a very direct involvement, and that includes garda&iacute; themselves where they are subject to investigation.  The most recent case with George Nkencho is a case in point, and the public and a particular community are very much looking at how that will be handled.</p>  <p>  I was very pleased that GSOC signed up to the Brussels declaration in December last year as a member of the Network of European Integrity and Whistleblowing Authorities.  We could not say we have excelled in that particular area, irrespective of which sector is involved, and a lot more work needs to happen.  In regard to the Garda authorities specifically, it is important that has happened.</p>  <p>  There are significant issues in regard to resourcing, whether in respect of investigations, training or otherwise, but certainly in respect of staffing.  The delays in completing investigations undermine the role of the organisation and will do so into the future.</p>  <p>  Given the changed role of policing in the context of Covid-19, we need to ensure the consensual nature of policing in Ireland is maintained at a time of great change.  There have been areas where we can be complimentary of the Garda.  However, GSOC has an important role in investigating any possible misconduct at a time when the role of policing in Ireland has been changed by the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in.</p>  <p>  I wish the two new appointees well in their role into the future.</p></speech>

I would like to see more civilian oversight of garda&iacute; to ensure we genuinely have independence in oversight of the Garda and that it is perceived to be independent.</p>  <p>  Given the recognition and acknowledgement that we need a new model for oversight of the Garda that genuinely has that credibility, I believe the case of George Nkencho, referred to by a number of Deputies, indicates the need to have an Abbeylara-style, fully independent inquiry.  Concerns have been expressed by the family solicitor about the failure to interview the family, even though they have important evidence regarding the shooting.  There is a very concerning independent pathologist&rsquo;s report about George Nkencho receiving two shots in the back of the six shots that killed him on the doorstep of his house, particularly when the family have important evidence to give in terms of what they saw and their belief that the shooting was unnecessary.</p>  <p>  I also think there are quite striking similarities that need to be acknowledged between this and the Abbeylara case: two young men, both aged 27, with 20 years almost exactly between these two events, and both of whom suffered from mental illness.  In both cases, there were attempts to demonise the individuals and downplay the impact of mental illness on the circumstances.  Of course, we know that the Barr tribunal eventually found that, really, had things been handled better, the shooting of John Carthy might not have been necessary.  It is important we have that kind of independent public investigation into the shooting of George Nkencho, not least because, of course, the far right have, in the most vile way, demonised the family on racist grounds.  It is very important for that reason as well that it is seen to be a genuine, independent public inquiry.</p></speech>

Ireland is not immune to the phenomenon of the over-policing of minority communities.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties observed that "the pain and anger in the black community in Ireland has been palpable since the killing of George Nkencho."  The words of the ICCL only underlines the sensitivity, local, national, international, of the investigation into this killing.  An organisation which initiates sensitive investigations in minority communities should have strong representation built into its structures for those communities.  I question GSOC's suitability to conduct such investigations given such lack of strong representation.</p> <p> Eyewitness statements were taken from the Nkencho family members today, four full weeks after the shooting.  No doubt there are particular reasons for this delay but minority community representation within the structures of GSOC would have been able to make it very clear very early that such delays only serve to increase suspicion and doubt over GSOC's bona fides within that community.</p> <p> I wish to state my opposition to the nomination of Mr. Hugh Hume, not on the basis on any personal aspersion or the need to be impartial and dispassionate but rather on the need to be seen to be impartial and dispassionate.  The point is not that the RUC in which he served was a discredited police force believed by many, including Mr. John Stalker, to operate a policy of shoot to kill and cover up, nor is it that Mr. Hume presided over specialised armed units within the PSNI.  The key point is that Mr. Hume served directly under Commissioner Harris in the PSNI from 2014 to 2017.  He should not be placed in a position where he has to preside over an organisation tasked with deciding whether to launch a criminal investigation into Commissioner Harris's officers in this or any other case.</p> <p> I conclude by reiterating two points, first that the investigation into the George Nkencho killing should be conducted not by GSOC but by an independent public inquiry which includes representation from both the community and the family, and second, I register my opposition to the nomination of Mr. Hume to the GSOC position.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the appointment of two new commissioners to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  I do so for three reasons.  One, as others have mentioned, it is very good that the competition was run exclusively through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  The competition was free, fair and fully transparent.  The more State appointments that are pushed through this pathway the better the country will be in the long run.  Second, as the Minister of State outlined, the two individuals recommended are both eminently qualified and suitable.  One has a background in human rights and is a former children's ombudsman and the second has had a life-long career in front-line policing at the highest level.  On an individual basis, they are very good nominees but third, and perhaps most important, we should look at these nominees as a pair rather than just as individuals.  Populating a commission such as this is a very delicate balancing act and on this occasion the Public Appointments Service has got it just right.  Having an individual with experience of front-line policing will ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be very fairly assessed in the performance of their duties from a policing perspective, and there is another person with a background in human rights who will allow the public to have complete confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the performance of its duties.  The PAS got the mix just right from the perspective of gender and expertise which is a very good thing.  I welcome both nominees to GSOC and will support both.</p>  <p>  I wish the outgoing commissioners, Dr. Kieran Fitzgerald and Patrick O'Sullivan, the best.  I thank them for their service in recent years and wish them well in their future careers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700044#RR00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State's statement on the outlining of the process to nominate these two commissioners culminating with the President's nomination.  Perhaps the Minister of State should look at how Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring has been on her own for more than a month and that should vacancies arise in the future that it would not happen and that the recruitment process would start earlier.</p>  <p>  I have no difficulty with this.  I know one name more than another.  I have already referred to Emily Logan this morning in her previous role on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the very strong submission it made to the UN committee in relation to the gaps, so to speak, in Ireland's compliance with our obligations under the social, political and cultural rights on which my colleague, Deputy Pringle, had a Bill before the D&aacute;il this morning.</p>  <p>  I also think it is important to point out the background as after a while, one forgets.  We are addicted to social media and constantly changing images but it is important to point it out.  I am glad to see Deputy Howlin here as he played a very important role leading to the establishment of the Morris Tribunal in April 2002 and the report was finally published in October 2008.  That was set up to investigate complaints concerning some garda&iacute; in the Donegal division.  By 2018 the cost of that was &euro;68.8 million and rising.  I think it is over &euro;70 million now.  I am inclined to say the biggest mistake - but I do not know if it was a mistake - was to look on Donegal in isolation, as one county, as though this could not possibly happen in any other county.  That was the worst decision made at that time and at huge cost.  We have oversight now.  There is the Policing Authority, GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate, but it is important to remember how those were really dragged into birth after all that happened among certain segments of the Garda.  The Smithwick Tribunal was established in 2005, reporting in 2013, involving the collusion of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other State employees into the fatal shootings of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan and the cost of that is &euro;20 million and rising.  The ongoing Charleton Tribunal is investigating protected disclosures made under the Protected Disclosures Act, which has cost millions and is rising.  My first introduction to the D&aacute;il was the Higgins Commission.  I read the whole report at the time.  It was to investigate certain complaints of Garda malpractice in the Cavan Monaghan division.  Gradually, costing all these millions, we realised that what was missing was independent oversight of the Garda.  Many families have been absolutely destroyed.  The garda&iacute; who were honest, straight and hardworking must have been in despair at what was allowed.</p>  <p>  We are here today to approve the nominations by the Government.  I have no difficulty with them but we have to learn and always remember why we need oversight.  I understand the Government will bring legislation before the House to have a separate oversight body which I look forward to.  In the meantime, GSOC is under-resourced with Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring forced to say so publicly.  Different Governments have utterly failed to learn.  They did in theory and they put an organisation in place but then they failed to resource it.  Can the Minister of State tell the House if it is adequately resourced now?  Are there staff vacancies?  I hope the two new commissioners will take courage and lead, so that if it is not fit for purpose, they tell us as legislators what is needed and tell the Government the budget that is necessary so that we give meaning to words when we talk about an independent oversight body of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I finish by paying tribute to the Garda during Covid.  We have had a wonderful picture of what is possible from good community policing on the ground.  Exactly what we need in any civilised society is garda&iacute; on the ground, on the beat, who we can trust.  However, it will take quite some time before that trust is built up in the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not the ordinary garda&iacute; on the ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700045#SS00100"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and their generous support for the Government's nominations to GSOC.  I note one Deputy's objection to one of the nominations and the particular reasons for that.  It is important to note that these appointments came through an independent PAS process.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the garda&iacute; for their commitment to the community, especially during the Covid-19 crisis.  They have provided a phenomenal account of themselves and their commitment to the community.</p>  <p>  The appointment of the candidates before the House will ensure that the very important functions of GSOC will continue to be discharged to the highest possible standard.  The Government is committed to ensuring that policy in Ireland is subject to the highest principles of governance and independent external oversight.  I have every confidence that Mr. Hume and Ms Logan will, in conjunction with the chair, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, deliver the essential leadership to the commission, both in fulfilling its oversight role and in preparing the future reform in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that the new programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to the rapid implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, COFPI, and to the introduction of the policing and community safety Bill, which will redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provide a new governance and oversight framework.  </p>  <p>  Work is at an advanced stage in my Department on the development of the general scheme of the policing and community safety Bill and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, expects Government approval for the draft scheme very soon.  This major legislative project will provide a framework for policing, community safety and security for the coming decades.  It seeks to build on previous reforms in 2005, and more recently in 2015, but does so with the benefit of the extensive and intensive consultations, deliberations and recommendations of COFPI, a group of independent national and international experts in diverse fields.</p>  <p>  While there have been many reports on aspects of the administration and operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the past, this was the first comprehensive, future focused inquiry encompassing all functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and police oversight bodies, including GSOC.  COFPI took a strategic and objective approach to its task and examined the area afresh.  Its final recommendations centred on an overall message on the need for a coherent policing architecture to support effective accountability and, ultimately, a more effective policing service for all.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the recommendations of COFPI, the new legislation will identify the prevention of harm to individuals, particularly those who are vulnerable or at risk, as a specific objective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The rationale for this reflects the experience of our garda&iacute; and police elsewhere where the majority of police time is spent on the non-crime related activity of harm prevention, providing services to the people with mental health and addiction conditions, homeless people, children, elderly and others at risk.  In the reality of what police do every day, this also supports their broader policing objective of preventing crime and contributing to peace and public safety.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this legislation we place an obligation on other public service bodies to co-operate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others to support more effective inter-agency co-operation to make our communities safer.  As I said, the legislation will also provide for a new governance and oversight framework to address a key COFPI finding that the current framework has insufficient clarity as to where responsibility lies between the Garda Commissioner, the oversight bodies and the Minister for Justice and has the effect of weakening accountability despite the best efforts of all involved.</p>  <p>  Our proposal will seek to ensure strong and efficient internal governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and effective external oversight structures.  Specifically, with regard to GSOC, the new legislation will include, as recommended by COFPI, an expanded remit and reform process for the handling of complaints and the conduct of investigations to streamline them and ensure timely resolution by safeguarding due process for all concerned.  In addition, as recommended by COFPI, the new legislation will include measures to enforce the independence of the commission and ensure it has the capacity to deliver its expanded remit.</p>  <p>  I note the comments by a number of Deputies with regard to the importance of the role the justice committee will play in this and the importance of discussion on the pre-legislative stage to continue to ensure that there is proper oversight.  As Deputy Howlin stated, it is critical that the public have absolute confidence in the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any new body that is put in place and that it retains that confidence.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to, policing by consent is vital and not only that that culture is retained but reinforced in any future body.  We are committed to ensuring that.</p>  <p>  With regard to the shooting of George Nkencho, I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to all those impacted by the tragic event in Hartstown and in particular to the Nkencho family.  Any fatal shooting is deeply distressing.  Such incidents are, thankfully, very rare in Ireland but all are fully and independently investigated.  As is the case in every incident involving a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that results in the death of a person, the shooting of Mr. Nkencho is being fully investigated by the independent GSOC, which is chaired by the High Court justice, Ms Mary Ellen Ring.  At the same time, garda&iacute; are investigating the incidents at Hartstown Shopping Centre and the events leading up to the shooting.  There are well-established protocols in place between GSOC and the garda&iacute; to allow these to run parallel with the separate investigations to take place.  As these tragic events are the subject of two separate and independent investigations, it is not appropriate for me to make further comment as I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of any investigation.</p>  <p>  In advance of the introduction of this new legislation the important oversight work of the GSOC must continue.  Budget 2021 increased the justice and equality Vote by &euro;56.1 million or 13.4% on the comparative 2020 allocation, bringing the total gross allocation to &euro;474 million.  The 2021 allocation provides &euro;11.27 million for the commission.</p>  <p>  The Government has nominated two excellent candidates to lead GSOC and I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700045#SS00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to present the Bill to the House.  The Bill was passed in the Seanad in November 2020 and I am pleased that it received general support from the Members of that House.  I am hopeful that the Members of this House will be similarly supportive.</p>  <p>  It is a relatively short Bill, and its specific and limited purpose is to complete the transposition of EU Directive No. 2017/1371 on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law, which is commonly referred to as the PIF directive.  This directive builds on previous measures to harmonise and update the approach across the EU to the criminalisation of fraud affecting the Union's financial interests.</p>  <p>  This legislation is particularly time sensitive as the transposition is now overdue, and the European Commission has issued a reasoned opinion to Ireland with respect to it.  This reasoned opinion is the final step before Ireland can be referred to the European Court of Justice, ECJ, where a fine will be imposed.</p>  <p>  While the legislation is primarily technical from an Irish perspective, it has a particular significance in an EU context in respect of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO. Although Ireland has not joined the EPPO initiative, transposition of this directive in all member states is being treated as a particular priority by the Commission.  A deadline of 3 February applies to responding to the reasoned opinion and we hope to enact and commence this legislation over the coming weeks.  This will reduce the risk of Ireland being referred¬†to the ECJ and incurring a substantial fine.</p>  <p>  The EU is a unique economic and political union and Ireland, like all other member states, contributes to its budget.  That budget is a cornerstone of the Union.  The largest share goes¬†on creating growth and jobs and reducing economic gaps between the Union's various regions.  Agriculture, rural development, fisheries and environmental protection also account for a major share, while other areas of expenditure include combating terrorism and¬†organised crime.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for protecting the Union's financial interests and fighting fraud is a shared responsibility between the EU bodies and the authorities within its member states.  Member state authorities manage approximately 74% of EU expenditure and collect the EU's traditional own resources.  It is essential that every member state takes the necessary and appropriate measures to tackle criminal behaviour in respect of both EU revenue and expenditure.</p>  <p>  The key offence¬†of fraud affecting the Union's financial interests already exists in Ireland and is provided for in section 42 of Part 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  This was introduced in respect of the 1995 EU convention on the protection¬†of the European Communities' financial interests and the related protocols, which was the first measure to create a common approach to the criminal prosecution of these offences.</p> <p>The 2017 directive replaces the 1995 convention and establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions with regard to combating fraud and other illegal activities including corruption and money laundering which affect the EU's financial interests.  These financial interests refer to all revenues, expenditure and assets covered by, acquired through or due to the Union budget, the budgets of the EU institutions or budgets directly or indirectly managed and monitored by them.</p> <p> In order to comply with the directive, it has been necessary to update the key PIF offence and provide for a new offence of misappropriation.  We are also applying the freezing and confiscation measures which are contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to the proceeds of criminal offences under this Bill by amending Schedule 1A of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, to enable the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from the criminal offences in the Bill.  Other provisions in the directive are already provided for in existing legislation and therefore do not need to be separately provided for in this Bill.  Notably, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 and the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, apply in their respective areas and satisfy the requirements of the directive.</p> <p> Another provision of the directive is that committing a serious offence within its scope as part of the activities of a criminal organisation is considered an aggravating factor in the context of sentencing.  This provision already exists on a general basis through section 74A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as amended.</p> <p> In a European context, the directive is of particular significance in that it defines the scope of offences falling under the EPPO.  While Ireland is not participating in the EPPO, these offences will be prosecuted by the EPPO in other member states, potentially in co-operation with Irish authorities, so I would like to address developments in respect of it.  The establishment of an EU-level body with investigative and prosecution powers was under consideration for many years in the EU.  The legal basis for it was ultimately included in Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, introduced by the Lisbon treaty.  The regulation establishing EPPO entered into force in 2017 through a special legislative process, and 22 member states are participating.  Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary and Poland are not taking part.  A European chief prosecutor and the 22 nationally appointed European prosecutors are now in place and the EPPO is entering into operation.</p> <p> In considering Ireland's participation in the EPPO, it is important to note that the development of a supranational investigative and prosecution authority, even one with a relatively limited scope, presented particular difficulties in an Irish context.  The fundamental difficulty that arises is that the Irish courts would not be entitled to exclude unconstitutionally obtained evidence.  Under the EPPO regulation, evidence would potentially be admissible based on other member states' legal regimes and on the regulation itself.  More generally, challenges arose in how the EPPO structures would have interacted with our common law regime and how institutions and practices have evolved.  The EPPO built primarily from a civil law base.  Nonetheless, while Ireland could not take part, we recognise that the establishment of the EPPO is an important and innovative EU measure, and we have been working closely with participating member states and with the EPPO to look at how co-operation with non-participating members will work.</p> <p> The approach that has been proposed on an EU level and which is being implemented by participating member states is that the EPPO will be designated by those states as a competent authority within each for the purposes of making mutual legal assistance and European arrest warrant requests to non-participating states.  These issues are under detailed consideration.  It is important that we avoid conflicts of jurisdiction and ensure legal certainty in respect of requests.  We are consulting with and taking into account legal advice on these matters.  It is important to emphasise that the fact that Ireland is not participating in the EPPO does not  prevent us from prosecuting such crimes here.  Such offences will be dealt with by the relevant agencies within the criminal justice system such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p> <p> I will now turn to the content and provisions of the Bill.  This is a relatively short and primarily technical Bill comprising 13 sections and a Schedule.  Section 1 is a standard provision defining the principal Act as the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.</p> <p> Section 2 amends section 40 of the Act.  This is the interpretation section for Part 6 of the 2001 Act, and the amendment substitutes the definitions which will now apply to Part 6.  In particular, it provides that the offences in the Bill have the same meaning as they do in the directive.  This means that the offence of "fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union" has the same meaning as in Article 3(2).  The section provides that the offence of misappropriation has the same meaning as it has in Article 4(3).  It also provides that "corruption offence" means an offence under section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 and that "money laundering offence" means an offence under Part 2 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  Definitions for terms such as "national official", "public official", "Union official" and "foreign official" are also included.</p> <p> Section 3 amends section 42, the existing offence provision for fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union.  It provides that the elements of the conduct which constitute the offence of fraud, when committed intentionally, can be in respect of non-procurement related expenditure; procurement-related expenditure; revenue other than revenue arising from VAT own resources; and revenue arising from VAT own resources in cross-border fraudulent schemes where the total fraud involves a value over &euro;10 million.  A person guilty of an offence is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or five years imprisonment or both.</p> <p> Section 4 inserts a new section 42A into the 2001 Act which provides for the new offence of misappropriation.  Section 2 provides that it has the same meaning as in Article 4(3) of the directive which means the action of a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets to commit or disburse funds or appropriate or use assets contrary to the purpose for which they were intended in any way which damages the Union's financial interests.  A person guilty of an offence is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.</p> <p> Section 5 inserts a new section 42B into the 2001 Act providing for liability for offences by a body corporate in relation to an offence under section 42 or section 42A and provides for penalties on conviction on indictment of imprisonment and-or a fine.</p> <p> Section 6 amends section 45 of the 2001 Act and provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction.  Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, it was decided to extend the jurisdiction provided for.  I therefore brought forward amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad to apply extraterritorial jurisdiction to a person who is resident in the State and a company established under the law of the State.  The dual criminality requirement was also removed.</p> <p> Section 7 provides for a technical amendment to section 58, regarding liability for offences by bodies corporate under the 2001 Act, to exclude the application of section 58 of the principal Act to Part 6 in view of the new section 42B inserted by section 5.</p> <p> Section 8 provides for the insertion of Schedule 1A in the principal Act containing the text of the directive.</p> <p> Section 9 adds the offences of fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union and misappropriation to paragraph 10 of Part 2 of Schedule 1A of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Article 10 of the directive requires measures to be put in place, in accordance with Directive 2014/42/EU, to enable the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from the criminal offences in the directive.  The principal offence of money laundering and active and passive corruption are already subject to these measures.</p> <p> Section 10 includes the new section 42A offence of misappropriation in paragraph 23 of Schedule 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.</p> <p> Section 11 includes the new section 42A offence of misappropriation in paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 of the European Union (Passenger Name Record Data) Regulations 2018, SI 177 of 2018.</p> <p> Section 12 provides for the repeal of sections 41, 46(4), 47 and Schedules 2 to 9 of the principal Act.  These schedules are the 1995 Convention and related protocols on which Part 6 of Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 is based.  As they are being replaced by the directive, they will no longer be relevant.</p> <p> Section 13 is a standard provision, providing for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions.</p> <p> This Bill will ensure that our legislation is up to date with the provisions of the directive.  I hope Deputies will facilitate its passage through the House as enactment of this Bill will demonstrate Ireland's continued commitment to tackling fraud which affects the Union's financial interests and address the ongoing infringement proceedings.</p> <p> There is an amendment on the Order Paper to the Second Stage motion in respect of pet theft.  The amendment was tabled by the Regional Group and I look forward to speaking further on it in my closing remarks.  As Deputies are aware, this is an important issue for me and one for which I introduced a Private Member's Bill.  The crime of pet theft can give rise to incredible trauma.  We are all aware of the strong emotional attachment we have to our pets and theft not only leads to their loss from our lives, it also gives rise to a high level of concern regarding their welfare and what happened to them.  This is a crime which often affects which is often targeted at older and more vulnerable people, for whom a pet is of significant emotional importance.  Since becoming Minister of State, I have committed to addressing this issue.  I met with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and the Marine, before Christmas to discuss it with him.  I have also had discussions with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, about it.  Contact is continuing at an official level with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as we work on options.  I look forward to hearing Deputies' views.  I recognise and appreciate Deputy Naughten's real and genuine interest in this matter.</p> <p> I emphasise that while legislative changes may be considered and needed, we must also look at the full range of policy enforcement options to ensure that this very serious matter is addressed.  As I have set out, there is a practical issue in respect of the urgency of the Bill before the House, which needs to be passed in the next week to ten days.  It is not a suitable vehicle for making changes in the area in question and I cannot agree to deferring Second Stage by a month, as referred to in the amendment.  That said, I am absolutely willing to work with the Deputies on the issue of pet theft and to introduce appropriate, well-considered and effective measures.  I look forward to considering the Bill further with Deputies and I commend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700047#UU00200"><p>On the amendment to which the Minister of State referred, I know that pet theft is very upsetting.  It is even more upsetting than regular theft but I am not sure that this is the place to be putting an amendment to Bill of this nature.  The delay to which it would give rise would cause more trouble that it is worth.  It is important to say that in the original 2001 Act, under section 12, the penalty on indictment is imprisonment of up to 14 years for somebody who goes onto someone else's property and steals anything, regardless of whether it is a pet.  These stories play out well in the media, and especially on social media.  After the most recent meeting of the joint policing committee in Kerry, I asked one of the sergeants how many cases of pet theft there have been in the county.  There have been fewer than five - and it is not the higher end of fewer than five - reported pet thefts in Kerry since 1 January 2020.  The key consideration when it comes to a matter of this nature is that this House has a responsibility to address crime and the causes of crime, but also the fear of crime.  The same garda to whom I spoke to informed me that were more complaints from people going about their business in the county doing legitimate tasks who were wrongly identified as individuals who were possibly stealing pets, and dogs in particular.  Garda&iacute; in Kerry were frustrated that this issue was being hyped up and people were afraid that there were some individuals going around the county, and the country in general, stealing dogs, when that is not the case.  It is important to put that fact on the record.</p><p>On the substantive issue, I wish to highlight the delay in transposing this directive.  We have been forced into a situation whereby we have been asked to pass this Bill quickly through both Houses.  What commencement date does the Minister of State have in mind in respect of this amending legislation.  I understand that existing laws, including the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, largely cover our obligations, but a referral to the European Court of Justice is a serious matter.  Some account should be given as to why the delay occurred here, as it did with transposing other obligations relating to money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  Deputies, Ministers and officials are only human.  Rushed lawmaking could lead to mistakes and an absence of scrutiny.</p><p>One important matter in this regard relates to how the Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, while retaining the defence for bodies corporate under section 5.  The relevant section states &quot;it shall be a defence for a body corporate against which such proceedings are brought to prove that it took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence.&quot;  With regard to the original group of offences that the Act covers, some of which were intended to transpose the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions into Irish law, offences under this Bill will also be subject to that defence.  The OECD has commented, in the context of its own recommendations, that this is not a defence that it envisaged under the convention.  On foot of its report, I understand that the Department is of the view that an offence of vicarious corporate liability would violate an assumption of <i>mens rea</i>, with potential constitutional consequences.  Nevertheless, the OECD has pointed out that there is no definition of what could constitute &quot;reasonable steps&quot; or &quot;due diligence&quot;.  Maybe this could be looked at further on Committee Stage.</p><p>One aspect of the Bill that is notable and, indeed, welcome in facilitating prosecutions is that it will allow for extraterritoriality in the prosecution of offences, including situations in which an offence takes place abroad and the proceeds of that offence are laundered in this State.  Our laws, having long been criticised by the OECD, have become far more robust since the passing of the 2018 Act.  This is particularly important because of the amount of foreign direct investment into this country.  We must not let Ireland be perceived as a soft touch when it comes to corporate wrongdoing or exceptionalism.</p><p>We should not drag our feet in respect of this Bill.  We will support its passage.  We should have a strong enforcement system, but law is only one part of the system.  I believe there is another Bill undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny to overhaul the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, which is also worthy.  The powers for the ODCE or the offences created under this Bill are of no use without the resources.  The State needs to give itself a fighting chance and create a career path for people who are interested in law and accountancy to work in these matters.  The offences under discussion are complex, multilayered and require much know-how.  Furthermore, in the area of white-collar crime, private practice will always enjoy an advantage over the prosecution in light of the rewards for those qualified individuals.  Various investigations in the past have been delayed and stymied by a lack of resources in the ODCE.  Some household names were involved in cases where serious wrongdoing occurred and public confidence in our wider legal and economic system rests on successful sanctioning where wrongs have occurred.  That said, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill proceeding to Committee Stage.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State on it in the future.</p></speech>

We know the complex VAT fraud and what are known as carousel fraud operations have used shell companies and banks here.  Of course, they have been unwittingly involved, but criminal enterprises have used Irish banks to commit serious offences.  Therefore, it is right that Ireland plays its part as a member state and implements this legislation in order to give effect to the EU directive.  We know that these types of crimes cost EU taxpayers billions of euros every year.  It is important that we do all we can to prevent this.  Successive governments have been reluctant to strengthen our domestic white-collar crime legislation but, as my colleague mentioned, the legislation to overhaul the ODCE is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny, which is very welcome.</p>  <p>  The reform of the ODCE is much needed and well overdue.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in its criticism of the hands-off approach of the Government to white-collar crime here.  It is scandalous that ten years after the bank bailout, the need for which arose as a result of the reckless behaviour of banking executives, the agency tasked with monitoring compliance with company law has a staff of just 44.  The need for a total overhaul of the ODCE came to the fore in 2017 when the trial of the former chairman of the Anglo Irish Bank collapsed due to nature and performance of the investigation of the ODCE.  At the time, Justice Aylmer said that the investigation carried out by the ODCE fell short of an unbiased, impartial and balanced investigation to which the accused in any case is entitled.  The coaching of witnesses in respect of their statements, the late disclosure of documents, a perceived bias on the part of ODCE investigators and the shredding of documents were all cited as reasons that the trial of the accused could not be considered to be fair.  It was, in effect, a damning indictment of the State's apparatus to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime.  Almost four years on, however, we are still waiting for the new overhauled agency.  The limited staff, funding and powers conferred on the ODCE over decades epitomises the lack of interest that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have in tackling white-collar crime.  I look forward to the overhaul of the ODCE.  We will seek to ensure that this office has the full capability it needs to pursue and prosecute white-collar criminals.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us is welcome because it provides more protections for EU taxpayers in the context of fraud and misappropriation.</p> <p>The need for our laws in this area to be regularly updated was highlighted by a case involving Meath County Council a couple of years ago.  I was a member of that local authority at the time.  The council was a victim of what is known as CEO fraud, whereby large sums are transferred online to criminals on foot of a bogus instruction in the name of a company chief executive.  Fortunately, the &euro;4.3 million involved in that case was recovered when the money was frozen in a bank account in Hong Kong after the Garda interrupted the operation.  That and other cases highlight the need for regular reviews of our laws to take account of new forms of fraud and cybercrime.  They also highlight the importance of working with international colleagues due to the nature of sophisticated online crime.</p> <p> I welcome the Bill but I ask that the Minister for Justice to further strengthen and update domestic legislation to tackle white-collar crime and to ensure that white-collar criminals face the full legal consequences of their actions, which many have escaped to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700048#VV00200"><p>I welcome the arrival of the Bill 2020 into the D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State said in his opening statement that it is not a complicated nor a particularly lengthy Bill.  One wonders why it has taken so long to arrive before us.  We seem to be always at the end of the timelines for the transposition of EU directives.  Again and again, that seems to be the situation and we are presented with timelines in which we must get the legislation done or face financial sanction in the European court.  That should not be the way we operate.  Directives take a long time to go through the European system.  They are well-signalled within Departments but it seems the Departments sit on them until such time as they must have them enacted or until legal processes are commenced against this nation.  That is not good for our reputation and it is not good for the processes we use to evaluate legislation properly.  I say that by way of general commentary.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Bill, as the Minister of State said, is to give effect to EU Directive No. 2017/1371, or at least the remaining parts that have not been transposed in previous legislation, and to extend the definition of fraud.  The Bill provides for a new offence of misappropriation and the extraterritorial application of certain offences.  That, in essence, is the thrust of the legislation.  Its purpose is to create a stronger and more harmonised system to fight crime, namely, crime that affects the EU budget.  The legislation is designed to protect the internal funding mechanisms of the EU itself.  Those mechanisms are growing, they are important and very considerable and we need to ensure that money disbursed across the 27 nations of the EU, with their different legal systems and different traditions of oversight and so on, is done in a very robust way in order that all taxpayers throughout the Union can have full confidence that the moneys are properly appropriated and used for the purposes that the European Parliament, Commission and Council determine.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 transposed part of this directive.  We are finally getting around to dealing with the untransposed parts in this particular legislation.  The EU Anti-Fraud Office estimates the damage from fraud within the EU budget to be more than &euro;500 million per year.  There are many within the Union who regard that as a gross underestimate.  The UK House of Lords did its own estimate, for example, which was multiples of the EU estimate on an annual basis.  I understand we do not have a proper estimate of money that is misappropriated.  We need not only to strengthen our laws but, following on from the debate we just had about Garda oversight, we also need to have financial oversight in a robust fashion within the EU.  The largest fraud, according to the report of the UK House of Lords investigation, was in the area of VAT.  Of course, VAT is the big generator of resources for the Union.  These are matters on which we might usefully have further debate in terms of how we monitor expenditure.  We have the European Court of Auditors, and our own member of that court, but, in many instances, it is seen as our sending somebody to Luxembourg who disappears over there and we do not hear very much more from him or her.  Perhaps we do not ask enough questions in that regard and it is our fault.  We certainly need to look at these matters.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State made several mentions of the new EPPO, which was to be established from 2017.  It is still not operational, even for those countries that have subscribed to it and that fully intended to participate in the process.  It would be interesting to hear a more detailed discussion on how that office is going to develop and how we, as a nation, will be impacted.  From the Minister of State's explanation of why we are not joining the 22 nations out of the EU 27 that are going to be part of the EPPO process, it is partly because of the operation of common law in this jurisdiction and partly because of the constitutional difficulties that might arise from that independent office and the way it does its business.  It comes down to a very fundamental point about which we will have to have some debate, namely, the divergence of our common law tradition and the civil law tradition of the EU.  Following the exit of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Cyrus are the only two remaining common law jurisdictions.  Like all the debates we have had about the impact of the exit of the UK, it is important to note that, in many instances and in many fields, we formerly lay in the shadow of the UK in terms of its impact within the EU.  One of the things the UK did was to ensure that when European law was being drafted, because of its size, scale and capacity, it was able to push in with its common law tradition and ensure that European legislation could not be interpreted in a way that did damage to our own common law traditions.  I am afraid that the situation is now very fundamentally altered because I do not see Ireland and Cyprus having the same capacity to do that.</p>  <p>  This is an issue to which we must give some consideration.  I was just rereading the very interesting comments by the Attorney General, Paul Gallagher, SC, before he was reappointed to that office.  He was talking at a seminar on Brexit and made some of the points I have raised.  He talked about the difference between the two legal traditions and how that difference is now, in his phrase, coming to a head post Brexit.  He spoke about how that is going to impact upon us in the future when significant differences arise, such as in the way we have, in our common law tradition, allowed the courts to be, in some ways, not only the interpreters of law but the instigators of law.  Many of the most impressive things that have been done in this country, in fact, have been decisions of our highest courts reinforcing principles and creating law.  It will be an interesting new issue for us to address how we are going to continue with those traditions in the context of European law more and more being not only dominated by but, in fact, overwhelmed by a civil law tradition.</p> <p>I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on that matter.</p> <p> I have no difficulty at all in supporting this legislation.  "Is &eacute; a locht a laghad," is the only comment to be made about it, in that we can go an awful lot further in dealing with the whole issue of fraud and theft, not only as it pertains to funds belonging to and originating in the institutions of the EU but also as it pertains to white-collar crime, which other speakers have mentioned.  In this regard, our structures are wholly inadequate.  The previous speaker talked about the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  By everybody's assessment, it is simply not geared up, resourced or able to do the task we now give it in the context of the complexity of financial services operating from this jurisdiction.  We are a long time waiting for the fundamental reforms we were promised.  I hope we will be dealing with that legislation very shortly.</p> <p> The most recent document I have read on the subject of the scale of operations out of Ireland is from 2015.  It was commissioned by the Department of Finance.  In the period covered, over 400 companies were operating in financial services in the State, employing 35,000 people.  Staggeringly, the companies were handling &euro;3.2 trillion in funding and paying in excess of &euro;2 billion in taxes and &euro;2.3 billion in wages to employees in our State.  I am afraid that Departments and Governments sometimes consider only the bottom line for ourselves, the tax take and the employment rate and they are a little reluctant to robustly ensure the companies paying those taxes and wages are regulated to the highest possible standards.</p> <p> I want to mention a Private Members' Bill I introduced just before Christmas.  It is another criminal justice Bill, the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, more commonly referred to as a Magnitsky Bill.  The Minister of State will be perfectly aware that in the European Parliament itself and in several jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and the United States, Magnitsky Bills have been enacted.  These are Bills named after the Russian citizen who tried to expose fraud in his own country, Russia, and who ended up being imprisoned and dying simply because he was a campaigner against wrongdoing and fraud.  The idea of a Magnitsky Act is that where there is a gross abuse of human rights anywhere and the perpetrators have funds in our jurisdiction, we can act against them in the same way as the Criminal Assets Bureau can act against domestic criminals.  If trillions of euro are washing their way - I do not use that term in a pejorative sense - or moving their way through our financial services sector, we certainly need to have robust legislation to ensure that if there are gross human rights abuses abroad, the perpetrators cannot use our jurisdiction as a safe place to stash their ill-gotten gains or their filthy loot.  I hope my Bill, when it comes before the House, will be supported by the Government.  In my judgment, it would attract broad support across all sectors of this House.</p> <p> We are required to enact the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Bill on foot of a European directive.  It has arrived here slowly.  On the face of it, having examined the Bill, the Seanad debates and the relevant analysis done, including by our own services in the Oireachtas, I believe it is fit for its stated purpose, which is to give greater legal strength to the protection of funding of the EU and to act against those involved in fraudulent activities against the funds of the EU.  Again, as with all legislation, implementation will be the issue.  This includes the question of how the legislation is to be implemented.  We are not going to be participants in the new European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO.  I am not clear from the Minister of State's Second Stage speech how Ireland, as a state, and those other states that are not formally participating in the EPPO, will interact with it once it is established.  What will be the equivalent of the EPPO for Ireland?  What body will have its functions and authority here?  Alternatively, will there be some authority or functioning of the EPPO in our jurisdiction, notwithstanding the fact that we will not be formally participating in it?</p> <p> I hope the deadlines for the passage of this Bill can be achieved in order that we can report to the European Court of Justice that we have done our business finally, that there will be no financial consequences for tardiness on our part and that we can strengthen our common focus to ensure fraud and theft of public moneys are combated to the best of our ability.</p> <p> To return to the domestic situation, an increasing number of citizens are considering how we introduce criminal justice legislation in this jurisdiction, how clear, precise and accurate we are in dealing with theft, as in somebody robbing something from a shop, and, at the same time, how obtuse or opaque we are at times in ensuring that theft of a far greater scale, or what is euphemistically referred to as "white-collar crime", is combated to the same extent.  We are all critical at times of the United States and of how its criminal justice system operates, and also of how its prison system or plea-bargaining system operates - there are plenty of things to be critical of - but we cannot be critical of the fact that where someone is found out for serious fraud there and somebody from the judicial system puts a hand on his or her shoulder, that person knows it is a very serious matter and that he or she will go to jail for a very long time.  I am not sure that people operating in our jurisdiction feel the same weight on their shoulder when they are tempted to commit so-called white-collar crime or fraud.  This legislation is a start in addressing this issue insofar as it relates to EU funding but we have an awfully long way to go to ensure not only that we have robust laws but also that we have robust mechanisms to delve into the complexities of the electronic trading that now characterises so much of the activity in the services sector in our country.  All this activity is welcome but it needs to be policed to protect our reputation as a country where funds are invested, handled and dealt with in an efficient but fair manner and where nobody is exploited or allowed to get away with fraudulent activities because of our inability to detect them.  I hope legislation to achieve this can be put in place here.</p></speech>

It is important, as we work to transpose the protection of the union's financial interests, PIF, directive into domestic legislation, that we look at the opportunities presented and, more importantly, the responsibilities of the State and agencies of the State in enforcing this directive.  It is in our interests.  This directive allows for an important level of harmonisation in dealing with fraud and theft against institutions of the EU across the member states.</p>  <p>  I will touch on the situation in respect of the EPPO later on but the first thing to note when we talk about the area of the EU's financial interests and the reason why this directive and, in turn, the legislation is so important is that responsibility is ever-changing.  When this directive was published in 2017, many of the challenges facing the Union and the State at present were probably not imagined or were far off in the ether.  The first of these relates to the Covid-19 response of the European Union.  It is a collective response, be it in terms of storing PPE, buying vaccines or investing in research and development.  They are EU financial interests and it is the work of the European Union and the collaborative work of the member states through the European Union that needs to come under this directive to ensure that the protections of the Union and the citizenry are maintained through this directive.</p>  <p>  The second area which I think is important and which has a particular resonance pertains to section 3 of this legislation and the references to VAT.  Of particular interest to this State in recent weeks and pertaining to this legislation is the impact on VAT and the impact on the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol of the withdrawal agreement post Brexit.  All of us have no doubt been contacted by many constituents in recent days on buying or shipping online for personal purposes, as well as business purposes.  There are anomalies and confusion that many people who are buying in from the UK are facing when it comes to VAT and other customs charges and related delivery charges.  It is an area where this directive has a real and powerful role to play because it relates to the EU's financial interests when it comes to dealing with the UK and running projects on the whole of this island, not just in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  One of the key points to make when discussing this legislation and the impact of the activities covered by this legislation is the fact that any time someone attempts to defraud the EU, he or she is not trying to defraud an alternative body or an alien subject, he or she is trying to defraud the citizenry.  The EU is our Union, just as anyone who seeks to defraud the State seeks to defraud the individuals and citizens resident within the State.  Fraud or theft against the European Union is not a victimless crime.  The lack of resources and the fact it may take away from individuals can be felt by everyone in our society and that is why, as Deputy Howlin mentioned, not only is it important that we transpose this directive properly and have rigorous legislation in place, but that we also have rigorous enforcement tools in place that will ensure that we equip the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the resources to fully implement this directive.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the EPPO, I recognise the Minister of State's contribution earlier.  We said there are major issues for Ireland from a common law perspective in terms of why we had to understandably opt out of elements of it, as other member states did.  That is true and there is no point debating that as a matter of law.  However, we should not rule out, in the future, the possibility of playing a part within that or seeing how we could further integrate our legislation, even though it is within a common law jurisdiction, to further allow for the proper harmonisation of European norms to ensure these directives are fully enforceable and as enforceable in one member state as in another, be it Ireland, Denmark, Hungary or whichever ones have opted out.</p>  <p>  I refer to the area of pet crime on which the Minister of State laid out his concerns eloquently earlier in the day.  I fully recognise his track record in other legislation and the work he has done over the last number of years as a Member of the House.  It is something all of us have been touched by, whether in dealing with constituents or as pet owners.  It is so serious a matter that it is important to recognise this through the Department of Justice and the legal system, as well as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  One hears harrowing reports of not just individuals who have lost a treasured family pet but the worrying environments and situations into which these stolen pieces of property, as some people view them, are put.  These are disgraceful, abominable conditions and it is important to ensure that every aspect of our legislation addresses those areas that are fundamentally concerning and worrying for our society.</p>  <p>  I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to this very straightforward debate.  I imagine this legislation will pass through the House with some ease.  When it comes to transposing all European directives, I welcome the opportunity the Minister has given to the Seanad on Committee Stage and to Members of the D&aacute;il on this Stage.  Every time European legislation or a directive comes before the House, it requires rigorous scrutiny, not just on the floor of the House but also to make sure we elaborate its impact on wider society.  This is a good piece of work from the European Union and from the Government and the Minister.  I am happy to support it.  </p></speech>

We may be a bit late in transposing the directive but it is important that the Bill is passed.  Last week at the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, members heard from Ian Drennan, director of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, regarding the establishment of the new corporate enforcement agency.  Our discussion at the committee related to domestic efforts to combat so-called white-collar crime.  I am pleased to be able to continue this theme, albeit referencing the transposing of the EU directive on the protection of the European Union's financial interests and the prevention of fraud against said interests.  The European Anti-Fraud Office estimates that over &euro;500 million is lost to the EU budget annually due to the fraudulent activities that the PIF directive aims to combat.  This is not an insignificant sum.  It is only right that this State steps up and plays its part in the effort to combat fraud against the EU budget.  As a member state, it is important we take this responsibility seriously.  We are now a net contributor to the European Union and in 2019, we paid &euro;229 million more into the EU budget than we received.  It is incumbent on us to ensure the money is not lost to fraud or misappropriation.</p>  <p>  Although this is a short and technical Bill, I agree with the Minister of State that it is extremely important.  An aspect of the Bill that is particularly welcome is the proposed addition of section 42B to the principal Act, namely, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  This allows a means by which criminal liability can be attributed to corporate bodies through the failure-to-prevent model.  Although failure to prevent will be used in a limited scope, it is a strong signal of a determination to attribute criminal liability to corporate bodies that fail to exercise proper control over their agents.</p>  <p>  Another aspect of the Bill that is important to reference is the allowance for extraterritorial jurisdiction in terms of the prosecution of offences.  This is an extremely important aspect of the directive and our efforts to implement it.  The offences we are talking about are often committed by numerous actors or bodies across a multitude of EU borders.</p>  <p>  The transposition of this directive harmonises member states' response to budgetary fraud against EU finances.  As I mentioned earlier, it is important that our State plays its part in this effort.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will not be found wanting in that regard and, as such, I am pleased to support this Bill.  It is my sincere hope that the implementation of this directive and the unrelated creation of a corporate enforcement authority will send a signal far and wide that there is no tolerance for fraud or corruption and offenders will be pursued.  For too long, there has been a lack of appetite to prosecute this type of crime.  The perception has permeated many communities that crimes committed by those in suits are tolerated.  Introducing measures such as this balances the scale between the accused who are well resourced and those who have less expansive wealth.  The adaption of this directive adds another tool with which those who commit offences can be pursued and prosecuted.</p>  <p>  We are looking at what will be a litmus test in the establishment of the corporate enforcement agency.  Will it get the resources and funding it needs and deserves in order that we can tackle white-collar crime properly?  If we do not devote the resources to the new agency, we are on a hiding to nothing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700050#XX00300"><p>This Bill, as has been stated by the Minister of State and the Government, is largely technical in nature, protecting the EU's financial interests and creating offences around fraud affecting the financial interest of the EU.</p> <p>We are generally supportive of it.  It is welcome to see legislation that will tackle this issue, given that estimates of the volume of fraud against the EU budget range from &euro;400 million to &euro;5 billion, including an estimated &euro;1 billion linked to VAT fraud.  This is a massive expense on the European taxpayer and it removes a huge sum from vital services and supports.  We stress the importance of good governance, scrutiny and oversight in passing legislation.  Time and again, successive Governments have lacked a proactive approach to transposing EU directives, frequently missing deadlines and passing legislation only in the nick of time, as though our arm is being twisted.  There is a resistance and we have to change that culture.</p> <p> On 11 July 2012, the European Commission submitted a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law.  The proposal led to an examination in September of the same year, and in June 2013, the general approach was agreed.  It then went through the European Parliament in 2014.  Legislation such as that which is before us has a long lead-in time before it becomes a directive, and then countries have to transpose it.  We are elongating that process by virtue of the fact that we are laggards when it comes to transposing EU legislation.  We are serial offenders in regard to not transposing directives in a timely way.</p> <p> On 3 December, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Ireland and Romania for failing to transpose this directive into our criminal code.  We talk a great deal about being good Europeans but how we act is very different.  It is interesting that our former partners in the European Union, the UK, were actually very good at transposing European legislation in a timely way, whereas in that sense we compare very unfavourably.  This directive should have been transposed on 6 July 2019, and this delay cannot be blamed on Covid.  Time was given to conduct an analysis and present the Bill in a timely manner, but the then Department of Justice and Equality did not do that.  Some aspects of the directive were transposed previously under the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.  Why is it that this aspect of the direct was pushed back for so long when, by the Government's admission, this is largely technical and uncontroversial legislation?  The objective of the legislation and of the directive is to harmonise the rules in respect of fraud and to ensure consistency in criminal sanctions.  Doing so will improve the effectiveness of both investigations and prosecutions, given that all police forces will operate with largely the same rules, even if they are not under the same agency.</p> <p> We have traditionally allowed white-collar crime to play second fiddle.  Even though there is applicable legislation on the Statute Book, the level of enforcement has lagged behind that for other crimes.  This is the case even when very large sums of money are involved.  Whether someone robs a bank or steals money on the other side of the counter, we pay a price for it.  We often enact legislation without considering the need for regulatory impact, with an enforcement agency and the capacity to enforce it properly.</p> <p> In 2015 or 2016, we in the Social Democrats proposed an anti-corruption agency to focus on white-collar crime.  That proposal was about effective enforcement with strong powers, including the power to arrest and prosecute, but also about having a remit that would encourage compliance and assist with compliance to foster a better culture.  We modelled the proposal on the New South Wales model, which was very effective.  It would incorporate several agencies and particular disciplines could be moved around as required, including, for example, forensic accountancy.  Companies would be liable for offences committed by directors, employers, agents or subsidiaries, unless they could demonstrate they had taken appropriate action to ensure compliance.  Advice is needed to ensure that people come into compliance.  We need to get to the point where compliance is in line with best practice, but that will not happen by accident.  That is why we put forward our proposal and we remain as convinced as we were when we published it that there is a need for something bigger and more robust.  While it is welcome that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is to be improved, we should not limit ourselves in respect of the improvements that can happen in this area, which is growing and demands much greater attention.</p> <p> Meeting the EU transposition deadlines is not a matter of courtesy; by missing them we waste time and resources and face possible fines from the EU when it initiates infringement processes against us, as it did in this case on 3 December.  Hopefully, we can avoid penalties if the directive is enacted in a timely way.  Elsewhere, in regard to other legislation, Ireland was fined &euro;5 million, along with additional daily penalties of &euro;15,000, over landslides at a Galway wind farm.  That happened in 2003 and still the issue has not been remedied.  I understand that in Limerick, &euro;100,000 was spent on CCTV cameras but they are covered by hoods because they are not in compliance with European directives.  Not only do we have a problem with compliance, therefore, we have a problem with understanding the superior nature of European legislation.  Only recently, legislation was passed in respect of the right to information as part of the debate on mother and baby homes.  We need a better understanding of where Irish and European law is positioned.</p> <p> It is strange that the Government would state that the key issue is that the State should aim to act lawfully, thereby avoiding fines and reputational damage.  Of course that should be the aim.  It is not just fines; citizens can go to the courts to seek remedies where the State is liable for not acting within the law.  While most people cannot afford to do that, it is not what people will want to do in any event; they will want to be in compliance in the first instance.</p> <p> What is the basis on which the Government prioritises directives?  Is a system in place or is it just at departmental level?  Is there a priority list?  It does not seem to flow but rather seems to be an afterthought, whereby we say we will get to them but we do not really want to.  We have to change our behaviour in regard to coming into compliance.  It would be highly beneficial if all Departments could indicate exactly what is in the queue and where we are likely to fall into non-compliance, even if that is done through the various committees.  There is probably a role to be played by our MEPs in determining which of our obligations require urgent consideration and which work we should be planning in order that we can address it in such a way that keeps us in compliance and in order that we will have a better culture of compliance.</p> <p>That includes the Oireachtas as much as it does Government.  Ultimately, it will go through our committee system when we enact legislation and through the various Stages before it is passed.</p> <p> I endorse what the Minister of State said earlier about the amendment being very much separate but it is urgent at the same time.  It is not something for this legislation.  That does not mean there should be a lack of urgency about dealing with it, however.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700052#ZZ00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the attending.  This legislation is on the back of a directive and there is not much to disagree with in it.  I want to use of the time available to make a few points, however.</p>  <p>  First, with regard to the transposition of directives, previous Deputies have said there is form here on waiting until the last minute of the last hour of the last day, which does not augur well in terms of our reputation in the European context.  Indeed, during the formulation of directives, before it even gets to the directive stage after it is passed in Europe and we are expected to transpose it, we are not very good.  In fact, we are one of the worst EU members for availing of the opportunity, afforded to us under the Lisbon treaty, for a period in which national parliaments can view the embryonic stage of proposed directives.  It is not something we do well in Ireland at all.  The last time I checked the statistics, which was some time ago, we were among the worst in terms of availing of that opportunity.  Bringing Europe closer to the people and making optimum use of the Houses of the Oireachtas is something we could and should do much better.</p>  <p>  As a former Senator, in one of the umpteen calls for Seanad reform and in various submissions and so forth, I proposed the Seanad could play a useful role in that when directives under whichever Department are referred at embryonic stage, it could have a debate and take a view.  That could inform our national position before directives are struck.  I am sure it does not apply to this particular directive because we all agree that financial fraud is a moving target in the sense that financial fraudsters are always developing new ways around the system to illegally secure money that is not theirs and belongs to other people, states, the EU, businesses, homes and so on. </p>  <p>  I will, of course, support the legislation.  I ask that in his deliberations with other junior Ministers and Cabinet Ministers, the Minister of State examines the potential to make greater use of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in particular, the Seanad, which would be only too delighted to play a role.  Ultimately, it is a role we are not currently living up to in our democratic mandates as public representatives in taking a view, when we can, on proposed legislation that comes in from Europe.</p>  <p>  When we adopt new laws, I am always conscious of resources that are available to garda&iacute;.  I would like to take this opportunity to put on record the fact that we almost pass laws here willy-nilly without considering the impact on the potential for garda&iacute; and authorities to enforce those laws with the resources available to them, particularly in the context of fraud.  We have various fraud squads, criminal assets bureaus and so on.  The technical capabilities of the criminals involved in carrying out fraud is so advanced, however, I wonder and question whether, in fact, we are sufficiently investing the appropriate resources with the Garda to enforce such legislation.</p>  <p>  It would be appropriate for me to put on record all our thanks, and certainly my own, to the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They have been hard-pressed over the course of the past ten months in keeping us all safe during the pandemic and, indeed, with the various checkpoints and so on to ensure we all stick within the rules as laid down on the advice of NPHET during the pandemic.  We are all grateful for their ongoing work in that regard.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for a little bit of latitude because I am going to go off reservation here on a further issue of resourcing.  As I have access at the moment to the Minister of State on the justice side, however, I want to talk about something that predates our time in government, that is, the restructuring of regions and divisions within the Garda.</p>  <p>  At the time, in the north-west, Sligo housed the divisional and regional headquarters for that region.  With the new Commissioner getting all the blame for this and the phrase "operational reasons" always being cited as the answer, we had a peculiar change where the divisional headquarters went to Letterkenny and the regional headquarters went to Galway, all of which is not in keeping with Project Ireland 2040 or the plans for that region in Sligo being a growth centre.</p>  <p>  Worse than that, however, sites had been purchased and procured in Sligo, Clonmel and Macroom and were to form part of a public private partnership for the development of three new Garda stations.  These Garda stations were announced approximately ten times by the previous Government.  Indeed, any time a Minister was on tour for a photcall, he or she would be wheeled up in front of Sligo's existing Garda station, which goes back to the 19th century, to advise us about this new station.</p>  <p>  In advance of the election last year, it emerged from my sources that the Government had moved the goalposts, and through a little bit of political engineering at Cabinet, the restructuring was about to shaft Sligo, Clonmel and Macroom.  This was denied by the outgoing Minister with responsibility for justice at the time but, lo and behold, last December, before the new Government took over, the then Minister advised that due to operational reasons it was decided the Government was going to do up Sligo station instead.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to look into this matter.  I have spoken to him about it personally.  We dished out &euro;1.325 million of the public's money to procure this site in Sligo.  I do not know what the status of Macroom and Clonmel is now because they were linked together.  As a growth centre, if the Minister of State saw where existing garda&iacute; are forced to work in Sligo, in such a large urban centre, he would be shocked.  Indeed, the Minister's announcement at the time focused on the fact there were detailed plans for a total refurbishment of Sligo station.  The authorities within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na locally have heard nothing about this.  Nobody has visited to plan or engaged to see what is required.  Yet, ten years between site purchase, the involvement of various political entities and 100 announcements by the previous Government we will now have no Garda station and an expensive site sitting idle.  I ask the Minister of State to address this matter and come back to me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.269" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700052#ZZ00400"><p>As my colleagues have stated, Sinn F&eacute;in will support this Bill, which transposes EU directives that will help in the fight against fraud and will be in the financial interests of the EU and, by extension, Ireland.  It is welcome that this Bill tackles further aspects of white-collar crime, corruption and fraud of public money.  The EU sources of income, however, include contributions from member countries and it is right we try to ensure that every single euro of the EU budget is spent for its intended purposes.  It is critical we have good co-operation across the EU when it comes to tackling areas of fraud, including public money.</p>  <p>  For citizens to be confident their money is being properly used, the EU needs to protect its financial interests.  This legislation will provide for the transposition of the remaining elements of the anti-fraud EU directive to strengthen the fight against fraud to the Union's fiscal interest by means of criminal law.</p>  <p>  If I may, I will refer to some issues that have come up in my local area.  It is a slight deviation from the Bill.  There has, however, been a spate of robberies in my locality in recent times, which has left people feeling insecure.  It is an invasion of privacy and some of them are fearful of the burglars returning.  I can understand the stolen cash can be difficult to trace unless someone with no means suddenly seems to have a lot of money.</p> <p>However, many of the people involved have said that they have had jewellery stolen, sometimes of great monetary value and sometimes of sentimental value.  There has also been farm theft and the theft of workmen's tools and people's bicycles.  Are the regulations strong enough in the context of the resale of these items?  Are pawnshops doing enough to make sure that the jewellery they receive is coming from the legitimate owners and has not been stolen?</p> <p> Much of this is linked to the number of garda&iacute; stationed in rural areas being insufficient.  Many Garda stations have been closed.  A small number of garda&iacute; are being asked to cover much larger areas.  Members of the community in Drumconrath, County Meath, contacted me recently to say that they feel abandoned by the Garda.  There was a break-in there recently that was carried out by someone who was already out on bail but the Garda seems reluctant to deal with this person, to the extent that people in the community wondered if this individual had ever been arrested for the initial offence.  I contacted the Minister about this matter before Christmas and I am disappointed that I have not even received an acknowledgement, never mind a reply from her.  She lives quite near the area in question, even though it is located in my constituency.  A bigger effort needs to be made to keep communities informed of what is happening with regard to crime and to increase the number of garda&iacute; covering rural areas.</p> <p> There is also an amendment to the Bill in the context of pet theft.  It seems that a large number of dogs have been stolen during the Covid-19 pandemic.  This type of occurrence was commonplace throughout the country last year.  Having a pet stolen can be extremely distressing because pets are like part of the family.  I am not sure if this matter fits exactly with the amendment but it is something that needs to be dealt with.  Dogs are being stolen for breeding purposes or to be sold on for exorbitant amounts of money.  It is totally unfair.  Genuine pet lovers who are attempting to buy dogs are unable to do so because of the lack of availability or the exorbitant prices being charged.  Something needs to be done to tackle that matter as well.</p></speech>

We have an amendment that would clearly set out a real deterrent against the growing crime of the theft of companion animals.  I have moved the amendment in order that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann can consider a change in the law that would act as a real deterrent in respect of the theft of pets.</p><p>We need to increase the penalties in this area for people who steal companion pets, a practice that has been on the rise since the introduction of the Covid-19 restrictions last year.  In the past 12 months, there has been a significant increase in the number of reports of thefts of pets to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the law, however, pets are considered property and their theft is treated in the same way as the theft of, for example, mobile phones.  We all know that pets are much more than property.  They are part of families and homes across this country.  Sometimes a pet is the only friend to someone who is isolated or is a guide for someone who is blind or has other sensory issues.  This needs to be clearly reflected in much stronger legislation.</p><p>On Deputy Daly's comments, I remind him that last year An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na received 14 reports per day of animals being stolen or lost.  This particular practice has a heartbreaking impact on the individual owners of these animals.  The law does not take into account this emotional distress of the theft of a family pet which, as we all know, is far greater than the distress caused by the theft of a mobile phone or another piece of property.  Yet, the legislation remains the same in its treatment of people involved in stealing family pets.</p><p>There are also people who, particularly during the lockdown, have been exploiting vulnerable owners of pets.  They steal a beloved animal and then claim the reward for its safe return.  From an animal welfare perspective, there is also a serious impact on the pet involved.  Being stolen can give rise to long-term emotional or behavioural problems for a particular animal.  Despite some criticism earlier, the fact is that there is cross-party support to the effect that companion pets must be treated as much more than property and that the law should and must reflect that.  Across D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann there is support from all parties and from Independents for a change in the existing law so that there will be a real deterrent against the growing crime of pet theft and that it will be made clear to people that we will act to ensure that there are significant penalties for those who steal or attempt to steal pets.</p><p>I welcome the comments of the Minister of State earlier.  I hope that he can accept the sentiments behind the amendment we have proposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-01-27a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1609" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700053#AAA00600"><p>I wish to support the amendment put forward by my colleague, Deputy Denis Naughten, on behalf of the Regional Group and say that people have come a long way in their understanding and appreciation of animals.  The role that animals can play in our lives is vastly different to what it was decades ago.  This is particularly true in the case of companion animals.</p>  <p>  The business of veterinary care, pet supplies and animal nutrition is a multibillion euro industry.  The vast majority of Irish people take care of their pets and they cherish the as part of their families.  Ironically, it was this appreciation and the increased desire to have a companion pet that led to an alarming spate of dog thefts.  It had long been an issue of concern but it exploded in the spring of last year.  Demand for dogs, especially puppies, soared as the pandemic led to people being confined to home.  The prices being paid for dogs also soared.  This was instantly identified by both criminals and opportunists.  Headlines screamed that drugs, guns and dogs were the key priorities for criminals.  At European level, dogs became the third most trafficked entities.  Some reports indicated that there was a 63% increase in the number of dogs stolen last year, while others stated that not all cases were reported and that the figures could be higher.</p>  <p>  The figures are concerning but even more concerning are the stories of mental anguish and suffering that countless families endured when they realised that their furry family member was gone without a trace.  Broken-hearted families and pet owners took to every available channel to plead for the return of their pets.  Gut-wrenching stories flooded the media about elderly dogs that required regular medical care disappearing, nursing dogs and their puppies vanishing, multiple dogs from the same family all gone and support animals being taken from people who depended on them.</p>  <p>  Stories and rumours on the possible fate of these dogs added to the distress.  Dogs that were not fit for breeding were said to be sold as bait for dogs for fighting rings or abandoned to fend for themselves.  Younger and more intact females were deemed to be destined for puppy farms.  Puppies and purebred dogs were sold for grossly inflated prices.  Dogs had their fur dyed and were advertised as perfect family companions.  Microchips were barbarically cut out of dog's bodies so that they could not be scanned and traced.  The common trend seemed to be that stolen dogs were largely exported as quickly as possible in the boots of cars or in the backs of vans to the UK and much further afield.</p>  <p>  Heartbroken owners were left inconsolable and helpless, terrified of what might be happening to their pets and despairing at the thought that they might never see their beloved dogs again.  Many were prepared to go to any lengths to get their precious animals back.  This too was exploited.  Demands for ransom were sent to desperate owners.  The majority of these were false, with heartless individuals reading about missing pets and seeing their chance to get their hands on some cash.</p> <p>Money was handed over with the promise of the return of the missing pet.  Neither the pet nor the money was ever seen again.</p> <p> As a country, we continue to deem these treasured family members as property, as something akin to a lawnmower or computer.  We are not alone in this.  Only a handful of countries have moved to change the definition of animals.  They have chosen to view them as more than just objects.  Switzerland, Germany and Austria were the leaders in amending their laws.  They have declared that animals are not merely property and should not be subject to laws relating to property.</p> <p> It is important that people understand that amending the law in this way does not change the legal status of animals.  Neither is it related to animal welfare laws.  These are entirely different areas and ready for a different discussion.</p> <p> The purpose of this amendment is to send out a clear and loud message to those who steal pets from their families that a fine or a rap on the knuckles will not be their fate, that the punishment will go some way closer to fitting the crime and that we recognise that stealing a companion animal is not an insignificant offence.  Unless a real deterrent is put in place to prevent or at the very least discourage criminals and opportunists from stealing companion animals, this activity will continue to escalate.  If the penalty for stealing a living sentient animal remains the same as that for stealing an inanimate object then families the length and breadth of Ireland will continue to live in fear.  We have a moral duty to prevent that from happening and we can do that by inserting this amendment in the legislation as proposed by Deputy Denis Naughten.</p></speech>

I am glad to get another opportunity to discuss this important issue with the tabling of this amending legislation today as well.</p><p>Obviously, pets are very much members of people's families.  Anybody who has lost a pet or anybody who has had a pet die, will tell you that it is heartbreaking.  People grieve because they lose their pets and people grieve because their pets die.  This is an everyday sad experience for families right throughout the country.  As such, the sentence for the theft of pets should be different from the sentence that exists for the theft of an inanimate object.  It should be harsher.  It should be designed to deter in a stronger fashion.  It should send a strong message that if one impacts so devastatingly on a family, one will have to spend time in prison as a result.  I know people who have had pets stolen and yet the sentence has been similar to that for the theft of a mobile phone, a laptop or a farmyard object.</p><p>I know of a family who lives in Navan in a street adjacent to the street in which I grew up and every day their dog, by himself, used to walk up the street to the pedestrian crossing.  He would wait for the pedestrian crossing lights to change and then he would cross the road.  Then he would go to the local pet shop.  He would bark a couple of times and the pet shop owner would open the door and throw out a pig's ear to him.  The dog would scoff the pig's ear and then make its way back to the family home using the pedestrian crossing again.  At the end of every week, the family used to pay the dog's tab in the pet shop.  They used to make up and pay the cost of the five pig's ears that the dog consumed that week.  When that dog passed, it was amazing that many of the people of Navan actually felt a sadness because this character they had engaged with on a regular basis for years had been lost.  A pet is not an inanimate object.  The loss of a pet must be recognised as such in the law.</p><p>In the past year, because of Covid we have seen a change in this regard.  The pet theft issue has come into sharp focus for many families.  Covid lockdowns have seen many families decide to get pets and as a result of this, and a number of other issues, the price of pets has radically increased.  My own dog is a crossbreed between a red setter and a golden retriever.  He is13 years old.  We paid &euro;50 for him 13 years ago.  The same dog on the Internet now would cost &euro;1,500.  This shows that the idea of pet theft has become far more lucrative and as a result, we see criminal gangs get involved in the theft of pets.</p><p>Many people will have heard of markings made on the tarmac outside of their gates or strings tied to gates which show that these gangs are searching for these animals and returning at nighttime under the cover of darkness to rob them.  There was a seizure of 32 stolen dogs in Swords in August last.  Their value was estimated at anything between &euro;130,000 and &euro;150,000.  This pointed to the organised nature of this crime.  Animals are sold online, are sold for cash or are got quickly onto ferries to go over to Britain and this makes Garda efforts to break this crime far more difficult.  My instinct is that we need to tackle this.</p><p>I was interested to hear, and nearly surprised at, Deputy Daly from Sinn F&eacute;in mention earlier that this was not a massive issue.  The Deputy contradicted his teammate, Deputy Tully, who recognised how serious this is.  I have done a lot of research on the incidence of this crime in the State.  There have been 17,014 thefts of animals in the State in the past ten years.  There have been another 40,000 reports of lost animals in the State.  In fact, a big chunk of those 40,000 would have been stolen animals.  Anybody who has been involved with the Garda will know that there is always a difference between what is reported and what happens because many people do not report these incidents.  This is a big crime with a significant impact.</p><p>When I formulated the Bill in response to this crime and published it last October, I met and discussed the issue with the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, and Dogs Trust.  These are two organisations that work on many occasions with stolen or lost animals, and they have backed the Aont&uacute; Bill on this.  They want the law to reflect the gravity of the crime when it comes to the theft of pets.</p><p>In the past 12 months there has been a jump of 16% in the number of animals reported stolen to the Garda.  Unfortunately, the number of charges or summons brought against people who are involved in this crime is low.  Only one in five of these crimes sees a charge or summons.  This points to the fact that there is massive underfunding of the Garda around the country.</p><p>We often hear from the Government that we have the highest ever level of garda&iacute; in the State and that we are back up to the 2009 figures, before Fine Gael hammered the garda numbers in the State, but the truth of the matter is, if one takes it by ratio of garda to population, we are still not back up to 2009 figures.  On a <i>per capita</i>basis, the number of garda&iacute; is still fewer than the 2009 level.  In my constituency of Meath, whole swathes of the county are absent of Garda stations.  Of those towns that have Garda stations, many of the garda&iacute; are only working part time.  Ratoath is the biggest town in the State without a Garda station.  I know of a section of Meath which is 30 miles wide by ten to 15 miles long where on a Sunday there are five garda&iacute; on duty.  If two of those garda&iacute; are taken out for an arrest, it hardly leaves enough garda&iacute; to cover the phones in that part of the county.  It stands to reason that garda&iacute; are unable to bring the charges and summons necessary to better tackle this crime.  What we need also is for the Government to put its money where its mouth is to make sure that Garda stations are functioning, that they are open and to make sure there are enough garda&iacute; to be able to do the job in hand.</p><p>The key element of this, and one of my worries, is that we will have a lot of motherhood and apple pie when it comes to this issue, that people will speak positively about the need for us to get tough on this crime but we will not see any action.</p> <p>That is why I am asking the Government to accept this amendment and the Bill I have put forward and expedite it through the House in order that we can give some comfort to families who are dependent on their pets.</p></speech>

That is why it is welcome that we are aiming for a more harmonised system to fight against crime affecting the EU budget by defining the terms &quot;theft&quot; and &quot;fraud perpetrated against the EU&quot; as addressed in the Bill.  It is also good to see that the offence of misappropriation is defined as meaning &quot;the action of a public official who commits or disperses funding contrary to the purpose of which it was intended&quot;.  Hopefully, this will give us an added assurance that the distribution of important funding such as that relating to the Common Agricultural Policy will be policed effectively and monitored intensely.</p><p><b></b>The amendments proposed in the Bill deal with criminal liability in corporate bodies.  Criminal conduct on the part of a company is only attributed to that company if it is proved that the offences are committed by senior managers.  In widening its scope in this legislation, I hope the Department and the EU have done all they can to ensure that junior officers are not targeted by unscrupulous companies as a result.  These amendments indicate that there is a great deal that has not been done by successive Governments domestically over the years in terms of action in respect of white-collar crime.  In the past, the ODCE was criticised by a judge for its work in a particularly high-profile case involving Anglo Irish Bank.  Tribunals and inquiries have largely been seen as toothless wastes of money that have done little to give the appearance that justice was done.  They have only added to the bill the public has to pick up.  We also live in a country which has the lion's share of corporate headquarters and a financial services centre that is seen by the Government as its Holy Grail.  Only now, however, we have seen movement through the Hamilton report on penalising economic crime and reform.</p><p>It is for these reasons that I believe this conversation must highlight the range of shortcomings when it comes to tackling white-collar crime.  This debate must also raise the issue of financial inequality.  In the course of this pandemic, the country's billionaires have done well for themselves.  Recent reports suggest that these individuals have benefited to the tune of over &euro;3 billion.  The rich have a habit of getting richer while the poor ultimately get poorer.  This is facilitated through a range of measures.</p><p>The Government's opposition to the Apple tax ruling is an example of the worrying culture of rewarding those who have to the detriment of those who have not.  We see those who have the financial resources to avoid paying taxes being able to do precisely that.  This puts more of the financial burden on the shoulders of our workers while all the time we have unpaid student nurses and are reluctant to invest properly in housing for our citizens.  This culture must be addressed.  As long as the rich can use our laws to work their way around the obligations that apply to the rest of us, we will continue to have a long way to go in protecting our own financial interests.  We must address that matter next.</p></speech>

Dog theft is a particularly cruel and nasty crime because a pet is not just property, it is an integral part of a family.  Harsh sentences should be handed down to anyone caught stealing dogs in order to deter others.  Under current laws, pets are considered property.  Their theft is treated the same way as mobile phone theft or items taken from people's gardens.  We all know pets are much more than that.  Pets are an integral part of families.</p><p><b></b>Introducing laws is one thing but implementing them is another.  For example, since 1 February 2020, we have had in place regulations on the sale and supply of pets.  Despite animal welfare organisations reporting hundreds of illegal adverts for the sale of dogs, the Government confirmed to my party colleague, Senator Boylan, that it is yet to take any infringement cases.  Animal welfare organisations are using up valuable resources reporting adverts and chasing their tails in doing so.  As soon as one illegal advert is taken down, another one pops up.</p><p>There is also poor enforcement of the microchipping laws that are already in place.  If there was better enforcement, it would help to address the issue of dog theft and reunite lost or stolen pets with their families.  There are laws in place.  It would be much more productive if these were implemented.  Resources need to be allocated to collate the data on dog breeders, sellers and microchip numbers in order to create a central, accessible database.  The creation of such a database would not only tackle the illegal sale of animals online but would also make it much harder for unscrupulous dog breeders to avoid paying tax.  It would also be a deterrent to dog theft.  For example, in my area in west Dublin, if a dog is stolen and later abandoned, it is often taken to Ashton dog pound.  When I was a member of South Dublin County Council, there were reports of the Dickensian-style conditions that abandoned dogs had to endure in that facility.  The pound operates as the dog warden centre for the greater Dublin area and is used by all four local authorities.  Last summer, garda&iacute; were called in to investigate whether unauthorised veterinary drugs were used to sedate and euthanise dogs there.  It is time all four local authorities in Dublin developed their own dog pounds to be managed by themselves or by one of the reputable animal welfare services.</p></speech>

I want to send my good wishes to the Minister for Justice.</p><p><b></b>Looking at the Bill and listening to the Minister of State, when the European masters want something done, we jump.  They say jump and we ask how high.  However, there is much legislation languishing in the bowels of the Department of Justice that has not been implemented.  The Minister of State is new and I wish him well.  I often worked and debated with his father, who I also wish well.</p><p>This legislation is necessary.  Any way we can stop fraud or crime is important.  I support Deputy Denis Naughten's amendment.  I compliment him and his group.  I also compliment Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and the other Members involved on bringing forward a Bill to deal with the theft of our canine friends.  It has become mean, low and a difficult trauma for many families, especially during lockdown.  There are gangs going around putting cable ties on gates in order to highlight the number of dogs that could be stolen from particular premises by the next crowd to come along.  Now they have different colour codes for different types of dogs.  This practice is sinister and very organised.  It must also be very profitable.</p><p>I hope the Government will accede to the amendment.  It should not be classed as the theft of property, of which we have thousands every day of the week.  It is the theft of something very special.  One just has to think of &quot;One Man and His Dog&quot;.  I love the sheep dogs and to see them working the sheep.  There are dogs for autistic children and dogs for the blind.  The bond built between a dog and their owner is just phenomenal.  Many of them have been trained.  I salute the groups and charities involved in the training these dogs.  There is a huge demand for these dogs for autistic children now more so than ever when the schools are d&uacute;nta and special needs classes are not taking place.  I hope the Government will accept this amendment.</p><p>The European Commission has recommended two courses of action in this area, one of which is primary legislation.  We are crying out for legislation.  Today, I raised with the Taoiseach the introduction of legislation to put some manners on utility companies.  These companies are fleecing people.</p> <p>They gave an eight-week moratorium to people with regard to standing charges.  I have been inundated all afternoon with calls from big and small companies about legislation.  We can bring in emergency legislation.  In the middle of a pandemic we can bring in this Bill, which is interesting to my mind.  It would require a simple short emergency Bill so that utility companies could not charge people when their businesses are closed.</p> <p> Today, the Taoiseach told me the Government did not close premises but that it was the virus.  That is a new element of spin.  We are gone completely now.  It was an act of this House.  It was something I voted for at the start, as we all did.  I heard the Leas-Cheann Comhairle being very rigorous in her questioning and rightly so and she was well able to do it.  By our acts here we closed the House and gave the Minister for Health inordinate powers to do what he liked.  Then the Taoiseach stood up today and said what he did.  Some one needs to pinch him and see whether he is in the real world.  Previously, he said we had no bank bailout.  It is the Government.  He blamed the HSE for closing St Brigid's hospital in Carrick-on-Siur.  He passes on the blame.  He is the Taoiseach.  For a while he was confused with the T&aacute;naiste.  Which was which?  Was it the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste or the T&aacute;naiste or the Taoiseach?  Who was the Taoiseach?  Who was the T&aacute;naiste?  At this stage, he should know he is the boss and the buck stops with him.  Legislation is passed in the House to delegate roles to Ministers and there is collective Cabinet responsibility.</p> <p> I introduced a scrap and precious metal Bill twice, once before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's time and once during her time.  It is very important legislation.  Today, precious protected buildings are being stripped of their lead.  Georgian buildings in Dublin are being stripped of their door knockers.  Worse than this, telecommunications lines are stolen.  We almost had major fatalities in Limerick Junction because of copper wire being stolen for a kilometre outside of the station.  But for the swift action of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann employees there would have been head-on collisions.  The first Bill was rubbished by the then Minister, Alan Shatter.  We amended it and brought it back but it was not accepted.  It involved a few simple measures such as traceability, whereby anybody buying or selling scrap metal had to have a PPS number and the item had to be held for a specified period so the Garda could find it.  It went back to gold and silver and PPS numbers.  It would have been very lucrative for the Exchequer's coffers but there would also have been traceability and time for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with issues.  It was rubbished and we could not act on it.  Now we can act on this because Europe wants us to do so.  Other countries did act in the area of metal.  There is also the theft of farm buildings, farm machinery and farm equipment.  House owners also have valuable items taken from them.  There is the vast reservoir of artefacts.  Some of the precious artefacts were on motorways, where artistic sculptures were sawn down with a gas torch at night and taken away.  They stopped at nothing.  They took the lead from the roofs of churches.  We did not deal with this.</p> <p> There are many issues we have not dealt with and white-collar crime is a big one.  It is a huge issue.  We can see it going on and we can see that the regulators in many areas are not dealing with these issues.  We have seen whistleblowers being vilified in the past.  Next week, the Prison Service will hold interviews and I have been contacted by concerned people about the interview process and the make-up of the boards.  I have had no response.  It seems to be the Wild West and they can do what they want.</p> <p> I missed the debate on GSOC and I am sorry.  The Ceann Comhairle told me he would allow me to say something on it in this debate because of the lack of backbenchers who did not show up.  We cannot watch a debate and it finished early.  It is impossible.  They want time taken from Independent Deputies but they will not turn up for the debate.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has a nice name and it certainly does some good work but it needs to be revamped and there needs to be a refocus.  I want every Garda to be held accountable as some have not been very accountable in the past.  I have had issues with a Garda station in Dungarvan, County Waterford.  They need to be held to account.  I have often been contacted by garda&iacute;, some of whom are now retired, who were caught in accidents and did not have a squad car or a squad van.  Some Deputies mentioned the lack of resources.  GSOC investigators could land in a field in a helicopter.  Where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on or off duty, is involved in an accident, GSOC has those powers.  That is extraordinary.</p> <p> Recently, we saw a case where GSOC took a garda to the courts and the judge lambasted it and rightly so.  The garda was doing his duty and the next thing GSOC brought him all the way to the courts and vilified him.  He was cleared, thankfully, and GSOC was admonished by the judge.  We need a review.  We set up these bodies, most of which are quangos.  They have boards, and today we appointed two new members to the board of GSOC.  I do not know who they are or what they are and more power to them.  There has to be accountability and there has to be a comeback and some respect for the law of the land.</p> <p> Some of these quangos get in and they just seem to be there.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA is one of them.  It just does what it likes with regard to licences and tests.  There is pure blackguarding of ordinary citizens.  There seems to be no accountability.  I do not see the chair of the RSA board on the television complaining about the testing.  The test centre in Clonmel in Tipperary is the Wild West.  Young people are being penalised unfairly.  Yesterday morning. four tests were cancelled because of the frost, despite the fact driving instructors were able to drive, the testers drove to work and the people drove with their parents, who took a day off work in these hard times to bring their child.  Then, at 2 p.m. one of the testers decided he or she was sick and went home and left people with appointments for which they had waited months.  They had spent a fortune on lessons with very good tutors.  This is blackguarding of the highest order.  It is driving people to the brink and could drive young people over the top.  They try to do a test two or three times but get blackguarded like this.  It is not acceptable and there is no redress and nowhere to go.</p> <p> There are many areas of legislation the Minister of State could look at during his career.  We do not have to wait until the high masters in Europe tell us what they want.  We are wonderful Europeans.  There are many elements of European law the Government will not introduce because they would suit Irish citizens.  It is time that we served the people whom we are elected to serve and left our masters wait.  When we wanted a bailout, we got little support and solace.  There are many areas in the Department of Justice.  I could go on for an hour but I will not.  I gallantly tried twice to introduce the scrap and precious metal Bill and it was the same with the sulky racing Bill.  There are murky industries that we do not want to touch and we dance around them.</p></speech>

To be clear, this includes the misappropriation of funds that might be obtained under the EU budget but also fraud or wrongdoing concerning money from national budgets that could contribute to EU resources.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the EU's annual report on the fight against fraud found 1,410 instances of fraud involving &euro;391 million.  The regulatory impact analysis of the Bill published by the Department of Justice states the European Commission estimates that implementing the directive would result in a saving of &euro;477 million throughout the EU.  The departmental analysis is that it is not possible to quantify what portion of this &euro;477 million would result from Ireland's transposition of the instrument.  Will the Minister of State address or clarify this point?  For instance, on what basis did the Commission reached the figure of &euro;477 million?  Why can a country-by-country breakdown not be given, even in very general terms?  The Commission's report on the fight against fraud gives a national breakdown.  If it has a means of estimating an overall figure surely it would be able to estimate a breakdown by country.  It would be of benefit to know how much money could be saved by the passage of the Bill into law.  Why is there no country-by-country breakdown from the Commission or from Ireland?  Is it about protecting the reputations of certain countries?  Is it the case that the Bill is more about protecting eastern European countries?  Will the Minister of State address these questions?</p>  <p>  We are speaking about the EU, and we are part of the EU, but the Garda needs more resources to apprehend criminals such as these and all other criminals.  Is there a new budget for them?  We also need to thank our local garda&iacute; for all of their efforts in recent months.  It has not been an easy job for them as the Minister of State can well imagine.  They stand on the roadside in the rain and snow.  This is their job and this is what they are made to do.  They are out in the frost and cold and every kind of weather telling people not to go outside their 5 km limit while we have tens of thousands flying in and out of the country and no one gives a damn.  They are all fine and welcome and there is no quarantine.  It is an EU issue and an issue throughout the country.  I raised it in the D&aacute;il last May with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  I stated we needed PCR testing for those coming in at our airports but it was dismissed at the time.  I contacted the airports but it was dismissed.  It has come at a very high cost.  We can look at various issues but this needs to be addressed.</p> <p>We have been fighting very hard down through the years to give justice and stronger powers to garda&iacute; because they need them to deal with these issues.  I think of the Garda stations that were closed in Ballinspittle, Ballinacarriga and Goleen.  We fought and we won the battle to reopen Ballinspittle Garda station but issues like that need to be tackled.</p> <p> I fully support the amendments tabled by Deputies Naughten and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  We look at the theft of dogs and the fines and proceedings that follow.  People adore their animals.  I have had so many phone calls about this over the past number of months from people who would rather be taken away themselves.  They would rather nearly kill themselves than to think the dog was taken away from them, given the heartbreak and the worry they have had in the past number of months due to unscrupulous individuals who go around terrorising people by attempting to take or taking their dogs.  The law here is too easy.  Long ago, the law was very strict in regard to horses and if a person hurt a horse, it was far more serious than if they hurt a human.  The law should be serious if a person attempts to abduct a dog or take a dog away from its owner, and thinks they can walk away from it.</p> <p> We talk about Europe and this law is based on a European directive.  I see what came into law in the past number of days, after the Taoiseach signing into law on 26 August the penalty points for fishermen, which is another EU belt on top of the fishermen.  Well done to the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  He is continuing his goal since he got into office of wiping out Irish fishing after Brexit, and this is another EU penalty down on top of the fishermen.</p> <p> These are all areas that have caused great stress to people and they would warrant further discussion, but I am out of time to discuss them.</p></speech>

Other Members have asked about the &euro;477 million.  We need more clarity on how this figure came about and how much of it applies to Ireland.  I sincerely hope farmers or people who could or would have benefited from funds like this will not be denied this money as a result of this or any other fraud.  None of us in the House condone or support fraud and we are certainly behind any laws that would prevent same.</p>  <p>  It was mentioned that dogs and pets are being stolen.  I know one person who had a very valuable dog and he is fairly sure that it was stolen recently, or anyway he cannot find the dog, and it disappeared for no reason.  I know too well about pets.  We had a pony ourselves, Peig, and she was stolen.  It gave my father desperate concern at the time because he used to go up and feed her every day and, all of a sudden, she was missing.  It took three months or more to find her but we did find her, thankfully.  I thank all those who were involved, including Detective Sullivan from Castletownbere, who played a massive role in ensuring we found the pony.  I know the anxiety and the pressure that was on my father and my younger family members when that pony was stolen.  I thank everyone who helped in the recovery and return of Peig, who we still have and take pride in having, and we see after her in the best way we can.</p>  <p>  What springs to mind is the situation of old people being robbed in their homes and being so concerned about being robbed or broken into.  When people move on in years, they are not as courageous when people drive into the yard and they are worried.  I know one great friend of ours, and when someone drives the long road up to his house and he sees the car coming, he would go out the door of the house and into the outbuildings, and he would wait in the yard and peep from some angle until he was sure it was not thieves or blackguards, and that at least it was someone he knew or that they had a good reason for coming to visit him.</p>  <p>  There are other types of what I would call fraud when a property is rendered of less value.  What I am talking about is designations, whereby environmentalists and others seek to reduce the value of property by placing designations on land that farmers may have bought and paid for at high cost, or inherited, and their pride in their place could not be exceeded by anyone.  Sadly, in some places, land has been designated for the hen harrier or for different reasons, and we hear that more of the countryside is going to be designated as special areas of conservation.  This will definitely reduce the value of their properties.</p>  <p>  There is also the situation where environmentalists want to stop us cutting turf.  Turf is of value to the people who own the bog in that they can cut and save turf, and keep themselves warm.  We hear of others suffering fuel poverty.  What do they want these people to do?  Do they want them to suffer fuel poverty as well, with the bog lying idle on their land?  Will they stop them cutting it like they have done for generations and for centuries back, without doing any harm to themselves or anyone else?  Their pride in their property could not be exceeded by any environmentalist.</p></speech>

It is interesting to sit here in a debate to transpose EU legislation onto our Statute Book only to listen to a debate about the theft of dogs.  When I heard this debate was coming up and it was being discussed earlier, I was thinking that it was not appropriate for this Bill.  However, I then thought that the Government is going to have to show to Europe that we have transposed this Bill and will have to send a copy of it off.  It would be interesting and a bit of craic to send it off with the amendment about protecting dogs and looking after dogs because it would really show what this Government amounts to in the overall scheme of things.  It would be very interesting and worthwhile.  For that reason, while I was thinking during the debate that this was not appropriate and it should not go ahead and, for the first time in my career, I was thinking I would support the Government in rejecting the amendment, now, I think I will stick with it because I think it would be worthwhile.  I would love to be there and, in fact, I would deliver the Bill to the European Commission and make sure the Commission sees it with that provision in it, if it is passed.  However, I am sure the Government will use its majority to make sure it is not passed.</p>  <p>  I am sure this is an issue of feeling for the Members who have raised it and it needs to be addressed.  It is probably a sign of how things cannot be addressed that the Members have to take the step to shoehorn this amendment into the Bill to try to get it dealt with and taken care of.  Maybe the Government's response will be that it is not an issue, and maybe the Government can explain that as well.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Bill-----</p></speech>
