    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400003#A00200"><p>I have been reluctant to raise the matter of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on Leaders' Questions before today.  I absolutely accept that everybody makes mistakes, that people learn from those mistakes and that they move on.  We wanted to give the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine every opportunity to address all of the matters concerned, to draw a line under them and to move on at a time of huge health and economic challenges, not least for the farming community.  Last week, the Minister had the opportunity to do just that by putting all of the facts on the record of the D&aacute;il in relation to his drink-driving incident but, unfortunately, he has failed to do that.  </p><p>We now have an unprecedented situation where a Minister is disputing the Garda PULSE record of a drink-driving offence he was involved in and looking to have that record changed.  Last week in his personal statement, the Minister stated he was &quot;conscious that a constant drip feed of new information can be damaging and destabilising&quot;.  He said it was for that reason he had conducted a full examination of all records that he could obtain.  Yet here we are a week later and the drip feed of new information continues.</p><p>On 4 July, according to <i>The Sunday Times</i>, contact was made with the Minister regarding the Garda record from 18 September 2016, stating that he sought to evade a Garda checkpoint on the evening of the drink-driving offence.  <i>The Irish Times</i>today quotes sources saying the Taoiseach was made aware of these records at the time of this media query, that is, the weekend before last.  Can the Taoiseach confirm when he was made aware of the Garda record of the Minister's attempt to evade a Garda checkpoint?  Was he aware of this before the Minister made his statement to the D&aacute;il?  Did the Minister discuss with the Taoiseach or seek advice from the Taoiseach regarding his decision to seek to amend the record relating to his 2016 drink-driving conviction?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister's statement to the D&aacute;il was incomplete, as it made no mention of this Garda record?  When did the Taoiseach inform his coalition partners about all of this?  Has he challenged the Minister on his incomplete statement?  Does he accept that a Minister challenging the accuracy or, indeed, the truthfulness of a Garda PULSE record is a very serious matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400003#A00300"><p>As the Deputy said, the Minister came into the D&aacute;il and publicly admitted that he was convicted of a drink-driving offence four years ago, that he was penalised for that offence and that justice was meted out in accordance with the charge and with the offence that he committed.  He adamantly denies any suggestion or implication that he sought to evade any checkpoint.  That is his very strong position.  He is very concerned that data related to his personal files have found their way to others and he feels that is a very serious issue.</p> <p>Irrespective of what side of the House we come from and irrespective of the issue here, that is an issue that will have to be dealt with at some stage.  I am aware that the Garda Commissioner has referred the issue to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and it is one we cannot ignore.  I am not apportioning blame anywhere here, because I do not know how that material left the PULSE file and ended up with various media outlets or others.  I do not know how that process happened.</p> <p> I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the weekend before last and he adamantly denied any suggestion or implication that he would have evaded or attempted to avoid a checkpoint.  At that stage, when someone says I was told, I believe a newspaper says it told my chief of staff or gave information to my chief of staff, but I cannot work on the basis of the sources of the media.  I cannot verify without seeing the document myself.  I had a lengthy conversation last evening with the Minister.  Early this morning, with the Minister's permission, I saw the actual document.</p> <p> The Minister has made it very clear to me that he wants to pursue both issues through the mechanisms that are available to him to pursue them.  First, under the data protection process and by way of the Data Protection Commission, he is entitled to seek a correction of that particular record insofar as he believes that it does not accurately convey what transpired or that implications can be taken from it which may not necessarily be the case.  He is pursuing that.  Second, he feels the entire issue has become public because of what he sees as illegal procurement of the information.  We now know that is being investigated.  The Minister feels his rights have been transgressed and undermined in that regard and he believes he is entitled to due process in respect of both issues.  He has pointed out to me that when it was first put to him - I think it was by a reporter or the media - he was very taken aback by the suggestion that he had turned away from a checkpoint.  He was very adamant about that to me.  That is why he said there was no issue made of it at the time, there was no reference to it at the time and he wants to seek to correct that aspect of it.  In that context, he was clear to me that he wants to pursue his legal rights and entitlements in that respect.</p> <p> I have kept both my colleagues in government, namely, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan, fully up to date in regard to my conversations with the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and in respect of the fact that I have seen the Garda file.  I am not at liberty to disclose it because it is not my property and it was shared with me in that context.  That is the up-to-date position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400004#B00200"><p>It is becoming clear that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, will have to come before the House and take questions on all of these issues.  However, for the purposes of today's discussion, I am more concerned with what the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, knew.  He has confirmed that he did, in fact, know about the Garda PULSE record and that there was an allegation that the Minister had sought to evade a Garda checkpoint.  He has confirmed that he knew that information as or before the Minister was making his statement.  I find it extraordinary that the Taoiseach would stand over a Minister who has made an incomplete statement to the D&aacute;il on a matter of this importance.  Were the Taoiseach's coalition partners, the leaders of Fine Gael and the Green Party, aware of the PULSE record and the allegation that the Minister had evaded a Garda checkpoint at the time the Minister, Deputy Cowen, made his statement?  The Taoiseach said he has had a conversation with the Minister, but the Taoiseach did not indicate that he challenged the Minister on the fact that his statement was incomplete.</p> <p>I accept the Minister's point on data protection.  That matter should be investigated by the appropriate authorities but it is not the net point here.  The net point is that a Minister is now contradicting a Garda record.  He came before the House to make what was to be a complete, no-holds-barred statement on all the material matters and did not state that this Garda PULSE record existed and that an allegation had been made that he had sought to evade a Garda checkpoint.  That is absolutely extraordinary.  It is even more extraordinary that the Taoiseach, as the Head of Government, would accept that.  Do the Taoiseach's coalition partners similarly accept that the Minister was right to come before the House and not give us all the information?  Do they also accept that he is right to challenge the Garda PULSE record?  It is extraordinary that a Minister is now openly contradicting the PULSE records.  This is not just about Deputy Cowen, because we all must rely on the truthfulness and accuracy of PULSE records.  The Minister has brought that accuracy into question but he has also failed to give a full account of events on that night.  The Taoiseach was aware that there was another twist in the tale and yet it seems he has not challenged the Minister on it.  Does he believe in full and frank statements to this House, or does he not?</p></speech>

I was not aware of the PULSE record and did not see it.  I cannot work on the basis of a journalist saying that he or she has a source or paper that shows X.  I saw the document myself this morning and having seen it, I can say that it is not quite as it has been portrayed.  Nonetheless, the document is there.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Cowen, was unaware of the record and exactly what it said until he got possession of it.  One can only comment on a record when one sees it.  For the last four years, he was unaware of any suggestion that this would be on the record.  That is his point of view.  I would not pre-emptively judge something until I saw the record for myself, and I did early this morning.  The Minister contacted the Garda during the week to get possession of the record because he did not have it.  Others had it before he did and that is also an issue for any individual in such a situation.  As regards his contribution to the House, he did not yet have the document and did not want to incriminate himself in relation to it.  All I can convey to the Deputy is that he has very serious concerns about how the whole thing has developed and how his own personal information was procured or disseminated from the PULSE record.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400005#C01500"><p>Last week, the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response met representatives from the Irish Primary Principals' Network and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals with regard to education provision in September.  I have been contacted by a large number of special needs assistants, SNAs, who have expressed their deep disappointment and despair that they were excluded from this session.  As the Taoiseach knows, SNAs have the closest contact with pupils in schools.  They effectively look after the most vulnerable students in schools and to exclude them from this session was wrong and deeply hurtful to the thousands of SNAs around the country.  They have asked that their opinions be taken into account with regard to the reopening of schools in September.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that he will work with the Minister for Education and Skills and ensure the views and opinions of SNAs will be taken into account when decisions are taken on reopening schools in September?</p> <p> Last weekend, more than 60 motorhomes and caravans were located in the village of Carlingford.  This was way above what is normal.  I note that yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, stated that visitors should not come to Ireland unless they restrict their movements for 14 days.  With respect, this type of advice means absolutely nothing unless it can be backed up by action.  Over the weekend, we saw many tourists from the USA out and about in our cities and towns.  I understand that in the USA, people from the state of Texas are unable to visit their neighbours because of Covid-19 restrictions, yet they can travel freely to Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House what action the Government intends to take to ensure visitors to our island respect and obey the restrictions in place?</p> <p> I congratulate the Taoiseach on getting the contractor back on the site of the national children's hospital yesterday.  Will he confirm to the House whether any additional conditions have been imposed by the contractor for its return to the site?  We are all aware that the spiralling costs of the hospital have gained worldwide attention.  As I come from a business background, I know how projects can overrun their budgets, but what has happened at the national children's hospital to date is simply not acceptable.  Can the Taoiseach inform the House of the current situation regarding costs?  Are measures being put in place to ensure costs are controlled?  Is the Taoiseach confident that the costs can be controlled for the remainder of the project?</p></speech>

On the first matter, I will of course speak to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, regarding the inclusion of representative voices for SNAs.  I think we have more than 70,000 SNAs in our system now.  Those posts sprung from an initiative I took back in 1998, when I served as Minister for Education and Science, with regard to special needs education.  The objective of the Government and of the Minister is to get as full an opening and return to school as possible near the end of August.</p><p>That relates to the Deputy's question regarding travel and behaviour.  If our number one priority is to reopen schools, and I believe everyone shares that as a priority, we must be extremely vigilant concerning social distancing, etiquette regarding washing of hands etc. and abiding by the public health advice.  Any slippage between now and the end of August could undermine our efforts to get schools open fully.</p><p>In the context of travel, there has been much commentary concerning the number of American visitors.  Our information from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is that the numbers coming in from the US are quite low.  From the outset of the pandemic, travel has never been banned officially or <i>per se</i>.  It has never been prohibited.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will be giving us advice.  It is meeting today and there will be a meeting of the Government tomorrow in respect of phase 4 of the roadmap.  There will also be further discussions about the travel issue, which will culminate in decisions on 20 July about drawing up a green list and strengthening our presence at airports and ports in respect of inward traffic.  </p><p>I have been speaking to the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  There are concerns regarding increases in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last fortnight.  Congregated indoor settings are presenting a problem and having 30 or 40 people in house parties is an issue.  We have to be very strong in respect of travel, especially regarding our messaging, with a view to keeping the rate of Covid-19 down.  That will be our objective in the coming weeks, with the overarching considerations being to get the schools open and to free our hospital capacity to get the non-Covid strands of medicine opened up.  I think I have covered that item for Deputy Fitzpatrick.</p><p>Concerning the national children's hospital, that is back now after the Covid-19 disruption.  There are ongoing issues between the contractor and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB.  The Deputy will have seen my comments on Friday.  There are mechanisms in the contract for resolving any contractual issues or any issues pertaining to claims and counterclaims.</p> <p>Those mechanisms should be used.  What is essential is that work continues in respect of building the hospital for the children of this nation.  The children of this nation need a modern hospital.  We are way behind in terms of getting that completed.  From the Government's perspective, working through the board, we want to protect the taxpayer, make sure that the contract is implemented and monitor that in a robust way.  Any issues should be resolved through the mechanisms that are provided for within the contract.</p></speech>

Only for the fact I am a pioneer I would buy you a drink.</p><p>I thank the Taoiseach because he realises that special needs assistants do a fantastic job.  It is important that their opinions and concerns are given expression.</p><p>The people of County Louth, especially the Carlingford area, are concerned about what is happening at the moment.  We see so many motor homes and the number of people coming to the Border area at the moment is high.  It is okay for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the T&aacute;naiste to make those statements, but it is important that if statements are made, action is taken.</p><p>We all need the children's hospital.  We are all talking about the children's hospital for the wrong reasons - the cost.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on getting the site back up and running but we have to keep an eye on the cost.  That is very important.</p><p>I congratulate the Taoiseach again and thank him for answering my three questions.</p></speech>

I have to put that on the record.  The board has kept the Minister informed in respect of the efforts it has been making in that regard.</p>  <p>  There will be significant domestic tourism activity this year.  That is important to weigh up.  Our travel advisory is consistent.  We are advising people not to travel abroad except for essential reasons.  As a result there has been a significant demand on domestic facilities, including hotels and so on.  Again, the message has to be that while obviously we want people to enjoy themselves during the summer, they should do so in a socially responsible way.  In this phase of Covid-19, personal responsibility is essential and is key to keeping the spread of the virus down.  It is a very dangerous virus.  What worries me is that the age profile of new cases is going down.  It is important to convey to people the serious potential long-term impact that getting this virus can have on one's health.  That is why, in all of the holiday locations across the country, people should be conscious of that and behave appropriately.</p></speech>

High-speed fibre broadband is a dream for everyone in rural Ireland, which has turned into a nightmare.  It has turned out to be a shameful legacy of Taoiseach after Taoiseach in this country.  The current Taoiseach has two and a half years to turn this around.  His leadership of the country will be measured in rural Ireland by many issues in this term but broadband will be top in most people's minds.</p>  <p>  The &euro;3 billion national broadband plan, NBP, was signed last year.  Many doubt if it will work, but that is something I have no wish to dwell on too much today.  What I want to dwell on is a solution.  We have it under our fingertips.  For once, it may not be Eir, Vodafone, Three Ireland or any of the national operators.  The solution to almost 100% of our problems is our local private wireless operators.  I will offer an example that, if worked on, can be a solution.  The Taoiseach could oversee this solution to the broadband problems in this country in his term in office.  One of these companies is DigitalForge, a fixed wireless broadband provider in west Cork.  It has been providing a service for 16 years and employs eight people.  It has provided a service in this time to thousands of homes and businesses in the county of Cork as well as to 60 schools.  This business has expanded without any State assistance whatsoever during that time.  The company has not increased the price of its standard package, which provides a 70 MB service, in 16 years.  The European minimum specification has been 30 MB.  We should remember the company started out 16 years ago offering a 1 MB service.  It has grown and continues to grow.  The company's network is resilient.  In the recent Storm Ophelia the longest outage some customers experienced was three hours while customers relying on the traditional hardwired system waited weeks for phone and broadband lines to be restored.</p> <p>The State sets the price for radio frequencies and by pricing these high, there is no allowance for competition, the recent closure of a Cork wireless operator, permaNET, being an example.  The licence goes to the highest bidder.  The State does not allocate the spectrum for smaller operators.  Prices are in the millions and smaller operators do not stand a chance.  <br/><br/>DigitalForge provided broadband to the Mealagh Valley north of Bantry when no other broadband provider could or would help.  It provided broadband to Baltimore and when eir came to town later to rich pick customers, almost all of DigitalForge's customers stayed with it because, as they said, they had a top-class service and somebody at the end of the phone who would immediately set about resolving any problems.<br/><br/>The areas I have spoken of have benefited from having DigitalForge in west Cork.  Gaggan in Bandon, Kilmacsimon in Innishannon, Sandycove in Kinsale and other areas of west Cork have little or no broadband.  Despite of all of the efforts to get the larger operators to deliver extra capacity, nothing has been delivered.<br/><br/> Will the Taoiseach sit down with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and try to create a level playing pitch by developing a two-tier solution?  I do not mean in any way to disrupt the national broadband dream, which can work away behind the scenes.  Rather, I ask that private wireless operators be given some small State assistance and recognition for being the only operators who can deliver broadband to well over 90% of rural Ireland.  In some cases, they provided 100% of the broadband to areas of rural Ireland for the first time.</p></speech>

I have no issue with sitting down with the Minister and discussing the issues he raised.  He might forward to me some further details on the company and its work.</p><p>  That said, the allocation of spectrum is a matter for proper procurement processes and so on.  It is not a process with which we can readily interfere.  If it is the Deputy's contention that the mechanism unduly disadvantages smaller operators, that is something that can be considered.  The national development plan is not one that will be working behind the scenes, as the Deputy suggested.  The programme for Government commits to an accelerated roll-out of the national broadband plan if that is possible.  The objective is to deliver it faster than within the seven-year period specified.  </p><p>Work between the Department and the company is ongoing.  There is still some work to be done in terms of improving on the timelines around the national broadband plan.  Towards the latter end of this year, the Government would like to be in a position to have the full assessment and costings available in regard to the idea of proceeding faster with the national broadband plan, if that is possible.</p><p>  I am aware of local initiatives, such as the digital hub in Skibbereen, which is a very good example of collaboration between private companies and the public interest, and incorporating a degree of philanthropy.  That example proved particularly effective in terms of being a catalyst for the generation of jobs and companies locating near the hub and in Skibbereen more widely.  I do not disagree with the Deputy about the significance of broadband and connectivity in respect of rural Ireland and enabling economic recovery in rural Ireland.  It is an essential prerequisite to enabling rural Ireland to fulfil its economic potential into the future.</p></speech>

That is the situation we have experienced in west Cork.  I did my best to steer away from the national broadband plan in my initial question as I do not want this to be the rock on which the Taoiseach will perish, like his predecessors.</p><p>  A few short months ago, the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, agreed to allow ComReg to give extra capacity to broadband and mobile phone companies to increase capacity in rural communities due to the increased numbers of people working at home because of Covid-19.  As far as I am aware, not one community in west Cork has had increased capacity.</p><p>Who is monitoring ComReg?  Is it a law unto itself?  At a conservative estimate, some 100,000 customers nationally are serviced by fixed wireless operators, which get no recognition from the State for what they do.  With Government support these numbers could double or treble.  The national scheme is spending &euro;5,000 per household to ensure services are available.  Small communities have no broadband and little chance of getting it for years, if ever.</p> <p>It is not financially viable to build infrastructure for them.  If 20 houses in a village are without broadband, the NBP will pay &euro;100,000 to get these homes serviced whereas a fixed wireless provider could do it for a fraction of that figure and in a significantly better timeframe.  The solutions offered by fixed wireless access operators are environmentally friendly.  They do not build huge masts or run miles of cables across thousands of poles and they frequently use green technologies such as wind and solar.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach consider creating this type of solution for many homes with little or no broadband in west Cork?</p></speech>

The Department is pretty clear in terms of the primacy of the national broadband plan as the route to creating proper broadband connectivity across the entirety of Ireland, particularly those areas that are not commercially viable.  I have no doubt the new Minister is open to any innovative suggestions or proposals that would accelerate provision and enable particularly remote locations to have access to high connectivity.  This would facilitate remote working, which is an objective of the Government and the programme for Government, and, as the recent Covid-19 experience has illustrated, is something that could be made more permanent in our workplace as an option and in enabling people to spend part of their week working from home.  That would be economically beneficial to certain communities and localities but connectivity is needed to enable that.  That is something we all share in the House.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Taoiseach about his commitment to developing regional growth centres and, specifically, to developing Sligo as one of those centres.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 makes many promises but the programme for Government is light on detail.  We are told the Government will develop the cities of Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway and there is mention of regional towns prospering.  We need a strong statement and I will tell the Taoiseach why we need a strong statement and strong action.  The European Commission has downgraded the northern and western region from the status of being developed to a region in transition.  As somebody who was involved in the Objective One status campaign I thought I would never see that day where we had gone backwards.</p>  <p>  According to EUROSTAT's GDP figures, in 2018, we were at 79% of the European average per person compared to the south at 235% and the east at 205%.  I acknowledge GDP has its limitations but even going back to 2014, our GDP has continued to fall comparatively.  We cannot just say there is a gap between the regions and that it is growing; it is ballooning.</p>  <p>  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly report published last November contains a load of figures.  I will only quote one or two, as I have quoted some of them to the Taoiseach previously.  Capital investment in third level education, for example, equates to &euro;141 per student in the north and west whereas it is &euro;197 nationally.  The spend on roads, both regional and local, are significantly lower.  I will not quote the figures because they will fry people's heads.  In eight of the past 11 years the spend on research and development is below the national average.  There are many more figures. </p>  <p>  I refer specifically to Sligo.  The number of Enterprise Ireland, EI, jobs in Sligo reduced by one third between 2010 and 2019 and in Leitrim by half.  The number of Industrial Development Authority Ireland, IDA, jobs, in Sligo remained the same but the national average increased by 40%.  Sligo University Hospital has 40 fewer beds than it had nine years ago.</p>  <p>  What measures will the Government take to redress that imbalance and ensure that Sligo is a regional growth centre?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400010#H00100"><p>First of all, as the Deputy will be aware, the national planning framework targets there being additional population of 160,000 to 180,000 in the north west which would give a population of approximately 1 million people by 2040.  In the here and now, Sligo is the engine room in many respects for the north west.  In my view, the entire higher education edifice in the region - the institutes of technology, along with St. Angela's College - is the key to economic regeneration there.</p>  <p>  Obviously, the move towards a technological university between Letterkenny, Sligo and Galway is important in increasing the level of research and development over time.  Critical mass is needed for research and development investments.  In Sligo, there are already strong research and development components; for example, in the robotics centre which is probably unique across the country in terms of its quality.  That is what helps to bring in foreign direct investment.  We have set up a new Department of third level education, research and science specifically for that purpose.  I was anxious that the Department would be established from a policy perspective because I think the future of the country depends on significant investment in education at all levels, particularly in third level and in fourth level research.  The move from institute of technology status to technological university status will enable over time a greater amount of research to take place.</p>  <p>  The town centre-based approach in the programme for Government is another avenue through which we want to bring back development to towns that have suffered significantly in recent times through a range of factors, including demographics, the movement of industries and the closure of certain types of industry.  There is a need for a renaissance and revitalisation of many town centres across the country, particularly in the north west.  The programme for Government identifies incentives to try to encourage people to develop buildings and residential homes within town centres.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;1 billion will be spent on rural regeneration over the next ten years.  The north west has been effective in tapping into quite a number of funding streams and has had a number of projects sanctioned arising out of such funds.  Fundamentally, we must build on our strengths in rural areas, such as the agrifood industry, biodiversity and afforestation issues such as the growing of native trees.  There will be investment in all of that, and retrofitting as well.  There will be a need to develop alternative industries that are amenable to grow in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Regionally, we need to rebalance the country.  I acknowledge there is an imbalance at present.  The programme for Government is clear that it wants to redress the current imbalance.</p></speech>

By the end of the year Sligo, Letterkenny and GMIT will make their application.  Two of the colleges are ready to go but there is an issue about the third.  It is allowed that two out of the three would go forward and the third could join when it is ready.  I want a commitment that this can happen because when I read the programme for Government, I see the south-east technological university mentioned, not once but twice.  I see the Magee campus in Derry mentioned, but I see nothing about Connacht-Ulster.  I have real concerns around that.  I want to know that once they reach the criteria, they can go ahead.</p>  <p>  I heard what the Taoiseach said about the different programmes.  They are all important but we need investment in our services, we need incentives and we need a 40-bed unit in our hospital.  The Taoiseach mentioned the &euro;1 billion for rural investment but we need significant real investment in those areas where we can play to our strengths.  It has not happened.  I want to hear a commitment from the Taoiseach that it will happen and, specifically, over the next number of months, how it will happen.</p></speech>

Quite a few of the delays to date have not originated at central government level but rather, as the Deputy will appreciate, while getting local entities and the various stakeholders, including the institutions, ready or persuaded to do it.  The south east is one such area.  This is why there are repeated references to it.  It has been on the agenda for quite some time.  There is a commitment to progress this project and to get it over the line.  The merger in Munster between the institutes in Tralee and Cork has effectively occurred.  The Dublin merger happened first.  Time is ticking.  Once a programme is decided upon, as this one was a number of years ago, it should be followed through.</p>  <p>  I will talk to the Minister for Health in respect of the Sligo hospital.  The Minister and I met HSE representatives last week with regard to the winter initiative and the need to prepare and plan properly for this winter, more so than any other, because we will be living with Covid-19, which will place an extra strain on our healthcare facilities and hospitals as we approach a new flu season.  I am particularly worried about that.  Any extra capacity that can be brought into the system should be brought in as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach knew that the statement the Minister, Deputy Cowen, made to the D&aacute;il was incomplete.  Astonishingly, he has attempted to justify the Minister's lack of candour before the House.  It is now very clear that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, needs to come before the D&aacute;il to make a statement and to take questions.  A senior Cabinet Minister challenging the accuracy or truthfulness of the PULSE records of the Garda is a very serious matter.  A senior Cabinet Minister attempting to evade a Garda checkpoint while behind the wheel of a car and having consumed alcohol is a very serious matter.  These are matters of public concern.  It is now imperative that the Minister come before the D&aacute;il to make a full statement and to take questions.</p></speech>

That was a mistake.  The consequence of this was a drip feed of information, which is precisely what the Minister said would be damaging.  The information which emerged over the weekend is very serious for the two reasons.  The first is that the record itself describes a supposed attempt to evade a checkpoint and the second is that the Minister has made the very serious assertion that this record is incorrect.  Earlier, the Taoiseach seemed to imply that he was not aware of that record at the time of the Minister's statement last week.  He was aware.  He may not have seen the record but he had been informed of its existence.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was aware at the time of the statement by the Minister, Deputy Cowen.

I wrote to the Business Committee this morning stating that tomorrow or on another day this week, there will need to be statements on foot of the ruling, which will come out tomorrow, of the General Court of the European Union on the Apple tax case.  This is not a small matter.  We will get a ruling tomorrow as to whether the decision of the European Commission to award Revenue &euro;13 billion in unpaid taxes plus interest from Apple will be upheld.  Regrettably, the previous Government, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, appealed that decision and supported Apple rather than taking the &euro;13 billion we need.  Whatever about the previous Government, in the context of Covid and its costs, and when we are looking at a bill for this country of up to &euro;20 billion, it would be nothing short of economic treason to appeal a decision that awards those tax revenues to this country when we need them desperately to cover the bill for the Covid crisis.  We need to hear, as do the people of this country, from the Government this week, immediately after that ruling.  I hope it will tell us it will not further support Apple in its efforts to avoid paying taxes of such magnitude owed to this country, taxes which could transform our economic and financial situation fundamentally.  That is what I believe should happen, and the Government should agree because this is too serious a matter with implications too enormous for this country.</p></speech>

There have been two attempts to change the business.  I appreciate that Members are entitled to do that.</p>  <p>  By the way, the &euro;13 billion would not be available even if there were a decision to uphold the Commission's position.  The Government's position is not to support anybody or any company other than to say this was not state aid and that the independence and credibility of our Revenue cannot be undermined.  The idea that the &euro;13 billion will be available next week is just not true and is a dishonest presentation of the situation.  The Deputy can take it that whatever happens, and I do not know what will happen with the decision, the money is not readily available to Ireland.  I think there will be others in the queue.  Of course, nothing can be accessed until the full appeals mechanisms are exhausted.  There is a potential appeal by another party to this that would basically mean that no one could access the funding.</p>  <p>  That said, I would have no issue with a debate on the Apple ruling.</p> <p>It should be an informed debate.  I am not sure how lengthy the judgment will be tomorrow and how ready the D&aacute;il will be to have a meaningful debate on it tomorrow or Thursday.  We should have an informed debate on it.  I would welcome that and I do not see any issue, but there is an exhaustive legislative programme here and the reason for that legislative programme is to underpin the economic recovery and to deal with Covid, particularly getting as much assistance as we can to small businesses and medium-sized companies in the economy through the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020 and other Bills.</p></speech>

Can I take it that the proposal for dealing with Wednesday's business is agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Thursday's business agreed to?  Agreed.  On the Order of Business, I am conscious that we have only 18 minutes now.  I call Deputy McDonald.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400015#P01400"><p>When I raised with the Taoiseach last week the need to extend maternity leave and benefit by 12 weeks for mothers and parents affected by the Covid-19 crisis, he said the matter was complicated and complex but that the Government would do the right thing.  Yesterday, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced a three-week extension to parental leave to be brought in next year under budget 2021.  I put it to the Taoiseach that that is too little and too late.  Those new mothers and families that need the additional breathing space and support of 12 additional weeks of maternity leave and benefit need action now.  They are not in a position to wait until next year for some of that relief.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to support the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion that will be brought forward and more than that to act as a Government and live up to the Taoiseach's commitment to do the right thing.  The right thing is to afford 12 extra weeks to these woman, their babies and their families.</p></speech>

That is to give parents who gave birth during the Covid period an opportunity to avail of the scheme.  The pre-existing scheme was somewhat limited and could have excluded them.  The proposal Deputy McDonald put forward in terms of paternity benefit would have required further social welfare and justice legislation and would have had to be retrospective, which would have been complex enough.  Also, the benefit of this proposal is that it is consistent and in line with policy positions that Government had adopted and the Oireachtas had agreed to in respect of parents' leave.</p>  <p>  There are other groups out there as well.  If one takes the totality of the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy, there is a substantive range of supports helping people in different groupings and different situations.</p></speech>

We also have real issues coming down the line regarding trolley numbers in acute hospitals.  The numbers released today by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation in relation to trolley numbers are scary.  The total number is 166.  In relation to University Hospital Limerick, the number is 56.  The Minister is now silent on this issue despite making a range of huge commitments on it prior to being appointed.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about this?  We are in the middle of a pandemic.  We need leadership as to how we ensure we can cope over the coming months with Covid and non-Covid illnesses, particularly in relation to acute settings and trolley numbers.  Commitments have been made.  The Minister seems to be missing.  What will the Taoiseach do?</p></speech>

It is three and a half years since the Health Products Regulatory Authority recommended that a medical cannabis programme be set up.  Last year, the law was changed in this country.  For the first time, medical practitioners could legally prescribe medical cannabis.  Since then, not one person has been prescribed medical cannabis unless they go through the licensing system.  As the Taoiseach knows, this system is extremely bureaucratic and those people have to go to Holland and so forth.  Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that this programme, which is in the programme for Government, will be commenced as soon as possible?</p></speech>

I also told the Taoiseach about a constituent of mine whose daughter is getting chemotherapy and has to pay &euro;250 per session.  The Taoiseach gave a commitment that himself and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, would look into the situation.  He used a very strong word and said that no private hospital should be profiteering.  I agree with him.  I got a phone call yesterday from another constituent of mine.  She went to a private hospital which I will not name and she has to go for an operation on 27 July.  The consultant told her yesterday she might need as many as three Covid tests.  Can I go back to my constituent and tell her not to worry, that the fee will not be there on 27 July?  The Taoiseach made a commitment last week.  Did he or the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, or anybody tackle or visit the private hospitals to do away with this fee?</p></speech>

However, I reiterate what I said last week, namely, that there should be no profiteering out of the Covid situation in respect of any patients, be they private or public.  Private hospitals should not be levying charges that are disproportionate to the costs of providing those services and which are basically unfair to patients.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is communicating that view to the private hospitals.</p></speech>

I note the comment by the deputy chief medical officer that there is a week to decide on this matter.  The Civil Service can work for a while in splendid isolation from economic realities or at least until the economy cannot afford to pay their salaries.  For small businesses, however, there are preparations to be made, including getting in new stock.  Many of these pubs are family-run businesses and the owners have to make arrangements for their families.  They need to know in advance what is happening.  We cannot tell them on Monday morning that they can open at 10 a.m. that day.</p>  <p>  When will the statutory instrument that will govern this issue be published?  Thus far, we have had relevant statutory instruments published two or three days after they come into effect.  That does not amount to the rule of law because one cannot regulate one's behaviour in accordance with something that is not published and we cannot prosecute somebody for not adhering to something they cannot even see.  When will the statutory instrument be published so that people can have certainty as to what is happening?</p></speech>

I have been contacted by numerous publicans expressing their frustration and worry concerning the lack of advice provided to them on what they must do to prepare or whether they will be opening at all.  I understand that public safety is paramount and we must do everything in our power to safeguard it.  However, we need a concrete plan for publicans setting out what they must do to reopen and what guidelines they must abide by to ensure public safety remains the top priority.</p></speech>

Stocks needed to be ordered yesterday if they are to open next Monday.  Some publicans took the gamble by ordering but more did not because they do not know where they stand.  We seem to have completely forgotten that there are 50,000 jobs on the line.  Pub owners need clarity as to whether they can open their doors.  That is what I am hearing from every publican in west Cork.  I am pleading with the Taoiseach to give them that clarity and let them order their stock and reopen their businesses.  We should bear in mind that if we have one or two pubs opening at one end of the street and none at the other end, we will have a congestion of people at the first end.  If we instead allow all the pubs in a town to open, that will at least spread out the numbers.</p></speech>

While pub and shop owners, families and everyone else have suffered, people continue to be allowed into the country from abroad.  The Taoiseach said earlier that the people are law abiding and that is, of course, true.  However, they are also furious at what is happening at the ports and airports.  The Taoiseach knows, because he was there, that I have been asking NPHET, Dr. Holohan and others, from the very start, about the ports and airports remaining open.  Deputy Shortall asked how many personnel had been assigned to those locations but she was not given an answer.  The Government was trying to fool the Irish people.  We are expected to take all the medicine while, at the same time, people from areas with scary Covid numbers are let into the country by aeroplane.  The Taoiseach is saying that the number involved is limited but it is not fair to business people, publicans, shop owners and their families that they are being treated in this way.  Pub owners need to know when they can open.  Above all, if we do not seal the airports and stop people coming in from abroad, the results will be tragic.</p></speech>

In terms of the reopening under phase 4 of the roadmap, there will be a Government meeting tomorrow to discuss it.  NPHET is meeting today and will give us its up-to-date advice.  I am taken by some of the points made by Deputies McNamara, Cahill, Michael Collins and Mattie McGrath in terms of a rules-based approach sometimes being far more effective.  I said earlier that what is of more danger than anything is a situation where we have 30 or 60 people at a house party or parties taking place on certain roads in our cities, and we will have to do something about that.  I am making the same point that Deputies Collins and Cahill were making that where there are rules, behaviour follows.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that while its members did have some challenging experiences the weekend before last in identifying breaches under Operation Navigation, the large majority of premises were compliant.  The reports this weekend likewise suggest a large degree of compliance with the rules.  That said, there are other issues arising in terms of the virus itself and its activity levels, and all of that has to be taken in the round.  We will get the advice today and will make a decision tomorrow.  I am taken by the point regarding the need to give people notice and allow them time to prepare.  I accept that point.</p></speech>

There is a specific reference on page 28 to the expected impact of increased premium levels.  I want to tell the Taoiseach about a constituent of mine who contacted me over the weekend.  He is 21 years of age and has a full driving licence with no penalties or associated convictions whatsoever.  His insurance quote is a staggering &euro;4,450.  We are not talking about a Subaru Impreza or a high-powered car here; the insurance is for a van which the young man needs for his work, which is at a small business that is looking to expand.  Unfortunately, that is the quote he has been given.  Can the Taoiseach give an assurance to this young man and to the thousands of young people who are looking to the Government for help and support with their car insurance?  The price my constituent is being asked to pay is absolutely appalling.</p></speech>

It is not sustainable for a young man going into business to take a cost like that on board.  Such costs militate against young people becoming entrepreneurs, getting into business and going out to work.  The programme for Government sets out a multipronged approach to dealing with insurance, both on the personal injuries side and in terms of making sure there is fair competition.  We will be tackling the insurance issue on a number of fronts.</p></speech>

The case I want to talk about concerns a retained firefighter with 12 years' service, based in Dundalk, who has been working for the Revenue service.  He has been told that from Monday, he can no longer engage in his life-saving work as a firefighter.  Back in September 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform facilitated a local arrangement that allowed firefighters to continue working for Revenue.  While this individual was on call, he always made up his hours, worked both of his jobs perfectly and never let either side down.  We cannot expect private employers to facilitate a necessary life-saving service like this when we have a public employer failing to facilitate it.  We are talking about a firefighter who, with his colleagues, has dealt with some of the major fires in the Cooley Peninsula and some of the very serious arson attacks in Dundalk.</p></speech>

Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; an t-&aacute;dh libh.  The Taoiseach was previously Minister for Health and his legacy in my county of Monaghan is that he was one of a successive line of Ministers who oversaw the removal of services from our local hospital.  In view of the Covid-19-related restrictive measures that will have to be applied at emergency departments in Drogheda and Cavan and in hospitals throughout the State, will the Taoiseach ensure that the Government reviews the services that are offered and services that have been removed at hospitals?  We should be aiming for a restoration and development of services such as accident and emergency services at hospitals like Monaghan.</p></speech>

I remember the decisions made by the North Eastern Health Board and we have come a long way in medicine since then.  Very often now, it is the colleges of the various clinical specialties which determine the critical mass that justifies and sustains, for example, a maternity unit or an emergency department.</p> <p>Gone are the days when politicians claim we should have an emergency department without any reference to the medical wherewithal that is required to sustain it and make it safe.  That is an ongoing battle between the political world and the medical world as medicine advances.  That said, our aim for acute and emergency cover in the north west, particularly with Covid-19, is to do everything we possibly can to develop capacity within respective hospitals, and short-term capacity in particular, because there will be pressure on emergency departments.  We cannot operate at 95% occupancy during the flu season with the potential of Covid with us as well and, therefore, the HSE is looking at how it can either procure or develop capacity quickly in certain locations to enable it to deal with the urgency of the next six to nine months. </p></speech>

This report has been further supplemented by the publication of the NEIC strategic plan 2020 to 2022, which is available on<i>www.neic.ie</i></p><p>In June 2017, the Government appointed an independent chairperson to the NEIC programme implementation board.  Members of the board include representatives from relevant Departments and agencies, business and the local community.  The board is assisted in its work by six subgroups: enhancing policing; maximising education, training and employment opportunities; family well-being; enhancing community well-being and the physical landscape; substance use, misuse, inclusion and health; and alignment of services.</p><p>The board and its subgroups continue to meet on a monthly basis to oversee and progress the implementation of the Mulvey report and the next strategic plan for 2020 to 2022.  Officials from my Department work closely with the board, the subgroups and the dedicated programme office based on Sean McDermott Street.  The chairperson of the board reports to an oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  This group, which has met 11 times, ensures strong and active participation by all relevant Departments and agencies and deals with any barriers or issues highlighted by the board.  The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will provide political oversight of the NEIC initiative.</p><p>The Government is committed to supporting and investing in the north-east inner city community and ensuring that the board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfil its ambition.  To this end, the Government made available &euro;6.5 million in funding for the initiative in 2020.  Some highlights of what the board has delivered to date include an increased Garda presence in the area, with the Garda community support van, supporting a focus on community policing, particularly throughout the Covid-19 pandemic; funding provided for establishing a Garda project focused on drug-related intimidation, which commenced in the area, continues to have positive effects; a full-time intercultural development co-ordinator was employed for the NEIC; continued operation of Ireland's first social inclusion hub in the NEIC; funding provided for the homeless case management team and a residential stabilisation programme.  Funding was also provided to a career local employment action partnership, LEAP, which supports young jobseekers into work placements and employment, as well to establish the City Connects programme and a local early learning initiative.  A green ribbon project was rolled out for environmental clean-up and litter prevention in partnership with local residents, and a comprehensive programme of sport and well-being activities has continued to support local people even throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Progress reports on the NEIC initiative are available on <i></i>for 2017, 2018 and 2019.  The Government remains committed to supporting and investing in the north-east inner city community and in ensuring that the chairperson and programme implementation board have the necessary resources to help make the area a better place in which to work and live.</p></reply>

He will recall that lives had been lost, the community, including children, was traumatised by the incidents they had been witnessed and at the time there, was an understanding that there had to be an intervention that was wider than a policing or criminal justice response.  That response had to be holistic, progressive and recognise the history and the reality of intergenerational poverty and the very specific social circumstances of the north-east inner city.  By the way, I do not argue that the inner city of Dublin is unique in that regard; sadly, it is not.</p>  <p>  I argue at this stage for a review of this initiative.  I had hoped to hear more energy and commitment in the Taoiseach's response to this issue.  This should never turn into a box-ticking exercise or something on which there is routine reporting.  If we get this initiative right in the inner city of Dublin, then we will have the potential to get it right elsewhere as well.  First, we have to establish if the approach being adopted is working.  Is the project making a substantive difference to the lives and generations of the people who live in the inner city?  </p>  <p>  I was struck last week when I was listening to the Taoiseach talking about drug use and misuse.  He very correctly spoke of things such as resilience, self-confidence and respect, all those things to which we all subscribe.  What was missing from his analysis, however, was any real appreciation or recognition that poverty is systemic, that inequality is toxic and that communities in which generation after generation suffer deprivation and marginalisation will experience real consequences.  One of the consequences that can be measured is drug addiction and drug misuse.  We, therefore, need to review this initiative.  The boundaries of the project need to encapsulate the north-west inner city as well the north-east inner city.  Critically, we need to go to the community, measure and ask if this project is making a difference and what needs to change and what needs to be enhanced.  </p>  <p>  The Government is commited to supporting and investing in the north east inner city community and in ensuring that the board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfill its ambitions.  To this end, the Governmetn has made available &euro;6.5 million in funding for the initiative in 2020.  Some highlights of what the board has delivered to date in 2020 include:  increased Garda presence in the area, the Garda community support van supporting a focus on community policing, particularly throughout the Covid-19 pandemic; funding was provided to establish a Garda project focused on drugs-related intimidation, which commenced in the area and continues to have positive benefits; a full-time intercultural development co-ordinator employed for the NEC; continued operation in the NEC of Ireland's first social inclusion hub; funding provided for the homeless case management team; funding provided for residential stablilisation programme; funding provided to local career leap supporting young jobseeker's into work placements and in employemtn; and funding provided to establish the city connects programmes; funding provided to the local early learning initiative; a green ribbon project rolling out environmental clean-up and litter prevention, in partnership with local residents; and a comprehensive programme of sport and well-being activities that has continued to support local -</p></speech>

All my life I have been committed to the idea of dealing with the vulnerable, those living in poor conditions and those in disadvantaged communities.  For example, I believe the RAPID programme of earlier years was an effective multisectoral multidepartmental approach to dealing with urban disadvantage and urban issues.  The forerunner of that programme, the drugs task force areas programme, likewise took a holistic approach to development within particular communities with some success.  Education and early intervention at childcare level and in the early years of primary education were the key with higher resources being allocated to the pupil-teacher ratio in schools in such areas.  Now the DEIS programme has replaced all of that.  Our party introduced DEIS some time ago to target resources where they were most needed and most effective.</p>  <p>  I will talk to the board about the idea of commissioning a review.  In addition, the new Minister with responsibility for community affairs will be looking at this in terms of the broader application of this model to other areas.</p>  <p>  One area we need to integrate into this programme is housing.  I remember touring the area with Senator Mary Fitzpatrick and meeting all the groups.  There is a need to look at the housing part of this to assist the local community as part of the wider level of supports that are available.  The Secretary General of my Department chairs the oversight group.  The chairperson and the board report on a regular basis to the Secretary General, so we are keeping a close eye on this with a view to ensuring the 54 actions are implemented.</p></speech>

I am keen to acknowledge the substantial amount of work done by the board and I commend those involved on it.  Nevertheless, this review has to be about the community.  It has to be about the people who live in the kind of atrocious housing conditions that the Taoiseach has himself witnessed.  Should the Taoiseach go into any of these blocks of flats and ask himself whether this is how our citizens should be living in 2020, the clear answer would be "No".  Poor housing is not only a consequence of disadvantage and poverty, but it is also a driver of further inequality and marginalisation.  I have lost count of the number of homes and flats I have been in that do not have room for a kitchen table or a place for the children to do their homework or for the family to eat a meal.  That is scandalous in 2020.  That needs to be wired in.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to another thing that should concern him - it certainly concerns me.  Goal 4 of the national drug and alcohol strategy sets out the importance of enabling communities to participate in the shaping of decisions that affect them.  Community participation is critical to driving interventions and solutions.  In the north inner city the HSE is actively undermining this.  In fact, the HSE is acting to remove participation workers from the north-east and north-west inner city.  I cannot overstate how wrong this decision is and I ask the Taoiseach to examine it.  I will write to him on the specifics of it.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and prevent that from happening?</p></speech>

I will talk to the Minister for Health on the point she has made and on what she was saying.  I am unsure of the background.  Deputy McDonald is suggesting that the HSE is undermining community participation.  We will get that looked at.</p>  <p>  I have gone into some of the flat complexes with Senator Mary Fitzpatrick.  I agree with Deputy McDonald that the conditions were poor and tight with no space.  There were significant levels of respiratory conditions.  I remember coming out of the Greek Street flats one day and looking across at modern student accommodation.  The contrast was stark although some of that is historical.  I will talk to the Minister with responsibility for housing on that and to Dublin City Council to discuss the various programmes on refurbishing and improving the quality of living conditions in some of the complexes that I visited.  Without question there is room for improvement there.  I will talk to the Secretary General about a review of the overall plan for the north-eastern inner city and how we can add to it.</p></speech>

They are not captured by the catchment area.  I am not saying this to catch out the Taoiseach at all.  I am simply raising it to reiterate the point about the catchment area for the north-east and north-west inner city.  A line was arbitrarily drawn.  I hope that as part of the review which I hope will be commissioned, those responsible look at the boundaries and accept a north inner city area of Dublin without artificial distinctions that are not helpful to landing on the right solutions.</p></speech>

The details of the roles and staffing of these offices have not been finalised to date.  Appointments to these offices will be made in line with the Public Service Management Act 1997 and will be published in due course.  These include the establishment of an office of the T&aacute;naiste and an office of the leader of the Green Party within the Department of the Taoiseach to be located in Government Buildings.  The office of the T&aacute;naiste will consist of a private office and a policy and programme implementation unit.  The purpose of these offices is to support both the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party in the co-ordination and implementation of policy within the Government.  In particular, the policy and programme implementation unit will assist the T&aacute;naiste in work relating to the Cabinet, Cabinet committees and oversight of the implementation of the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Public Service Management Act 1997, Ministers and Ministers of State who regularly attend Cabinet meetings may appoint special advisers.  The Act also provides that other Ministers of State may also appoint a special adviser.  The requirement for specialist policy input and advice is a matter for each Minister to consider having regard to the area of responsibility and the support in place in the relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  Having appointed Ministers and Ministers of State to their various portfolios across the Government, I am also considering the advisory supports I might need in my role as Taoiseach and Head of Government.  While I have not yet fully finalised the make-up of my team, it currently consists of a chief of staff at deputy secretary level, a deputy chief of staff at assistant secretary level and three special advisers at principal officer level.  It is also my intention to appoint an adviser shortly with relevant expertise on economic policy.  While not finalised, I anticipate that, in addition to Civil Service support, the office of the T&aacute;naiste will consist of approximately five or six special advisers and the office of the leader of the Green Party will consist of approximately four or five special advisers.  In line with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997 there will be two special advisers assigned to the Office of the Government Chief Whip.  It should be noted that all of the above appointments are subject to Government approval and relevant contracts.  Statements of qualifications and statements of relationship will be laid before the Oireachtas in due course.</p></reply>

However, I would caution that too many cooks can spoil the broth, as they say.  It strikes me that this is a most irregular arrangement.  Not alone will the T&aacute;naiste have an office within the Department of An Taoiseach, but we will now have an office of the leader of the Green Party within the Department of An Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has set out considerable resources.  He referred to five or six special advisers for the T&aacute;naiste.  I presume that is by way of addition to whatever resources the T&aacute;naiste will have in his line Department.  The Taoiseach might clarify that.  It is similar for the leader of the Green Party.  Is that additional to the resources afforded to him as a senior Minister?  Are there additional press resources for the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party as well?</p> <p>Critically, what is all of this costing?  How does this compare with previous Administrations?  <br/><br/>The Taoiseach has appointed 20 Ministers of State, three of whom will sit at Cabinet.  I understand, however, there are only two salaries.  How will that particular loaves-and-fishes exercise work out?  Who is going to lose out in that scenario?  The Taoiseach might make that clear for us.<br/><br/> By way of final comment, I understand that responsibility for the coherence and overseeing of the implementation of the programme for Government falls to the Cabinet as a whole.  I am very concerned that we now have a holy trinity of taoisigh, or at least a holy trinity of very senior actors, located in the Department of the Taoiseach at considerable expense to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

However, there is no transparency.  I respect the fact that he has not yet made some decisions, but there seems to be an incredible number of advisers.  There will be three people in the Office of the Taoiseach and in the T&aacute;naiste's office as well.</p>  <p>  It is, frankly, a joke that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will cost the taxpayer &euro;200,000 because he wants, of all things, a head of protocol and a Garda car and driver.  We are going through a pandemic and an economic crash, the likes of which we have never seen.  I was part of a Government that picked up the pieces of what happened in 2011.  The Taoiseach could look back on some of the comments he made during that time on Ministers, advisers etc.</p>  <p>  None of the 20 Ministers of State can have advisers.  It would be wrong to put taxpayers through that.  I do not have an issue with Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet having advisers.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out in the last D&aacute;il, unless the Taoiseach introduces new legislation, which I am sure he will not do, only two Ministers of State can get the extra &euro;16,288.</p>  <p>  How many advisers will there be for the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Green Party leader?  Will the Taoiseach cut the extra &euro;200,000 that is going to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?  Will he commit that Ministers of State who do not sit at Cabinet will not have advisers, given that they are totally unnecessary in the current economic climate?</p></speech>

They want to see through the political commitments that have been made.  That was a major turning point in how Government works in terms of the use of special advisers.  In the Northern Ireland Executive, the role of special advisers is strong and I have no difficulty with that.  We know that special advisers in Northern Ireland play a key role in advising Ministers and working the machinery of government.</p>  <p>  Not all of the advisers will be political.  Some of them will have expertise in economics or other specific areas.  My advisers have been allocated based on particular policy areas.  One innovation of the new Government is the reintroduction of some substantive Cabinet committees to work through key areas and objectives of Government, including housing, health and climate change.  </p>  <p>  Other Cabinet sub-committees, such as that dealing with economic recovery, will meet on a monthly basis to bring a more cross-sectoral and cross-departmental approach to the business of Government.  That is why there will be advisers for each party.  This approach is to ensure cohesion, genuine partnership and parity of esteem within Government.  It is not about one party lording it over another.  I have made that very clear from the beginning. </p>  <p>  The last Government had, for example, advisers for the Independent Alliance and for an Independent Minister.  It had 19 Ministers of State, and this Government has one more.  That is hardly earth-shattering.</p></speech>

There is a need and Government is becoming wide-ranging.  There are areas, such as insurance, that need specialist attention.  As we heard on the Order of Business, it is a key area and it is a good idea to have a Minister of State, together with senior Ministers, specifically charged with trying to deal with that area.</p>  <p>  That is the position.  When we get further details we will put them out transparently.  All of this information will be in the public domain.  I will have further details on how advisers will overlap in terms of the line Departments for which the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister with responsibility for climate action and Environment have responsibility.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste having, in addition to his departmental advisers, five or six additional advisers in order that he can fulfil his duties as T&aacute;naiste strikes me as absolutely extraordinary.  For the leader of the Green Party to have four or five additional advisers, as the Taoiseach said, is similarly extraordinary.  Nobody is against bringing expertise to the table; on the contrary.  We have to be very sure that things are not being over-egged and that this is not a case of sharing the spoils between the three parties in this tripartite Government.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach explain to me why the T&aacute;naiste needs an aide-de-camp?  What is the thinking behind that?  As the T&aacute;naiste is not the Taoiseach, or at least not yet, why would he require that?  I do not understand it and the Taoiseach should give an explanation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly has correctly raised issues concerning the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Where there is this kind of additionality in terms of resources, Members and, more importantly, the taxpayer need an explanation as to why all of this is happening.  The Taoiseach might answer my question on the Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet.  There are two salaries, but three such Ministers of State.  The maths of that does not really add up.  Is the Taoiseach going to bring in a third &euro;16,000 allowance?</p></speech>

Will Ministers of State have advisers?  They did not when the economy collapsed in 2011, and we are probably in a worse situation now.  The Taoiseach does not agree with that now because it does not suit him.  However, we can go back through the record if he wants to do that.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;80,000 multiplied by 20 is not a good use of taxpayers' money.  How are we to vet the advisers for Ministers and the Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet, something I do not have an issue with?  They are meant to be specialist advisers.  How will we know they are qualified?  How can we vet them to ensure they are not political appointees and are instead specialists in insurance and various different disciplines?</p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of the aide-de-camp for the T&aacute;naiste.  It is a joke.  It is an extra cost.  Why is it necessary?  We still do not know the total number of advisers for the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party.  We will get to that. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has to answer my question on Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet.  Why is the Minister for Foreign and Affairs and Trade getting a Garda driver and car?  Why is this extra cost to the taxpayer, along with the aide-de-camp for the T&aacute;naiste, being tolerated by the Taoiseach given the current economic situation?  I do not believe we can have either of those or advisers to Ministers of State. </p> <p>If the Taoiseach wants to show example and show leadership he will not have any of them.  Their total cost is a serious amount, coming to a seven figure sum, and the Taoiseach cannot justify it. </p></speech>

I recall Deputy Howlin and the then T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Dick Spring, won a substantial number of seats.  They no longer wanted to play second fiddle to the Fine Gael party and did not go into coalition with them.  They entered into coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il and developed this idea.  We are political parties, and I do not mean political in the sense that one is just making appointments; we are parties that want to get policies implemented.  There must be proper respectful demarcation lines between full-time permanent civil servants and full-time political programmes and political input.  That was the idea at the time and it worked.  Sinn F&eacute;in are no strangers to special advisers in Northern Ireland.  We saw that in the RHI report.</p></speech>

The emails were flying to and fro on that between all the special advisers of all parties so let us not pretend that this is something new.  Ministers of State either mean something or they do not mean.  In my view, they mean something in terms of the policy areas that are under their responsibility.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability will transfer to the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is a substantive Minister of State portfolio because all of the relevant areas in health to do with disability are being delegated to that Minister of State.</p></speech>

The plan will put sustainability at the heart of our fiscal, enterprise, innovation and environmental policies.  As part of the development of the new national economic plan, my Department will lead a high-level review of the economy.  This review will seek to identify the sectors that have the greatest opportunity to grow and sustain quality employment in the future.  It will be an opportunity to consider, along with relevant Departments and sectors, how Ireland can adapt to a very changed global economy.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment has been established and first met on Wednesday, 8 July.  The terms of reference of the committee are to oversee the implementation of programme for Government commitments aimed at sustainable economic recovery, investment and job creation.  The committee will operate in accordance with established guidelines for Cabinet committees and substantive issues will be referred to Government for discussion and approval.  The Cabinet committee&rsquo;s immediate focus is the development of proposals for a July jobs initiative in line with the commitments in the programme for Government.  This will have a short-term focus on jobs as a first step towards the longer-term national economic plan to follow in the autumn.</p></reply>

If I understand it correctly, there will be a rotation between the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party.  Will the Taoiseach set that out, and the basis upon which these committees were allocated to each of them?</p>  <p>  I refer to the high-level review of the economy.  This is to be led by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, yet the T&aacute;naiste is chairing the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  I would like to know how those meet and marry.  I would also like to know who is in charge when it comes to the economy, economic planning and all of that lift that needs to be made.  The T&aacute;naiste has the line Ministry.  He chairs this Cabinet committee, his party colleague is in the Department of Finance and so on.  Is the Taoiseach answerable to them or is he, as Head of Government, in charge of this critical part of policy and this initiative?</p></speech>

As regards the make-up of the committee, the Taoiseach might give further detail as to who will be involved.  He keeps talking about specialists.  Will he bring in specialists to sit on this committee?  When I sat on Cabinet committees, specialists were brought in.  The Taoiseach seems to have a new thematic analysis of everything so I presume he will bring in people all the time.  Will he supply us with the details in this regard?</p>  <p>  The July stimulus will be the key deliverable from this committee from day one.  What quantum will be spent on that?  I do not expect the Taoiseach to go into the detail of the stimulus now but it would be rather unfortunate and it would not look good if he did not know the quantum he will spend on it.  Covid-19 has been a disruptor across a range of areas but that can deliver some positive change despite everything.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s feeling on new economic modelling that we can be generated from this?  How will hope be given to young people, in particular, and how will economic inequality be reduced?  How will it be ensured that as part of this process, through that restructuring and that disruptor effect, those who get a stimulus from this will respect the industrial architecture of the State and the various processes and the decisions we have made in regard to protecting people&rsquo;s incomes, in particular those in low-paid jobs or in the gig economy?</p></speech>

I emphasise again that three parties came together.  My overall objective is to ensure the three parties work seamlessly and in co-operation in getting the work of the nation done, and I take that very seriously.  My ego is not going to get in the way of doing the right thing.  We agreed we would share the chairing of various Cabinet committees.  I am keen to have Cabinet committees established to follow through on the implementation of the programme for Government.  I have been in government previously and if committees are well organised, they can work very effectively in pulling different Departments together to get things done.  My Department tends to be the Department in government that pulls the different Departments together, in particular its economic division.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, will chair the Cabinet committee on economic recovery.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, will chair the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change.  I am chairing a range of other committees dealing with Covid, housing, health, social affairs and equality committee, education and European affairs.  The European committee will meet before every EU Council to bring a cross-departmental approach to it, and in relation to Brexit and Northern Ireland.  There is a Government co-ordination committee involving myself, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, leader of the Green Party.  The structure is designed to enable Government to work with respect to the three parties in a seamless and effective way.  That is the objective of the exercise.</p> <p> Regarding the economy generally and the July jobs stimulus, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance have key roles and will do much of the running in taking ideas from other Departments in respect of the July stimulus.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will have the difficult task of making decisions on what will make the cut - one will excuse the word "cut" as it is the wrong word in this case because this is-----</p></speech>

I refer to the projects that will be identified and prioritised, the key as well being the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy on which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has ideas.</p>  <p>  I will not give Deputy Kelly the final quantum today because that will be announced on the day and work is still under way.  There will be a further Cabinet committee meeting tomorrow evening, specifically in respect of the July stimulus.  Various ideas and submissions have come in from different Departments.  The focus is on trying to get shovel-ready projects and endeavouring to get credit and funding to the SME sector in particular.  That is why much of the legislation this month will work in tandem with the July stimulus.  A great deal of good legislation is getting done this month thanks to the co-operation of everybody in the House, which we appreciate.  That will underpin much work that is contained within the July stimulus as well.</p></speech>

We are discussing the Chairs of the committee.  That is implicit.</p>  <p>  That is a strange tripartite division of labour.  It seems that Fine Gael will have its fingerprints all over the economic strategy and approach of this Government.  That is not something I welcome.  That certainly is not something that working people across this State will welcome because they all know from bitter experience what that will amount to.  Whatever about the initial flurry and rhetoric about stimulus, we know ultimately who Fine Gael will protect and whose interests it will advance when things get tight, and I assure the Taoiseach it is not the working families the length and breadth of this land.</p>  <p>  This Government co-ordination committee brings the three wise men, or otherwise, together.  It strikes me that the Taoiseach has an awful lot of apparatus of government.  I accept the need for expertise, but this looks clumsy.  It looks like perhaps the Taoiseach's partners in government cannot accept that he is, in fact, the Head of Government and he is in charge.  I say this because we need somebody to be in charge.  The job of Taoiseach cannot be contracted or subdivided between different political actors.  That, I say in all seriousness, is not an approach that will bring cohesion; that is an approach that will bring confusion and that, it strikes me, is born of rivalry rather than any strong co-operation.  The body charged with good governance and overseeing the programme for Government is the Cabinet as a unit in a collective fashion.</p></speech>

This will not work.  There will be confusion all over the place.  There is no consistency.  The Taoiseach will have competition between committees in respect of funding and actions and it is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>I asked a number of questions which the Taoiseach ignored regarding young people and economic models, particularly in relation to stimulus funding being given out and the <i>quid pro quo</i>being respecting the architecture of the State, sectoral agreements on wages, etc.  The Taoiseach will not answer regarding the size of the stimulus package.  I do not know whether he knows.  Is a quantum agreed at this point or not?  The Taoiseach might confirm that a quantum is agreed, if he will not tell me the amount.</p><p>With regard to capital funding under the stimulus package, in addition to shovel-ready projects, I encourage the Taoiseach to support tourism projects because in my experience this worked.  Tourism is taking a massive hit this year.  This is a way of getting funding into the regions and the tourism areas.  I refer to small capital projects where funding is being spent to improve products and facilities which, hopefully, will help them to come back next year.  There are a raft of them left over that should be used.</p><p>There is much talk about targeted VAT cuts.  I have a different opinion on this.  What is the Government's current thinking on that?  If there were changes, there would have to be some form of finance Bill in conjunction with it.</p></speech>

Having been in previous Governments, I know that co-ordination is key.  In coalition Governments - this is a three-party Government - where one has regular engagement, particularly between the three leaders and also to avoid issues that may be disruptive or may cause difficulties, it will require hard work but that is needed to maintain cohesion.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet co-ordination committee is a good idea.  It does not only comprise the three leaders.  It involves the Secretary General of my Department and the three advisers to each party leader.  The idea is to review the programme for Government, make sure it is being implemented, identify any issues that are causing difficulties and see whether a resolution can be found.  It is not the dominant committee in the work of the Cabinet.  It is there to prevent issues from festering and becoming bigger issues than they should and to develop trust between the three parties, and that is working.  It worked during the negotiations and it will continue.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy Kelly's point on the architecture of workers' rights.  We will be cognisant of that, as well as the climate.  In fairness, the July stimulus arises quickly but there is much work done.  We will publish it next week.  I refer to Deputy's point on tourism.  I would like to hear his ideas on tourism in terms of the tax measures that might be optimal for the industry.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that many people are saving at present.  There are a lot of savings in the banks and elsewhere.  One of the issues is, can we engineer greater expenditure over the next while domestically to give an impetus to the economy.  The key areas of the wage subsidy and the pandemic unemployment payment are important but other initiatives can be taken as well that could lead to jobs in the short term to deal with the disruptive impact that Covid represents.  One of the dangers is that Covid is not going away.  It could be with us for the next 12 months or more unless a vaccine arrives.  Even then, that will take time too.  We must try and fine-tune our economy and our model to meet the realities of living with Covid.</p> <p>That impacts on tourism, travel and the more global side of our economy, without mentioning Brexit, which is coming around the corner.</p></speech>

Is that the mechanism the Taoiseach uses to brief his partners in Government on all of the serious issues arising, including the contested Garda PULSE records that suggest the Minister sought to evade a Garda checkpoint?  The Taoiseach has said the co-ordination committee involves not only the leaders but the Secretary Generals of their Departments.  I understand the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach is the only Secretary General present, although the other leaders' advisers attend.  The Taoiseach says it is a mechanism by which to sort out problems and to ensure that things do not get overly contentious or overheated.  Will the Taoiseach talk us through that committee?  I presume its first task, as the Taoiseach has only just entered government, was to deal with the situation regarding the Minister, Deputy Cowen.  How did that work?</p></speech>

Ordinarily, agreement will have been arrived at.  Someone may say his party wants to consider an issue further or to push a memorandum back by a week pending resolution of some issue which has arisen.

It relates to the decision of the courts to strike down sectoral employment orders.

I congratulate her on her appointment as Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for enterprise trade and employment.  I look forward to tangling with her for the next two and a half years.</p>  <p>In June, the High Court found that SI 251/2019 was made outside of the powers of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  It was also found that the legislative framework governing the sectoral employment process is unconstitutional.  In the judge&rsquo;s ruling, it is explained that this is because of the manner in which the process is delegated to bodies outside of these Houses and the lack of clear guidance regarding how to balance competing interests in drawing up sectoral employment orders.  SI 251/2019 applied to the electrical contracting sector.</p>  <p>  As set out in the House on Thursday, 9 July, following a discussion with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and consultation with the Attorney General, it was decided to appeal that judgment.  Once the orders which must be completed by the High Court for this ruling to be given legal effect have been perfected, an appeal will be lodged in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court at the same time with a view to a leapfrog appeal directly to the Supreme Court.  I appraised the Government of this matter at its meeting yesterday.</p>  <p>  This is an area of legislation which has proven to be very litigious in the past 15 years, with significant constitutional issues being called into question.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 was major legislation brought through by the last Government which sought to deal with those issues.  We must now await the outcome of the appeal to understand where to go next with respect to this issue and before we commit to any further legislation.  </p>  <p>  The existing terms, conditions and contracts of employees in this sector stand.  They cannot be unilaterally changed by employers.  The situation is different for new entrants or for those changing employer but the terms, conditions and pay of those with existing contracts with their employers stand and cannot be reduced unilaterally by employers.</p></speech>

We were told the wages of people in employment would be protected but they were not.  I have absolutely no faith that, in the absence of sectoral employment orders, employers will act in the manner the T&aacute;naiste very kindly suggested they might.  I am very pleased to see that the Government will appeal the ruling but, in the meantime, there is an urgent need to protect the tens of thousands of workers who are reliant on these SEOs.  We have evidence to suggest that, where legal protections or minimums are removed, employers will seek to act.  We need to legislate to ensure and guarantee people these minimal rights.  We are not talking about a bonanza for those covered by sectoral employment orders; we are talking about very modest rates of pay and fairly basic terms and conditions of employment.  Nonetheless, these people require that level of protection.  Will the Minister enlighten me as to whether he plans to bring in such legislation?  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will certainly work with him to ensure its quick passage so that protection can be provided to the affected workers pending the outcome of the appeal.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the earlier comments of the Deputy's party leader, we increased the minimum wage to one of the highest levels in the European Union and to a much higher level than that in Northern Ireland, where the Deputy's party is in power.  Legislation to introduce new sectoral minima is problematic because the High Court has found that this House and the Government of the time acted unconstitutionally by applying sectoral employment orders.  We need the courts to clarify this issue.  There is now a serious point of law to be considered as to whether sectoral employment orders such as these are permissible.  Such orders have been struck down before.  Legislation to reintroduce them was passed in 2015.  They have now been struck down again, or at least the one in question has.  Our actions have been found to be unconstitutional.  We do not agree with this judgment, which is why we are appealing it to the Supreme Court.  It would not be possible, however, to bring in new legislation to set sectoral minima when the courts have found that we do not have the power to do so.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the difficulties regarding sectoral employment orders, registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, they are open to legal action and such actions have been taken on a number of occasions.</p> <p>In the intervening time, what protections does an electrical worker who is due to start work tomorrow or the next day have for his or her basic minimum rights and entitlements now that such workers are no longer set by or covered by the SEO?  We must bear in mind that this challenge was not taken by people who sought to improve the terms of the SEO; it was taken by people who sought to get around the terms of the SEO and in some instances to pay less than the SEO would have granted.  Is there a plan for the intervening time, pending the appeal?  As I stated to the Minister, we commit to working with him if there is a plan to bring in a form of legislation that will underpin the basic rights and entitlements.  The Government clearly sees the need for the SEO, as it introduced it, and I am sure the Minister believes it is a good idea.  Therefore, when it is gone something must replace it.  What will the Minister say to a worker starting on a site tomorrow morning and in the intervening period?</p></speech>

We will be seeking an early hearing by the Supreme Court so that this issue can be clarified.  In the meantime, the terms and conditions of those on existing contracts cannot be reduced unilaterally.  There is an issue, which the Deputy has identified, where people are changing employer or starting a new contract.  They will still be covered by the existing minimum wage legislation and minimum terms and conditions but not by the SEO.  That is a real problem.  For Government contracts, we are saying the SEO terms and conditions should still apply.  That is a matter of contract law but I cannot guarantee that everyone in the private sector will take the same view.  Some of the unions have indicated that they would look very dimly on any employer trying to diminish terms and conditions while the issue is under appeal and may take industrial action.  Any employers thinking of taking advantage of this High Court decision, while it is on appeal, should think about the fact that they may bring industrial action on themselves.</p></speech>

The difficulty we have is that because this section of the legislation has been struck down as unconstitutional, it is questionable as to whether this House can bring in sector-specific minimum wages, pension arrangements or terms and conditions.  With that power in question, all we can do is bring in legislation across the board but that will not work because the whole point of sectoral employment orders is that they are sectoral.  I am not sure we have a legislative solution to address this lacuna and the problem that arises, at least until the Supreme Court hears the case.</p>  <p>  We have to work on contingencies, depending on what the outcome of the case might be.  Having spoken to the Attorney General, we are confident as a Government that this House does have the authority to make sectoral employment orders.  The Minister cannot do so on his or her own but provided it is done by regulation and can be revoked by the House, then we are confident that we can but it does create a lacuna during that period, and does speak to a bigger question that we need to resolve.  One of the problems with sectoral employment orders is that they only apply to sectors and one issue we both need and want to address in next couple of years, presuming the economy allows it, is to continue to raise pay and terms and conditions for all workers, not just those in particular sectors or those who are represented by unions.  I refer to the move from the minimum wage to the living wage.  What that means has to be defined because it means different things to different people in different countries.</p>  <p>  It is also intended to introduce auto-enrolment so that everyone has access to a pension fund.  At the moment, three quarters of people in the private sector have no access to an occupational pension fund.  We have pension apartheid in Ireland when one compares the public and private sectors.  The third issue is to increase social insurance benefits more generally to every working person, so that work pays.  In recent years we have made some good progress in that regard on issues such as treatment benefit, maternity benefit and parental benefit and we need to add to that now with other social-insurance related benefits as well, so that we are raising the floor for everyone not just those in particular sectors or those who are unionised.</p></speech>

We have lived in a low-wage economy for some years.  I stated previously to the Minister previously - the Labour Party wishes to repeats the point - that statistics provided by the OECD show that 23% of workers are on low pay.  Last week, my colleague, Deputy Nash, introduced the Industrial Relations (Sectoral Employment Orders) Confirmation Bill 2020.  If the Minister were to support the legislation or to bring in similar legislation, he would be signalling to these workers that he has their backs and he is on their side.  I have been in these Houses long enough to know that when a Government needs or wants to do something, it sends out a message.  It is able to do so, regardless of what commentators might say or whether its constitutionality might be questioned.  What sort of signal would the Minister give in terms of a legislative response?  Just as the Labour Party has done with its Bill, could the Minister not do something similar in order to show the workers that he does have their backs and that he is not just going to wait for the outcome of a case before the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal?</p></speech>

We do not have to appeal it but we are choosing to appeal it because we think it is the right thing to do.  We will look at the legislation produced.  I have not seen the Bill yet, but we will examine it.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has been a Minister and he has served in government.  He knows that no Government can bring in legislation that is unconstitutional.  Producing legislation that is unconstitutional is not showing that one has anyone's back: it is showing that one is pretending to have someone's back and that is not a good thing.</p></speech>

This is legislation that has been proposed by a former Minister in this area, who brought in the 2015 legislation to which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, referred in an earlier comment.  It is not a case of playing games or doing something for the sake of it; it is legislation that has identified the issues raised in the court case and is trying to iron them out.  What I suggest is that the Minister could support the Bill or give it proper consideration and bring in his own legislation while we wait on the Supreme Court to rule on the case.</p>  <p>  It jars with me and my party, and probably with others, to hear the Minister congratulate himself on taking the case to the Supreme Court.  If the Minister were not to take the case to the Supreme Court, we would definitely see which side of the fence he is on.  In the meantime, while we wait for the stimulus package and for the outcome of the Supreme Court case, it is the responsibility of the Government to show there is nothing the Government will not do or entertain in order to protect people who are covered by SEOs, who by their very nature are in vulnerable work, and are open to exploitation.  That is the reason for the necessity of SEOs.  This is the type of message we need from the Government.  I appreciate that the Minister said he will examine the legislation that has been produced by the Labour Party, but I wish to hear a harder and more supportive message than that.</p></speech>

It is to ask the Minister if he will implement the legislative measures to prevent tactical insolvencies and ensure that workers are protected in insolvency situations.  The latest of quite a number of cases of this nature concerns the Debenhams workers, but there has been a litany of cases.  Every time this comes up, whoever is in government says something needs to be done, someone should do something, this cannot be allowed to happen again and when it happens again they say the same things.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Workers are getting a bit sick of waiting, they want protection and they want it now.</p></reply>

The procedures for liquidations are set out in the Part 11 of the Companies Act 2014.  In general terms, a company is permitted to initiate a winding-up where it has complied with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.  A company both during normal operation and in a winding-up process must of course also abide by all relevant legal requirements, including the treatment of employees and creditors and disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners as well.  However, the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 provide safeguards to prevent the abuse of the liquidation system.  These include preferential payments under section 621 which provide for categories of employee entitlement such as wages owed, holiday remuneration, superannuation benefits, ill health payments and social welfare contributions.  An insolvent company is defined by the Companies Act 2014 in section 818 as a company that is unable to pay its debts and is further defined in the Act.</p><p>Therefore insolvency cannot merely be asserted: insolvency is defined in the legislation and scrutinised in the courts.  In addition the liquidator of an insolvent company must report to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, on its demise and must apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the company, unless they are relieved of that obligation by the ODCE.  Ireland has a longstanding preventative restructuring framework in examinership that provides a protective mechanism for companies that have real prospects for the future but find themselves in financial difficulty at a point in time.  When it comes to workers the Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including official notification to the relevant Minister and a 30-day consultation period to allow employee representatives adequate opportunity to consider the employer's proposals and make constructive proposals in response.  While this legislation is currently the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, it will shortly transfer to my Department under a transfer order.</p><p>On redundancy entitlements, it is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy and all other wage-related entitlements to eligible employees.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>However, the social insurance fund, under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides a safety net for employees in situations where the employer cannot pay due to financial difficulties or insolvency.</p><p>The Government has committed in the programme for Government to reviewing whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies protect the rights of workers effectively.  It has committed also to reviewing the Companies Act 2014 with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property with the result being the trading business, including the jobs, go into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business.  Additionally, it commits to examining the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.</p><p>As part of its next work programme, I will be requesting the Company Law Review Group to examine these programme for Government commitments.</p></speech>

They are not on the picket line because they want to be there, they are on the picket line because they are literally in the last-chance saloon.  They have got no option.  They have nothing, they have lost their jobs.  If one talks to these men and women, some have 20, 30 or 34 years of service to the company.  Between them, they have given hundreds of years of loyal service to a company that has simply left them, dumped them.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste may recall that my party tabled legislation in 2016.  His predecessor as Minister in responding to the legislation, the Protection of Employees (Collective Redundancies) Bill 2017, said:</p> <blockquote> 	The Government supports the broad principles of the Bill.  It is well intentioned and in line with proposals being developed in my Department in response to the Duffy-Cahill report. </blockquote>  <p>Where are those proposals now?  They were being developed in 2016.  It is 2020 now and we have another situation.  They were developed on foot of what happened to the Clerys workers, we now have another such situation.  We are going to have more of these if we do not take some action.  We have tabled legislation that is broadly in line with the legislation previously tabled, entitled the Protection of Employees (Collective Redundancies) Bill 2020.  I have sought leave to introduce it and I hope that the Minister will work with me in the spirit of his predecessor to ensure that action is taken on behalf of these workers.</p><p>Will the Minister agree to meet with a delegation of Debenhams workers?  Their trade union, Mandate, has written to him to request that.  I have spoken to them directly and they have said that if they could talk to the Minister and explain to him it might underline for him the urgency and the need to act.</p></speech>

I am certainly happy to consider any meeting request.  It is important to say that the Debenhams staff who were laid off should get their redundancy and they will.  Even if it has to come out of the Social Insurance Fund they should get it.  I know that they have not gotten it yet but redundancy payments are suspended at the moment because of Covid.  That should not stop them getting their redundancy payments and they should get them as soon as is possible, either from the company or from the Social Insurance Fund if needs be.</p>  <p>  The situations with Clerys and Debenhams are not quite the same.  Clerys had substantial property assets on O'Connell Street, Debenhams did not.  It was renting its premises and had been in and out of examinership for quite some time.  Putting the two together is a little bit inaccurate.  There are legal changes that need to be made however.  Some flow from company law and the company law Bill which we will publish in the next couple of days will deal with some of those.  When we have the employment affairs section transferred over I will look again at the Duffy Cahill report and see if we need to make some changes on foot of that.</p></speech>

It outlines again the need for changes and outlines exactly what needs to be done.  There is absolutely no dearth of information about what needs to be done and what would be the right thing to do.  Everybody knows this.  All that they are waiting on is the political will to act on it and that is why I am imploring the Minister to meet with the Debenhams workers and I welcome the fact that he will consider that.  Their trade union has written to him, I think the letter was sent last week.  They would be very grateful for a formal meeting with a delegation.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to redundancy.  As he rightly pointed out, the workers are entitled to what I, in my previous life, would have called "stat", that is, statutory redundancy.  They have a collective agreement.  They were a unionised workforce and I am conscious of the fact that I am talking to someone who has worked for probably most of his adult life under collective agreements and national wage agreements.  These workers had a collective agreement with their employer and their employer has walked away from it.  It did cover issues such as their redundancy entitlement and they are now sitting-in because there is stock in the Debenhams store and once that is gone they believe that will be it, that it is all that is going to be left to them.  Statutory redundancy after 34 years of good and loyal service is not really good enough.  These people had a collective agreement with their employer which was negotiated.  There was give and take, as there always is, on behalf of both parties but the workers should be entitled to the minimum terms that are in that collective agreement.</p></speech>

A company has to initiate a liquidation while insolvent and it cannot do so by voluntary liquidation, it must apply to the High Court.  It may be that these matters have yet to be heard in the courts and that is where they will be determined.</p></speech>

These three papers, which are available on my Department's website gov.ie, were developed in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and provide an assessment of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some other Departments also provided sectoral input based on their analyses.  The papers also drew on international analysis from organisations such as the OECD, the ECB, Copenhagen Economics and Oxford University.</p>  <p>  The economic impact of Covid-19 has not been uniform across all sectors of the economy.  Based on the analysis from the Department of Finance's stability programme update and a more detailed sectoral and labour market analysis provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the most heavily-impacted sectors are accommodation, food, construction, administration and support services, wholesale and retail and other personal services.  Evidence for this includes the number of employees availing of the temporary wage subsidy and the pandemic unemployment payment.  Sectors like finance, service activities and information and communications technology are the least affected.  These sectors rely much less on direct contact with consumers and service providers and much activity can be completed from home.</p> <p>There has also been less of a direct impact on the manufacturing sector.  Many manufacturing industries were considered as essential during the restrictions and continued operations, albeit adapting to ensure safe workplaces with social distancing.  The fall in output will be limited given that pharmaceutical and other medical devices sectors account for the majority of output.  Indeed, activity in the pharmaceutical sector largely continued throughout the restrictions.  However, production in the indigenous sector is expected to be adversely affected, reflected in an annual decline in manufacturing production in the traditional sector in February and March this year.<br/><br/>There are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy.  However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism, hospitality, arts, entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, remain in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are uncertain.<br/><br/>I am out of practice doing this.  I will get shorter replies next time.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i><br/><br/>The July stimulus package, to be announced shortly, will be of scale and speed.  In considering the analyses, I see five areas which we should focus on in helping our enterprises in the future: income support, direct grants for businesses, cheaper finance, new opportunities for future jobs and support for the hardest hit sectors.</p></speech>

It is essential this analysis is done, and continues to be done, in order that there is a targeted approach.  Is the approach of the stimulation that it will be jobs rich?  It is one thing to make sure businesses recover but it is another that they recover and that good quality employment is provided where public money is invested in that recovery.  What are the principles behind the analysis that was done?  It is very welcome that the analysis was done.  It is something that was called for at the Covid committee very recently by some of the employer organisations.  They were quite critical that it was not done until very late in the day after the last crash.  They made a point of saying it needed to be done to have a targeted approach in the recovery.</p></speech>

The truth is, as the Deputy will acknowledge, that any analysis and projection as to how Covid will impact on our economy is a good educated guess.  Nobody really knows how long this pandemic will go on for, how many waves there may or may not be or what they will look like.  It is everyone's best guess as to what the impact will be but it is better to have some analysis and projection than none.  We have to be honest with people that the analysis could change significantly over the coming months, depending on what happens with the virus and whether a vaccine is developed, and all of the things that everyone in the House appreciates already.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, if we have anything to do with the recovery, it will be jobs rich and jobs led.  The priority is to get people back to their old jobs where possible.  We acknowledge this may not be possible in all cases because some firms may fail and some sectors may not recover for a very long time.  We need to make sure alternative employment is created in other sectors, such as climate action, green tech and green energy.  It will also be in construction building some of the many houses we desperately need, and in areas such as care, where we need to increase the number of staff in that part of the public service and other parts of the public service.</p></speech>

It is simply to ensure that where a worker contracts an illness in the workplace, that illness being Covid-19, that it is notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority, which can examine the case to determine how the person got it.  I am a member of the Covid-19 response committee and I have heard from people representing workers in high-risk sectors, such as meat plants, and healthcare workers among whom infection rates are very high.  It beggars belief that this is not notifiable in the normal way that an illness acquired in the workplace is to the HSA.</p></reply>

Any infectious disease pandemic is first and foremost a matter of public health, for which a legal basis for reporting already exists under public health legislation.  Notifiable infectious diseases are statutorily reported under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 to the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health for investigation and control.  At present, under the occupational safety and health legislation the requirement to report accidents does not apply to a person who suffers a disease, occupational illness or impairment of mental health as a result of workplace activity.</p>  <p>  There are a number of considerations to take into account with regard to reporting occupational diseases or illnesses or both to the Health and Safety Authority.  These include the fact that many employers are not in a position to assess or attribute the diagnosis of Covid-19 as an occupational disease or illness with any degree of reliability since it can be acquired in a community or workplace setting.  It would also introduce an obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer, which would be seen as contrary to the protection of an individual's right to the privacy of such information.</p>  <p>  However, I do understand that the board of the Health and Safety Authority has requested a review of the reporting obligations concerning infectious diseases in the context of employers' obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  The review will include consultation with a range of parties, including the Department of Health and the State Claims Agency.  It will also examine whether a proposed change can be achieved without increasing reporting requirements for employers outside the health sector and can be aligned with general data protection regulation, GDPR, requirements.  The review will also look at the practices in other European countries on the reporting of infectious diseases by employers.  I have asked that the review be presented to the Department for consideration as soon as it is available.  I am happy to revert to the Deputy at that stage.</p></speech>

Will representatives of workers be involved in the review?  I heard the Minister of State list the stakeholders but I did not hear worker representatives on it.  If they are not involved in the review, I urge the Minister of State as a matter of priority to ensure they are.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister of State's concern for workers with regard to any responsibility that might be placed on them but their representative body, and a fine representative body it is too, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, wrote to the previous Minister to outline that the workers are more than happy to undertake that responsibility.  If a person acquires an injury or illness in the workplace it should be notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  It beggars belief.  I actually did not believe it when I read the correspondence first that it was not notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  For some people, putting themselves in the way of this disease is part of their job.  It is part of their work and it is in the transaction of that work that they acquire it.  It is not good enough to say we might not be able to determine exactly how people acquired it.  That is what the Health and Safety Authority inspectors are there to do.  They can come in and investigate how it happened.  The Covid committee has heard at length how it runs through workplaces in particular settings.  We know we have unusually high rates of infection among healthcare workers, which is very worrying.  What we need now is to give the HSA the authority to do what it should be doing and inspecting these workplaces.  However, in order to do this they have to be notified.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400026#BB00900"><p>I understand that as part of the report, it will consult.  We can check this.  It is something we can also do when we get the report.  To be clear, the Health and Safety Authority is aware that Covid-19 is a risk in healthcare settings and in other settings also.  It is working with the HSE and individual employees in places of work to investigate the incidents among healthcare workers.  The HSA is also investigating fatalities arising from cases where healthcare workers have contracted Covid-19.  This is when they are called in.  Approximately 9,000 non-fatal workplace injuries and accidents are reported to the HSA per year.</p> <p>However, the report of a workplace injury or accident is for statistical analysis generally.  It is when it goes deeper that it carries out the full investigation.</p> <p> The Deputy asked why it is not included.  As recently as 2016 a statutory instrument, SI 370 of 2016, amended the health and safety general application regulations to clarify issues for employers as to what was a workplace accident by setting out that the requirement to report an accident does not apply to an accident which occurs in a place of work or as a result of work activity in respect of which a person suffers any disease, occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition.  At that time a regulatory impact assessment was carried out as part of this change to the regulations.  The regulatory impact assessment identified that the exclusion of disease or occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition was needed as employers were not in a position to assess or attribute occupational disease or illness to a workplace activity.  That is probably a fair assessment.  However, we will await the report and take matters from there.  We can discuss it in the House.</p></speech>

It would seem, therefore, that the decision has already been taken at European level.  It is a very simple request - that the Minister of State make the necessary amendment to regulation 224 of the safety, health and welfare at work general application, amendment, regulations.  He has the power to do it.  I understand and respect that he will wait for the report and the review, but this issue has been ongoing for some time.  With the greatest respect, we should have that report and subsequent action on it without any further delay.  As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out in the previous reply, we do not have a crystal ball when it comes to this virus.  In all likelihood we will face more waves of it, so we must put contingency measures in place now to ensure workers are protected to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>

That is an absolute guarantee.  It is likewise in the health service.  With regard to the changes and the biological agents regulations, this does not impact the reporting of Covid-19.  The reporting requirements in the regulations require that the HSA be notified immediately of any accident or incident which may result in the release of a biological agent which could cause severe human infection or illness in a laboratory setting.  For example, if a sample containing SARS-CoV-2 was released, this would have to be reported.  The requirement for an employer to report a case of Covid-19 in a healthcare worker is not covered, or intended, under the biological agents regulations.</p>  <p>  I can just set out what the situation is.  It is appropriate that we wait for that report.  Naturally, if the report makes recommendations, we will act.  I have committed to discussing it in the House.  We are very open on this as there is no issue with it.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the T&aacute;naiste is replying to this question, but what plans has he to review and strengthen the co-operative sector?

The Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2018 provide the statutory regulatory basis for the formation and general operation of industrial and provident societies, primarily co-operatives, in Ireland.  The current legislative framework is largely Victorian statutory code incorporating a number of antiquated provisions.  Following a root and branch review of the existing legislative framework, which included conducting a public consultation on the operation and implementation of the current statutory code, the Department is well advanced in the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill for modernised and consolidated legislation.  I expect the Minister to bring this to the Government in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the existing industrial and provident societies legislation and to ensure that a modernised and effective legislative framework, suitable for the diverse range of organisations using the co-operative model in Ireland, is in place.  The Bill will deal with a wide range of issues that have arisen, informed by the public consultation and bilateral engagement with stakeholders, issues identified by the Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the report on the Private Members' Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill 2018 prepared by the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation in 2019.  The Bill will, among other issues, provide co-operative societies with a distinct legislative identity reflecting the co-operatives' ethos, revise the provisions on debentures, introduce audit exemptions in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014, strengthen the governance provision and revise the powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</p>  <p>  A modernised legislative framework aligned with the realities of the 21st century business and regulatory environment will ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and other legal options for structured enterprise activities.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the heads of the scheme will be published.  Forgive my cynicism, however, as I go back over 60 years of promise after promise.  Following a suggestion from Mr. Lemass, a report was published in 1964.  We move forward to a report in 1986, 20 years later, and to 2007, when there was a very good report from Forf&aacute;s.  In 2009 there was another consultation and there was a further consultation in 2016 and 2017.  Then there was the committee's report mentioned by the Minister of State arising from the Bill from Independents 4 Change, which forced some action.  Given all of that, I want a definitive answer from the Minister of State on when the Bill will be published.</p></speech>

I have said that a substantial body of work has already been undertaken.  The Deputy rightly referred to the Private Members' Bill that went through the D&aacute;il in 2018.  It was referred to the committee on business and enterprise and the committee conducted a review and produced a report on the Bill.  That has fed into the work that has been ongoing in the Department.  I ask the Deputy to judge me on my track record.  I have given a commitment in the D&aacute;il today that this is a priority for the Department.  It is envisaged that we will bring this legislation forward by the fourth quarter of 2020 to be debated in the D&aacute;il, and I will welcome the Deputy's engagement at that stage.</p></speech>

The reason 60 years was mentioned was to put it into perspective.  The legislation dates back to 1893 and gives no recognition to the distinct characteristics of co-operatives, or any reference to the co-operative principle.  The Forf&aacute;s report in 2007 highlights that the co-operative sector in Ireland is vibrant, but concentrated in certain traditional sectors.  It goes on to say that it is static.  We simply have not used the potential that exists in co-operatives.  I would have thought we would have learned from the recession and certainly we should learn from Covid-19.  If one looks at the underlying principles, they fit in with what the Government says in theory.  There are seven parts to the definition and one is particularly striking, that co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by members.  There must be Government recognition of that.  We need policy and legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State giving his word today and I will hold him to it.</p></speech>

Their work is recognised and it is on the basis of that good work that my Department has already started the work to bring forward the necessary legislative change.  That legislative change will recognise the distinct identity reflecting co-operative ethos, reduce the number of members required to form a co-operative, revise the provisions on debentures and introduce audit exemptions in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014.  The Deputy will be aware that the Companies Act 2014 required a vast volume of work.</p> <p>It took a lot of time, and now that it has been done there is the opportunity to move it at an accelerated pace in respect of this legislation.  I anticipate engaging fully in this regard with the Deputy before the end of the year.</p></speech>

At the end of 2019 almost 2.3 million people were at work.  Today approximately 1 million people are on some form of income support.  We knew that reigniting our economy after the Covid shutdown would present significant challenges.  The message from small businesses, though, is clear.  They want supports.  They do not want to take on additional debt.  They want grants.  It is important that this distinction is made.  What confirmation can the T&aacute;naiste give to the House on the plans to have SMEs reopen and get people back to work?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400028#DD00500"><p>I thank Deputy Devlin for raising this important question.</p>  <p>  As T&aacute;naiste and Minister with responsibility for enterprise, trade and employment, I am committed to playing my part to get businesses reopened and to provide grant aid, advice and access to finance as we work to get businesses open and people back to work.  A crucial part of this work will involve getting our SMEs back to capacity as soon as possible.  So far the Government has introduced a &euro;12 billion package for firms of all sizes.  This includes the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed and sole traders, grants such as the restart grant, low-cost loans, the write-off of commercial rates, and deferred tax liabilities.  All of this has helped to improve the financial position of SMEs.</p>  <p>  As business reopens, what is needed now is a plan of sufficient speed and scale to repair some of the damage that has been done and to restore confidence.  The July stimulus package, as promised in the programme for Government, will do just that.  It will save jobs and create new ones and get our people back to work.  In considering the analysis, I see five areas on which we should focus in helping our enterprises into the future: income supports for workers, direct grants for business, cheaper finance, new opportunities for future jobs, and support for the hardest-hit sectors.  It is a matter of enabling our SMEs to return to capacity, where possible, and, more broadly, strengthening the resilience, productivity and innovation of SMEs.  SMEs are the backbone of our economy and communities across the country and are key drivers of employment.</p>  <p>  Separately, the programme for Government set out our ambition to honour this commitment.  I intend to form an SME growth task force shortly.  This group will help to bring about a national SME growth plan, which will map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint well beyond Covid-19.  The national SME growth plan will be largely informed by the comprehensive OECD report, SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland, which was published last year.  The plan will include detailed proposals to help SMEs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets.  It will look at ways to make them more productive, innovative and ready to transition to the digital and green economy of the future.  It will make improvements to areas such as local entrepreneurship ecosystems and local industry clusters to drive regional development.  The plan will be brought before the Government for approval as part of the national economic plan in October.</p></speech>

They have been much needed by the businesses the T&aacute;naiste speaks of.  I also welcome and support the July stimulus package.  I reiterate, however, the difference between the grant aid scheme and the loan scheme.  Equally, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to focus on the under 25s.  Approximately 250,000 people aged under 25 are unemployed, and I hope his Department will focus on that cohort too.  It is now just four working days until the start date of the next phase of the reopening of the economy, and businesses need clarity on this.  They need to order stock, train staff and prepare their premises.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm when they can expect such clarity?</p></speech>

I cannot yet say whether the decision will be in the affirmative or the negative, but it will be made most likely tomorrow evening at our Cabinet meeting.  That would give those sectors the best part of a few days to prepare.  I hope it will be possible for them to reopen.  I know there has been an uptick in the number of new Covid cases in the past week or two, but they still number in the teens or about 20 per day.  We did think there would be a slight increase in case numbers as we eased restrictions.  I do not think the increase has been so enormous that at this stage it should prevent us moving to stage 4, but that is not a decision for me on my own.  We need the advice from NPHET, and the Cabinet needs to decide.</p>  <p>  I totally take the Deputy's point about grants and loans.  We need more of both.  One of the things that I expect will be part of the package next week will be an improved and enhanced restart grant that is open to more businesses.  A lot of businesses did not qualify for one reason or another.  I would like to expand the grant in order that more businesses can qualify and get up and running or, as the case may be, stay up and running.</p></speech>

It is important there is a balance between the two.  I wish to reiterate and focus on the fact that it is estimated that 2.1 million people will return to work.  That is approximately 90% of the pre-Covid number of people in employment.  That 90% has presented and, I have no doubt, will present challenges over the coming months, but the 10% who are expected not to return to work must not be left behind.  As I said earlier, I would focus on the under 25s.  We do not want to see young people long-term unemployed if at all possible.  We need to look at schemes and initiatives to get them back to work as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I think he is correct that a proportion will not be able to return to their old jobs, if only because the companies they had been working for will not succeed or the sectors for which they were working will struggle.  It is important we have alternatives for those people, whether new jobs in areas such as housing construction, the care sector or green energy or other opportunities such as apprenticeships, higher education options, back-to-work enterprises and back-to-education options.  The Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister with responsibility for higher education are doing some good work on that in order that we have opportunities and plenty of options for people and do not have young people on the pandemic unemployment payment or jobseeker's payments for a prolonged period.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is examining community employment, which is a good scheme and can be scaled up or scaled down depending on the economic conditions.  Now is probably the time to scale it up again.</p></speech>

It was launched with a fund of &euro;250 million, as the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, on 22 May.  It was devised in recognition of the fact that some small and medium-sized companies and microbusinesses were particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of the pandemic.  The programme for Government pledged a review of the grant, which I welcome because it shows a degree of responsiveness and flexibility towards it and how it should work going forward.  Regarding that pledge in the programme, have any issues been identified by the Department as needing improvement and, if so, what might they be?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400028#DD01300"><p>The restart grant was launched on 22 May and is a critically important tool to assist small businesses in reopening their doors.  Grant payments range from a minimum of &euro;2,000 to a maximum of &euro;10,000.  The scheme was devised in recognition of the fact that microbusinesses and small businesses were and are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19.  Using funding allocated by my Department to Enterprise Ireland for the scheme, local authorities are the granting authorities in each of their respective areas.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;250 million was allocated to the scheme, and roughly 40,000 companies have applied.  That will come to a value of approximately &euro;120 million or &euro;130 million, so there is still a lot yet to apply.  Local authorities have been mixed in their capacity to pay the money out, but we are certain that more will be paid out.  What we are examining for next week is limited to companies with 50 employees or fewer.  We are considering whether the scheme should be expanded to companies with more employees.  The average country hotel will have more than 50 employees.  They need to get reopened.  Educational and other businesses can also have more than 50 employees.  In addition, it has not been open to non-rateable businesses such as B&amp;Bs.  We need to look at a few businesses like that and consider whether we can extend the scheme to them.  However, it should always be seen as part of a wider assistance package for businesses and firms of all sizes.</p> <p>The main measure is the wage subsidy scheme, which, for most employers I meet, is the one they most want to see extended.  It is the issue that is raised most with me by employers.  That has already cost about &euro;2 billion.  There is the pandemic unemployment scheme for the self-employed and sole traders.  We are encouraging them to come off it with an upfront payment.  There are low-cost loans, the write-off of commercial rates and the deferred tax liabilities.  All of these have helped to improve the financial position of SMEs.  It is encouraging that 67,000 people came off the pandemic unemployment payment last week.  Some went back into employment and some went back into employment through the wage subsidy scheme.  If we can keep up that kind of momentum in the next couple of weeks, we could be heading for a faster recovery than we might have thought possible but I think it will be a bumpy road.</p></speech>

I am speaking as a former Dublin spokesperson on the other side of the House.  We have all championed the notion of remote working but it is having consequences.  It has consequences for the city in terms of hospitality.  Walking around the city, one sees a lot of offices are not occupied and that has an impact on hospitality, whether it be restaurants, cafes, sandwich bars or pubs.  It is having enormous consequences.  While I hear the T&aacute;naiste's comments on the July stimulus and I welcome them, he seems to indicate that businesses will fail.  I know he will agree with me that almost every hospitality business in this city and its suburbs is viable, in the absence of a pandemic, and needs assistance to survive.  Is that being considered in the context of the July stimulus?  I acknowledge it is not part of the question, but if the T&aacute;naiste could humour me in answering it, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400029#EE00300"><p>The truth is that not every business was viable before the pandemic.  There were those who hoped they would become viable as the economy continued to grow.  That has not happened.  We had a pandemic instead and now the economy has shrunk so, for some businesses that hoped to become viable, that hope is now lost.  We will see businesses close in all sectors, unfortunately.  That is just the truth of it but we want to minimise the number of businesses that fail and for sectors who were hit hard, hit first and hit worst, such as the hospitality, arts and entertainment sectors, we want them to be able to at least trade through to Christmas if not to the tourist season of next year.  They will need special help to do that.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the city centre.  I am a fan of remote working.  It has huge benefits for parents and for the rural economy and rural areas.  It has benefits in terms of reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions but it is evident how quiet the city centre is at the moment.  I wonder how many of those sandwich bars, coffee shops, small restaurants and so on in our city centres - not just in Dublin - can survive, if we do not have footfall.  No amount of Government interventions, changes to VAT rates or commercial rates will replace footfall.  We will need to have some sort of return of people to their offices over the next couple of weeks, providing the pandemic is under control - perhaps people working two or three days at home and two or three days back in the office.  That will help the city centre.</p></speech>

We are paying attention to what other countries do and every country's package is different.  We compare favourably when it comes to the pandemic unemployment payment.  Not many countries are providing &euro;350 per week to workers.  That is triple what it is in Northern Ireland or Britain.  We compare quite well when it comes to the wage subsidy scheme, which will end in the UK, for example, in October.  We have not yet set a date for ours.  We probably need to do more with direct grants and in terms of our loan guarantee.  These are the kinds of things we are working on for next week and beyond.</p>  <p>   Regarding next spring, unfortunately none of us can predict the future.  I anticipate we will have spikes and clusters but I hope we will not return to a nationwide lockdown again, which will allow the economy to recover.  I hope we will get to the point where we have a vaccine, effective treatments and potentially screening at airports and so on.  That would allow a decent tourism season to happen next year.  This year will be very difficult but I hope Christmas and next year will be good and maybe there will be pent-up demand to help compensate for some of the losses this year.</p></speech>

I reiterate the T&aacute;naiste's message at that time and again today to all workers and employers affected by this decision in regard to sectoral employment orders, that until the appeal process is concluded and legal certainty has been obtained, there can be no unilateral diminution of the terms and conditions of employees by employers.  In regard to contract cleaners and the other sectors the Deputy raised, they are covered by employment regulation orders, which is a slightly different part of the Industrial Relations Act 2015 and they are not impacted by this judgment directly.  In regard to meeting representatives of the workers governed by the sectoral employment orders, I intend to meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the coming weeks to discuss this and other pressing matters.  We can take it from there.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy on this but the important thing is that we appeal this at the appropriate time.</p></speech>

The reason I am putting the question in this manner is that I think there is more to protecting and advocating workers&rsquo; right than just what goes on in the courts.  There is also the ability of workers to defend themselves.  There is plan A, where one defends the rights in the courts and plan B, where the State gives workers the possibility to defend themselves.   Here I am talking about the legal right to trade union recognition where if one has a high percentage or a certain percentage - as is the case in other countries - of workers who join a union, then the employer must recognise and deal with them and give them access to the workplace, which would prevent the sort of scandals which are alleged to have happened during the Covid crisis in meat plants.  That sort of legislation that enables workers to defend themselves rather than always relying on the courts is also needed.  It is not just about appealing laws we make here but it is about enabling workers to fight for and defend themselves.</p></speech>

The Industrial Relations Act 2015 was quite a large Act.  Previously, we had 15 or 16 years of discussion and legal cases.  We tried to bring certainty to this and we acted on that with that legislation.  We have built on that since and we have shown our absolute commitment here.  The national minimum wage has been increased four or five times over the past nine years since we have been in government.  When it comes to any cases, we try to strengthen the position of employees and workers.  Naturally, we try to bring employers with us on that journey at all times and to get that balance right and that is what the legislation was about.</p> <p>It is important that we concentrate on appealing the court decision and trying to get that appeal right.  The ruling in this case calls into question the constitutionality behind the regulations and statutory instruments that were based on the relevant legislation.  We will concentrate on this issue in the weeks and months ahead, and both the T&aacute;naiste and I will engage with trade union representatives as part of that.  There is no doubting our commitment to this area.</p></speech>

I do not agree that this Government and its predecessors have done their best to defend workers' rights.  The Lockout more than 100 years ago was all about trade union recognition and we still do not have that in this country.  Several Bills were put before the previous Government, which ended up being delayed and never progressing through the legislative Stages as they should have.  No doubt we will introduce similar Bills in this term.</p>  <p>  Workers need the right to organise and defend themselves and they cannot consistently rely on the courts to uphold that right.  I refute the Minister of State's claim that this and previous governments have always had the interests of workers at heart.  We need to look again at the Duffy Cahill report in view of what has gone on at Debenhams.  What happened in that case will repeat itself in other cases.  We need to consider giving workers the ability to organise and trade unions the ability to access workplaces such as meat plants where there are contentious issues.  Construction sites are notoriously bad for bogus self-employment, precarious working conditions and low pay.  All of those practices must be addressed.  That will require a commitment from the Government to introduce robust legislation that will ensure workers can organise and defend themselves instead of having to rely on the courts to uphold that right.</p></speech>

That is the focus of a lot of our work in the Department.  The Deputy referred to a particular report.  Our officials work through all such reports and bring forward any changes that are required on foot of them.  The machinery at the disposal of the State when it comes to employees' rights is very strong.  We are proud of that machinery and we will protect it.  We will be happy to engage with the Deputy on any legislative proposals she brings forward in this area.  It is about getting the balance right.  We are all committed to protecting workers' rights and that is why we will launch an appeal to the ruling in question when it is the appropriate time to do so.</p></speech>

To assist businesses to overcome the unique and unprecedented challenges posed by Covid-19, the Government has put in place a package for firms that includes the wage subsidy scheme, direct grants, low-cost loans, the write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.  These measures are designed to restore confidence and further assist businesses in terms of their management and business continuity, thus allowing them to begin planning for the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  My focus since I took up my role has been on the July stimulus package, which is aimed at protecting the viability of the business and enterprise sector and enabling people to get back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors.  The stimulus will extend and enhance existing measures to address the impact of Covid-19 on businesses.  I am engaging with my ministerial colleagues on a range of proposals.  Helping SMEs is central to our efforts, given their pivotal role in the economy and employment.  The July stimulus package to be announced next week will be of scale and speed.</p>  <p>  In considering the analysis, I see five areas on which we should focus.  These are income supports for workers, by way of extending the wage subsidy scheme; better direct grants for business; cheaper finance for business; new opportunities for future jobs; and targeted supports for the hardest-hit sectors.  While I have emphasised the importance of preserving existing firms and jobs, the July package should also have an eye to exploiting emerging opportunities and attracting high-value projects with significant economic benefits.  Importantly, the July stimulus must position our economy and firms to meet future challenges.  In the near term, this includes helping companies further in meeting the challenges of Brexit, but we also need to include actions that will build enterprise resilience and help businesses to transition to the low-carbon and digital future.  I look forward to announcing the details with the Taoiseach shortly.</p></speech>

There is a significant focus at the moment on the July stimulus package and a lot of SME owners are waiting very anxiously for it.  Some sectors have been hit harder than others by the Covid-19 pandemic and they are particularly anxious to see what will be announced next week.  Private bus operators, small retail outlets, boutique owners and many others have suffered greatly during this period.  We are hugely dependent in this country on the SME sector and the July stimulus will be critical in rebooting our economy following the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some 65% of workers in the State are employed in SMEs, which means that getting the vast majority of those businesses back on an even keel is absolutely essential.  They are anxiously awaiting next week's announcement.</p></speech>

In all parts of Ireland, large numbers of people are employed in small firms.  When we talk about SMEs, people might not appreciate that we are talking about firms with up to 500 employees.  A company with that number of employees is quite a large firm but it is technically an SME.  We know that the public sector has been largely protected through the pandemic.  Very few people in the public service have lost their job, which is a good thing.  Employees of large multinational companies have also largely been protected.  The people who have borne the brunt of the pandemic are those working in small firms in the private sector.  That is why we need to focus our efforts on them.</p></speech>

Rural-based SMEs, although likely to employ fewer numbers than SMEs in urban areas, are nevertheless significant employers.  We need to look to the future when considering the issues they face.  Access to broadband, transport infrastructure, education facilities and further tax-based incentives will be essential in ensuring the future viability of the sector and enabling the future growth that will enable us to recover from this unique pandemic.  As the Government prepares the July stimulus, there is very significant weight on the T&aacute;naiste's shoulders in seeking to address the issues facing SMEs and enabling them to recover.  Doing so is an essential part of rebooting our economy.  I hope the stimulus package will answer the vast majority of our concerns.</p></speech>

I expect it to include actions we can implement within weeks or months, not actions that cannot be done until next year or the year after, and to amount to several billions of euro in funding.  It is important to say, however, that we are not going to fire all our bullets next week.  We will do more in October as part of the budget and as part of the national economic plan.  The proposals we publish next week will provide a multibillion euro package of measures that can be implemented quickly.  It will include measures to help businesses that are closed to reopen and help those that have reopened but are struggling to stay open.  Most important, it will maintain the connection between employers and employees so that we see more and more people going back to work over the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

Whatever shape it finally takes, Brexit will have a significant impact on the economy.  It will fundamentally change the trading environment for businesses currently trading with the UK.  In 2018, my Department published a report, entitled Strategic Implications for Ireland Arising from Changing EU-UK Trading Relations, which examined the implications of Brexit for the economy and trade.  While tariffs often spring to mind as a significant cost factor, in fact, the cost of non-tariff barriers due to regulatory divergence and bureaucracy will have a greater impact on businesses trading with Britain.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>In January of this year, my Department published a further study on Brexit impacts based on the withdrawal agreement and the revised political declaration agreed between the EU and the UK.  The findings suggest a reduction in Irish GDP of between 3.2% and 3.9% by 2030, compared with a baseline whereby the UK remains a member of the EU.  This compares with a negative impact of 7% in the no-deal, or WTO rules, scenario modelled in 2018.  Of course, both Brexit studies predated Covid-19, which has had a severe impact on the Irish and British economies, with recent forecasts suggesting negative GDP growth of around 10% this year.</p> <p> The Government has taken extensive action to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit and in each of the last three budgets, provision was made to assist businesses to prepare for Brexit.  That provision includes a wide variety of soft and harder enterprise and financial interventions delivered mainly through the enterprise agencies.  At entry level, training, mentoring and consultancy advice has been provided, leading to financial assistance by means of vouchers, grants, short-term liquidity loans and longer-term loans to assist businesses to restructure and diversify into new markets beyond Britain.  Customs is another area in which we have been actively working on putting in place training programmes, as well as the Clear Customs initiative, which is designed to build sufficient capacity to deal with the new checks, controls and documentation that businesses will need post Brexit.</p></speech>

To what degree are he and his Department pursuing the alternative markets that are currently emerging and which might become available, with a view to identifying the best possible options as we proceed?  Given that it is in the interests of businesses to keep costs as low as possible, to what extent is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied that we are on the right road and are capable of meeting any challenges we might face?</p></speech>

If one looks back far enough, Britain was once our only significant trading partner and it now makes up about 17% or 18% of our trade, though that is a misleading figure because it is so important for certain sectors such as the food and drink sector, small manufacturers and many SMEs.  While our food sector still exports about 40% of everything we produce to Britain, there was a time when that was 70% or 80%.  Much progress has been made in that regard but we need to build on it.  As we are part of the eurozone, we need to develop trading links with more eurozone countries.  There are huge opportunities in our trade agreement with Canada and more opportunities in America, China and Asia as well.  The difficulty is that much of that work has been disrupted in the past few months because of Covid, as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland offices in Asia were closed and no site visits were happening.  Much of that work is now being done online but it is not the same and that has been quite disruptive.  The good news is that some of the offices in Asia are reopening this week.</p></speech>

Based on the experience I have had with Brexit negotiations up until now, I think there will be a deal but that it will come late in the day, maybe as late as October, November or December.  That is why we once again have to prepare for the risk of a Brexit with no trade agreement.  We unfortunately have had to march businesses up that hill a few times already but we need to be prepared for it if it happens and we are going to have to step that up again over the next few months.  I think there will be an agreement with the UK but whatever that agreement is, it will not include membership of the Single Market so it will be a diminution in the trading relationship and will mean checks and costs for businesses.  It will not be good news but hopefully it will be manageable rather than detrimental.</p></speech>

While I do not imagine for a minute that the answer will be easy or straightforward, it is something that should be investigated by the Department and should form part of the discussions around both the July stimulus and other measures as we move forward.  As the Minister said, this is only the first foray and then there will be more measures announced in October.  As we move forward, we want assurances from him that workers will be protected in the same way as he is going to move to protect businesses.</p></reply>

We referred to this last week.  Our number one focus is helping businesses to survive and keep their doors open and then to thrive thereafter as well.  That is the main focus but there are links to tax compliance in all the various grants, funds and opportunities given out by local enterprise offices, LEOs, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the local authorities.  Applicants have to show they have a tax certificate before the money is drawn down.</p>  <p>  Labour Court recommendations, which are not always legally binding, and outstanding Workplace Relations Commission awards are not linked to the drawdown of grants.  They are generally enforced by other sectors rather than Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or the local authorities.  There is other legislation to protect that area and those organisations do not track it.</p></speech>

We know that the Government knows how to respect workers' rights.  The question is whether it is going to use the power it has to enforce them.  I ask the Minister of State to imagine for a moment that he is a worker with an outstanding award from the Labour Court.  Such awards are rarely legally binding and are often modest.  It is a slap in the face for workers on low incomes who are awaiting payment of Labour Court awards to find their employers are in receipt of grants or special funding from the Government.  For many of those workers, their employers have simply walked away.  Would that Labour Court recommendations were legally binding but they are not, or very rarely are.  If a worker is a trade union member, he or she then has the opportunity to take industrial action in support of that decision, but that is a large undertaking, particularly for people who have just been out of work.  I ask the Minister of State to consider stitching in a mechanism that ensures the third-party mechanism of the State is respected.  I also ask that he adheres to the principle, to which the T&aacute;naiste alluded earlier, that when the State spends money, it will spend it where workers' rights are protected.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me about our agencies, whose number one job has been helping businesses survive and stay open over these last few weeks and months.  Only last week, the Deputy and many of her party colleagues were complaining that the application process for assistance was too cumbersome and involved too much red tape.  Our focus is on getting supports and help out as quickly as we possibly can.  While we expect all our applicants to honour State law and be tax compliant, Enterprise Ireland, LEOs and local authorities are not in a position to track everyone's responsibilities regarding the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission recommendations and I do not think the Deputy expects them to do so in the current climate.  She will probably be in here again next week demanding quick action and that is what we are trying to do.  A number of other agencies and people under our Department are also responsible for tracking employment legislation and employment law but they are not the ones in charge of getting the money out to the businesses as quickly as possible.  Again, our aim is to support businesses to stay open, reopen or restart and survive during these difficult times over the next six to 18 months.  They will then hopefully be in a position to grow again, expand and employ more people.  That is what we are trying to do here and we need to reach out to all those employers as quickly as we possibly can.  There is no proposal to add to the list of requirements they have to comply with to draw down funding at this moment in time.</p></speech>

"Economic growth accompanied by worsening social outcomes" is not worth having.  We fully respect and we will insist that extraordinary measures be taken in extraordinary times to sustain jobs, but it is not counterintuitive to insist that those are also decent jobs.  The recovery of which the Minister of State speaks will not be built on the back of the gig economy, precarious work or low-hours contracts.  It will instead be built on decent work, if it is to be sustainable, and he has a role in that regard.  Will he take on that responsibility?  I do not for a minute suggest that it will be easy and I also do not suggest that it should be so cumbersome that businesses will not be able to engage.  The Minister of State will have to give thought and regard to workers' rights for decent work as he proceeds with the stimulus package.</p></speech>

We take that very seriously in our Department.  We have several agencies that excel in their work in that area.  They have built up much experience and they work with our Department and other agencies.  Bodies such as our LEOs, local authorities, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have to focus on business development and growth and putting the money out.</p>  <p>  The majority of jobs created under the remit of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in recent years have been full time and high end.  Naturally, as a Government and a Government party for the past several years, we have been focused on decent jobs and wages.  Our track record will show where our focus has been and is.  We brought forward legislation on several occasions concerning industrial relations and protecting employees.  We have strengthened their position, if at all possible.  When it comes to pay and decent conditions, we have also not been behind the door in bringing forward four or five increases in the minimum wage.  We are, therefore, showing our focus by our actions.  Our focus now, however, has to be on getting the money out.  That is one arm of our Department.  The Deputy's question is about the fees concerning the action in the High Court, however, and that shows that we are very much committed to the issue of employee conditions.</p></speech>

Some businesses by their very nature, however, will not be able to get going until next year.  The events business is one of those businesses that involves crowds by definition, in many cases at big outdoor events but also big indoor events.  I refer to everything from weddings right to music events in Croke Park, St. Patrick's Day parades, etc..</p>  <p>  What are we going to do to sustain during this period businesses, such as events businesses, where opening is totally dependent on health advice?  Once things get back to normal, or whatever the new normal will be, we are going to need those events businesses.  We often see the musicians, but sometimes we do not see the people who make all the events happen.  </p></reply>

I recognise the difficulties and concerns that events businesses are facing and those businesses that rely on events companies for trade shows, exhibitions, events etc.. to promote and sell their products.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that measures are in place to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 at organised and ticketed events with members of the public attending is first and foremost a public health concern.  The Deputy is correct, however, to identify the real concern regarding the number of people working in the events industry.  Last week, I met representatives of the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC.  It is a new group, as the Deputy will be well aware of, because its representatives outlined how helpful he has been since its formation.  The group represents  3,500 full-time and 15,000 part-time employees.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that 2020 is a write-off for these companies because of the magnitude of the events in which the industry participates.  They are now facing the issue of skills retention, as well as issues in respect of brand Ireland because these companies promote Ireland in St. Patrick's Day parades, the new year's eve festival, etc.  It is important that the July stimulus recognises that this is also a critical sector of the economy.  As the T&aacute;naiste said earlier, the July stimulus will be ambitious, it will look at how we can protect employees and it will look at how we can expand the restart grant to accommodate people not normally accommodated.  I also refer to the credit guarantee scheme enabling businesses such as event companies to refinance.  I met them in that context, but I also asked officials in my Department to meet the representative groups in the days to come to see how we can support this industry in the future.  </p></speech>

The response requires urgent, decisive and comprehensive action at EU, national, regional and local levels.</p>  <p>  At a European level as part of the early response to Covid-19 on 23 March 2020 the European Commission triggered the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact and has adopted a temporary framework to enable member states to use the full flexibility foreseen under state aid rules.  Then, the European Central Bank, ECB, launched a pandemic emergency purchase programme, which is now worth &euro;1.35 trillion.  The European Council endorsed a further comprehensive package of measures amounting to &euro;540 billion on 23 April.  That package includes three safety nets to minimise the short-term economic consequences of the crisis for workers, businesses and member states: the European Stability Mechanism pandemic crisis support instrument; the new SURE instrument, which is the main subject of today's legislation and will protect jobs, workers and people's livelihoods; and the European Investment Bank, EIB, pan-European guarantee fund to support SMEs.</p>  <p>  These initiatives are in keeping with the commitments laid out in the programme for Government for a jobs-led recovery.  This will help families and households where jobs have been lost to return to work and ensure businesses that have weathered the Covid-19 storm can now grow and rebuild.  The July stimulus package will be unveiled shortly and will place the SME sector, which is the backbone of our economy and is central to our recovery, at its core.  There will be a specific focus on offering supports for the sectors of the economy worst affected by the pandemic.  The package will help to restore employment to the end of 2020 and will fund and progress our goals of decarbonising the economy, delivering balanced regional development and preparing for a digital future.  The legislation we are introducing today can complement the stimulus package in helping the economy and the country to recover.</p>  <p>  The EIB and the European Commission have already presented a support action plan amounting to &euro;40 billion to address the economic challenges resulting from the Covid-19 crisis.  However, given the gravity of the challenges facing the EU economy it has become apparent that far more is required.  To significantly and rapidly extend the EU support for struggling SMEs, mid-cap companies as well as corporate and public entitles the EIB has decided to establish a pan-European guarantee fund.</p> <p>This &euro;25 billion guarantee fund is designed to support those enterprises by leveraging up to &euro;200 billion of additional financing.  The EIB guarantee fund is for workers and business, and is designed to finance high-risk operations that are viable in the long term but vulnerable due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.  These will be primarily private sector operations with a focus on SMEs, although mid-caps and large corporates will also be eligible.<br/><br/>Public entities providing essential services, particularly those in the health, research and education sectors, that cannot be financed under existing EIB group products will also be eligible for support under the guarantee fund.  Geographic eligibility will extend to those EU member states that have agreed to participate in the fund by way of a contribution guarantee.  The fund will be implemented by the EIB in partnership with national promotional banks, in our case the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  In managing the fund, the EIB group plans to deploy a broad mix of products, including counter-guarantees for national promotional banks, venture debt, venture capital and private equity to fund working capital for the corporate sector.<br/><br/>All 27 EU member states are invited to participate in the guarantee fund.  The contribution from each member state will be in the form of a state guarantee of &euro;25 billion in proportion to its shareholding in the EIB.  As Ireland's shareholding in the EIB is 0.66%, our liability to the guarantee fund is capped at &euro;164.7 million.  Ireland's shareholding in the EIB was recently adjusted from 0.67% to 0.66%, which led to a corresponding reduction in our liability from &euro;167.5 million, based on a shareholding of 0.67%, to &euro;164.7 million.  This adjustment occurred as a result of two events that had a material impact on our shareholding in percentage terms: the UK's departure from the EU and the subsequent withdrawal of its shareholding, followed by two member states increasing their shareholding.  While our commitment to the guarantee fund is &euro;164.7 million in actual terms, provision in the proposed legislation is for an amount not to exceed &euro;167.5 million.  This offers a degree of flexibility should further shareholding variations occur.<br/><br/>The State guarantee is required to cover a degree of losses incurred in the implementation of the commercial operations of the guarantee fund.  The fund will be formally established once member states representing at least 60% of EIB capital make appropriate commitments.  Following Government approval on 29 May, Ireland gave a commitment in principle that it will, subject to the passage of legislation in the form of this Bill by the Oireachtas, participate in the guarantee fund.  Legislative provision is required for payments to be made out of the Central Fund to cover any calls on the guarantee provided by the State.  Where losses are incurred by the guarantee fund in the implementation of its operations, a call will be made on all of the member states' guarantees at the same time, given the pooled nature of the fund.  Any delay in payment beyond five days would incur interest penalties.  However, the EIB will provide a liquidity facility to allow member states time to make the necessary arrangements to cover the call on their guarantees.<br/><br/>Repayments and advances under this liquidity facility will take place on standardised dates once per quarter.  The maturity of each advance will be for a maximum of six months.  It is envisaged that the guarantee fund will be temporary in nature, with the initial investment period in place until 31 December 2021.  A prolongation by six months could take place if the majority of contributing member states do not object.  Any further prolongation would be subject to the agreement of all contributors.  The legislation to provide for Ireland's participation in the European instrument for a temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, otherwise known as SURE, and the &euro;25 billion EIB pan-European guarantee fund established by the EIB, and to provide for related payments from the Central Fund to cover both guarantees, is set out in sections 2 to 9, inclusive, of the Bill before the House.<br/><br/>On 7 April, the Government approved the drafting of an amendment to remove an ambiguity about the ability of the SBCI to offer guarantees without breaching the insurance Acts or regulations.  This was not considered necessary up to this point because the SBCI was only involved in a small number of risk-sharing schemes up to now.  It was already clear that risk-sharing schemes were going to become a larger part of the SBCI's offering in the coming years.  The current crisis has accelerated this process.  Following detailed discussions with the Offices of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel, it was decided that the most appropriate way to deal with this ambiguity was to amend the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014.  Taking this step will aid the development and deployment of new risk-sharing loan schemes, including schemes that may be backed by the EIB guarantee fund, to which this Bill is facilitating access for Ireland.  For this reason, the amendment will be included in section 10 of the Bill.<br/><br/>On a further clarification matter, section 11 of the proposed legislation includes a provision to allow for an award of the arbitral tribunal to be enforceable before the Irish courts in accordance with the Third Protocol to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe.  This provision is for the avoidance of doubt on the matter.<br/><br/>In recent years, legal opinions have been necessary in order for the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, to borrow from the Council of Europe Development Bank.  This provision will be important in allowing for and simplifying the potential future borrowing by the HFA and other State parties from the Council of Europe Development Bank.<br/><br/>The SURE instrument is intended primarily to support member states with efforts to protect workers and jobs, and also to support some health-related measures.  In the case of Ireland, the introduction of the temporary wage subsidy scheme has been important in supporting families and ensuring businesses can continue to trade.  These are the types of essential initiatives that can now be supported on a European level.  Under the proposal, SURE will provide financial assistance to member states of up to &euro;100 billion in total.  The Commission will borrow on financial markets to finance loans to member states at the same interest rate, allowing them to benefit from the EU's strong credit rating and low borrowing costs.  The loans are targeted to assist member states in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure caused by the pandemic in order to preserve employment, such as short-time work schemes and other measures put in place for the self-employed, and certain health expenditure.<br/><br/> SURE comes with safeguards to ensure fair and equitable access to funding for member states, with no more than &euro;60 billion available to any three member states under the proposal.  The loans will be underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantees for member states and no more than 10% of all loans would fall due for repayment in any one year.  For a lending volume of &euro;100 billion under the SURE instrument, &euro;25 billion in guarantee commitments are required from all member states collectively.  This guarantee mechanism ensures member states do not have to pay any money upfront.  The instrument will not become available until all member states sign up to their guaranteed amount.  These commitments will remain in place for the full term of the loans which they are underwriting.  Each member state contributes to the guarantee in proportion to its relative share in the total gross national income of the Union.  For Ireland, this will be equivalent to just over &euro;483 million.<br/><br/>SURE was adopted by ECOFIN Finance Ministers and published in the Official Journal on 19 May 2020.  While the SURE instrument is a regulation which is directly applicable to Ireland, signing the voluntary guarantee agreement will require enabling legislation.  This requirement stems from Article 11 of the Constitution which provides that all the revenues of the State &quot;shall be appropriated for the purposes and in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities determined and imposed by law&quot;.<br/><br/>As no member state can access SURE funding until all member states have signed the voluntary guarantee, the timeline for the introduction of this Bill is urgent.  I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 1 defines the commonly used terms in the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 2 outlines the circumstances for the application of section 8.  The EIB guarantee fund can be formally established when member states representing at least 60% of EIB capital have made public commitments.  Section 8 shall not apply unless and until that occasion occurs.<br/><br/>Section 3 allows the State to enter into the SURE guarantee and associated commitments and empowers the Minister for Finance to carry out the obligations associated with that guarantee.<br/><br/>Section 4 of the Bill permits the payment of a sum not exceeding &euro;483,401,250 in aggregate out of the Central Fund under the State's obligations under the SURE guarantee.<br/><br/>Section 5 ensures all moneys received by or on behalf of the State by way of repayment of sums paid in accordance with the SURE fund will be placed in the Central Fund to ensure the Exchequer has access to them.<br/><br/>Section 6 provides for reporting arrangements on the operation of Ireland's part of the SURE guarantee.  In the event of a demand being made under the guarantee, a report will be laid before the House within one month of payment of that demand and annually thereafter.  The report will consist of any information or any sum paid by the State or repaid to the State under the guarantee.  Each subsequent demand will be reported upon within one month in the same manner and is then included in the annual report.</p> <p>The reporting arrangement ceases when the SURE instrument expires and when all outstanding commitments by or to Ireland are exhausted.</p> <p>Section 7 confers on the Minister the power to enter into a contribution agreement and fund guarantee agreement with the European Investment Bank, EIB, for the purpose of committing to the pan-European guarantee fund.  The guarantee shall be based on Ireland's shareholding in the EIB, the aggregate not exceeding &euro;167.5 million, thereby capping the State's liability.  If any amendment is proposed to be made to the contribution agreement or the fund guarantee, a draft of the proposed agreement providing for the amendment and containing the text of the amendment shall be laid by the Minister before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the amendment shall not be made unless and until a resolution approving the amendment has been passed by this House.</p> <p> Section 8 permits payments related to the contribution agreement and fund guarantee to be made out of Central Fund for an amount not exceeding, in aggregate, the sum of &euro;167.5 million.</p> <p> Section 9 allows for any payments received by or on behalf of the State by way of repayment of sums paid in accordance with the contribution agreement and fund guarantee to be received by the Exchequer and to be returned to the Central Fund.</p> <p> Section 10 amends the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014 to remove an ambiguity with regard to the issuance of guarantees by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The amendment confirms that the Insurance Acts 1909 to 2018 and regulations relating to insurance made under the European Communities Act 1972 do not apply to guarantees made by the SBCI in the furtherance of its functions.</p> <p> Section 11 includes a provision to allow for an award of the arbitral tribunal to be enforceable before the Irish courts in accordance with the Third Protocol to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe.  This will allow and simplify potential future borrowing by the Housing Finance Agency and other State bodies from the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p> <p> Section 12 provides for the Short Title, the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill 2020, and its commencement.</p> <p> I am confident the measures to be outlined as part of the July stimulus package will help us to kick-start the economy post lockdown and set us on the path to recovery.  However, Ireland's response must also take account of the wider European Union and global context for recovery.  As a small open economy with a global outlook, Ireland depends on a rule-based international order and robust global trading frameworks.  A recovery at global and European levels will in turn support efforts at national level to restore the Irish economy to growth.  Our membership of the European Union, guaranteeing access to a Single Market of over 450 million consumers and the EU's network of free trade agreements covering 72 countries, is central to our prosperity and the success of our businesses.  Ireland will work with its EU partners to restore the European economy to growth and to ensure the smooth functioning of the Single Market.</p> <p> As a member of the eurozone, we share a common currency with 18 other member states with whom we will continue to engage closely in the development of economic and monetary union.  We also enjoy uniquely close ties with the United Kingdom and with the United States, enabling Ireland to act as a bridge between three major currency areas and to attract foreign direct investment.</p> <p> The Government will also draw on Ireland's membership of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions to shape the global economic recovery and maximise opportunities and supports for Irish business.  Engaging at the heart of the European Union with our fellow member states and strengthening our ties with the United Kingdom, the United States and a range of other global partners will play an important role in the Government's pursuit of national recovery and efforts to return the economy to growth.  Participation in SURE and the pan-European pandemic guarantee fund is essential to this recovery effort.</p> <p> To summarise, this Bill allows us to participate in two important EU Covid-19 pandemic response instruments.  It supports access for workers on short-term schemes and in struggling businesses and is a strong signal of our willingness to stand in solidarity with other European Union member states.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

However, before discussing the provisions of the Bill I wish to first comment on this broader response.</p>  <p>  On 23 March I wrote to the Minister for Finance outlining the set of principles and policies that should underpin the Irish response to the economic downturn created by this pandemic.  While it centred on specific domestic measures such as an income support scheme and financial assistance to business, I also addressed what I and Sinn F&eacute;in believed was the required response at a European level.  I said that the European fallout to the health crisis was a European problem requiring a European response.  This view was not just driven by the fact that Covid-19 pays no heed to borders, it was also a recognition that our fiscal response was constrained by a common fiscal framework.  Additionally, it was a recognition that a monetary response and much else was in the sole hands of the European Central Bank, ECB.  I made clear that if the level of debt refinancing necessary to deal with this crisis was to be possible, a radical departure from the past was necessary.  As the European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Mr. Paolo Gentiloni, has said, we need to face an extraordinary crisis with extraordinary tools.  I said in that correspondence that an essential tool in the kit would be in the hands of the ECB through its bond purchasing programme and I am pleased that the ECB, through its pandemic emergency purchase programme, has learned some of the lesson from the past and acted to ensure affordable levels of debt financing for member states such as our own.</p>  <p>  It is now crucial that the fiscal response at a European level is adequate to meet the challenge we face.  The Minister will play a crucial role in that response in his new role of president of the Eurogroup and if he we here, as I did privately, I would congratulate him on his appointment to that role.  I urge him to ensure that the interests of Ireland are represented and delivered upon in his new role.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us concerns access to capital to support workers and business that have been impacted by the economic fallout of Covid-19.  In particular, it will enable the State to participate in two instruments designed at European level, namely, the SURE scheme and the EIB guarantee scheme.  I will deal with each in turn and I note 140 pages of legislation with a very tight time for it to be scrutinised and a tighter time to make amendments.</p>  <p>  On 9 April the Eurogroup agreed to a &euro;540 billion fund to tackle the social and economic impacts of Covid-19.  This fund and the measure it provided for were endorsed by the European Council on 23 April.  Among them was SURE, temporary supports to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency.  This instrument will provide up to &euro;100 billion with the fund raised on capital markets by the European Commission.  While this will allow member states to benefit from low-cost borrowing due to the strength of Europe's collective credit rating, I wish to put on record that previous schemes financed by the Commission's borrowing from the capital markets came with damaging conditions attached.  One of them, of course, was the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, and we must ensure we never return to those austerity policies of the past.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify in his summing up remarks that there are no conditions or expectations of that nature with regard to signing up to these schemes.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Bill allows the State to enter the SURE guarantee and with the Minister granted all such powers required to perform the State's obligation under the scheme.  Under the agreement provided for in Schedule 1 the State will contribute in excess of &euro;483 million to avail of loans under SURE.  These loans are targeted to assist member states in financing sudden increase in spending caused by a pandemic, in particular, spending targeting short-term work schemes such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.</p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I ask the Minister to clarify the total values of loans or contribution we would be entitled to access, the criteria for use of the funds accessed under the loans and what quantum of loans the Minister intends would be permissible to draw down under this scheme.</p> <p> Under section 4, a contribution in excess of &euro;483 million will be paid out of the Central Fund under the terms of the SURE agreement.  On Committee Stage, I will speak to amendments that my party seeks to give the D&aacute;il greater oversight over payments made to the fund but I ask the Minister in due course to address a number of issues in this regard: the expected schedule of payments, their value and when they will be made under the provisions of the agreement, and similarly, the expected schedule of loans that will be drawn down under the scheme.</p> <p> The other instrument this legislation will provide for is access to the EIB Covid-19 pan-European guarantee fund, which formed part of the fund agreed by the Eurogroup on 9 April.  The fund will amount to &euro;25 billion and mobilise up to &euro;200 billion with a guarantee provided by each member state - a condition for access to the fund.  As section 7 sets out, our liability to the fund will be capped at &euro;168 million.  For us, this fund will be administered by the EIB in partnership with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p> <p> The guarantee fund will provide working capital to SMEs, to mid-caps and corporates that have been impacted by Covid-19.  While this is welcome, a number of issues require clarification.  Up to 23% of credit through the scheme will be earmarked for companies with over 250 employees and up to 7% to venture and growth capital funds, while at least 65% of the financing is earmarked for SMEs.  What clarification can be given that this credit will be accessible for small businesses that have been unable to access credit to date from banks that refuse to lend?  Also, I would appreciate if the Minister could provide clarity as to how financing under the scheme and its associated agreements can be incorporated into our own loan schemes and business supports.  Measures taken at a European level benefit from our own contributions, but also a lower cost of financing.  This will, in turn, benefit those businesses which are able to avail of financing under the EIB Covid-19 guarantee fund.  It is, therefore, essential that the benefits of the scheme are open to Irish small and medium-sized businesses, not only big business.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will not be opposing the provisions of the Bill.  We have argued before and since this crisis began for a social Europe that invests in its people and serves the interests of sovereign member states, not only big business or unaccountable elites.  We must ensure that the European response to this crisis serves those ends and provides for the issues I have raised in this speech and ensures that they are adequately addressed.  If they are, my party will support this Bill.</p> <p> However, there are a number of clarifications required.  There is a number of further details required that we need to tease out on Committee Stage, in particular, in relation to the loan guarantee scheme and how the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which, as we know, is not a bank but a non-lender, will provide loans to the main lenders here in the State, what type of guarantees will be provided and what type of loans will we see drawn down.  There is also reference to the Minister being able to set the type of lending criteria.  We need to hear more about how that will work and, crucially, because we will deal with the credit guarantee scheme, how this will all interact with domestic legislation.</p> <p> As I argued for in March last with the Minister, Europe had to step up.  I believe Europe is stepping up.  While there is much more that they can do and while we have concerns in relation to some of the expectations as a result of this here, we need to ensure that we get support to businesses as quickly as possible.  It is clear from any fair reading that this State is far behind when it comes to supporting its SMEs, which could have devastating consequences for those small and medium-sized enterprises and more devastating consequences for the workers who are hoping to return to full employment in these same businesses at a future date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400036#NN00200"><p>The provisions of this Bill which are designed to allow Ireland to access the various European funding supports are welcome but questions remain on whether they go far enough, how they will be utilised and to what end.  According to the OECD, average employment will remain below pre-crisis levels by the end of 2021, which is the date the initial investment period of the pan-European guarantee fund ends, after which time any extension will need to be approved by the contributors.  I have concerns that were this extension to need unanimous approval at a period when the crisis could be at its height, it could become the subject of a political battle among member states at the worst possible time and thus be dead in the water.  We should not forget the turmoil of the past decade over whether the eurozone itself would survive.  We need to remember that this affects people's lives.  Come December 2021, if the OECD's unemployment predictions prove to be correct, and I fear they may be overly optimistic, there will be people standing at the edge of the cliff not knowing what the future holds.</p>  <p>  We should be clear that the host of measures contained in this package, while welcome, are at best a workaround.  The proposals for eurobonds and the mutualisation of debt still represent the best way out of this quagmire and the European Stability Mechanism remains highly unpopular among member states due to all the conditional structural reforms it entails, which is code for fiscal austerity and a recipe for economic disaster.</p>  <p>  The European Investment Bank's pan-European guarantee fund will provide working capital to SMEs, which my party believes need to be supported during the crisis as they are the backbone of our economy.  For instance, rural Connemara will suffer considerably due to lack of tourism.  We need to ensure that the small and medium-sized businesses can get the funds they need to ride out the storm of the Covid crisis and ensure that they can survive and continue to provide jobs in their locality.</p>  <p>  For mid-caps and corporates that are deemed viable in the long term but are struggling due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the guarantee fund will also make funds available.  For these companies receiving funds, the way for the State to optimise its return should be through loans that are convertible to equity for the successful firms, while making provisions which allow these firms to buy these shares back at a later date.  All talk of fiscal prudence which does not seek to maximise the return to the State is just that; talk.</p>  <p>  It is also worth highlighting that the pan-European guarantee fund allows for 7% of its funds to be allocated to venture capitalists and private equity.  Given private equity's often poor track record of saddling companies with debt, stripping their assets, raiding their pension funds and then laying off their employees, what mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that this does not happen?  From my perspective, we need to ensure that this funding goes to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>  <p>  The SURE scheme temporary support to mitigate unemployment risk is to be welcomed as it seeks to save jobs, and as we know from the previous crisis, a failure to protect jobs is a failure to protect people's livelihood and a sure-fire way to exacerbate economic inequality.  Nevertheless, it mandates that every member state contributes to the guarantee in proportion to its relative share in the total gross national income of the Union.  As a result, it is estimated that we will be putting &euro;483 million into this scheme.  As has now been well documented, GNI is a poor measure of the health of the Irish economy - something that has even been acknowledged by the Central Statistics Office which has constructed its own modified GNI measure which attempts to remove distortion from profit-shifting.  Unfortunately, for Ireland, the latter measure is not used internationally, meaning the standard over-inflated GNI measure will be utilised and Ireland is likely to contribute more and potentially receive less funding due to the inaccurate picture of the economy.  I hope the Minister will raise that with his European counterparts.</p>  <p>  In closing, I wish to raise two general concerns.  First, there is a likely reluctance on the part of the Government to draw down as much funds as possible due to its conservative ideological bias, which runs the risk of not providing enough investment to counteract the downturn.  In other words, the risk is that we do too little rather than too much.  Second, the more market-friendly approach that this Government will take means that these de facto State subsidies could be used to support the private sector's interest at the expense of public enterprise.  We should not forget the crises in housing, education and the healthcare sector.  These are the front-line staff who we were quick to clap but slow to reward.  We should be clear that what these funds constitute is massive State subsidies to Europe's private sector.  Following the previous crisis, as the public sector was forced to bail out the financial sector, that same sector then turned around and told us that the large public debts and deficits were evidence that we were living beyond our means.  This has accurately been described as the biggest bait-and-switch in history.  Today, European states will not be bailing out the financial sector, but in many cases the wider corporate sector.  I would certainly hope that many of these corporates will remember that in a few years' time when the austerians come calling.</p></speech>

As it was only published last week, we only had two working days to submit amendments.  I know it is necessary legislation but I request that the Minister and the Department consider the difficulties this has created for Deputies and for their staff behind the scenes.  </p> <p> I will focus my remarks on the European Investment Bank, EIB, guarantee fund.   The new pan-European guarantee fund to tackle the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic is a welcome development.  The fund was endorsed by the European Council on 23 April as part of the overall EU Covid-19 response package.  It is timely to see it embedded in our own legislation so we can gain access to those funds under the new guarantee fund.  When will the contributors' committee decide on the use of the guarantee?  For what purposes will it allow the EIB guarantee fund to be used?</p> <p> The economic damage done by the Covid-19 pandemic becomes more visible every day.  Our microbusinesses, SMEs and family businesses are fighting for survival.  They need an immediate injection of liquidity.  Most of these businesses have spent a decade working through the debts and loans they accumulated during the previous recession.  As a result of this, for them it is a case of once bitten, twice shy.  These businesses are very reluctant to take on significant debt.  They remember all too well the implications of the last recession and what it was like.  The trauma has stayed with many of them.  They need a liquidity injection through grants or other mechanisms.  These are businesses that were viable.  They were closed for public health reasons rather than because they could not trade successfully.  They want to get back to work.  Liquidity injections need to be the focus of a lot of the short-term measures and must form part of the July stimulus.</p> <p> Across Europe, we see countries unveiling significant economic stimulus packages.  In Britain, we have seen a package of approximately &pound;30 billion announced to invest in the economy in order to save sectors and return them to something like their pre-Covid-19 state.  Countries such as Germany and Denmark have gone even further and are investing massive sums of money in targeted and imaginative ways to stimulate their economies.  The Germans have launched a &euro;130 billion stimulus package while Denmark aims to ensure its stimulus package will deliver a severely reduced economic contraction that will be lower than the European average.</p> <p> While the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste should look at the positive aspects of the British stimulus package, it is our European Union counterparts' economic stimulus packages we should focus on.  This will require the State to borrow; however the cost of not investing in affected sectors will be far greater and will cost the State more in both the short and long terms.</p> <p> Will the Minister of State convey to the Minister for Finance the need to follow our European counterparts and deliver an economic stimulus package, specifically targeting microbusinesses and SMEs in affected sectors, that is both expansive and imaginative and which will also allow businesses to recover, reinvest and re-employ?</p> <p> In addition to the EIB guarantee fund, we need to see more support from the European Union.  The Minister for Finance was recently elected president of the Eurogroup.  This role brings a new range of responsibilities and, we hope, opportunities.  Will the Minister of State confirm that, through his new role, the Minister for Finance will push for additional supports from the EU?  Will those appeals request a support mechanism such as eurobonds?  </p> <p> States are borrowing money and are going to have significant deficits of at least 10% of their GDP without the power to issue the currency in which their public debt is denominated.  The European Central Bank enjoys the power of monetising public debts, a privilege which eurozone members do not enjoy.  Eurobonds have been suggested as a way to tackle the financial difficulties created by the Covid-19 crisis.  They would allow states to borrow new funds at better conditions, supported by the overall rating of states across the eurozone.  Will the Minister of State ask the senior Minister to use his position as both Minister for Finance and president of the Eurogroup to challenge the opposition to eurobonds?</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose this Bill.  I hope the supports from the EU are only the first in a range of measures that will ensure social and economic progress and the recovery of member states.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400037#OO00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment and wish him well in his work and in his term of office at a very important time for our country.  I confirm that the Labour Party will not oppose this legislation.  We support its merits and what it is designed to do.</p><p>I noted with interest the book review by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in <i>The</i><i>Irish Times</i>this weekend of <i>The Economics of Belonging </i>by Martin Sandbu.  He cited a particular relevant passage, which I will read out.  It states &ldquo;Those turning against the western order are those who feel left behind in it, but not just that: they feel left behind by their own &ndash; betrayed by the elites who constructed the system and were entrusted with making it deliver.&rdquo;  The Minister noted that, according to this analysis, the causes of this challenge are primarily economic.  The Minister wrote &quot;The promise of economic advancement, through a secure job, rising income or an affordable home, has diminished for too many.&quot;  These phenomena referenced by the Minister in his book review last weekend should come as no surprise to anyone who served in the last Government, a government supported by the Minister of State's own party, albeit from the outside.  </p><p>The challenges outlined by Mr. Sandbu in that publication are very real.  Covid-19 risks further exacerbating the feelings of those left behind economically, particularly our young people, who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic fallout from this public health crisis.  As the T&aacute;naiste outlined and admitted in recent weeks, the pandemic has the potential to cause further divisive inequality, which may ultimately fuel the rise of the kinds of far-right populism and far-left populism we are seeing develop across western societies at present.  </p><p>The forthcoming July stimulus therefore has to be the start of a new social contract that restores the promise of economic advancement through a secure job, rising incomes and affordable home ownership in a new, sustainable economic model.  Short-term working and training schemes will be pivotal in providing such secure employment opportunities in the months and years ahead.  The EU Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency, SURE, scheme, which was first proposed by our collective of sister parties across Europe, the Party of European Socialists, will be a key funding mechanism to make such systems a reality.</p><p>I therefore welcome the legislation before us this evening, although it is coming two months after the scheme was initially announced at EU level.  For months now, others in the Labour Party and I have been calling, on the record of this House and in the local and national media, for a reformed short-term work and training scheme similar to the German model which proved so successful in supporting businesses and workers throughout the last economic crisis.  International evidence from the OECD suggest that the key element of its success was concurrent access to vocational training, which the current temporary wage subsidy scheme lacks.  Last month's confirmation of the incorporation of apprentices into the wage subsidy scheme is a welcome step in the right direction but it does not go nearly far enough.  Under the equivalent Dutch scheme, for example, employers are obliged to support retraining or reskilling opportunities for all employees.  Similarly, France has introduced a special training subsidy as part of its scheme to help companies undergoing structural changes that need to reskill or upskill their workforces.  </p><p>The Government must prioritise this area in the upcoming July stimulus package.  Specifically, we need to both oblige and support companies to invest in the skills of new and existing employees, for example via the uptake of accessible online training programmes.  All of the evidence shows that this will lead to greater productivity, higher wages, and greater job security as employers seek to retain the skilled workers in whom they have invested over many years.  </p><p>Ireland has one of the lowest rates of in-work training and upskilling in the EU.  It is estimated at only 5.5% compared with 17% in the UK, 20% in France, and as high as 33% in Denmark.  To take digital skills for example, despite our current status as a hub for multinational technology firms and the fact that nine out of ten jobs in the future will require a degree of digital expertise, more than half of our population lack basic digital skills and only 79% are able to use the Internet, which is one of the lowest levels in the EU.</p> <p>Digital literacy issues do not just have an economic consequence but a social and cultural impact as well.  Likewise, more than a third of workers in sectors such as financial services have not been provided with any training and development on technology according to the Financial Services Union working conditions survey of 2019.  In addition, Ireland currently spends well below its EU peers when it comes to investing in human capital and the innovative capacity of young people.  This is the real threat to our future competitiveness when it comes to attracting, sustaining and maintaining the high levels of foreign direct investment we all want to promote and maintain.  As part of the July stimulus, the Government should target schemes to immediately address the current digital skills shortage caused by years of chronic underinvestment and a lack of in-work training.</p> <p> We must also seek to develop new technological universities such as Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, in my constituency, in collaboration with the multinational corporations that locate here so that the new technological universities evolving throughout the country are delivering and instilling in young people the kind of skill sets our economic model and national industrial strategy will require.</p> <p> Another essential element of a reformed short-term working scheme that I hope can be funded through this enabling legislation must be the introduction of limitations on economic dismissals, in essence, redundancies, during the crisis.  A ban on lay-offs was introduced as early as March in Italy and Spain and later in France, the Netherlands and other EU states.  Such measures are needed to reassure workers in a period of strong anxiety while also limiting the opportunistic behaviour of some employers who have used or may use the crisis as an excuse to dismiss difficult workers.  We have already witnessed large-scale dismissals in the context of Debenhams and National Pen in my constituency, organisations which in my view have ruthlessly used the Covid-19 crisis as cover to cull workers without any meaningful consultation whatsoever.  Any reformed short-term working scheme must ensure that both workers and the public purse are protected.  For example, under the Dutch scheme to which I referred earlier, if an employer dismisses a worker on economic grounds, the employer must pay back 100% of the compensation that it received.  In addition, agreement with trade unions and worker representatives must be reached before any large-scale lay-offs of 20 or more employees.</p> <p> On several occasions in recent weeks I asked the Minister for Finance if he would consider such a clawback mechanism as part of the wage subsidy scheme, to which he replied that he had no plans to do so.  I am interested in the Minister's view on this issue and if the Department of Finance has revised its thinking on this since the Minister for Finance replied to me and if this forms part of the Government's thinking on the July stimulus package.  Likewise, I have repeatedly made the case that social and environmental conditionality should be attached to the wage subsidy scheme and other initiatives that may be undertaken by the Government and that there also needs to be a comprehensive audit of companies receiving the scheme to ensure they have met the stated criteria.  On the latter point, I am pleased that the Minister has been reasonably vocal in recent weeks on a compliance programme as part of the operation of the wage subsidy scheme.  I am interested in an update on this if it is to hand.</p> <p> Regarding the question of conditionality, governments in other EU countries such as Denmark and France, and Scotland refused to grant public aid such as wage subsidy schemes to businesses registered in tax havens.  Programmes under the SURE scheme will attract considerable funding from the State via the Union.  The states I referred to are wisely making use of aid conditionality as an incentive for the enforcement of their own fiscal rules and EU fiscal rules, and so should we, in particular in light of tomorrow's Apple tax ruling and the international crackdown on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by some multinational corporations.  Does the Department have plans to attach any kind of conditionality at all, for example, to a reformed short-time working scheme or any of the other programmes that will be brought forward as a result of the passage of this legislation and the funding of other such programmes that I expect to be announced in the coming days?</p> <p> That is an important point.  Many other countries across Europe have attached that kind of conditionality and it seems that we are entirely uninterested in doing that.  It is reasonable that we use the opportunities presented to us now to paint a picture of a better future and to attach conditions to massive State investment in the interests of achieving some positive public policy gains.  Many significant opportunities will arise for this country from the passage of the legislation and we need to use them to paint a picture of a better future and reshape our future to make sure that people are paid reasonable wages, that their rights in the workplace are respected and that the social and environmental objectives we have, which I hope we share across this Chamber, are achieved and that the post-pandemic Ireland of the future looks better than the Ireland of the recent past.</p></speech>

The Social Democrats will not oppose the Bill.  We are considering it in the most extraordinary of circumstances, at a time the economic shock from the crisis is being felt not only by Ireland or a small handful of other countries but by every nation around the world.  Covid-19 has ushered in an unprecedented time of solidarity and that is a welcome by-product.  That solidarity, which is a very welcome development, is unprecedented in European economic history.  It is a very much changed environment and changed attitude since 2008 and it has resulted in the issuance of collective debt.</p>  <p>  This is a time for new ideas and new ways forward and that is very much welcome.  I hope the Government will be part of that new way of thinking and new approaches because we desperately need them to work our way back to recovery.  It cannot be a case of going back to the old ways of doing things; we must take a new approach to ensuring that we have a vibrant economy but also a fair and vibrant society.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the use of two instruments of the Eurogroup financial package, which were agreed on 9 April &ndash; the SURE fund of &euro;100 billion and the EIB guarantee fund of &euro;200 billion.  The legislation does not provide for the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, the third arm of the Eurogroup package.  This fund is worth &euro;240 billion, just under half of the total Eurogroup package.  It is a bailout fund, established in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, which is now being deployed as a pandemic credit line to help finance health costs incurred in fighting Covid-19.  The ESM is not mentioned in this Bill or in any of the supporting documents shared with Members.  The Minister has stated that the Government has no intention at present to borrow under the ESM because we can borrow reliably from the international markets at real rates that are more favourable than the ESM.  This is good and shows Ireland's favourable standing and relative economic health.  If the circumstances arise whereby Ireland no longer has easy access to low-interest rate funds on the market and needs to avail of the ESM, do further provisions needs to be made in legislation to allow the country to draw down these funds?  Could the Minister of State confirm, therefore, that the European Stability Mechanism Acts of 2012 and 2014 make sufficient provision for access to the ESM in this scenario and that access can be guaranteed by issuing a request for assistance from the Government, which does not require further legislation?</p>  <p>  I wish to move on to our domestic circumstances.  On Friday next, the European Council will meet to discuss the economic response to the pandemic and the &euro;750 billion recovery package, which is in addition to the &euro;540 billion package this legislation is dealing with.</p> <p>There has been a good deal of discussion on this already and the compromise position contains several important changes to the original proposal.  Of particular importance for Ireland is a Brexit reserve fund of &euro;5 billion which will be set aside primarily for the benefit of Belgium and Ireland.  This is a success on Ireland's part and very prudent given the damage a no-deal Brexit may cause to our economic recovery.  However this benefit also raises an important point about the approach that the recovery plan should take.  Just as our domestic circumstances surrounding Brexit have been taken into account, Ireland should by the same measure and in solidarity, push for the domestic circumstances of other member states to be taken into account in their recovery plans.<br/><br/>The last decade showed that a one-size-fits-all form of recovery and resilience does not make sense for a diverse collection of economies like the EU.  We should not make that mistake again.  The President of the European Council has proposed that the funds will be linked to stronger enforcement of the rule of law.  This provision has provoked a strong reaction from some member states, including Ireland, which are considered to be acting outside the European law.  I urge the Minister and the Government to support this provision.  Given Ireland's commitment to the rule of law and human rights generally, we should be calling for their inclusion in the final package.<br/><br/>In planning for the overall EU fiscal response, there is a prudent discussion to be had about the value of balancing grant aid and debt-based lending.  There has been a certain amount of discussion about this at European level and whatever happens in that regard will feed into the domestic situation also.  The group SME Recovery spoke recently to the Special Committee on the Covid-19 Response, making several good points on the importance of grant-based lending for small business.  The current supports in Ireland are based primarily on debt-based lending whereas other European countries have introduced more grant supports, which in turn encourages take-up.<br/><br/>Many SMEs in Ireland are simply not in a position to take on further debt, meaning an over-reliance on debt-based lending to business will not be appropriate.  It is really important to get this balance right, and not just domestically - we need to be arguing for that at European level as well.  I support and commend what the previous Government did in its rapid fiscal response to this crisis but many of the support schemes have been adapted from plans originally drawn up for a hard Brexit scenario.  At this point, given the crisis we are facing at the moment, those schemes are not fit for purpose.  We need to focus on ensuring the schemes are adapted for the current crisis and provide sufficient grant support to SMEs, which are so vital to our domestic economy and for job creation and retention.<br/><br/>It was interesting to note that the former Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, last week urged deeper spending to combat the fiscal crisis that is looming.  He said that there &quot;should be no loss of nerve in fully deploying the financial resources of the State and its borrowing capacity&quot; and that it &quot;would be a very big mistake to use the previous crisis as a model for how the public finances should be managed,&quot;.  We ignore that advice at our peril.  Professor Honohan made the point that if governments attempt to limit expenditure once the immediate danger has passed, it will simply exacerbate the economic slump.  We have the ability now, from EU support as well as borrowing on the private markets, to borrow substantial amounts of money on a long-term basis at rates that are effectively close to zero.  This has enormous potential.  It has the potential to reposition our economy significantly.<br/><br/>We will only attract investment if we have a strong stimulus and long-term growth plan.  I was very concerned when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, spoke a number of months ago about the need to return to a balanced budget in the medium term.  That is not the kind of thinking that is required at the moment.  The then Taoiseach spoke about borrowing leading to nervousness on the part of investors, and that has no basis either.  Given the current economic circumstances, which are very favourable and benign, it makes no sense whatsoever not to borrow in significant amounts and invest in our economy.  Ensuring growth in our economy is the one sure way to attract foreign direct investment or domestic investment.  The aim has to be significant growth over the coming years.<br/><br/>Any attempt at retrenchment or any mention of austerity will simply weaken our standing and turn off investors.  We should know at this point that austerity measures stunt growth.  Ireland raised &euro;1.5 billion in debt last Thursday.  That comprised three separate issuances with terms of seven, ten and 30 years.The 30-year debt, which was raised at 0.6%, was oversubscribed by nearly three times.  This is a significant demand for Irish debt of long duration at low yields.  We should be taking full advantage of this by borrowing extensively and spending the capital now to invest in our long-term growth and prosperity.  A few weeks ago, Austria raised &euro;2 billion in a bond auction with a maturity of 100 years and that was priced below 1%.  That auction was more than ten times oversubscribed.  We should be learning from that and from what a number of our EU counterparts are doing.  We should avail of the wonderful opportunities presented to us now to invest significantly in our economy.<br/><br/>The Covid-19 committee heard from the NTMA that the State is in a very strong position to meet its borrowing requirements.  It said that most important fundamentals for investors in deciding whether to lend to Ireland and on what terms have not changed and are the country's growth potential and its fiscal policy over the long term.  All these factors point to the same conclusion.  Given the low interest rates available on Ireland&rsquo;s debt, the Government should borrow extensively and spend deeply to provide support for the economy at this time.  Deputy Nash referred to the book review done by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I would like to recommend to the Minister, and indeed to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, another book that would be well worth their while reading.  It is quite a short book called <i>Angrynomics </i>and it is by two Irishmen, Mr. Eric Lonergan and Mr. Mark Blyth.  It talks about establishing a national wealth fund.  This idea has also been promoted by a number of very respected economic commentators, including Dr. Aidan Regan in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>just last week.The idea is to establish a national wealth fund supported by the issuance of Government debt.</p> <p>The goal of the fund would be to make long-term strategic investments, which would provide a return either to the State or to the public directly.  The proposal is based on the economic theory that when the rate of interest grows faster than the economic growth rate the rich get richer and wealth inequality grows.  This is because people who are lucky enough to receive an inheritance will be able to invest their assets and see them grow in value over time, while those without an inheritance will work for years to save a lump sum, which will most likely be put forward as a deposit on an overpriced house.  They will continue to work and wait more than 30 years to pay off the mortgage debt to own that asset.</p> <p> A fair and functioning market economy should lead to a wider distribution of wealth but the reality we see is that wealth inequality and inherited wealth put the majority of our population lifetimes behind those who are born into economic privilege.  Creating a national wealth fund could combat growing wealth inequalities by having the State invest assets on behalf of Irish society and then distributing the capital returns to citizens.  There is no better time to create this national wealth fund than right now.  The Government has the ability now to issue long-term bonds at what is effectively a rate of 0%.  We saw that the debt issued last week was oversubscribed.  Even if the compound interest was only 5%, the State could repay debt issued to create the fund in less than 15 years.  At that point, the State would own all of the assets it had invested in and all capital returns would go back to Irish society.  Every citizen would have a share of the national wealth, meaning everyone would effectively have an inheritance to provide seed capital funding for a business or a house deposit, thereby being set up for future careers and prosperity.  Now is the time to take a new approach to create a fairer and more equal society.  It is within reach of the Government and would dramatically improve the livelihoods of Irish people and the long-term growth of our economy.</p> <p> It is also very important that in rebuilding our economy, we ensure the regrowth and recovery are jobs rich but also are worker centred.  There are measures beyond strict spending and taxation that the Government must take to improve our economy and public finances.  We need to focus on a worker-centred recovery in order that as people return to work and the economy reopens, people's living standards and work-life balance are also improved.  A right to collective bargaining and greater employee led decision making will not only ensure that workers have better conditions but will also lead to greater productivity and greater competitiveness in the economy.  We need to ensure that workers have the right to flexible working conditions, especially in the aftermath of Covid-19 when working from home has become the norm for so many.  Initiatives such as flexitime, a four-day working week and options to work from home on a long-term basis could also go a long way to improving working conditions.  Equally important is the right to switch off and enshrining this in legislation.</p> <p> Younger people in Ireland undoubtedly have taken the brunt of this crisis and it is very important to prioritise their needs.  People in their late 20s and 30s are experiencing a second deep recession.  They paid a significant price at a very important stage at the start of their adulthood and the start of their careers in the last recession.  They are now knocked back again.  We know from the figures that it is the younger generation who have paid the highest price in this crisis.  They must be the priority in our recovery.</p> <p> The provision of public services must be seen as a major element of any recovery and any stimulus package.  Investment in the public sector and good quality public services not only ensures that people's rights to a decent standard of living are upheld but we also must recognise that the State is a major employer and a major purchaser of services, which in turn can create a huge stimulus for the private sector.  Ensuring people have access on a universal basis to public services without cost at the point of use means we take a lot of heat out of wage demands and ensure a greater level of competitiveness throughout the economy.</p> <p> There are many other things we need to do in addition to the stimulus package but we must take the broader view.  The recovery must be person centred and I hope the Minister of State will take on board many of the proposals made this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400040#RR00200"><p>I am not sure whether my colleagues are coming in to share the time but if they do I will share it.  We do not oppose the legislation.  I welcome the fact that apparently, some lessons were at least partially learned from the follies of the response of the European Union, its member states and here in Ireland to the crisis in 2008 and the austerity that followed it.  We need not return to austerity but instead to inject money into maintaining jobs, investing in services and adopting Keynesian policies rather than fiscal austerity policies.  This is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  The two specific mechanisms or schemes we are talking about include the EU's SURE scheme, focused on supporting schemes to keep people in work, which is absolutely right and it is absolutely critical that we do so.  I understand there is also some expenditure on occupational health and the pan-European guarantee fund to support and finance small and medium enterprises primarily, although notably it also refers to middle and large scale companies.  This may be justified but I will make a few points about how we do have to distinguish in our supports between the small enterprises that really need the help and big enterprises.  We should not subsidise highly profitable entities and they should have to pay us back.  We need to distinguish between those that are very small and facing an existential threat to their survival, which should not have strings attached to that support and should get all of the support we can give to sustain their existence through this difficult period, and large companies and corporations that can often benefit from these schemes but do not need them and perhaps do not recognise their obligations to everybody else in terms of paying back that support.  In this regard, I cannot help but comment on the day that is in it.</p> <p>Much of this is still about borrowing money.  I support borrowing money and injecting it into the economy.  Interest rates are low and the various schemes are about giving low interest finance to states and to business, to schemes to keep people in work or, indeed, as the Government is also intending to do, to just borrow on the markets.</p> <p> However, we should put some provisos on the debt financing of stimulus.  I cannot help commenting on the irony of where we are.  It is not so long ago that the same EU and the Governments that included the two major parties in this country, who are now promoting this more Keynesian approach, were telling us that we had to stay with a fiscal austerity model, that one could not debt finance one's way out of a crisis, it was dangerous to do it and that it would produce an unsustainable debt burden and put us in a very vulnerable position.  Now it appears all that caution and prudence have gone out the window and it is a case of borrow, borrow, borrow.  Members should not misunderstand me.  I disagreed with the fiscal austerity model when it was proposed and some of us warned that the time was not far away when people would realise the folly of the fiscal treaty and that it would be necessary to borrow and break through the fiscal treaty parameters to deal with an economic crisis such as the one we faced.  Here we are, and suddenly all the rules can be broken.  It is difficult not to comment on the irony of that.</p> <p> However, here we are and lessons seem to have been learned.  Ironically, I now find myself in the "let us be a little prudent" camp.  Debt financing cannot go on forever.  One eventually has to pay the piper.  Somebody is always making money when one borrows money.  It is rich people who are making money.  It is the people with inherited wealth and the vast accumulations of profit, and who are looking for somewhere to sustain and increase the value of that, who are lending us the money and want to be repaid.  There is an alternative to that, and the &euro;18 billion that the EU will decide on tomorrow brings that into sharp relief.  We would not need to borrow the vast amounts of money we are about to borrow, or are in the process of borrowing, if we took the &euro;13 billion plus interest from Apple.  We would not incur this debt burden and all the interest.</p> <p> It is worth saying that because it is those accumulations of wealth and capital that we are borrowing from at interest.  It might not be Apple directly but wherever it puts its money, such as some wealth asset management outfit which lends it to governments such as ours or to the European Union and is then paid interest on it.  It is constantly accumulating its wealth.  We could, and I believe we should, short-circuit that process somewhat by just taking back the tax money it owes us.  We would not have to borrow so much, and it would transform our situation.  It is important to say that, particularly because the Government, after tomorrow, is very likely to be faced with a decision on whether it will appeal that judgment.  One cannot separate the considerations the Government has in that regard and the discussion we are having now because it has a direct bearing in terms of how much we have to borrow.  I say we should borrow less and make the big corporations pay their fair share of taxes.  We could still fund the stimulus that we absolutely must have.</p> <p> The other thing I wish to say, and there is some acknowledgement of it in these two schemes, is something we must write large.  Much of the talk on stimulus, understandably and correctly, is focused on private business, SMEs and so forth.  I agree with that.  They are on the floor, they need help and they should get that support, so Members should not misunderstand what I am saying.  However, there appears to be a complete failure most of the time to acknowledge that the public sector is part of the plan to get us out of this crisis, or it should be.  Investment in that area is critical.  Often the two are set against each other.  At the most obvious level, we must recognise that this is true.  What we learned during Covid-19 is that if our health service is not able to cope or is even threatened with the situation of not being able to cope with the health needs of our society, the entire economy, or most of it, shuts down.  That is not an equation that most people would have accepted up to now.  There was the attitude that too much money was going into the public sector and that what we needed to do was support the entrepreneur, as if the two were at odds with each other.  What we have learned, and I hope we never forget it, is that the private sector effectively shuts down if our health service is not able to cope.  We had better learn the lesson going forward - God, I hate that expression - because this could have an immediate impact on everything we are discussing here.  All the stimulus in the world of small enterprise will be meaningless if our health service is overrun in the autumn because of a second wave and the economy has to be shut down again.  It will all be pointless, and this discussion will be rendered meaningless.</p> <p> What we know, as we learned from repeated testimony at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, and what I hope we do not forget in the rush and understandable desperation to get the economy back up and running, is that our public health service is running at such critically low levels of capacity that it would not take much for that system to be overrun.  You will be aware of the famous graph, a Cheann Comhairle.  We have to raise the capacity part of that graph very significantly.  It is not just about the level of infection, but the level of infection related to the capacity of the health service to deal with it.  Critically in that regard, while some of it is capital capacity, such as building the physical infrastructure and having the ventilators, most of it is staff.  We must urgently recruit staff to the health service to increase ICU and bed capacity, to put staff capacity levels into the nursing home sector, recruit general practitioners and so forth to provide the cradle to the grave healthcare that is able to cope with the type of situation we are in at present.  If we not do that as a matter of urgency, all this stimulus will be irrelevant if there is a second wave.</p> <p> In that focus on the role of the public sector in sustaining the wider economy, one could make the same point about education.  If we have to shut down the schools and the universities again, all of this will be irrelevant.  If childcare has to shut down again, this will be irrelevant because people will be at home minding the children and unable to get out to work.  What if we have to shut down public transport?  As the Government and, indeed, the EU are considering what they are going to do with these funds, they must understand that a huge part of the stimulus programme must be a massive increase in investment in the capacity of key public services and infrastructure to deal with the crises we are facing now and in the foreseeable future.  I sincerely hope that lesson is learned.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> It is critically important we channel these supports towards the people who have fallen through the cracks.  This was put very well by the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC, the events people who organise gigs, the music industry and so on, when it appeared before the Covid committee and by the representatives of the arts sector.  I refer to the individual sole trader, the musician, the small business with a van but no premises and which is not rateable and so on.  They are not getting the supports and have in some cases been excluded from them.  The supports need to be directed at them because they are in serious trouble.  Taxi drivers cannot avail of any of the SME supports because they do not have rateable premises and because of something to do with VAT which, frankly, I do not fully understand.  For that reason they do not get the supports, but they need them and they face going under.</p> <p> We will support the Bill, or at least not oppose it.  The Government, however, needs to prevent an unnecessary debt burden by making some of those who can afford to do so pay their taxes.  I refer to Apple but also to some in the corporate sector who have not suffered, even in this crisis.  Certain sectors have done very well.  I believe that corporate tax receipts have held up remarkably and surprisingly well because certain industries have not really been hit.  The small guys - the people who have lost their jobs and their livelihoods - have been hit but some of the big corporations are actually doing well out of this crisis.  They should make a solidarity contribution to the rest of society.  We could finance some of the stimulus we need that way rather than just borrowing huge amounts of money and paying interest, directly or indirectly, probably to those very same people.  We need to recognise the role of the public sector, public services and public infrastructure investment in terms of stimulus and not see this just in terms of the private sector.  We need to support the people who are falling through the cracks.</p> <p> Lastly, we need to make sure that all this support is linked to decent wages and conditions for workers and their trade union rights.  There should be no question of giving support to entities that do not respect the rights of workers to be paid properly, have proper terms and conditions and be represented by the union or organisation of their choice.  That is absolutely critical and should be a condition imposed on these stimulus supports.</p></speech>

He is probably the youngest Minister of State in the Government.  I hope he does well.  Is he not the youngest?  There you go.  I will not ask who is, but I congratulate him and hope it works out well for him.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill as it stands, and the Regional Group certainly will support it.  I get very concerned, though, when I look at Covid from day to day, everything that is happening, whether we go up or down and the increasing numbers.  I really worry about the fallout we face as an economy, particularly for our SME sector.  For its staff and customers, Covid is a huge concern.  There are 250,000 SMEs in the country, providing 1.2 million jobs, and 68% of those jobs are outside of Dublin.  We are therefore very much reliant on the SME sector, particularly tourism and hospitality, in the country.  The tourism and hospitality sector accounts for 266,000 jobs, 9,300 of which are in Wexford.  A large number of the businesses have already closed and others do not know where they are.  They all have similar challenges when I speak to them.  Many of the SME sectors have three things in common at the moment.  One is the lack of cash flow, the second is short-term working capital and the third is liquidity.  Those are their major concerns when I discuss any type of financing with them.  They all say similar things about Covid finance, whether it be the restart package, the microenterprise Bill or this Bill which, being 142 pages long, I did not exactly get to look at in depth.  Their fear, and what they all say in commonality, is that the interest rates for all the finance packages are too high.  They cannot afford or are not able to meet the loan requirements and do not have enough business to generate the repayments even if they could get the loans.  We must be mindful that the interest rate on the money being provided through microenterprise financing is above 4%.  It might sound cheap and we might say interest rates are low, but that is not cheap for a struggling business that is probably at the bare minimum of 30% of its pre-Covid footfall, depending on cash flow.  That is not cheap finance.  As the Minister of State will have heard me say previously in the House, insolvency experts have said that the restart package should have been ten times what it was.  My concern is that while we will have provision within this legislation to look after the 1.2 million workers, we need to look after the SMEs that provide those jobs and to do so in the context of being in the middle of the worst health crisis that this country, in my living memory, has even seen.</p>  <p>  We are about to get into what will be a catastrophe of equal scale called Brexit.  We are going from one to the other, from Covid to Brexit.  I am concerned as to whether this type of financing we are now doing for Covid will impinge on our ability to finance Brexit.  I see Covid as a trial run for Brexit.  I anticipate it in the logistics sector, having dealt with many of the SMEs involved for the past 30 years in business, drawing all types of goods.  I anticipate Brexit to be a bigger calamity, or equally as big as Covid has been.  People might find that hard to believe, but on top of Covid the potential crisis is very real.</p>  <p>  I think the mixed messages going out every day, as I said, are that interest rates are low but everybody says that is not a practical measure or application of finance interest rates on loan supports for struggling businesses.  Often they say they are far too complicated and seem to be more of a benefit to the financial institution than of assistance to them as SMEs.  I think this has been alluded to by many colleagues today, that often the benefit from financial loans of this nature does not actually come down to the SME or the businesses for which they are being provided.</p>  <p>  While the Bill contains supports to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency - which is what we call scalability, usability, reliability and economy, SURE - these loans are being underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantee by member states.  On that basis I would add a word of caution and I have stated previously in the House that our first support must be to the SMEs to keep them in business rather than the short-term work schemes.  We need to support the self-employed to stay self-employed and to sustain that position.  If we do not ensure affordable and meaningful supports for our SMEs through Covid and Brexit, they will not survive.  We are on a fool's errand passing legislation that will not support that position because our loan guarantees will be called in.  I am asking for the Minister of State to ensure 0% rates for government loans at a minimum for the future.</p>  <p>  I also ask - these are just points to note from my interaction with businesses and their understanding of smaller financial institutions - that the ECB actively support its member states immediately in these unprecedented times.  The Central Bank needs to continue to modify its rules on pillar banks immediately to allow them the flexibility that is essential to support businesses, which rely on cash flow.  If there is more money coming in than going out in any business, that is a positive situation but it is an unlikely situation for many in the near future.  We therefore need extremely low interest rates and need to ensure that the pillar banks are making businesses aware of the SBCI supports because many of them are just not aware of them.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to ensure the pillar banks make the SMEs aware of their eligibility and do everything possible to allow them to apply for these loans to sustain them in the future.</p></speech>

I have spent a lot of time talking to people whose businesses are in serious financial difficulty.  The Government is talking about giving low interest rates but providing low interest rates is kicking the can down the road for many of these businesses.  I appeal to the Government to reconsider and think along the lines of some kind of grant aid to support these businesses because no matter how low interest rates are, they have to be paid back.  Businesses are unable to contemplate that at this time.  Cafes, restaurants and hairdressers need some kind of package.  A stimulus package is to be announced next week.  That will hopefully give them some kind of a way forward.  A lot of these businesses feel they are running in some ways at a loss at the present time with more staff and fewer customers.</p><p>We spoke earlier today about the pub industry.  A lot of these businesses are in dire straits.  The VAT rate on drinks is at 23%.  I sincerely hope that the Minister of State is considering a measure to bring that down to a percentage that might allow the publicans to survive.  There are 50,000 jobs on the line.  Many pubs had the intention of opening on Monday.  They had to buy stock yesterday if they were to open on Monday.  They were given the indication that they would be able to do so.  They are now hanging on an announcement tomorrow morning and they cannot afford to take other losses.  I appeal with the Minister to give some clarity tonight to that sector, which has been suffering and has been shown little or no roadmap towards its survival.  In talking to many of those involved, even some who do not have mortgages and rents, they are worried about how they are going to keep the door open. </p><p>One can also look at the hotel sector and how they are able to keep the doors when they are open paying high rents or mortgages.  A temporary wage subsidy scheme has to be looked for the hotel sector.  A meeting including all the hotels in west Cork was held in recent weeks and that was one of the things on which they sought my support.  I ask the Minister of State to give serious consideration to changing and rejigging the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  While we are talking about that scheme, I have understanding, respect and sympathy - although sympathy sometimes does not pay the bills - for those who had mortgage approval and banks will not now accept their mortgages because they are on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  I ask the Minister to intercede with the banks on this issue.  It is difficult enough for people trying to start out and make a living but as this is a measure the Government put in place due to the crisis, for the banks to use it as a way out is immoral and wrong.  It needs to be put right.</p><p>Regarding the moratorium on mortgages, a lot of banks are considering adding to the mortgage as soon as people start the repayments.  People are struggling at present and cannot afford that punishment.  It is a tough word but that is what the banks are considering doing to their customers.  It is wrong and it needs to be looked at.  It is one thing to add it at the end of the mortgage but going back in a month's time and paying perhaps a quarter more than what they were paying initially is something that many people will not be able to sustain. </p><p>An announcement has been made in the UK on bringing the VAT rate in the tourism sector down to 5%.  The increase in the rate from 9% to 13.5% was detrimental enough prior to Covid but it is now imperative that the Government move quickly.  There is no point in giving the VAT decrease when the tourism season is over.  That decrease should have been announced a number of weeks ago when businesses were trying to get up and running again. </p><p>Another issue that has caused concern for small businesses is rates.  There is a freeze in that regard at the moment.  Is there serious consideration to that freeze continuing at least some way into next year to give people a chance?  I have been talking to taxi and bus operators.  I spoke to a businessman in west Cork who has invested thousand and thousands of euro to open up a bus service to Cork and back.  It is an incredible service and pre-Covid was going to be a massive, growing service.  He has to take on Bus &Eacute;ireann, which has the State behind it.  Now he is at a massive financial loss and it is difficult for him to find a way forward.  He is trying to continue the service but they are the people who need very serious grant aid in these times.  This cannot be allowed to drag on with them not knowing the way forward.</p><p>We have had a lot of positive things in relation to health in this country but there are questions too.  Money was spent on Covid-19 tests, which were sent to Germany.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, said in answer to a question from me here that it cost around &euro;200 a test.  We knew in west Cork that they could do the test for &euro;49.  There was the purchase of a PC-12 aeroplane by the State at a massive cost.  We do not hear on the floor of the D&aacute;il who is paying, what it cost and why that money was spent.  Why was the money not invested in local laboratories and spent in Ireland? </p><p>We have not even touched on the agricultural sector.  Through this crisis, they have had little or no funding.  There was a &euro;15 million package.  A very genuine farmer in west Cork and many others said to me they looked at the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>and they threw it on the ground in anger because they could not get their hands on that type of funding.  There is no point announcing a stimulus package next week if hurdles and fences are put in front of people.</p><p>A lot of people are not paying rates in business that also are struggling and they need to be looked at too.  The fishing industry is furious with what has been given to them to date.  I hope next week will address a lot of the issues for that industry.  </p></speech>

I congratulate Deputy Chambers on being appointed Minister of State.  I do not think he has quite made it to Cabinet yet as the previous Deputy alluded to but I know she meant well.  I wish him well and look forward to working with him.</p>  <p>  This legislation is a comprehensive Bill.  I do not normally advocate a lot of borrowing.  However, I do not think we have any option but to borrow, especially from our European friends, as we like to call them.  They were not very friendly or helpful to us in our economic crash a few years ago when they bulldozed in the money in the morning and then they fleeced us for it.  They charged us 6% when the IMF gave it to us for 2.9%.</p>  <p>  The Minister has a big role to follow with his lead Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  This Bill is well intentioned, like the road to Damascus.  It is well intentioned but lined with landmines.  We have a big problem with the Central Bank and the pillar banks.  The pillar banks are not working.</p> <p>They may as well shut up shop because they are not functioning.  They have not been functioning for a decade or more and they will not function in the future.  The contempt they hold for this House and for the public is palpable.  A former Member of the House is their spokesperson, and there are many former political advisers who have likewise become spokespersons for the different banking associations.  Deputy Michael Collins and I met them to discuss the terrors they put on people who were trying to pay back loans.  We met the representatives of the various banking federations but it was a waste of time.</p> <p> There are some good aspects of the Bill and some provisions that give serious cause for worry.  As we say and hear all the time, SMEs account for a huge number of jobs in this country.  Most SME owners - I must declare that I am one myself - have a good relationship with their workers and want to keep that relationship because it is imperative for the future success of their business.  We are not all, as Deputy Boyd Barrett would like to think, big operators who are reckless with our workers and mad for profit.  In my own county of Tipperary, we have had huge direct investment in job creation and in companies paying corporation tax.  I support that, and the contribution of those companies is massive.  Their factories probably provide 5,000 jobs in the greater Clonmel area.  Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme is there more than 50 years.  These are long-stay enterprises, not fly-by-night entities that run away after they get their special deals.</p> <p> Chasing the Apple money is like a chasing a rainbow.  When the sun comes out, one sees plenty of rainbows, but there is no crock of gold from Apple at the end of that particular rainbow.  Now there is talk of getting interest on the Apple money as well.  Before any of that we have to wait for the courts to decide and for any appeals to be gone through, from third parties or anybody else.  It may or may not be a case of "live, horse, and you will get grass" but that seems to be the ideology.</p> <p> On the other hand, we have the sectoral agreements, in respect of which there is a clamouring every day to revisit the court decision.  Those sectoral agreements were made with the big financial people - the Construction Industry Federation, or whatever - but things are different for small employers.  I know I am straying a small bit from the legislation but this is a very important point.  Small employers cannot pay the wage that large employers can pay.  Workers in rural parts of Ireland do not expect to get the &euro;25 an hour that is paid in Dublin.  The local authorities employ people and machinery and they would not give &euro;25 an hour for the machine and the man.  We must cut our cloth according to our measure and we must be very careful of the damage we could do in this area.</p> <p> Deputy Michael Collins alluded to the mixed messages and statements that are going out all the time in regard to this legislation and other measures.  It is devastating tonight to hear that the pubs may not be reopening on Monday.  I read on my iPhone ten minutes ago that NPHET, which seems to be the gospel for everything, has indicated there may be a delay.  I wish Dr. Holohan and his wife all the very best but there are serious questions to be asked, even about the sittings of this House.  I said in the convention centre that we could not afford such a salubrious place.  Like the small businesses, we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  Publicans and other small business owners pay tax, VAT, rates, PRSI and insurance.  They must be allowed to reopen.  Many of them, who are watching this debate tonight, will have had to order in new stock before next week.  I never owned a pub or had anything to do with running one but I was often at a pub counter and I talk to and support a lot of pub owners.  It is unreal when we see the house parties that are going on around the country.  At the same time, the pubs and the respectable publicans are controlled and if they break the rules, objections will be raised to their licences.  It is ridiculous.</p> <p> Today is Tuesday and the pubs are meant to open next Monday but we are now getting mixed messages and it seems they might not be allowed to open after all.  Yet there is a situation going on that I raised at the very start of the crisis.  It is why I asked the Taoiseach earlier whether he really believes there is a pandemic.  I have concerns, as do many other people, that we never closed the airports and ports.  That was never done while so much was asked of small businesses.  I mentioned pubs but I am also talking about shops and everything else, including farmers and sporting people.  Big Tom is resting in his grave, Lord have mercy on him, but there are many country music artists struggling.  I know many of them and many of the ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; clubs and scoileanna rince.  They are all closed and all the independent artists have nowhere to perform.  We are all over the place in how we are dealing with this.</p> <p> We got the roadmap - I do not remember how long ago it is now - and stage 4 was to see the pubs reopening, but doubt is being thrown on that tonight.  It is totally unfair to publicans.  Their stocks were taken back and they have nothing in stock now.  They must borrow to restock.  In those circumstances, it just does not add up for me or any ordinary person that people can come into this country from Dallas, Texas.  I have seen the list of flights coming into Dublin Airport and it includes lots of Covid hotspots in Spain and other places.  At one stage we were getting a briefing from the HSE once a week but nobody has given us such a briefing for a while.  Deputy Shortall asked at one of those briefings if we could be enlightened as to how many personnel were stationed at the airports and ports monitoring people coming into the country.  No answer was given and there was only head-scratching and looking around.  The HSE representatives thought the Garda was dealing with that issue.  I said at the time and I will say it again that it is like drawing water from a well with a leaky bucket.  One will never fill one's tank that way and if we do not seal our borders, we will never survive.  Before we get into borrowing, microfinance and the different schemes, we must deal with the basics first.  If we do not have a good foundation - and we do not - we are not serious about dealing with this pandemic.  NPHET certainly has a job to do, and that is to advise.  It is for the Government to make decisions but all we are seeing is inertia, lethargic efforts and unclear, mixed messages.</p> <p> The Taoiseach alluded last week to the possibility that the pubs might not reopen.  It is shocking to have this uncertainty.  Many of them will never reopen anyway ever again because of legislation that was passed here in recent times, but we need to support the ones that can reopen.  The hairdressers were able to open, thank God, but there was huge expense involved in it for them.  The schemes that were introduced, including the microfinance scheme and the rates break, were brought in with big announcements and a big spin machine by the former Taoiseach.  The county councils have not had a penny yet to offset what they lost via the rates measure.  I am glad to see the Minister of State writing that down.  Members of my council told me ten days ago when they sent out the rates bills for the second moiety starting in July, which they had to do, that the council has not got a shilling from the Government to offset the loss from the rates holiday or the parking moratorium.</p> <p> We have had all the announcements.  Even this Bill has grand platitudes, but it is not enough.  If the procedures are too cumbersome and there is too much form-filling, SMEs cannot afford it and they will not do it.  They need stimulus grants and the public needs the same.  We need to encourage people to spend and stimulate the economy.  I took a walk down Grafton Street earlier tonight and it is just not happening.  People are worried.  The Taoiseach or somebody else said earlier that they are saving their money.  We must look at a scheme similar to the one introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Charles McCreevy, to encourage the release of money that is being saved into the economy.  We do not want people to spend all their savings but they should be encouraged to spend some of them and should not be penalised for doing so.  There should be schemes that encourage people to do home refurbishments or change their car and thereby stimulate different industries.  We should leave some savings residue in place but people should not be penalised if they take out some of their savings before a scheme has matured.  We need money in the economy now and airgead in the p&oacute;ca for people to spend.</p> <p> Pious platitudes, grand schemes and great-sounding legislation are not enough.  We must secure interest-free loans for SMEs and ordinary families.  We must get support from our European colleagues to do so.  I see that Austria has raised &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion on a scheme that it put out for tender, and it got that money at very reasonable interest.  There are ways of doing these things but it is not by having too much legislation, red tape and bureaucracy.  The mixed messages must stop.</p> <p> We must remember that Brexit is looming large.  It is looming large for the farming community on which all of rural Ireland depends.  It is looming large for the haulage industry, which is in an awful situation.  All of that is coming down the line.  Deputy Verona N&iacute; Mhurch&uacute; said that Brexit could be even worse than this.  If that is the case, it will be one huge whammy.  We know it will be bad but we have lost sight of it completely.  We must deal with it because it will have an enormous impact.</p> <p> The first thing we must do is let our people live again.  We must stop the fear factor and do away with the figures that are being issued in the main RT&Eacute; headlines into people's homes.  They have people driven demented with fright, especially the elderly, and the situation is creating mental health issues.  We see the billions being wasted on the deal with the private hospitals and in the overcharging for Covid-19 testing.  As Deputy Michael Collins said, if the tests can be done for &euro;40 or &euro;50 in west Cork, why are we sending them to Germany at a cost of &euro;195 each?  What is wrong with us?  There have been no proper tendering procedures and no proper evaluation of the vast amounts of money that have been spent to tackle Covid-19.  I do not like repeating myself but I said some months ago that what is going on is a scamdemic.  Every day since, I feel it more that I was justified in that description.  There are too many scams going on.  We are making too much money for the big businesses that own the private hospitals and clinics.  People who had private health insurance could not get treatment even though they had been paying into schemes for up to 40 years.  Now the private health insurers have the audacity to charge those people &euro;275 for a test that can be done in west Cork for &euro;40.</p> <p>This is daylight robbery.  Like most schemes, it seems there will be latitude for people to make huge money.<br/><br/>I wish the Minister of State well and I will support the Bill but I have huge concerns about it.  We must let people live.  They are not being let live at the moment because they are being corralled into their homes and are frightened about going anywhere.  All the mixed messaging is not good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400045#WW00200"><p>The Bill is part of the overall package, including the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 from last week, to support businesses during the Covid crisis.  This Bill relates to European funding that needs to be drawn down.  I am slightly concerned that all EU member states have to pass similar legislation before next week to allow this fund to be established.  The Minister of State is only bringing it forward now, which has reduced the time we have to discuss it and consider its implications.  That discussion should be allowed and we should not pass Bills up against a European deadline.  As I understand it, if we did not pass this Bill, the entire European Covid-19 response would collapse.  That is not something any of us would want to happen, but we should have proper time to consider and discuss the implications of a Bill when it comes before us.  That is something we need to look at for the future.  The excuse will be used that we did not have a Government and that, therefore, it could not be discussed before now.  Many discussions took place while we were on hiatus and this Bill could have been discussed then as well.  The Minister of State said there is an urgent need to introduce this legislation and in light of that, I do not think anyone will oppose it as it stands.</p><p>The legislation establishes a number of different funds throughout the EU, which would levy a potential contribution of &euro;650 million on Ireland should everything be called in.  While I understand such guarantees are required to enable these funds to be drawn down, if they fall due or we default, a liability of &euro;650 million could be laid on us.  That is not an insubstantial amount.  While signing up to these guarantees allows us to draw down approximately &euro;2 billion from the fund, meaning there is a multiplier effect of 3:1 that may make it more attractive to us, we cannot underestimate the risk involved.  The Minister of State said that if these funds were called in he would lay a report before the House and we could discuss it after the fact.  Discussing something after it has happened seems a bizarre way of doing business.  Surely the State would want to discuss it beforehand and decide whether we should do it or needed to do it.  It is a bit like the recent Estimates, which were all retrospective and related to money that had been spent.  When the then Taoiseach was asked about them, he said there would be Supplementary Estimates later in the year to cover the money that would be spent between these Estimates.  Maybe that is just the way we do business and thinking we should discuss these measures before we pay the money rather than after is na&iuml;vet&eacute; on my part.  In reality it is retrospective and there is little we can we do about it.  When we pass this Bill our liability will be cast in stone so having to pay the money will be a moot point at that stage.</p><p>The Bill leverages funding from a few different areas.  I welcome the fact that we are not going to use the Commission fund.  We have a sad history in that regard because of the bailout and doing so would bring home too many bad memories.  Approximately 200 companies around the country would benefit from this fund.  It seems a lot of money but in reality that &euro;2 billion would only benefit 200 companies.  That is a lot of money for a small number of companies.  There are also larger employers and SMEs in Ireland.  A medium-sized enterprise is one that has up to 250 employees.  Many of us think of small businesses as being much smaller than that but that is the measure used.  If the State draws down &euro;2 billion to benefit 200 companies, we should get a guarantee from them rather than just hoping they might stay open.  We have to ensure workers are protected within those companies and the funding should be linked to employment and wages, which are vitally important.  I brought this up last week during the debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020.  The T&aacute;naiste said that it would not be a problem because companies would only reduce wages if they were in bother.  The problem is that we do not know whether that will be the case.  We are paying companies the Covid payment to keep people in employment and they cut their wages and their own contributions as well.  How much are we really contributing to them?  There has to be a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  Companies have an obligations to the State, as citizens within this country, to say why they are reducing wages.  I have no doubt that employees would be reasonable if they were spoken to and what was required was laid out in front of them.  They might then accept a wage cut but some employers are cutting their wages by 10% or 15% regardless, while also getting the Covid payment from the State to supplement those wages and reducing the contribution they are paying.  That is a bit much and is too much for us to accept.  We should put measures in place to ensure employers maintain the wages of employees because no matter who the employees are, it was hard enough for them to survive on the wages they had before this crisis.  Having their wages cut despite them being supplemented by the State makes it more than difficult for them to survive.  We need to have those protections in place.  While protecting and saving companies is well and good, this money should also save employees and the people of the State.  That is vitally important.  Everything we do should be about making sure that is happening.  Unfortunately, I do not think that is the case for this Bill and it was not the case for the Bill last week either.  That is a worrying trend because we have to ensure we look after workers and people in the State.</p><p>There is a great deal in the Bill, including how the drawdowns will work and so on, but that will come in time.  I have mentioned the possibility of the &euro;650 million being called in.  There has been much criticism at European level that this Bill does not go far enough and is not enough for what is required at European level.  What are the Government's views on that?  Will this fund be enough to manage the bailout required across the board?  There has been much talk about Europe being collegiate, looking after everybody and coming together.  However, that was not evident in the development of this fund.  Will that be the case in the future?  How much are we going to take?  Are we just going to go along with everything others say or do we have any input into these decisions and what is happening?</p> <p>Looking in from the outside, it always seems to be France and Germany that decide everything and we just go along with it and say "nice work boys".  It does not seem to be a collegiate response or one in which everyone speaks and is listened to.  It just seems to be that France and Germany decide and that is it.  Every so often, the Netherlands or one or two other countries - the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria on this fund, for example - might oppose something but it is really and truly the big two countries that decide everything.  They even go to the extent of having bilateral meetings themselves before the meetings of the Council of Ministers and then tell us what we are going to accept.  Is that acceptable to the Irish Government?  Perhaps that question might be addressed at the later Stages.  </p></speech>

I welcome this Bill and its contents.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, on his new role.  I wish him every success during the Government's period in office.</p>  <p>  Looking at the contents of the legislation, it is to enable us to get money from Europe and get a fund in place to ensure funding available to businesses in post-pandemic Ireland.  What we really need to do is look at what happened in recent months.  There was what can only be called carnage right throughout the industrial world in small to medium-sized and even large businesses.  There is great concern among those operating businesses and those employed in them regarding the future and how soon it will be possible to get back to normal or back to what things were like pre-Covid-19 in January, February and March 2020.  </p>  <p>  We as a society have to look at the Ireland of the middle of July 2020 and see what has happened in recent months.  We must see the real challenges that exist in the tourist industry, the catering industry and all the small-to-medium-sized businesses that were supplying all sectors.  We must see the challenges and the voids that are left.  We look at this legislation and we have to ensure we can get money quickly to where it really matters.  In the past decade, we saw the challenges that were faced after the crash and what has subsequently happened concerning small to medium-sized businesses never getting back off the ground.</p>  <p>  Some tremendously successful businesses will need grants rather than loans to get them up and running and to protect employment, not just in urban Ireland but in rural Ireland.  Much of the time, society is way ahead of us here in this Chamber and the commentators.  Society has moved very fast in recent months.  I come from a very rural constituency and I have looked at what has happened, including remote working, smart working and the number of people working from home.  I refer to people in public service employment who have been working very efficiently from home.  We have to put that down as a marker.  </p>  <p>  We have also looked at some of the multinational companies, which provide greatly prized employment in cities and large towns.  They have had their employees working from home as well.  The multinationals have looked at the benefit to themselves as companies but also at the benefit to their employees.  The very simple thing is that when the employee is happy, the company is happy.  In the context of this legislation to support industry, we must ensure that we take on board what has happened in society and not be trying to direct it towards more urbanisation.  </p>  <p>  We have a major opportunity now, if we care to take it.  I know that some people have little respect for country folk or that way of life.  That attitude exists and we have to rid society of it.  We have to rid the higher echelons of that attitude and we must look closely at what can be achieved.  Regarding Covid-19, the associated measures and whether we are serious, we will see that there is fear in the country now regarding a second wave and what should be done to stop people coming into Ireland etc..  We have seen where restaurants have taken it upon themselves to enforce the regulations and ensured that they are protecting their businesses and the people who will be coming into their premises.  </p>  <p>  We have to look back to when the pandemic was at its highest, and the fact that the challenges were in the large urban centres and people were looking to get to rural areas.  Thanks be to God, from my own perspective, we live in a rural community and those rural communities were spared the worst of the pandemic.  That is, however, the secret as we go into the future as a society.  We have to look at the pluses.  If we are desperately serious about ensuring that we learn the lessons, I refer to the old saying regarding never wasting a crisis to make the right decisions.  If we are serious about making the right decisions as society has learned to do, if those lessons can be learned by the Government and those who will be making the decisions in the next decade or so, we will have to ensure that there is more encouragement for multinational companies, small to medium-sized enterprises and State enterprises to relocate their people to rural communities, where they can work very effectively from home.  That has been proven on this occasion.</p>  <p>  We have had many debates concerning decentralisation over the years but we have seen now that society has decentralised itself recently.  It has not waited for the Government or direction but because of a pandemic, people have decentralised themselves and we should ensure that we take that lesson from society, because society is always ahead of the curve.  Looking at this legislation which is intended to try to make more money available, it is also important to ensure there is less bureaucracy involved and that we are not tying up small to medium-sized enterprises with employees having to try to wade through red tape.  Funding must be provided as quickly as possible to businesses to ensure their survival.  It is vitally important that we take that into account.</p>  <p>  This is the first time I have spoken on legislation relating to the pandemic.  As a society, we need to look at the front-line workers and what they have done for us, not only the healthcare workers but also those working in shops, delivering food etc..  I refer to those who kept the wheels going.  We should always remember those people.  They are so important to our society as we move into the future.  With those few words, I commend the legislation.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400046#XX00500"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, on his appointment and I wish him every success in his future career in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I am glad to see him in the Chamber so early in the term of the new Government.</p>  <p>  Today is 14 July, Bastille Day, the national holiday in France.  On this day in 1789, the Bastille, a French military fortress and prison, was stormed by the people of France and prisoners broken out.  It was one of the first actions of the French Revolution.  We all know it was a very bloody revolution.  Three years after that, however, in 1792, the guillotine was introduced by the authorities.  </p>  <p>  In parliamentary terms, the word "guillotine" means bringing a debate to an abrupt end, whether or not it has concluded.  Here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann we are back in the land of the parliamentary guillotine for this legislation.  We had several years without a parliamentary guillotine, but it is back today as part of ensuring that this Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill 2020 will conclude tomorrow evening, one way or the other.  </p> <p>Now I will say by way of mitigation that during the Covid-19 crisis it is essential for all such legislation to be concluded properly.  There may be extraneous or exceptional cases where a guillotine is necessary but I also believe it is important that in a normal functioning democracy a guillotine would be used sparingly when it comes to parliamentary debates.</p> <p> With this legislation my main concern is about microbusinesses.  Everyone talks about small, medium and large businesses.  The statisticians and the people who run Departments and big businesses talk about small and medium businesses.  Their idea of a small business is one with a couple of hundred people and they imagine a large business is one with over 1,000 people.  We have many of these in Ireland and we are fond of them.  They are important and they contribute significantly in terms of employment and the tax take.  Foreign multinational companies pay on average almost twice the average industrial wage.  They pay far more tax per individual aside from the corporation tax they pay.</p> <p> I estimate that up to 700,000 people in Ireland are working in microbusinesses.  They are the backbone of the economy.  I have in mind the man with the van or the man with the van and a helper.  Perhaps there is a company with two vans.  The business, whether a small shop or caf&eacute;, may have between two and five staff.</p> <p> I hope that during the course of this legislation, if it is not possible for it to be put out as part of the legislation, we would be given the figures of the total employment in companies with between one and five employees or maybe between six and ten employees.  This touches on small business activities.  These are the people we need to get back to work.  The big companies are big and strong.  They can borrow and many of them have good credit ratings.  However, for the small business a figure of &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 is a phenomenal amount of money.  That is what they need to keep ticking over so that they are viable and still in business on 1 January next year.</p> <p> I am making a plea for microbusinesses to be supported and singled out especially.  There is a case almost for a Department for microbusinesses and small businesses because of the fundamental impact they have on the Irish economy not only in urban areas but in rural areas too.</p> <p> What is this legislation about?  This legislation enables Ireland to contribute up to &euro;648 million to two European funds as part of an EU-wide initiative to mitigate the employment crisis and support businesses getting back on their feet.  That is good, great and fantastic.  Everyone in the House should be supportive of this legislation.  It is good that we have the EU element.  This is really an EU initiative.  That is why I brought in the issue of Bastille Day in my opening remarks.  It is a European national holiday for France, which is one of the largest countries in the EU.</p> <p> I support all the specifics in the legislation but I have two or three observations to make.  The first is written in the legislation several times and I want people to understand it.  The &euro;648 million that Ireland will contribute will not be subject to any parliamentary scrutiny in respect of that fund being contributed to or any funds we draw down.  It is written in the legislation that the funds will be paid out of the Central Fund and not out of voted funding that comes through this House.  I want to explain to people what the Central Fund is.  The Central Fund is an account under the control of the Minister for Finance.  All taxes that are collected every year are lodged into that fund.  Maybe some other sundry income goes in there as well.  In a given year approximately &euro;60 billion goes into that fund.  It accounts for nearly all the taxation.  Approximately &euro;51 billion comes through this House by way of voted expenditure and departmental estimates.  There is scrutiny and this spending is considered and debated at length.  In addition, some &euro;9 billion, which is a phenomenal amount of money, goes through that fund but does not come through this House for debate, public scrutiny or public accountability.  I am keen to see more public accountability in respect of that &euro;9 billion in the Central Fund.  The biggest element of that &euro;9 billion is approximately &euro;6 billion that goes on paying the interest on the national debt.  That has to be paid, but there should be a debate in the House about the borrowing cost, the amount of borrowing and the nature of the borrowing.  The other &euro;3 billion goes straight to the EU.  It does not come through the floor of the House at any stage.  VAT is collected and paid to the EU with no reference to this House.</p> <p> Now, we have this new mechanism where a further &euro;650 million will be paid out of the Central Fund once the legislation is established.  There is no accountability or traceability back to the Houses.  The Minister may choose to amend the legislation and make a statement at some stage in future but in terms of the annual working out of this legislation there is no accountability to the House.  That is the one point I would like to see dealt with more effectively in future.</p> <p> I have mentioned in my comments the issue of payments to the EU.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is an issue for the Government at large, of which I am a part.  If those responsible are listening I would be happy to provide any thoughts on this issue and assess them in that regard.</p> <p> I have referred to the payments to the EU amounting to &euro;3 billion that we already make.  In addition we will hand over &euro;650 million now in receipts from the EU.  Regardless of whether they go directly through the Common Agricultural Policy or through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there is no accountability to the House in terms of the VAT receipts.  I would like the Department of Finance to do something it has not done before.  I want the Department to set out an annual report of our total financial transactions with the EU, including payments to the EU and receipts from the EU.  It is very important that people can see that.</p> <p> This is another EU initiative.  We are supportive of it.  We think it is good and I want it to concentrate on microbusinesses in particular to ensure we get over the employment crisis of Covid-19.  I will conclude by wishing the new Minister of State well in his job.</p></speech>

Pursuant to section 4(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1946, I have assigned the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to myself.  I will propose the appointment of a new member of the Government tomorrow, if the House can facilitate it.</p>  <p>  This is a very sad day for Barry, his family and me.  He has been a committed public representative, very diligent and dedicated.  Over the course of the past ten days he has been the subject of significant criticism and condemnation for a road traffic offence that took place in 2016.  He has been completely clear and unambiguous regarding his drink driving offence.  He gave a personal statement to the House on 7 July in which he talked about the stupidity of his actions.  He accepted what he did was absolutely wrong and he apologised to all Members.  I accepted that his remorse was genuine and I accepted his apology.</p>  <p>  When he was first confronted with the allegations Deputy Cowen was immediately clear and emphatic about his drink-driving offence and understood the need to acknowledge this.  However, he was equally clear and emphatic that one detail of the allegation he was being presented with was completely untrue, namely that he sought to evade garda&iacute; at the time.  We had extensive discussions on this point last evening and again this morning, when he shared with me for the first time the actual Garda record under dispute.  Following these discussions, and having seen the Garda report this morning, it was my view that it raised additional issues requiring further explanation and clarification.  I made this view clear to him and gave him space today to consider the matter further.  However, he has decided that he is not prepared to address this allegation publicly and will not make any further statement or answer any questions on this issue in this House.</p>  <p>  This decision has created a situation where legitimate doubts and additional questions are being raised.  Government colleagues are expected to address these.  This is simply untenable.  It is my view that Deputy Cowen had an obligation to come before the House.  It is also my view that this issue is damaging to the ongoing work of the Government.</p>  <p>  Throughout this I am conscious that there are important and legitimate legal processes under way.  Deputy Cowen is questioning the accuracy of the Garda record and seeking to establish how his personal information became public.  I have sought to respect these processes and I would ask that colleagues do the same.  This decision I have made is without prejudice to those proceedings.</p>  <p>  The challenges facing this Government are unprecedented in scale and the Irish people require nothing less than our full and undivided attention.  It is in everyone's interest that the Government not be distracted in any way from doing what is necessary to protect public health and our efforts to rebuild our society and economy.  Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for facilitating this statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400048#BBB00200"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  	notes that due to the public health emergency, parents of young babies find themselves facing particular challenges, and that there is an added difficulty in securing childcare for new children;<br /><br />acknowledges:<br /><br />&mdash;the #ExtendMaternityLeave2020 campaign established by mothers currently on maternity leave;<br /><br />&mdash;the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland&rsquo;s support of the campaign; and<br /><br />&mdash;the 28,000 people who signed a petition in support of the campaign;<br /><br />and calls on the Government to:<br /><br />&mdash;address this matter urgently by introducing a temporary extension of maternity benefit from six to nine months for mothers whose maternity benefit claim expires between the start of March and end of November, if they wish to avail of it; and<br /><br />&mdash;ensure this extension is reviewed at the end of November and continued for further mothers, if necessary.&rdquo;  </blockquote>  <p>I am very proud to bring this motion forward as my very first motion in this House.  Having a baby is one of the most exciting times in a person's life.  I know this because just a few months ago I became an auntie for the first time.  The joy my little nephew Tadhg has brought to all of our lives is something that is shared with every mother and parent behind this campaign.</p><p>  I know what family support means to a mother, especially a new mother, when she has just had a baby.  I also know that in the past few months many mothers have been robbed of that support.  Nothing about maternity leave has been normal since Covid-19 hit in March.  In the past few weeks and months, many of us in the Chamber have been contacted by numerous mothers who have asked us for help.  They have reached out to us as public representatives.  It is important that their stories are heard.</p><p>  A woman who contacted me yesterday told me her husband is a doctor and not one cr&egrave;che will take children aged under one year.  Therefore, her husband will take all of his leave and they have no idea what will happen after that.  Another mother told me that she had her fourth child the night all of the schools were closed.  She said that, hand on heart, she has not had a chance to bond sufficiently with her newborn baby or to give the time that was needed to home schooling her other three children.  She said she feels enormous guilt around this.  She told me that her husband returned to work after two and a half weeks, leaving her with four children, sleep deprived and with absolutely no help.</p><p>  Another mother told me her baby was born in mid-March and since then she has received just one check-up.  Every developmental check has been cancelled due to Covid-9.  She said she has never been checked following major surgery.  This alone is extremely dangerous, but she said she is more worried about her baby and whether she is reaching milestones and doing well.  She went on to say that she has no childcare in place and that nowhere she has contacted is taking new babies.  She said that come September she does not know how she will be able to return to work.  She has the option of taking additional leave, but it is unpaid and her mortgage and other bills will keep coming.</p><p>  We know that many women have been forced to take unpaid leave and are struggling financially.  Women have been forced to use their annual leave to give them a bit more time.  Women have given up their jobs and are worried sick as their maternity leave end dates approach and they have no one to mind their babies.  Cr&egrave;ches have closed their baby rooms and some are no longer taking babies aged under one year.</p><p>  I telephoned four cr&egrave;ches in my constituency, Roscommon-Galway, yesterday.  None of them is taking babies under the age of one.  This is replicated across the State.  Grandparents are no longer an option.  Many of us, or our children, have been looked after by grandmothers.  Going on yesterday's press conference following the Cabinet meeting, it appears that the Government's response to all of these mothers is to bring forward something that is totally irrelevant to the issue before us.</p><p>  The Government's response to the mothers who have asked for its help is to re-announce a commitment around parental leave and dress it up as a solution.  This is an insult to these mothers and their families.  I am genuinely baffled at the response from the Government that was announced yesterday.  I ask sincerely how announcing the possibility, as part of budget 2021, of bringing forward three weeks of additional parental leave has any impact or helps in any way any mother whose maternity leave ends next week and who has nowhere to look after their six-month old children.</p><p>  I do not see how there has been any recognition of what these mothers are facing in what was announced yesterday.  As the Minister with responsibility for children, disability, equality and integration, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, said yesterday this is the Government's response to this Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  It is also its response to every single mother who has had a baby over the past few months and has taken maternity leave in the midst of a global pandemic.</p><p>  I commend the #ExtendMaternityLeave2020 campaign group which, despite having newborn babies at home, somehow managed to create, build and drive a national campaign on such an important issue.  Those involved deserve huge credit.  This day last week the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that he would do right on this issue.  What the Government is proposing in its amendment to the motion is not the right thing and I ask it to reconsider its position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400048#BBB00300"><p>I commend Deputy Kerrane for bringing forward this important motion at this time.  On 11 June, the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, submitted a petition signed by more than 28,000 people to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, calling for an extension of 12 weeks to maternity leave and pay.  He said he would give full and meaningful consideration to this request.  However, after a month of inaction and pleas falling on deaf ears, last Tuesday I joined the NWCI and a group of exasperated mothers and fathers who demonstrated outside the D&aacute;il in support of this call.  I and other Deputies have consistently raised this issue on the floor of the House.</p><p>Last week, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, said the Government's intention was to do the right thing.  New mothers, women and families need and deserve much more than empty rhetoric and words.  They need urgent action now to extend maternity leave and benefits by 12 weeks.  There must be no ifs or buts, just action.</p><p>  Like Deputy Kerrane, I want to give a voice to the best advocates for this necessary support and change, that is, mothers themselves.  Victoria told me that her little girl was born four weeks premature and spent two weeks in intensive care.  She said she was scared and felt she did not have the time she needed.  She has no childcare available and does not know what to do.  She has suffered from post-natal depression, hospital appointments have been cancelled, her injections were put back by a month and neonatal appointments, along with a hip X-ray and ultrasound, have been cancelled.  Even though the lockdown has now been lifted, she is still suffering from anxiety and postnatal depression.  She told me that her child has not left the house except for doctor's appointments and small walks on a country lane.  She said she is at a loss, has no childcare and would have no choice but to return to work prematurely.</p><p>  Rebecca said she had her first baby during the pandemic and found it extremely stressful.  She said her daughter missed out on medical appointments and visits from the public health nurse.</p> <p>She says she will have to take unpaid leave if this motion is not passed and if the Government does not act.  She says extending maternity leave provides people with more time with their babies and gives them the chance to get back into the workforce later in the year.</p> <p> Jenny, and this case is particularly sad, said at the moment these truly feel like the darkest days she has personally had to face and it should be the most joyous and happy time in her life.  Victoria, Rebecca and Jenny articulate perfectly and directly why this extension to maternity leave and benefit is both essential and urgent.  </p> <p> We have and will out of necessity make all manner of interventions to support workers, the economy and businesses, sector by sector.  That is absolutely necessary and essential but we must intervene to support families too.  This, to my mind, is a very simple, straightforward, necessary and fair ask by new mothers that they be given the additional 12 months with their young children at a time, bear in mind, where childcare provision is under immense pressure and at a time when no-one can be sure the sufficient capacity will be available.</p> <p> The announcement yesterday by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in respect of parents leave is welcome, in as much as it has been made.  However,  it is not the solution and nobody should pretend it is a solution for mothers and families who need relief now. They cannot wait until next year, they need a solution now.  This is a matter of fairness and it is also a matter of common sense.  I ask that the Government stop hiding behind a veil of complexity and act immediately to extend paid maternity leave for these mothers by an additional 12 weeks.</p></speech>

There are times when I wonder why we must be on opposite sides of issues and if the Minister was true to herself she would accept this motion should be passed.  If she met the mothers, as we did, outside the gates of Leinster House holding their babies and talking about the challenges they have and the reasons these measures need to be put in place, she would support it.  I am at a loss as to why the Government will not support mothers and will not support these parents.</p>  <p>  We can throw any amount of money at banks.  We will invest, and rightly so, billions of euro of taxpayers' money into the July stimulus supporting business and enterprise which in turn supports jobs, but when it comes to supporting mothers who have had difficulties and challenges with their babies being born during this emergency period we cannot put in place an emergency measure to support them.  Maternity benefit and maternity leave is necessary.  I find the situation appalling.  What is more appalling is the Minister's amendment to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  As an Teachta McDonald said, I welcome the fact that the Government has at least reacted to some degree to our motion by extending parental leave, but that was promised anyway.  That was committed to last year.</p>  <p>  The response from the Government in its own amendment stated that it proposes to examine in early course, as part of the budgetary process, the possible extension of paid parent's leave and parents benefit from two to five weeks and the possible extension of the period in which parents leave can be taken by the cohort of people eligible. It is more spin and more nonsense, talking about the possibility and kicking the can down the road again.  I am sure many of the mothers are listening in here because they know this Private Members' business is being tabled.  The Minister should explain, and it is her job to explain, to those mothers and parents why this Government cannot support what is a simple motion that does what is right for those mothers and parents.  That is on the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400049#CCC00500"><p>Some 30,000 people have signed the Uplift petition calling on the Government to extend maternity leave by three months.  Like many, Government Deputies here tonight have signed it too.  The Fine Gael leader in the Seanad, Senator Regina Doherty, has in the last week confirmed to the Taoiseach that the Seanad stands ready and waiting to implement this extension.  It is now time to do the right thing and extend maternity leave by three months with the possibility of an extension in November if the pandemic is ongoing.</p>  <p>  We have had emails from parents telling us of the challenges they have faced in giving birth in the middle of a global pandemic.  Mothers have faced unique challenges during their maternity leave.  They struggle without the usual supports including family support, cancelled prenatal appointments and reduced visits from the public health nurse all because of Covid-19.  Babies were born without fathers present and in some cases fathers held their baby for the first time when they were being brought home.  Many mothers are now approaching the end date of their maternity leave and have no-one to mind their baby.  Grandparents are cocooning.  Some cr&egrave;ches have not reopened.  Some have opened with reduced capacity while others are no longer taking new clients.  </p>  <p>  Many mothers have described the stress they have been under during their maternity leave.  Some have been on their own at home while their partners go to work and this has been particularly challenging for new mothers.  Recent studies have shown that post-natal depression has tripled since the beginning of the pandemic.  The stress of dealing with a new baby, coupled with the stress of a strain on family finance and the worry about the health of a loved one, is already a lot to deal with.  On top of this, they have the worry of returning to work and putting their family at risk.  Mothers with other children of school-going age have had to juggle a newborn while home-schooling.  </p>  <p>  Yesterday evening at a press conference following the Cabinet meeting, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, announced that as part of budget 2021 an additional three weeks for parents leave would be examined.  The Minister referred to this as the Government's response to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion despite the fact it will do nothing to actually address the issue.  It is a slap in the face to tens of thousands of mothers who have fought over the last number of months to provide a semblance of normality to their newborns.  This move was already promised in the programme for Government and does nothing to address the present challenges.  It does not go far enough and families deserve better.  I ask that all Government Deputies, in particular, listen to their constituents and do the right thing in supporting this motion.</p></speech>

The restrictions we have lived through and precautions we have had to take have had an impact on the parents of newborn children.  As a mother of five I can say that a new addition to a family is a joy, and a joy that we once could share immediately with family members and friends.  Covid-19 has put a stop to this.  The safety of our health workers, newborns and their mothers is paramount and, as such, the current restrictions were necessary.  However, it must be recognised that these current circumstances are stressful for both mother and child.  The old certainties and reassurance of family support and public health nurse visits have been suspended.  For many, the end of the six-month maternity period is fast approaching.  Some childcare facilities remain closed and this has created uncertainty as to where new parents are to leave their child during working hours.  Maternity leave should be a time where necessary check-ups and medical appointments can be attended.  For many, these vital services were paused during the height of the lockdown.  It is vital that maternity leave and pay is extended for these families so they can follow up on missed developmental checks and hospital appointments.</p>  <p>  In my constituency of Clare I have received many calls and emails from the general public and, in particular, the #ExtendMaternityLeave2020 campaign group, calling for support on this motion.  I am sure I am not alone in this.  It is pleasing that over the last number of weeks so many Members of the Houses have indicated they will support this motion, and I sincerely hope this previous support is followed up by their actions.  The announcement by the Minister last night may seem like a step in the right direction but it does not go far enough.  That is why I encourage the Government parties to get behind this motion.  This is a sensible and fair motion.  It is a motion that is good for the State and good for our citizens.  Supporting this motion will go a long way towards reassuring the parents of newborn children that they will not be left behind as we look to recover from the economic impact of Covid-19.  Many countries across the world already allow for maternity leave for up to 12 months from the birth of a child.  These early months are crucial in the development of a child and we need to ensure the supports parents require are around them.  This motion allows for the most basic of these supports, that is, the love and attention of a parent.</p></speech>

After the birth of their children, many could not enjoy support from extended family members or from public health nurses and others who are so important for new parents, especially first-time mothers.  They could not enjoy these important first few months with their babies in view of the restrictions of lockdown.</p> <p> This has been such a stressful time for so many mothers and the very least they deserve is an extension of three months in their maternity leave to give them the space to catch up on experiences and medical appointments, check-ups and all the other activities they have missed out on.  These parents are now facing going back to work in a completely changed environment and many are unable to secure childcare places for their children.  Many cr&egrave;ches are simply not accepting newborns and this is leaving parents in the lurch.  In my constituency, a mother has been advised by her employer that she must hand in her notice if she is not ready to come back to work.  She is parenting alone and cannot secure childcare.  Her employer has now given her the option of looking after her children or losing her job.</p> <p> This Covid crisis has laid bare the absolute shambles that is childcare provision in this State.  The fees are absolutely outrageous and the waiting lists are lengthy.  This has left the parents of small children struggling with a enormous financial burden.  At the weekend, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Gorman, stated that he hoped that cr&egrave;che fees will be capped in order to ensure that parents will not have to pay more than their monthly mortgage payment for childcare fees.  Is that the extent of the ambition of this new Government?  Is this the radical change that people voted for in February?  Those comments were disgraceful and they show a total lack of understanding of the childcare issues that parents face.</p> <p> Mothers who have given birth during the Covid crisis are not trying to pull a fast one.  They have gone through an awfully bloody time and all they are asking for is an extension of three months to their maternity leave.  Given the difficult circumstances that they have had to endure, surely this is not too much to ask of the new Government.</p></speech>

These have been an extremely strange and stressful few months for all of us and I have no doubt that being at home with a new baby without the usual support systems must have been and continues to be extremely challenging for people.  Not having grandparents, siblings and friends around to share the joy and the work of minding a newborn is difficult and I think everyone in the House will recognise this.</p><p>The Government is acutely aware that many families have suffered during the pandemic, and that social distancing is particularly hard when one is caring for a young child or children and one has to be cautious about every social interaction.  Having said that, the Government is of the view that a temporary enhanced entitlement to maternity benefit is not the appropriate course of action.  This is not about money.  The change being sought is complex from a legal perspective.  It is not as simple as is being suggested.  Adopting the proposed measure would require me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to bring forward primary legislation to amend the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 to 2004, in order to provide that women who had already started or completed their maternity period would be entitled to take a further 13 weeks' leave.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection would also be required to amend the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, to provide for the associated payment of maternity benefit at &euro;245 per week for the period of any extension.</p><p>The amendment would require legislation to have a retrospective effect.  Retrospective legislation, as the House will be aware, is extremely rare and can raise constitutional issues.  In addition, there may be legal difficulties in identifying the relevant cohort to which the amendment would apply.  There are also practical considerations for how such an extension would be implemented in circumstances where some mothers may have already returned to the workplace or who are intending to return in the very near future.</p><p>An extension to maternity leave, while benefiting a small number of people, would also impact on others, most obviously employers who are already struggling with the impact of Covid-19 on their workplaces and other employees who may have had to manage complex childcare arrangements during the past three months, as many in this House will have done.  Any time we introduce a change in the mandatory leave arrangements for employees, we have to consider these impacts and we have to try and achieve the right balance between home life and work life.  That is all the more important now given the extraordinary changes to working arrangements that the whole country has undergone.  It would not be a responsible act for me, as Minister, to add a significant additional element to the challenges that business managers and, in particular, employees of SMEs are facing to resume their work during the COVID-19 pandemic.  These are businesses struggling to stay open and keep their employees healthy and working.  These issues that they are likely to face have been raised with me, as have the concerns by many mothers. They are concerned about the additional burden this proposal would place on the businesses and on their employees and we must look at both.</p><p>That said, this Government is firmly committed to enhancing the time that parents can spend with their new children but we want to do so in a way that the benefits, and any resulting burdens, are spread widely and equitably between mothers and fathers and do not come as an unexpected additional burden to our key SME sector.  The Government is proposing to advance the extension of parent's leave and benefit to five weeks for all parents of children born on after 1 November 2019 as an alternative to the temporary targeted extension of maternity leave and benefit.  The proposal will enable all eligible parents to spend additional time with their young children in the future.  I am sure Deputies will agree that this is a more desirable outcome than a reform limited to a specific group and a specific time.</p><p>Parent's leave and benefit were introduced on 1 November 2019 with the commencement of the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019.  This Act allows for a possible extension of the period of parent's leave and benefit.  An order can be made by the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide for an extension of parent's leave.  This can be done with the consent of the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The making of such an order requires prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition to leave for parents that is already in place - such as maternity and paternity leave - the Act provides an individual entitlement for each parent for a child born or adopted on or after 1 November 2019.</p><p>The parent's leave entitlement is currently two weeks' leave for each parent to be taken within 52 weeks of the birth or placement of the child.  Parents may also be entitled to parent's benefit which is paid at &euro;245 per week for two weeks.  This is the same rate as maternity benefit.  An extension of parent's leave and benefit will have a positive impact on family life.  Evidence shows that children benefit from being cared for and spending time with both parents, particularly when they are young.  Parent's leave provides fathers as well as mothers with an opportunity to participate in the care of their child at this young age.</p><p>Given that paid parent's leave cannot be shared between parents, an increase from two weeks to five weeks provides, in effect, an additional six weeks per family.</p> <p>We also intend to extend the period in which the leave can be taken.  This will allow the leave to be taken in the first two years of a child's life rather than the first 52 weeks, as is the case at present.  These changes will apply to all new parents once the reforms are approved and the parents of children born during the pandemic will be eligible to take the leave at the same time as all other parents once the 2021 budget process is completed in November.  This would not have happened without the changes we are proposing.  The proposals contained in the amendment will be considered as part of the 2021 budget process and will come into force thereafter.</p> <p> I understand the difficulties and I have spoken to many parents.  While the measures we intend to introduce in the budget will not fully deliver what has been asked for, they will go some way towards helping not only a specific set of parents, but all parents in the coming weeks, months and years.  I commend the amendment to the House.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Kerrane on putting this motion before the House.  I support it entirely.  I also commend all of the new mothers who led the campaign to extend maternity leave and those who supported them in their work, including the National Women's Council of Ireland and Members of this House, including Deputies McDonald, O'Reilly, Br&iacute;d Smith and others from across the political divide who stood outside the gates of this complex and assured those women that everything that could possibly be done on their behalf would be done.</p>  <p>  This evening we have seen that the chaos for which Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments have been renowned is very much evident once again.  The actions of the Government in bringing forward its amendment and rejecting the motion as put forward by Deputy Kerrane also show that the uncaring and out-of-touch nature of Administrations comprising those parties is also still evident.  The amendment to the motion and the Minister's remarks go to great lengths to assure people that the Government understands the issues pertaining to women who have had children during the pandemic period.  They go to great lengths to say that the Government understands the difficulties facing their families before going on to offer those people precisely sweet damn all in return.  That is really disappointing.  In fact, it is inexcusable.  I have no doubt that, if the Minister were on this side of the House and facing such an amendment to the motion, she would treat it with the disdain it warrants.</p>  <p>  I ask the Government to withdraw its amendment between now and Thursday, when we will vote on the motion, to stand with those women, not only in words but in actions, who have just had new babies and their families, and to show them that the State is caring and supports them in the position they are in.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400051#EEE00300"><p>This motion is enormously important to thousands of mothers and families throughout the State, as the Minister acknowledged.  I also acknowledge the work done by the National Women's Council of Ireland and the group campaigning to extend maternity leave in 2020.  I further acknowledge Deputy Kerrane for bringing the motion before the House.</p>  <p>  We are only talking about 12 weeks, or 60 working days.  This would help the likes of Lauren, who finished her maternity leave on 31 May.  She has 16 weeks of extended leave.  She has zero income and is building a house.  She has no cr&egrave;che facility.  That is the type of predicament these mothers are in.  I have spoken with dozens of mothers who are distressed and under financial pressure because of the situations in which they find themselves.  The Minister stated that retrospective legislation is extremely rare but so are pandemics.  During what should be the happiest time of their lives and when they should be enjoying their new babies, these mothers are left feeling isolated and uncared for.  Mothers have described to me how they could not go for walks with their babies and how they have been up all night caring for their babies before trying to home-school their other children.  They have told me how they have no childcare for their other children and face uncertainty as regards cr&egrave;ches.  They have told me how they could not even accept the help of their own mothers or siblings due to the lockdown and how they worried because they could not get their children to the baby clinic for injections.</p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion allows us to make good this situation.  It just gives these mothers an extra 60 days to spend quality time with their babies.  It would mean that mothers would not be forced to give up their jobs or to take unpaid annual leave which would compound the financial stress many families are experiencing.  It is time to give these mothers and families the break they need.  We should do so now, not after the budget.</p></speech>

It shows what a group of strong women can do when they get together.  It is just common sense to extend maternity leave by 12 weeks.  The programme for Government talks about extending maternity leave, parental leave and paternity leave.  This is the perfect opportunity for the Government to show that it is serious about that and to actually do something about it by taking real action and extending maternity leave by 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  It is obviously a very exciting time for people when a new baby comes into the house but those of us who have gone through it - I have taken maternity leave twice myself - will know that it can be a very difficult and stressful time.  One can be very anxious.  One of the truest saying in this regard is that one has absolutely no idea until one has gone through it and seen how difficult it can be at times.  What new mothers have gone through in recent months has been unbelievable.  There is the lack of family support and the very practical things we have heard about including public health visits, vaccinations and so on.  It makes sense to give mothers a bit of extra time with their babies and time with other children because everything just stopped all of a sudden.  Schools and cr&egrave;ches were closed.  These mothers had new babies on their hands and potentially other children as well.  The reality is that it was very difficult.  This is an excellent opportunity for the Government to start on the right note, particularly with the women of this country.  It is in the programme for Government so why not make a start now with this motion?</p>  <p>  In general, we all want to see maternity leave, parental leave and paternity leave to be extended.  This is a good way to start that.  The Minister said that this is a very technical and complex matter and that there is no way it could be done but the reality is that anything is possible if there is political will.  That is what is lacking.  The political will to do this is not there.</p>  <p>  The announcement of the three extra weeks of parental leave was a bit disingenuous.  People were contacting me today who thought that they would at least have an extra three weeks at the end of their maternity leave, which might be due to end in the next couple of weeks.  They actually will not have it until after November at the earliest.  It makes no sense to ask people to send their new babies, who have not been exposed to anything and who have only been at home, to cr&egrave;che facilities, if they can get one, when we are all wearing masks and sanitising our hands.  If the Government is serious about addressing these issues, this would be a good start and a good way to show it is taking the issue seriously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400051#EEE00500"><p>It takes a village to raise a child.  Covid-19 and the restrictions that came with it put that fact up in lights.  In the very short time I have, I will focus on first-time parents.  I am familiar with the experience myself.  People leave the hospital full of enthusiasm and love and bursting with pride but, in truth, they do not know what they are at and are half petrified.  To overcome this, they lean on their family, friends, neighbours and anyone else who is willing to help.  In normal times, there are many such people.</p>  <p>  My good friends, whom the Minister knows, Miche&aacute;l &Oacute;g &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir and Emma Dillon Gallagher, became parents for the first time on 14 March when Emma gave birth to beautiful baby Faol&aacute;n.  The picture of the first time baby Faol&aacute;n met his grandad, seven days later, was posted on Twitter.  It was retweeted 106,000 times and received 714,000 likes.  It was seen all over the world.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The new parents were asked to do media interviews in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.  We could ask why that was the case.  Many people will have seen it in the media.  It is because in the photo Faol&aacute;n is not in his grandad's arms - he cannot be - and his granddad is outside the house, peering in through the kitchen window at his grandson in his son's arms.  Three generations are separated by a window due to Covid-19 restrictions.  There was novelty in the story of the photo, but actually it was very sad.  New mums and babies such as Emma and Faol&aacute;n have been denied some of the very basic and essential supports that would otherwise be available.  Routine check-ups, visits from the public health nurse, vaccinations, therapies, mother and baby groups, and breastfeeding circles have similarly been cancelled or postponed.</p> <p> Postnatal depression has apparently increased threefold during the Covid period and I have no doubt the same applies to anxiety.  Childcare is a significant issue and it needs to be addressed.  It takes a village to raise a child.  Covid-19 has denied mothers and babies that benefit.  It has been said to me that we were forced to close the doors and lock ourselves away for three months.  The only compassionate and decent thing to do for new mothers and babies is to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I support Deputy Carthy's proposal that the Government withdraw its amendment as it does not go anywhere near far enough.  I commend the Sinn F&eacute;in motion to the House.</p></speech>

We welcome this unambiguous motion that should warrant the support of the majority of the Members of this House.</p><p>I reread the Minister's speech as I found part of it quite difficult to understand.  She stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The change being sought is complex from a legal perspective.  It is not as simple as is being suggested.  Adopting the proposed measure would require me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to bring forward primary legislation to amend the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 to 2004, in order to provide that women who had already started or completed their maternity period would be entitled to take a further 13 weeks' leave.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection would also be required to amend the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, to provide for the associated payment of maternity benefit at &euro;245 per week for the period of any extension. </blockquote>  <p>The Minister continued:</p> <blockquote> 	What is proposed in the motion would require legislation to have a retrospective effect.  Retrospective legislation, as the House will be aware, is extremely rare and can raise constitutional issues.  In addition, there may be legal difficulties in identifying the relevant cohort to which the amendment would apply.  </blockquote>  <p>With all due respect to the Minister, whom I wish well in her role, for a Minister to come into the Houses of the Oireachtas and give as an excuse for not dealing with this issue the line that it would be too complex from a legal perspective is condescending and patronising to those of us who represent the very women who have given us the testimonials of just how much this crisis has affected them.  If we had as a bar or standard that all legislation would have to be simple and clear before we could proceed, we would never get anything done in this House.  In fact, we would never have introduced the extensive legislation in respect of the Covid pandemic, which gave rise to many Government initiatives and which was extremely complex.  The Minister and the Government should rethink their approach to this issue.  Using the excuse that the matter is complex is not good enough for the women who have sought changes to the legislation and who voiced the concerns we have heard tonight.</p><p>Childcare is an issue we have been raising for months in this House.  This is the fourth time I have pointed out that we have yet to come up with a solution in respect of childcare in this country.  To be frank about it, the Government has been found wanting.  We now have testimony from so many providers and parents in respect of their inability to provide childcare facilities for babies under the age of one year.  We are now seeing the evidence of a regressivity having crept in as a result of Covid-19 in respect of women's rights in this country.  I ask the Government to please revisit this issue from a policy point of view because this pandemic has had a massive effect on women and their ability to progress in their careers and in society as a whole.  That effect has not been fully measured.  No quantum or metrics have been fully put behind it.  There is some nascent research from the Central Statistics Office.  I ask the Government to please revisit this issue on behalf of those women in order that we can bring forward progressive ideas on how women can progress in their jobs and in society.</p><p>There is no Green Party Minister in the Chamber, although there may be one here later on in the evening.  I do not wish to attack anybody, but we have before us testimony from Deputy O'Gorman, who is now a Minister.  I wish him well in his Ministry.  He raised this issue in the D&aacute;il on 20 May when he asked whether the then Minister had considered how groups such as women returning from maternity leave and employees returning from sick leave had been impacted by the current definition of specified employee under the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  He asked if the Minister had considered extending the statutory period of maternity leave, and the period of payment of maternity benefit, to provide protection for women who would otherwise be returning to work during the Covid-19 crisis.  The current Minister asked in a parliamentary question on 3 June, just last month, if the Minister for Justice and Equality - at the time it was Deputy Flanagan - would consider extending maternity leave and benefit for those women moving into the unpaid entitlement phase of their maternity leave during the Covid-19 crisis, and if he would make a statement on the matter.  There was a very clear, unambiguous position by one of the constituent parties of the Government in respect of dealing in an honest and forthright way with this issue on behalf of the thousands of women affected.</p><p>The Government's response tonight has fallen a little short of expectations.  The Minister cannot come to the House and speak about the &quot;unexpected additional burden to our key SME sector&quot;, having presumably heard the concerns of the SME sector in respect of this issue.  The SME sector is only one sector in society.  I know the Minister has to represent every swathe of society in this argument but there seems to be too much of what the SME sector has said in her response to this motion and not enough of what an august body, the National Women's Council of Ireland, has said.  That it supported this campaign on behalf of the women of Ireland should be enough for any progressive Government to stand up and take stock, listen and respond accordingly.</p><p>It is not long since Members of this House, now Ministers of the Government, stood up in this House and, to coin a phrase, spoke on the side of the angels on this issue.  It is deeply disappointing that they have gone to the other side in a heartbeat.  The testimonials are real.  These are emails from real people that we are all receiving.  A baby girl was screened due to reflux and no hands-on help was available or recommended from GPs, lactation consultants and osteopaths.  It was said that phone consultations are not the same.  The baby suffered unnecessarily for weeks until things settled down for her.  Her parents suffered.  Another mother said this was not the happy maternity leave she was looking forward to when having her baby.  She is due back to work in September but she cannot get childcare sorted due to restrictions.  This means she will need to take unpaid leave, which will create its own financial stresses and burdens.</p> <p>Many of us will have gone through this process.  As a father of two small children, I can relate to this.  However, because we were not then in a Covid-type situation, my family had access to all of the services that new parents can expect to avail of.  These were not available for many of these women.  As a society, we can do a lot more.  Senator Marie Sherlock, who, in case anyone is wondering, is a first cousin of mine, got the wording right on this issue, when she said the following:  </p><blockquote>	The extension in parental leave will not become available until November 2020.  This means that the crisis facing a number of parents who have exhausted all their maternity, paternity and parental leave and who cannot secure childcare for their young baby is not resolved.  These parents are still facing stark choices. </blockquote> <p>Will the Minister revisit this issue?  I know she is a progressive Minister and if she were to revisit this, she would do a great service to many women and families throughout this country.</p></speech>

She rang to tell me her story and the reason an extension to maternity leave was so important to her.  She was carrying twins.  Tragically, she lost one of the babies.  She continued with her pregnancy but it was a very difficult pregnancy.  She was grieving for her baby and the birth was very traumatic.  This woman has not had access to any counselling or physiotherapy and she is both physically and emotionally scarred following that experience.  Childbirth and having a baby should be something that a woman treasures.  However, this woman is in a very difficult position at the moment.  She told me she needs extra time for her body and mind to heal.  She needs time to get the supports that were denied to her due to Covid.  She is due to return to work in September and she does not think she will be in a position to do so.  She is going to be faced with the choice of looking after herself, her baby and her own health or going back to work.  That is a very difficult choice for any mother to have to make.</p><p>I learned all about this woman because I picked up the phone and listened to her story.  I really wish the Government had listened to all those women who have been telling their stories over the past few weeks and months.  Listening to her story, it became blatantly obvious that this call for an extension to maternity leave is not a luxury or something nice to have but an absolute necessity to support mothers for whom motherhood in this period has been very traumatic, scary, lonely and stressful.  There are many women who have this story to tell.</p><p>Not only did mothers find themselves in challenging situations during maternity leave but they are now facing various barriers to returning to work.  The roadmap to economic recovery has largely ignored two very important sectors that support women and families in the workforce, namely, childcare and education.  Parents, particularly women, have been dealing with these until now in the absence of any cohesive policy and strategy aligning the reopening of cr&egrave;ches and schools with the reopening of the economy.  With approximately 60% of childcare facilities taking up Government supports, there is a question mark over the other 40%.  We are finding that childcare has yet to return to normal capacity as the sector reopens.  It is particularly difficult to find care for children under one year of age.  Without adequate childcare, mothers have had to face some very hard decisions.  Some have returned to work part time, while others have had to quit work altogether.  Many are working from home while minding the baby and others are taking annual leave and parental leave to try to carry them through until childcare is available again.  This leads to fears of a two-tier workforce emerging as women are forced to choose between the domestic and professional demands in their lives.</p><p>What new mothers need now is time.  They need time to catch up on some of the important health checks for themselves and their babies and to source childcare.  Extending maternity leave would buy them crucial time to manage their transition back into the workforce.  This time has been taken away from them as a result of the pandemic.  If the Government had taken time to listen to all of those mothers and the stories they told outside the gates of Leinster House, they would have realised very early on that the proposed parental leave extension, which the Government mooted as an alternative to the extension of maternity leave, will not meet the needs of these women and families.  It is not a simple issue of providing leave for parents.  The issue is one of providing the correct leave at the correct time.  Women on maternity leave need an extension to be implemented urgently.  They do not have the luxury of waiting until budget 2021 for the Government to potentially sort this out or for the promise of additional paid parental leave to materialise because if or when that happens it will be too late for many of these mothers.</p><p>I will read from two documents, the first of which is the First 5 strategy, the ten-year plan to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families.  The strategy states that, under a new paid parental leave scheme established in 2019, by 2021 &quot;parents will each have an individual entitlement to seven weeks of paid parental leave&quot;.  The second document is the programme for Government which clearly states the Government will extend &quot;paid parental leave for parents to allow them spend more time with their baby in their first year&quot;.  It also states the Government will implement &quot;the <i>First 5 Strategy</i>for babies, young children and their families&quot;.  Despite the promises made in these documents, the Government announced an extension of paid parental live by three weeks, not the five weeks announced in this document.  The First 5 strategy clearly states that by 2021-----</p></speech>

It is really disappointing that one of the first initiatives announced by this Government potentially undercuts parents.  The Government, in its amendment, states it will examine the matter, that it is a proposal at this stage and that there are no guarantees with regard to the amount of paid leave promised to struggling parents.  It is also unfortunate and disappointing that the Government has done this in a way that has completely undermined a campaign led by women who have far more pressing issues on their minds and much greater demands on their time than campaigning for supports that should provided for them.  We should be supporting women and their families in the same way we supported the SME sector.  This has been a cynical move by the Government given the indications given in recent weeks by both the current and previous Taoisigh that they would listen and take into consideration what these women were asking for.</p>  <p>  We should not be playing political games with this important issue.  We should want better for women, mothers and families in this country.  We should recognise the integral role that women and mothers play in society, not only in the economy but also in providing quality of life for children, young people and those who need care.  Women continue to be undervalued, underpaid and under-represented.  This has to change.  It is time we saw Covid as an opportunity to rectify the entrenched inequalities that exist in society and begin reforming how the economy works for mothers, parents and families.  I noted the Minister stated there would be three weeks' parental leave per parent, meaning each family would have six weeks.  In many families, there is only one parent and that must also be considered.</p>  <p>  Extending maternity leave and pay is an opportunity for the Government to show it is serious about addressing the barriers facing women.  The way in which a Government addresses a crisis shows its priorities for the foreseeable future.  Parents, mothers in particular, have been at the crossroads of the numerous State responses to this crisis.  The response has failed to address the reality for mothers and women during this pandemic where childcare, education and health are concerned.  I urge the Government to acknowledge this first and foremost by extending the maternity leave and pay until November, as provided for in the motion.  It is time for us all to come together and help mothers hold their babies.</p></speech>

I thank the National Women's Council for their support and I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion.  I tabled a motion under the previous regime, which was circulated and signed by more than 77 Deputies.  I will return to this at the end of my contribution.  It was kicked around the House between the Ministers with responsibility for justice, social protection and finance and it eventually ended up in limbo.  We had the formation of the Government last week, and it was being kicked around until a statement was made last night that parents' leave would be extended by a number of weeks.  To their great disappointment and shock, the women out there find themselves back at square one.</p>  <p>  Having listened to the Minister's speech and having read through it carefully I want to pick up on a number of issues.  She stated it is too complex to change the legislation.  Although the Minister is not here - perhaps she will look back on this afterwards - I want to ask her whether she has looked at the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill, which is 142 pages of extremely complex and technical legislation to ensure we have business as usual.  We passed legislation during the emergency that covers evictions, redundancies, mortgages and all sorts of complex areas of society, but this is about women and babies.</p>  <p>  I remember acutely how we sat in the Chamber discussing the repeal the eighth campaign and trying to reach a position of consensus with the Citizens' Assembly and then having long arduous hours of arguments about women's right to choose.  That choice is about being able to have a child as much as choosing not to have a child.  Here are women who have had children and their choices are being utterly minimised by the countermotion presented to us tonight.</p>  <p>  I will not go through the sad cases of the individuals who have written to me and the many tortuous issues women with small babies have had to face during Covid.  The Minister said it is not about money.  I got a figure from the former Minister, Senator Regina Doherty, of more than &euro;130 million to cover all of the women who would be entitled to an extension of three months of maternity leave if the motion was passed.  We then had a figure from the Taoiseach of &euro;75 million.  If it is not about money then what is it about?  It is about women and babies.</p>  <p>  Tomorrow we will further discuss financial legislation to commit ourselves to more than &euro;600 million of European Union funds for which we have no accountability.  We do not know what the funds will do or where they will go.  We know exactly what the millions that would be spent on extending maternity leave would do.  They would improve the quality of life of thousands of women and babies and, therefore, improve society as a whole.</p>  <p>  As are other Deputies, I am extremely worried that this is a real setback for women's rights in this country.  These are rights we fought very long and hard to win.  Women are losing their jobs and failing to get promotion.  Women will be set back in their careers because they cannot find anybody to mind their children.  Cr&egrave;che places are just not available and grandparents, who usually act as a substitute, cannot do the job.  The fact that women are having to resign from jobs and forgo promotion is a kick in the face for women's rights and it is utterly shameful that the new Government would do something like this.</p>  <p>  I want to go through today's Covid figures because it is significant that we have had the largest number of new cases in a month.  Today there have been 32 new cases, with ten people in intensive care.  We have no certainty that the pandemic has gone away.  In fact, we are probably looking at a spike.  What do we then say to women who are being forced back to work with small babies at home?  The Government has to do the right thing and grant this extension to maternity leave.</p>  <p>  My last words are to the Green Party because eight of them signed the previous motion that we had hoped to present to the House.  Eight of them made statements to women, such as that it is of utmost importance that mothers of new babies have adequate childcare options available to them.  Deputy Neasa Hourigan said that extending maternity leave is Green Party policy and that she really wanted to support it fully.  What are those Deputies going to do on Thursday when it comes to a vote?  Will they vote against the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and support the terrible countermotion tabled by the Minister?  What about all of the Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael who enthusiastically signed the petition?  They will have to answer to their constituents if they vote against the motion on Thursday.</p></speech>

She says she was so upset and so sad she could not even hold her mother, that she was on her own for all of the labour except for ten minutes and that her husband barely made the birth.  She says they have had a hard start and continues to detail that hard start.  Emma says this is what her maternity leave has been.  The response of the Government to Emma and the 30,000 people who signed the petition is incredibly stingy.  The Government is starting as it means to continue and its proposal is nowhere near what is necessary.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion is a bare minimum that anyone who fights for the rights of women should be voting for.</p>  <p>  Even if the motion were implemented, it would not change the fact that the country's parental and maternity leave schemes are in need of change.  The pandemic has exposed even more sharply the clear problems with the system, but the problems predated Covid-19.  The State's attitude towards working-class families has always been one of contempt.  Nothing has made that clearer than the fact that 62% of INMO members have had to use annual leave for childcare purposes during the crisis.  So much for applause for our front-line workers.  The low level of paid maternity leave and parental leave, which are among the lowest in Europe, is part of an entire system of a neoliberal capitalist race to the bottom.  At the very least, employers should be forced to top up welfare benefits to full pay.</p>  <p>  Two measures that would transform the experience of parents, and mothers in particular, are a 30-hour week without loss of pay and two years of fully paid leave for parents.  This would create conditions to fight against the gendered expectation that childcare is primarily a woman's job.  It would significantly improve the health and well-being of parents and children.  The Government's offer is completely inadequate.</p></speech>

Families have been unable to extend the normal support because of the Covid situation.  The support of professionals has been very difficult to tap into because of Covid.  Many examples have been given in the debate so far, particularly as it relates to childcare.  Babies have missed vaccinations, the scans they would normally have and developmental checks.</p>  <p>  Demand has risen not from the Chamber but from women themselves and society that changes be made to support women and families in this situation and that maternity leave be extended by three months, from six months to nine months.  It is shameful that the Government is coming forward with a proposal for an extra three weeks' parental leave, which is rehashing an old promise.  The Green Party in particular has to answer the question whether it will stand over this on Thursday or whether it will support the position it previously backed.</p>  <p>  By the way, this is a very modest demand.  A total of &euro;245 per week is 26.7% of the average income of mothers who give birth in this country.  In Lithuania people get 100%, in Slovenia they get 92.7% and in the Czech Republic they get 74.1%.  Ireland is not the worst but it is far from the best in this regard.  The same applies with regard to the amount of time.  We are calling for nine months but in Estonia it is 166 weeks and not 39 weeks, in Finland it is 161 weeks and in Bulgaria it is 110 weeks.  The proposal that has been put forward in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion is very modest.</p> <p>At a bare minimum it must be supported as an alternative to the shameful position of the Government on this issue.</p></speech>

One thing we all must accept is that Covid-19 has changed things utterly and we simply cannot dismiss matters that would have been rejected out of hand by Governments in the past.  Who would have thought that a Government would introduce a one-tier health system overnight or ban rent increases, a policy that had been opposed so hard previously?  The same approach is now needed with regard to childcare and maternity leave.  Both are inextricably linked.</p>  <p>  Many of us have spent sleepless nights taking care of a sick child, naturally hoping that the child would improve but also panicking about how we would mind the sick child in the morning when we clearly could not access childcare and the child was too sick to go to school.  How many of us have encouraged one of our children out the door to school when, privately and honestly, we thought the child should be at home?  As we had no childcare backup, we did not have any choice because we had to be in work that day.  Yes, Zoom and Teams will be a godsend for many families, but what if a person has no childcare at all?</p>  <p>  I have been receiving messages from parents, not just first-time parents but also parents of siblings in childcare.  One is that there is no cr&egrave;che in the area that will accept a child under the age of two years due to the coronavirus, not to mind a six month old.  Another is that the parents have been informed that the cr&egrave;che where their baby was due to start has decided to stop taking children under one year old due to the restrictions being placed on it as a result of Covid-19.  This places the parents in the impossible position of having no childcare for the baby.  That is the practical problem women are now facing.  There is no childcare alternative available for them such as would have been available before Covid-19.</p>  <p>  There is a further aspect to this that we cannot ignore, the mental health of mothers.  All of us accept that Covid-19 has had a detrimental impact on the mental health of many people in society, and it has compounded an already stressful time for new mothers.  From the conversations I have had with mothers and the messages my office has received, it is clear that some mothers are suffering as a direct result of Covid-19, the lockdown, the lack of contact with family, the stress of childcare provision as well as concerns that we all share about a second wave of infection.  A three-month extension to maternity leave for this cohort of mothers would help to alleviate some of the stress and anxiety and ultimately help to reduce the pressure on mental health services.  A Vision for Change, the World Health Organization and even the United Nations have clearly identified maternal mental health as a priority for society.  Some 13% of women experience postnatal depression during the first year after birth, and in some instances this can persist for long periods of time.  It can have an adverse effect on the entire family, including on partners and on the emotional and cognitive development of infants and their siblings.</p>  <p>  I listened intently to the Minister's response earlier.  She highlighted the additional impact this would have in terms of cost on employers.  It is a fact that employers are currently legally obliged, if requested, to provide an additional 16 weeks' maternity leave.  It is also the case that employers are not legally obliged to top up the salary with respect to maternity benefit.  I can fully understand and empathise with many employers who are not in the financial position to top up that payment.  However, the State has been intervening in terms of people who were working part time for four hours per week and was prepared to pay them &euro;350 per week, against the advice I gave the then Taoiseach and the party leaders at that time.  That decision was taken, yet it is not prepared to pay this small cohort of women &euro;245 per week for three months.</p>  <p>  The issue regarding maternity leave masks a far greater problem with regard to childcare capacity, which is the return to schools and the impact this will have on women, in particular.  We must do everything possible to ensure the schools can fully reopen in September.  My concern is that any reduction in the number of hours or days that children attend school, particularly primary school, will impact disproportionately on thousands of women throughout the country.  We have already seen the impact of the lack of childcare on our front-line staff.  We are seeing it again now as parents are struggling to find childcare for young children where they cannot work from home and where grandparents are unable to help as they traditionally would have.  If schools do not fully reopen in September, there will be a far wider impact on the current crisis.</p>  <p>  If we are facing a situation where childcare facilities are not going to open or will only take reduced numbers or not cater for children under the age of two years, leaving parents without childcare options, especially where they need to return to employment and where the work cannot be done from home, we must examine solutions that would not have been contemplated prior to Covid-19.  The provision put forward by Deputy Kerrane is one.  Her proposal of a three-month extension for maternity leave is sensible.  I ask the Government to reconsider the amendment it has tabled and to support this proposal, not reject it out of hand.</p></speech>

The announcement yesterday regarding parents' leave is a step in the right direction, but it is not a solution.  It does not solve the crisis that parents face now.  It also excludes anybody whose baby was born earlier than last November.  These babies still need to be cared for.  It is imperative to support this motion.</p>  <p>  Childcare is difficult to find at the best of times, but the situation has been made worse by the closure of childcare facilities due to Covid-19.  Many families have been left without childcare, particularly those with babies younger than one year.  Some mothers do not have any childcare for their new babies.  The babies are afraid of other people because, as a result of the country's shutdown, they have not spent time with anybody other than their mothers and fathers.  Additionally, parents are worried about the safety of returning to work and leaving their babies with strangers when the world is in the midst of a pandemic.</p>  <p>  New mothers have spent the past four months isolated at home with a small baby and it has been desperately hard for them.  For many mothers with small babies, Covid-19 has made maternity leave extremely challenging.  Now these mothers are expected to return to work even though childcare for children under a year old is simply not available.  If they decide not to return to workforce, many will go into mortgage arrears, so they have no choice.  I support the motion.</p></speech>

I compliment the Deputy and Sinn F&eacute;in on putting it forward.  I hope this new and what is meant to be all-embracing Government will understand it and try to support it.</p> <p> Covid-19 has resulted in a very difficult time for many families but especially mothers who have experienced the pleasure, beauty and joy of giving birth to a baby.  Many such mothers were unable to have the support of their partners or husbands because of the lockdown and the situation regarding entry to hospitals.  The daddies and fathers had to wait until such time as mother and baby were being discharged even to see their babies.  As a proud grandparent of eight wonderful grandchildren, I know what it is like for grandparents to have to wait to get to see and hold and embrace their grandchildren.  It is a very joyous and spontaneous event for them to meet their grandchild in the first days.  It is normally in the hospital that this happens.</p> <p> Mothers have been denied so much and need now to be supported, dealt with sensitively and engaged with.  Many of them have not had even the pleasure - the necessity, really - of having the community nurse visit them to do the checkup on the child and to discuss his or her weight and feeding.  Such visits are very important to both mother and baby and indeed the father and all the siblings.  I receive emails from many grandparents and many mothers in this position and it is heart-rending to see them not being supported.  A paltry amount was offered yesterday, and the three weeks' extra leave announced is just not enough.  We have found money for everything in the Covid pandemic.  I know there will be a payback day.  I spoke in strong terms to the Minister for Finance about the &euro;350 payment for everybody, no matter if they were working two hours or ten hours per week.  It was ridiculous and gave people a sense of that money.  People will miss it terribly when it is cut off from them.  It will affect their applications for their SUSI grants and everything else.  It was a rushed decision.  We had no problem with the money.  Now it is proposed to pay mothers &euro;245 for 12 weeks.  Our children are our very future.  A nation is not a nation without its children.  They are the most important people to be nourished.</p> <p> In 2017 we introduced extended maternity leave for parents of premature children.  At the time I very much welcomed this extension.  My first grandchild, Amy-Berry, was born at just 30 weeks and spent over three months in hospital, so I understand the difficulties, stress and worries such situations bring.  Back then there was no extension to maternity benefit.  Thankfully, this was rectified, but I said at the time that what we were introducing had a lot of glaring anomalies in it, and it did, as much legislation does.  I am sure the motion we are debating has many anomalies as well.  Parents of premature children get an extra week's maternity benefit, depending on how prematurely the baby was born, to help them cope with extra hospital stays in neonatal units.  However, parents of children with life-limiting conditions born at full term and facing the same long stays in neonatal units receive nothing extra.  That is an awful statement.  Is it any wonder the thinking was along those lines when we see the savage abortion regime introduced in 2018?</p> <p> We have to think seriously about supporting the mothers and the babies.  I will probably be attacked for saying this, but the mothers are normally the homemakers.  They do a wonderful job and must be supported.  I salute the mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers and siblings for the support they give families.  There is a saying in Africa, I think, that it takes a village to rear a child.  It takes a whole family.  It is a very lonely place for a single mother. a mother who is away or, in this case, a mother in hospital on her own.  If there are any issues or delayed discharge after the birth, it is very harrowing and very tiring on them.  There is also the huge fear of being in hospital and perhaps coming into contact with Covid patients and becoming infected.</p> <p> As I said, both parents need to be supported.  We now have paternity leave as well.  Deputy Naughten mentioned employers, especially small ones in the current situation, who will find it hard to pay the extra leave.  Nonetheless, and I keep saying this, small employers especially value their staff.  It is a two-way street.  The staff value, appreciate and respect their employers and many amicable agreements are worked out.</p> <p> As I said, the parents of premature babies face a lifetime of hospital appointments, long hospital stays and many life challenges but they get no such support.  Therefore, while I support the motion, I ask that this group of parents are given support outside of the Covid-19 temporary extension because they need it.  It is not because Covid is here that they need it.  They need it all the more now that Covid is here but they need it in any case.  We have to nurture our youngest and our babies.  They are the adults of the future and the people who will fill up our schools and go on to third level education and indeed run our country and fill all the roles.</p> <p> One of my other concerns is that over-66s have been left with nothing.  Many of them are grandparents.  This is heartless.  These grandparents want to help rear their grandchildren, collect them from the cr&egrave;ches, bring them home, collect them from school, bring them to sports - whatever - to support the working families and the two parents who work because they have to work.  That is a very sad outcome.  It should be remembered that many of those grandparents will be called on again when their great-grandchildren are born.  It is a wonderful thing to be able to help in such cases.</p> <p> Mention was made of mental health, which is very important and a huge issue, and the damaging effect the Covid lockdown has had on people's mental health.  Some 13% of mothers suffer postnatal depression.  They need extra support and help.  The fact that they are being forced back to work now, just out of their maternity leave, can bring its own stresses and strains on mental health.  Because of Covid they have had no time until recent weeks to go out for a meal or a walk with their husband or partner or whoever else and their baby.  Those are the normal things they do.  They are so proud.  They have pride in their eyes and their faces when they present their babies to people.  They look forward to the christening and their long life together.  It is very important that this support be found.  After all, we can find savage amounts of money to pay for an abortion industry in which 6,666 children were aborted last year.  We have no bother paying the money for that or encouraging more of it.  We should be able to find this support for the living babies.  All the babies from the womb to the tomb should be spared.  The legislation in this area is unequal.  I appeal to the Minister of State's better judgment to support these mothers and families.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who has put great work into this area.  Really, though, this came from the ground, and what Sinn F&eacute;in has rightly done, and it deserves praise for having done so, is to respond to the organic movement of women on the ground.  We have almost 30,000 signatures asking us to do something.  I am very disappointed that the senior Minister has left.  I realise that Ministers are very busy, but this is a particularly important topic.  The National Women's Council of Ireland is giving full support to the motion and there is no Minister who happens to be female in the D&aacute;il, which is unfortunate.  If there is a personal reason for her absence, I will certainly forgive her.  It does not look well or augur well, however.</p>  <p>  We have learned two messages from Covid - we simply cannot go back to where we were, and we are all in this together.  I did not believe either message but I went with them for a while and tried to put aside my cynicism.  Certainly, the people in residential homes, direct provision and meat factories were not treated like the rest of us.  The message that we are all in it together is far from accurate.  Certainly, we treated the people over 70 very differently and with no justification whatsoever.</p> <p>That there is no going back has been laid bare tonight in the speech from the Minister.  I listened to it in my office and now I have read it and I am horrified by its contents.  I would like to know who wrote it because clearly we are going to treat women and mothers very differently.  We have elevated the businesses, who I supported here for the last number of weeks.  Indeed I spent a number of hours today going through 141 pages of very complicated legislation, most of it in schedules.  We are going to guarantee that we will pay millions into a fund so we can take back billions with very little oversight from the D&aacute;il and very little chance to put in amendments or to understand the legislation, other than it is good for us because we will get lots of millions that we can give out to big businesses - not microenterprises, not even small businesses, but big businesses with some small businesses.  That is very complicated legislation and I have had great difficulty understanding it but the Minister has told us that simple legislation in relation to extending maternity leave is too complex and cannot be done.  Deputy Sherlock has already referred to this and he is perfectly right.  The speech is utterly contemptuous.</p> <p> Further on in the speech, the Minister acknowledges that it applies to a small number of people and the consequence of that is a small amount of money but it "would also impact on others, most obviously on employers, who are already struggling with the impact of Covid-19 on their workplaces", and so on.  This would add to their challenges.  I do not know if the Minister of State can stand over that, but it is utterly contemptuous of mothers and women and places very little value on children.</p> <p> The background to this motion is the debacle over childcare.  No matter what we read - the Parliamentary Budget Office, OECD reports, documents from the European Commission - they have all highlighted our failure to provide affordable childcare.  Like affordable houses, it will never happen unless the State makes a commitment to public childcare.  The State must be i l&aacute;r an aonaigh, right in the middle of providing services.  This point was made earlier by Deputy Boyd Barrett on how the public service is coming into its own now in order to save the other side.  It would be great if we looked at that in a positive way and provided public childcare, public health, public education and realised the value of it, rather than standing over a speech like this which is utterly contemptuous and utterly fails to deal with the problems the women have outlined, including the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI.  There is a statement here to the effect that the reopening of childcare has relieved many parents of the burden of childcare.  Childcare is not a burden.  It is our duty and a labour of love and we should have a Government that facilitates that.  Sometimes that care will be in cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities and sometimes it will be at home.  I have run out of time.  I would like to go on but I will not, in deference to my colleague.</p></speech>

It has to be restated that the Minister's statement here today is shocking.  I fully support the motion and it is right that it is brought forward in response to the NWCI and the very good campaign it has run.  Like my colleague, I pay tribute to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and the work she did in highlighting this issue during the interim period when there was no Government.  It is vitally important and is the least we could do.  A way should be found to make it happen and there should not be a need for a motion to be brought into the House tonight to make it work.</p>  <p>  I think the Minister's response to the motion is appalling.  I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear this.  The Minister of State, Deputy McConalogue, will probably sum up and I hope his contribution is better because this is appalling.  It is an insult to women and all citizens in the State to say that it is too complicated and difficult to help young mothers in this situation and too complicated to draft legislation that will provide for this.  We have sat through legislation here on every aspect of the Covid response that has been very complex and detailed, as has been mentioned by other speakers.  It has involved finetuning and giving money to businesses to ensure they survive but we are told by the Minister that this is too complicated to deal with.  It shows, unfortunately, an aspect this Government will have over the coming months and years, in that it will be looking after small business and the citizens can go to hell unless they work for or own a small business and then this Government will be happy to do whatever it can to make sure they will be okay.</p>  <p>  This motion seeks an extension to maternity leave to acknowledge the difficulties that women are having and have had in dealing with childcare needs through this Covid-19 crisis.  Covid-19 has shown that the State is very important.  The very people we are bending over backwards and aiming to bankrupt ourselves for to make sure they survive are businesses, both large and small, across the State.  These are the very same businesspeople who would be leading the charge and saying the State should opt out and not have any role in their business.  Who do they look for to bail them out as soon as things get rough?  They come back to the State and the State has to do it.  It shows the State is vital and has a huge role to play.</p>  <p>  That brings us back to the issue of childcare and the fact that childcare is not available for women that need it.  That is because of the model of childcare we have in the State, fostered by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and developed more than  20 years or so.  It is basically a private model.  We have many childcare workers with degrees working for minimum wage or less.  It is a unique model across Europe as can be seen from the document here from the Library and Research Service.  We need to move away from that model.  It needs to be outlined over the next couple of years how that will happen.  This Government is not going to do that.  The least it could do is give women some modicum of support at this time but, unfortunately, it will not do that either.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="22:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400057#LLL00300"><p>I support the counter-motion being put forward this evening.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on children and parents, with many families experiencing significant stress due to the lack of supports and childcare over the last period of time.  The restrictions imposed over recent months have had a particularly adverse effect on mothers and newborn babies.  The Government is extremely sympathetic to families who have had their lives upended.  We are committed to enabling parents to have extended time with their babies so they can access the supports they need and enjoy these precious early months as much as possible.</p>  <p>  Supports for families have been introduced in recent years through a range of legislation that has facilitated greater work-life balance for parents. Most recently, a new parents leave and benefits scheme was introduced which provides two weeks of leave and benefit for each parent.  Each new parent is entitled to two weeks of leave and benefit for a child born or adopted after 1 November 2019.  Fortuitously, the legislation envisages an expansion of these entitlements.  That is why we propose that we utilise this scheme rather than the Maternity Protection Acts 1994-2004, in order to provide extra supports to new parents during this time.</p>  <p>  New ground was broken in the Irish context in 2016, when statutory paternity leave and benefit was introduced.  Until that time, unlike most EU member states, we had no provision for paternity leave, which rendered us very much out of step with the changed and more active role that fathers in modern societies play in raising their children.  The Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 was an important piece of legislation.  It recognises that paternity leave promotes social benefits and a fairer sharing of family responsibilities, and has a positive impact on fatherhood.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>A decision to extend maternity leave would reinforce the outdated message that caring for babies is the preserve of mothers.  The Government's proposal to legislate for increased parents' leave will bring more benefits for babies and young children and promote a balance in parenting responsibilities.  In September 2019, parental leave was increased from 18 to 22 weeks.  This leave is important in accommodating parents who wish to spend more time with older children.  The qualifying age of the child was recently extended to 12 years.</p> <p> In regard to other supports for new mothers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government reacted swiftly to issues that emerged in connection with the temporary wage subsidy scheme for parents on maternity or adoptive leave.  The scheme was introduced under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to attempt to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic on the labour market through an exceptional period beginning on 26 March and scheduled to run for an initial period of 12 weeks.  An issue was raised that the application of the qualifying criteria did not provide for persons returning from maternity or adoptive leave who consequentially were not on the payroll during the relevant period.  On 3 June, the Government announced that the temporary wage subsidy scheme would accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave.  This includes individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February or were not paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees.  This accommodation will be provided for by way of an amendment to the Finance Bill 2020.  In the meantime, where applicable, Revenue will implement the provision from 26 March.</p> <p> The Government has provided other financial supports to families during the Covid-19 crisis.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has provided an income support in the form of the pandemic unemployment payment payable at &euro;350 per week.  If a parent has left work to care for a child because of school or childcare closures and the employer is no longer paying the person's wages, he or she may qualify for the pandemic unemployment payment.  Women who were due to return to their employment after maternity leave have been eligible for this payment from the date they were due to return if that employment is no longer available and they are not receiving any payment from their employer.  As of 8 June 2020, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection had issued payments valued at &euro;180 million to more than 500,000 people in respect of their application for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  Among the recipients were 22,000 people who have since informed the Department of their returning to work.  Of these, 5,700 are female.  As of 6 July, there were 893 people receiving a Covid-related illness benefit payment.  Since the beginning of June, 104 people have been medically certified as having coronavirus and 946 have been medically certified because they are self-isolating for medical reasons.</p> <p> Turning back to the motion and amendment before the House, we are all in agreement that new mothers need additional time with their newborn babies.  I want to be unequivocal about the new Government's approach to resolving the issues we have been discussing.  In opposing the Deputies' motion and putting forward an amendment, our objective is to achieve our goal in a speedier, more effective manner.  An extension of parents' leave will be easier to achieve than an extension of maternity leave because the parental leave scheme already provides for an increase in entitlements.  There will be greater benefits for children as they will enjoy additional time with their fathers as well as their mothers.  Finally, this is an opportunity to promote gender balance in regard to family responsibilities.  Pandemics make existing inequalities for women and girls worse across every sphere, from health to the economy, security and social protection.  The impacts of Covid-19 are exacerbated for females and, as a result, the progress made on gender balance is at risk of being rowed back.  We have an opportunity to continue to support gender equality even in the face of the current grave situation.  I ask Deputies for their support in taking that opportunity.  I join my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in commending the Government amendment to the House.</p></speech>

Having become the father of a baby boy nine months ago, I have experience of what it was like to have a newborn during lockdown.  Our baby got his four-months injections before lockdown and his six-months injections during it.  I hope that by the time he gets his 12-months injections the world will be a different and better place, although it is hard not to feel that we will still be facing a challenging time.</p><p>There have been good and bad elements to having a newborn in the time of Covid.  There were two of us working from home most of the time.  Arranging meetings and trying to avoid a clash of Zoom schedules and things like that while also looking after a school-age child and a newborn was no joke.  However, there is no doubt that there also were upsides.  For example, I got to spend a lot more time with the baby than I would have in normal circumstances. <i></i>I have had contact from many parents, particularly mothers, in regard to the issues raised in our motion.  The challenges facing a lot of mothers in this time have been enormous.  It is said that it takes a village to raise a child.  For many mothers, they did not have access to that village during the pandemic.  New mothers feel they did not truly have a maternity leave because there was no access to support.  Many were cut off from their child's grandparents, who may have been many miles away.  Our son did not see one set of grandparents for several weeks and the other set he did not see for several months.  There was no access to breastfeeding groups and reduced access to public health nurses.  If their partner was an essential worker, mothers may have felt nearly cut off from the world for a time.  The stress of trying to figure out what comes next is something that came up in many of the conversations I had with parents.  Childcare is so scarce that it may as well not exist.</p><p>I take this opportunity to highlight that parents whose maternity leave elapsed during this crisis have faced incredible challenges.  For those who had to return to work, there was no childcare for older children as schools were closed and no access to wider support networks.  Women who would otherwise have gone back to work could not do so.  For mothers working from home there was the juggling involved in what was, in effect, the requirement to combine full-time parenting with a job and, in some cases, homeschooling.  In many instances, parents were reliant on the goodwill of employers, some of whom showed compassion and understanding of how challenging the situation was for their employees.  In many cases, however, there was not that understanding on the part of employers.  We can multiply these difficulties across a large number of families.</p><p>I urge the Government to back this motion.  It is absolutely necessary that we extend maternity leave for the cohort of women referred to in the motion.  I ask the Government to go further than that and to ensure all women and families have access to childcare and other supports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400058#MMM00300"><p>I wish to speak in favour of this motion to extend maternity leave benefit and to represent the views of the many mothers throughout the country who have contacted me on this issue.  The Covid restrictions were difficult on everyone but mothers who gave birth just before or during the pandemic were particularly badly affected.  Gone were the normal support networks such as help from extended family, breastfeeding groups, baby massage groups and mother and toddler groups.  All of those outlets were prohibited.  Visits from the public health nurse were severely curtailed or reduced to telephone contact.  Many children have not had their developmental milestones adequately monitored.  Children with difficulties were not treated, as hospital appointments continued to be postponed.  Mothers who gave birth by caesarean section have not had follow-up medical appointments.  The number of new mothers reported to be suffering from postnatal depression has trebled and proper care is not being provided.  Mothers who have underlying health issues susceptible to Covid are even more isolated.  Children are not being socialised because, in many cases, they have been seeing only their parent or parents.  I heard from one couple who went through rigorous IVF treatment and then were unable to share the joy of their little miracle, their precious newborn, with their family.</p>  <p>  Many mothers who were due to return to work in the coming weeks are not in a position to do so as there is a serious lack of childcare places, especially for children under one year of age and, in some cases, children under two.  Many mothers are not in a position to take the 16 weeks of additional unpaid maternity leave and others are faced with the prospect of resigning from their workplace due to the lack of childcare.  A lot of work has gone into ensuring employment equality.  What is happening now flies in the face of everything that was achieved and has the potential to undermine all of it.  An extension to maternity leave will help to alleviate many of these issues but the childcare crisis must be addressed in tandem.  That crisis existed before Covid and is exacerbated as a result of it.  The State has a responsibility to provide adequate and affordable childcare.  If we hope to get out of the economic crisis resulting from the virus, we need to get as many people as possible back to work as soon as we can.</p>  <p>This cannot happen without adequate childcare.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, on bringing forward this motion and encourage all Members to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="22:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400059#NNN00200"><p>I find the Government's amendment deeply insulting and I know I will not be the only one to find it so.  I am glad the Minister read the entire amendment into the D&aacute;il record because one would need to read it more than once to believe it.  I will first comment on a number of statements made by the Minister in her speech.  She initially acknowledged the "strange and stressful few months" for new mothers and went on to acknowledge that it has been extremely challenging.  She said she thinks everyone in the House today can recognise this, but the Government clearly does not because it has proposed that three additional weeks of leave may be, possibly, brought in next year.  That will do nothing for mothers today whose maternity leave is ending next week and who have nobody to look after their children.  Where is such a mother supposed to put a six-month-old baby?  Who is going to look after it?  Grandparents cannot step in, while cr&egrave;ches are not taking babies under one year of age, and I have not heard anything from the Government on that matter.</p>  <p>  The Minister went on to note the difficulties around the legislation, which were also mentioned by numerous other Deputies.  That argument was also made when Sinn F&eacute;in repeatedly proposed a rent freeze, yet it could be brought in overnight through emergency legislation when Covid hit.  Legislation is not an excuse.  The Minister also mentioned the legal difficulties in identifying the relevant cohort to which the amendment would apply.  We have done that for her.  The cohort is in the motion.  The Minister referred to difficulties in managing complex childcare.  Again, the childcare is not there, though that is referenced in the amendment as well.  Childcare is not available.  That is the major problem, and again the Government's amendment does not address that or deal with it.</p>  <p>  The Minister finished by saying she was sure Deputies would agree the Government's amendment was a more desirable outcome.  Deputies do not think that, nor do I believe the National Women's Council of Ireland or the women who formed the #ExtendMaternityLeave2020 campaign group will either.  Yesterday, it was widely reported that the proposed three weeks of additional leave would be included as part of the budget and would come in as part of that.  It now turns out that it is not even committed to in the Government amendment.  In fact, there is not a single commitment anywhere in the Government amendment.  Three Ministers, three Departments and countless officials have been looking at this issue for a number of weeks now and this is all the Government has come up with.  It says it will propose, examine and look at the budget, which is three months away, and even then there are no commitments for these mothers.</p>  <p>  It has now been nearly five weeks since the petition of more than 25,000 signatures was presented to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  That petition is now quickly approaching 30,000 signatures.  A commitment was made there and then that the proposal would be given careful consideration.  Many took that as good news and an indication that mothers would be heard.  However, when one looks at what the Government has brought forward tonight, it is as if the Government was looking at something completely different during those five weeks.  There will be huge disappointment and increased worry and anxiety for mothers watching this debate and listening to what the Government is suggesting.  Women who were on maternity leave during Covid-19 and members of the campaign group repeatedly emailed every single Deputy in this Chamber.  They shared their personal stories, opened up about the difficulties they faced, and after waiting for a decision from this Government, this pathetic excuse for an amendment is all it can offer.  That is simply not good enough and I again ask the Government to look at the speech that was made here tonight, to look at the amendment that has been brought forward and to reconsider its position.</p></speech>

I raise the issue of North Wicklow Educate Together secondary school in Bray.  I am not sure whether the Minister is familiar with this school but she will become very familiar with it.  It has been let down over recent years in finding permanent accommodation and has been bounced from temporary accommodation to temporary accommodation.  Unfortunately, it is in the middle of one of those bounces.  It has packed up where it was based in the previous academic year and has all its things in storage.  It was planned that it would move into a disused primary school in Bray, but it has yet to receive the keys to that school.  It had been promised a complete refurbishment of the school, but that has not occurred and so the school wants to know what is happening.  It needs to be able to find accommodation for its 240 students for September.  It needs to be able to plan.  There are many children with additional needs in the school who need to be planned for.  I ask the Minister to give a progress update and to make sure the school gets the care and support it requires.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="22:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400059#NNN00800"><p>Since the North Wicklow Educate Together school in Bray opened in August 2016, it has been treated absolutely appallingly by the Department.  It was opened in 2016 in a temporary premises in the old Presentation College on Putland Road in Bray.  At the time, the Department was aware of a 2015 High Court agreement between the former owner of the site and the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board that vacation of the premises needed to take place by April 2019.  Last year, right up until the 12th hour, the school did not know where it was going to be located for the 2019-20 school year.  At the last moment, the Department announced a 12-month extension to that lease, which would run out on 30 June just gone.  In January of this year, the Department announced that the school would move temporarily to another old school, the former Ravenswell primary school building in Bray, in September of this year.  There is now major concern because, with less than seven weeks to go until the school is due to reopen in that building, a legal difficulty appears to have arisen between the State solicitor and solicitors representing the owners of that site and a licence has not been signed.  Significant refurbishment works are due to take place within the premises, which cannot happen until that licence is signed.  This school has been treated appallingly by the Department and it is shameful that two Deputies have to come in to the Chamber to try to get answers from the Department and the Minister as to what is going to happen come September.</p>  <p>  I have two specific questions for the Minister.  First, when will the licence be signed between the two parties to ensure the significant refurbishment works can take place?  Second, have tenders been signed to allow that work to take place and are contractors in place in order that it can be done immediately?</p></speech>

It provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position regarding the accommodation needs of the North Wicklow Educate Together secondary school for this September.  As the Deputies may be aware, the school was established in 2016 and has been accommodated since then, as the Deputies said, in a leased property on the Putland Road in Bray.</p>  <p>  The school opened with an enrolment of 36 pupils and numbers are growing incrementally, with an enrolment of 226 pupils in the 2019 to 2020 school year.  I understand that the school expects an enrolment of 280 pupils for the 2020 to 2021 school year.  My Department held a lease on the Putland Road property until 30 June last and has secured an extension to this lease until 31 October 2020.  The school's patron is aware of this extension.</p>  <p>  The property is not available for long-term lease and the school requires alternative accommodation to facilitate its growth.  In this regard, the Department has secured the agreement of the Religious Sisters of Charity to use the former St. Philomena's primary school, Ravenswell, Bray to accommodate North Wicklow Educate Together secondary school.  The legal arrangements associated with the lease are being finalised by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the owner's legal representative, and that process is expected to be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  It is my Department's intention to have refurbishment works carried out in the building in advance of the school's occupation.  In preparation for these works, various surveys were required to develop the scope of the work to be undertaken.  This work was interrupted arising from Covid-19 and resumed when the restrictions were lifted.  A licence agreement between my Department and the Religious Sisters of Charity is required to admit the building contractor on site to undertake the refurbishment works.  The licence is being finalised by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the congregation's legal representative.  This process is also expected to be completed shortly.  My Department is anxious to ensure that the refurbishment works can be initiated in the building as soon as possible thereafter and will continue to keep the patron updated on progress.</p>  <p>  My Department's planning and building unit is working closely with the school authorities and patrons, including Educate Together, to ensure that contingency arrangements are in place where necessary if a school building project is not completed in time for the start of a new school year as a result of delays caused by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I wish to clarify for the Deputies that my Department is continuing to prioritise this matter and will be liaising with the school's patron when a further update is available.  I again thank the Deputies for giving me an opportunity to outline the position to the House and I assure them that the Department is concerned to ensure that the school's accommodation needs will most certainly be provided for.</p></speech>

It is incredibly disappointing for this school.  From reading this reply, it would appear that it is expected that the school will take everything that has been packed up and is in storage in a different county, bring it back into the school that has already been deemed inappropriate, and that the school will be put in there for a month or two while this work happens, before the school is actually placed back in its new temporary accommodation.</p>  <p>  This will be a huge upset for the school and for the children.  As the Minister knows, children with special needs and additional needs must have routine and be able to plan.  These children will now be forced back into a very uncertain period.  It is unacceptable that this school will not have Ravenswell available to it in September.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister expedite this work?  Much of the work that has not happened, such as the licence, is something that could have happened administratively.  It did not need to be postponed because of Covid-19.  It is not like work on the construction site.  I am really disappointed, therefore, that this has not happened and that the school is not getting ready to move into its new accommodation.  Perhaps it might be possible to open a channel of discussion with the school itself, because it is completely unaware of this situation.  The school will be really disappointed and frustrated to hear this news.</p></speech>

The school is completely in the dark as to what is going on.  All the equipment from the building which the school is legally obliged to vacate has been packed up and is in storage.  Now the Minister is talking about potential contingency plans being put in place if the work is not carried out.  Perhaps somebody might want to speak to school and start talking to it directly about what plans may have to be put in place, because it is completely in the dark.  The school is making plans to move into the building at Ravenswell, which it was informed it would be moving into in September.</p>  <p>  I know Covid-19 has caused much disruption in this State, as it has across the world.  I do not see how it could impact, however, on two legal entities signing a piece of paper, a licence, to ensure that the work could proceed.  I simply do not buy that explanation.  The handling of this situation by the Department has been absolutely shameful.  Someone needs to pick up the phone to the school immediately, have a conversation and start putting in place contingency plans, if those plans need to be put in place.  Less than seven weeks remain now until that school is due to open its doors to first years on 28 August.  Someone needs to pick up a phone and start talking.  It is absolutely shameful the way the school has been treated since 2016.</p></speech>

I have not had a chance to do so formally and I wish her the very best of luck with the journey ahead.  People may be aware that we were in the same year in college at NUI Galway, so I am very proud of her accession to such a high position.  Well done to the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  I will speak briefly to keep the Mallow relief road on the political agenda.  The M20 is very much on the political agenda regarding the roll-out of that motorway between Cork and Limerick.  As part of that, however, what the people of Mallow need and require now is an assurance regarding the relief road for the town.  The Minister of State will tell us that the design preparation is in play and that consultants have been appointed since November 2019.  We acknowledge that and there is a process to be gone through in that regard.  JB Barry Transportation has been approved as technical advisers and the study area has been identified.</p>  <p>  This project is part of the national development plan.  There is a strategic outcome which is relevant to this project and it comes under enhanced regional accessibility.  I am seeking assurances now from the Government that this project will not slip down the political agenda and that moneys will be put behind this project after the consultation process is over so that the project can be delivered.</p>  <p>  It is an essential project in giving relief for the N72 and N73.  The N73 is in a deplorable state.  It is the Mallow to Mitchelstown road and it needs serious investment regarding realignment.  The town of Mallow for many years now, however, has been asking for moneys to be made available for a relief road.  It is important that dovetails with any project concerning the M20 in a way that ensures a seamless joining of the two projects to give that relief.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State and the Government to give an assurance that this project will not slip down the political agenda. As I have said, the Minister of State will probably tell me that the consultants have been appointed.  I fully acknowledge that and we appreciate that design preparation is under way.  We have been there before and route corridors have been assigned before.</p> <p>That is why we want to remain vigilant about ensuring that the town of Mallow is not left behind in any capital investment for roads infrastructure.  It is a key reference town in the province of Munster and a key point of connectivity between Kerry and Dublin as well.  I appeal to the Minister of State to keep that in mind.</p></speech>

Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the national roads programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan.  In that context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme.  Within the timeframe given in the lead-up to the debate this evening, the following information is the most up to-date information available to me on Tll's delivery of this project.</p>  <p>  Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan has been developed by Government to underpin the successful implementation of the new national planning framework.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for Tll's national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  As set out in the programme for Government, the Government will be carrying out a review of the national development plan later this year, taking account of the priorities of Government set out in the programme.</p>  <p>  The proposed N72-N73 Mallow relief road project is included among a number of major national road schemes that were identified in the national development plan for planning, design and construction.  This scheme consists of a single or dual carriageway bypass of the town of Mallow.  The scheme length would be of the order of 4.5 km to 7 km.  The pre-appraisal plan for the Mallow relief road was approved by the economic unit of the Department.  Following this, the procurement process for the appointment of technical advisors to progress the first four stages of TII&rsquo;s project management guidelines was completed.  Early planning, design and appraisal work for the project has commenced.  Cork County Council and its advisors are currently assessing all route options available given the constraints.</p>  <p>  The relief road project would provide numerous benefits.  It would bypass Mallow, reducing congestion and improving the environment of the town.  It would cater for strategic traffic.  It would improve access to and from Mallow.  It would bring economic improvements for the Munster region.  It would provide cycle and walking facilities for non-motorised users.</p>  <p>  The scheme is at an early stage of development and, therefore, it is not possible at this time to indicate a likely timeframe for construction of the project.  The timeframe for delivery of any major or minor works or projects that require statutory approval, whether for environmental impact assessment or compulsory purchase orders or both, is between eight and 13 years.  As this project is in the early stages of planning it is not yet possible to provide an accurate estimate of the total cost.  The estimated cost cannot be finalised until the project reaches the business case stage of the process.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to contact TII directly for more detailed information on the agency's implementation of the national road network, including the N72-N73 Mallow relief road.</p></speech>

Again, I wish to reiterate the point that while there are statutory processes to be gone through in respect of Transport Infrastructure Ireland's responsibilities in that regard, it is important to state that there is considerable political capital in delivery of roads.  That political capital comes from the fact that Government decisions are made in respect of infrastructural projects like roads throughout the country.  I am again calling on the Government, once the consultation period has ended, to move to the next stage so that moneys can be assigned to carry out this project.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that there will be a review of the national development plan.  I acknowledge that but I am hopeful and optimistic that this Government will recognise the relief road from Mallow as being a key project given Mallow's location and centrality in the province of Munster.</p>  <p>  We are talking about regional development and inward investment.  We are talking about opening up the south-western region in the context of a keynote project like the M20 Cork to Limerick road.  If we go on an east to west trajectory then it is vital that the town of Mallow does not get left behind in that analysis.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the response of the Minister of State, which I appreciate, and the fact that there are environmental impact assessment reports and compulsory purchase orders to be gone through, I am asking for the Minister of State to give this her utmost priority.</p></speech>

This is also subject to the public spending code guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals.  The N72 and N73 Mallow relief road has been identified in the national development plan.  Therefore, TII is working to progress the scheme through planning, design and construction.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined, the project is at an early stage in this process.  The programme for Government commits to bringing forward the planned view of the national development plan from 2022 and to use the review to set out an updated national development plan for the period to 2031.  The review of the NDP will be aligned with the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040.  Work is under way within the Department to contribute to this planned review and the programme for Government also states that the process of reviewing the NDP and updating the national planning framework will not frustrate or delay any existing projects.</p>  <p>  TII remains committed to progressing the N72-N73 Mallow relief road and, as previously stated, this is subject to the public spending code guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals.</p></speech>

Any decision of the European Court of Justice that finds against the State is weighty and significant but this is especially so in the context of the work that the Marine Casualty Investigation Board does.  It has issued over recent years almost 300 reports on marine incidents and casualties since its establishment.  Throughout the history of the State, and especially in recent years, there have been so many significant events and tragedies and families left grieving because of significant instances and tragedies.  It is vital that the incidents are properly investigated and that the people who are affected, bereaved and injured have confidence in the system.</p>  <p>  It has been found by the European Court of Justice that Ireland is in breach of Article 8(1) of directive 2009/18/EC.  The fundamental point is quite straightforward.  The court decided that the Marine Casualty Investigation Board is not independent because two of the five on the board are from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It seems obvious.  Frankly, it is difficult to understand why the case was fought by the State given that many commentators were of the view that it was bound to fail.  Will the Minister set out how much this case cost?</p>  <p>  I have not been keeping track of time.</p></speech>

It is an important and significant judgment and requires a full response from the Department and the State.  I would question the approach taken by the Government in contesting the case.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire outlined, it is not as if this had not been flagged.  The judgment has important implications for the recommendations, findings and report of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  That needs to be fully investigated.  Above all, we need a system of governance and practice in the Marine Casualty Investigation Board that is beyond reproach.</p></speech>

It is about accountability and responsibility.  It beggars belief that this judgment has come back from the European Union.  It was not too long ago that we raised other marine safety issues relating to lifeboat gear, the Coast Guard and so on in the House.  It is imperative that the matter is investigated.  We have to get clarity in respect of what actually happened.  The previous two speakers indicated that this has serious implications, but it has also had an impact on families.  I was almost ten years of age when the Whiddy Island disaster happened, but I still remember it.  I urge the Minister of State to look into this judgment.  I am curious to hear her response.  I will stick to the time allowed and reply to the Minister of State afterwards.</p></speech>

The Marine Casualty Investigation Board was established as an independent body in 2002 under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 to investigate marine casualties and publish reports of such investigations involving Irish-registered vessels worldwide and other vessels in Irish territorial waters and inland waterways.  Section 8 of the Act provides that the board shall be independent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the performance of its functions and in general shall be independent of any other person or body whose interests could conflict with the functions of the board.  Section 9 sets out the composition of the five-person board, which consists of three persons appointed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the chief surveyor of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Secretary General of the Department or his or her nominee.</p>  <p>  Under current arrangements, the three ministerial appointments are made following an open application process involving the Public Appointments Service, PAS, State boards recruitment system.  The 2000 Act set out a specific legislative framework for the operation of the board and also addressed such issues as tenure of office, removal from office, disclosure of interests, the reporting of marine casualties and investigations.  All investigations of marine casualties are carried out by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board's panel of external investigators.  The panel reflects the broad-based marine competence and experience which is of relevance in undertaking independent investigations.</p>  <p>  Directive 2009/18/EC of 23 April 2009 establishes the fundamental principles governing the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector.  The directive applies to a small subset of the marine casualties that come under the remit of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, and involves an average of fewer than three casualties in any given year.  Article 8.1 of the directive provides that an investigation of body shall be independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to it.  </p>  <p>  In 2011, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board was designated as the investigative body in the State for the purposes of Article 8 of the directive.  The EU Commission expressed concern at the independence of the board in the context of the independence requirements of Article 8.1, with particular regard to the membership of the chief surveyor of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the nominee of the Secretary General of the Department of the board.</p>  <p>  The case was lodged with the Court of Justice of the European Union in March 2019.  On 9 July 2020, the court delivered its judgment, declaring that by failing to provide for an investigative body which is independent in its organisation and decision-making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to that investigative body, Ireland has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 8.1 of the directive.  The main issue of concern is the presence of two departmental officials on the board who were seen as persons whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to the board.  There is no finding of impartiality on the part of the board, but the court has noted that a finding that the investigative body failed to act impartially in specific cases is not necessary to establish an infringement.  My Department is examining the judgment and has sought urgent legal advice on the possible next steps, which may involve amending legislation to provide a basis for early engagement with the EU Commission and to ensure that the court's findings and the concerns of the Commission are addressed.</p>  <p>  At this early stage, I am not in a position to indicate definitively what our next course of action will be.  However, I can assure Deputies that every effort will be made to progress matters as quickly as possible in order to enhance the organisational independence of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board in carrying out its important role in investigating marine casualties, establishing the cause or causes of those casualties and making safety recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues with the response from the Minister of State.  There is a context to this.  The Government and senior Ministers received an email in recent days from a maritime lawyer, Mr. Michael Kingston, who is the son of one of the victims of the Whiddy Island disaster.  He outlined in that email his concerns that there has been a long track record in terms of a failure to tackle the issue of independence at the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  He is not alone in that regard.  Many voices have raised the same concern.</p>  <p>  To be honest, it is extraordinary that the case was defended.  The issue was that there was a clear need for independence.  Two of the five members of the board came from one Department.  It is very difficult to see how anyone could have argued that was independent.  I appreciate what the Minister of State said about impartiality, but it seems very apparent that the board was not independent.  There are issues with that and there is a need for independence, which is required in the EU legislation.</p>  <p>  It is remarkable that this judgment has not received more attention.  The European Court of Justice has found that in the context of maritime safety, this State is in breach of EU legislation.  It matters because the Department is responsible for safety on the water and for the legislation and relevant codes of practice.  Of course it is important that recommendations are made following an incident or tragedy by a body which is adequately independent.  That issue has been raised for several years now.  I raised the issue last year, but many others have raised it for many years. </p>  <p>  There is a strong view that the board was not adequately independent and that was problematic.  How much has this case cost?  The Minister of State referred to enhancing the organisational independence of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  I hope that happens.  Perhaps it needs to be entirely reconstituted.  There may be a need to re-examine some of the cases it has dealt with or, at the very least, its approach in recent years.  The State has incurred costs and it needs to accept that it is in the wrong and that there is a need for a fully independent body.  We need to examine what happened in the past and how we got to the situation.</p></speech>

The Department is examining the judgment and has sought legal advice on this in terms of the next steps we will need to take to address the concerns of the Commission.  Any proposed new policy approach will be the subject of a future submission for the consideration of the Cabinet.  The Deputies can be assured that every effort is being made to progress matters as quickly as possible and to enhance the organisational independence of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister of State for being present for this debate.</p> <p>I begin by congratulating him on his recent appointment as Minister of State.  It is a massive honour for any Deputy to be appointed, both for himself and his family and for his supporters.  I wish him the very best of good fortune in the time ahead.  I have no doubt he will do an excellent job.</p> <p> I raise this issue off the back of an informative meeting with members of the Chapter 23 Kerry and West Limerick Credit Union movement in Kerry last week and also off the back of the report by the Irish League of Credit Unions last Friday, 10 July entitled The Movement.  It is an insightful and interesting report that makes for interesting reading and also makes reasonable recommendations.  I ask the Minister, if he has not already seen that report, please to prioritise and have a look at it.  It is very clear and makes eight recommendations, none of which is outlandish.  They are all reasonable and by implementing those recommendations we would have stronger communities and a better country overall.</p> <p> In the context of this discussion, the impact of the credit union movement in Ireland over the last six decades cannot be overstated.  When one hears people of the magnitude of John Hume saying his involvement in the credit union movement was one of the things he was most proud of, and when he referred to it as having done so much good for all the people of Ireland, North and South, it really puts into context where the credit union stands in terms of its importance in our communities.  It is critically important that it is supported at its time of need.</p> <p> Among the number of things it has pointed out is that it needs support in terms of first putting together the new credit union Act to create a legislative basis for credit unions to become a stronger community banking force.  That is something the new Government needs to look at and I am hopeful it can be achieved.</p> <p> The reduction in capital reserve requirements from 12% to 8% would give credit unions some breathing space, as they say themselves, and also give them a better opportunity to expand their mortgage and business lending.  That would be really important.</p> <p> They are also seeking to unlock the potential for credit union funds to support construction of social housing through a State-regulated investment vehicle for which they have &euro;900 million, almost &euro;1 billion, available.  That money would be put to good use if that measure could be considered and acted upon.</p> <p> They also want to make credit union finance available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to fund the proposed national retrofitting plan.  We know almost 500,000 homes are planned for retrofitting by 2030 under that plan.  The credit unions want to assist and put their money to good use in that regard as well.</p> <p> One of the other main points is the suspension of regulatory levies from the Central Bank for 12 months and a review of all levies.  To put into context what some credit unions are experiencing with regard to regulatory levies over the last number of years, one of my own local credit unions, Killarney Credit Union, in the year ending September 2014 paid just over &euro;66,000 in regulatory levies.  In the year ending September 2019 that figure had risen to &euro;243,000.  That is a huge hit for any credit union to take when one considers the great work they do and that credit unions were not to blame for the huge financial mess we have seen in the past.  That is salt in the wounds of the credit unions and needs to be looked at.  I urge the Minister of State please to consider the points raised and do his best to assist the credit unions in their time of need.</p></speech>

I commend him on his time as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I remember him in one of my own local schools.  He really lived up to the title around promoting physical exercise and has left a strong legacy in that Department.  I think him for his time and acknowledge his role there in the last number of years.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohue, wishes to inform the Deputy that both he and his officials have engaged extensively with the credit union representative bodies in recent months.  Both I and the Minister for Finance are hoping to meet with the credit union representative bodies again next week.  As the Deputy will be aware, one of my specific responsibilities as Minister of State relates to the credit union movement and it will bring an additional focus to this area.  We must have significant and extensive engagement in the coming weeks so that we take the recommendations of reports the Deputy has referenced, and others, and expand the role of the credit unions across our communities.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the key role credit unions play in the delivery of financial services in local communities, the need for which is heightened at this time.  Credit unions account for approximately one third of the consumer credit market and are well positioned to provide credit to support the recovery.  However, it is recognised that credit unions have challenges, with a low and falling return on assets arising from the low sector loan-to-asset ratio whereby only 28 per cent of assets are lent out, from low-negative interest rates on over &euro;12 billion of investments, and a high cost to income ratio.</p>  <p>  Deputy Griffin mention as well meeting the Kerry and West Limerick Credit Union movement.  I am happy to engage directly with the credit union movement in the Deputy's own area over the period.  It is important not only to meet the national bodies but actually to engage with the local ones.  I am stating at the outset that I am happy to meet with people in the Deputy's own area on this.</p>  <p>  The economic outlook arising by virtue of Covid-19, including reduced demand for new lending and rising household savings over the past few months, has exacerbated the challenges the sector was already facing.  As a result, it was agreed that the credit union advisory committee would report to the Minister for Finance on challenges and opportunities for the sector, incorporating implications of Covid-19 and any relevant recommendations.  This report is actually complete and will be submitted to me and the Minister for Finance shortly.  I am hopeful we can take the challenges in the current sector and try to get new opportunities in the context of the stimulus and investment we will see in our economy in the coming period.  The credit union movement will have a strong role to play in that.</p>  <p>  There are several commitments in the programme for Government which relate to credit unions, including a review of the policy framework, which will be expanded in the coming weeks and months as the new Government beds down, taking into account work already completed such as the credit union advisory committee report noted earlier.  We will also take into consideration the views of key stakeholders.  Credit unions have a role to play themselves.  Credit unions have the ability to improve their loan-to-asset ratio, including through additional consumer lending, mortgage and SME lending, either individually or through collaborative efforts.</p>  <p>  Following a public consultation, the Central Bank issued revised lending regulations for credit unions which came into effect this year.  Under these regulations, the sector has capacity to lend an additional &euro;1.1 billion for mortgage and SME lending collectively on top of approximately &euro;300 million already lent at the end of 2019.  Further additional lending capacity could be available to credit unions which can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government's Covid-19 supports, a revised credit guarantee scheme, CGS, was announced this morning.  This scheme is a Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation scheme, operated by the SBCI, and is already available for banks, non-banks and, it is important to note, credit unions to participate in, subject to certain conditions.  Officials are available to discuss the CGS with banks, non-banks and credit unions.  In this regard I have been advised that some credit union stakeholders have held exploratory discussions with the SBCI in recent months.  We will also work with credit unions to support the programme for Government with regard to retrofitting.  I know from my previous role as climate action spokesperson that they will play an important role to embed their community pillar, as the Deputy has referenced, on that ethos with the entire transition we will see.  That is a positive future for the credit unions.  I will address some of the other questions the Deputy has in my other contribution.</p></speech>

From the outset I should have declared, a Chathaoirligh, that I previously, many years ago, was a member on a board of a local credit union, lest there be any accusations of conflicts of interest or anything, but that was long before being in public office.  That experience gave me great insight into the work credit unions do to improve their own situations and to progress in life.  I am concerned at the moment that credit unions find themselves in a perfect storm.  The Minister of State's help, and the support of the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole, is critical now and perhaps has never been as critical in the history of the credit union movement in Ireland.  I welcome very much the Minister of State's commitments to engage further with the credit unions and to have an open-door policy.  He will have an open door to some of the best people in the country, some of the real local heroes and unsung heroes of our communities, both at local and national level, as far as the Irish League of Credit Unions is concerned.  It is important that the points they put forward are facilitated, where possible.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>It is not always possible to do everything, but as I referred to earlier, there is nothing outlandish in what the credit unions are looking for here.  They are looking for a fair crack of the whip but they are trying to fight with both hands, not just one hand, tied behind their backs.  That is terribly sad when one considers the enormously positive impact that the credit union movement has had throughout Ireland over the past six decades.</p> <p> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.  I acknowledge the inclusion of numerous references to the credit union movement in the programme for Government.  The credit unions have a big role to play in numerous aspects of life in the time ahead, but they need a better environment in which to carry out their business and continue their excellent work into the future.  I hope Deputy Chambers will take a hands-on approach in making this one of his key issues as a Minister of State in the Department of Finance so that his work will benefit everybody in the country.</p></speech>

As the Deputy mentioned, the Government recognises in the programme for Government the role that credit unions play in society as a volunteer co-operative financial institution.  The economic outlook, including reduced demand for new lending, rising household savings and continued low return on investments, has exacerbated the challenges the Deputy referenced that existed before Covid-19 and the perfect storm that we need to turn away from.</p>  <p>  We committed in the programme for Government to a review of the policy framework.  The policy review will take into account work already completed, such as the Credit Union Advisory Committee report which I expect to receive shortly.  We will also take into consideration the report published last week by one of the representative bodies, and other views of stakeholders in the sector.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the current policy framework for credit unions was introduced from 2012 to 2016 and was based on the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  The implementation of these recommendations was the subject of a review by the Credit Union Advisory Committee in 2016.  Both I, the Minister for Finance and officials will continue to engage constructively to assist credit unions in delivering new services to their members, including other Government initiatives such as the credit guarantee scheme and initiatives in retrofitting.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that there is no legislative or regulatory barrier to the involvement of the credit union sector in the credit guarantee scheme, for example.  I encourage credit unions which can involve themselves in that to do so because it will allow them to lend into that structure which will help their balance sheet, which the Deputy referenced.  Similarly, there is no regulatory restriction hindering credit unions investing in a National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, auction or purchasing bonds in the secondary market.  However, there is an overarching difficulty in the European context with the way the ECB has flooded the liquidity markets.  That has an impact on credit unions and other financial institutions in terms of their balance sheet.</p>  <p>  We must support credit unions to increase their lending capacity into communities which will help their balance sheet, and we must support, as I do, their ongoing expansion of services.  With the input of Deputy Griffin and others, it is to be hoped we can have a more positive pathway for the sector.  That is what we are ambitious about.</p></speech>
