    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400003#A00200"><p>I have been reluctant to raise the matter of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on Leaders' Questions before today.  I absolutely accept that everybody makes mistakes, that people learn from those mistakes and that they move on.  We wanted to give the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine every opportunity to address all of the matters concerned, to draw a line under them and to move on at a time of huge health and economic challenges, not least for the farming community.  Last week, the Minister had the opportunity to do just that by putting all of the facts on the record of the D&aacute;il in relation to his drink-driving incident but, unfortunately, he has failed to do that.  </p><p>We now have an unprecedented situation where a Minister is disputing the Garda PULSE record of a drink-driving offence he was involved in and looking to have that record changed.  Last week in his personal statement, the Minister stated he was &quot;conscious that a constant drip feed of new information can be damaging and destabilising&quot;.  He said it was for that reason he had conducted a full examination of all records that he could obtain.  Yet here we are a week later and the drip feed of new information continues.</p><p>On 4 July, according to <i>The Sunday Times</i>, contact was made with the Minister regarding the Garda record from 18 September 2016, stating that he sought to evade a Garda checkpoint on the evening of the drink-driving offence.  <i>The Irish Times</i>today quotes sources saying the Taoiseach was made aware of these records at the time of this media query, that is, the weekend before last.  Can the Taoiseach confirm when he was made aware of the Garda record of the Minister's attempt to evade a Garda checkpoint?  Was he aware of this before the Minister made his statement to the D&aacute;il?  Did the Minister discuss with the Taoiseach or seek advice from the Taoiseach regarding his decision to seek to amend the record relating to his 2016 drink-driving conviction?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister's statement to the D&aacute;il was incomplete, as it made no mention of this Garda record?  When did the Taoiseach inform his coalition partners about all of this?  Has he challenged the Minister on his incomplete statement?  Does he accept that a Minister challenging the accuracy or, indeed, the truthfulness of a Garda PULSE record is a very serious matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400003#A00300"><p>As the Deputy said, the Minister came into the D&aacute;il and publicly admitted that he was convicted of a drink-driving offence four years ago, that he was penalised for that offence and that justice was meted out in accordance with the charge and with the offence that he committed.  He adamantly denies any suggestion or implication that he sought to evade any checkpoint.  That is his very strong position.  He is very concerned that data related to his personal files have found their way to others and he feels that is a very serious issue.</p> <p>Irrespective of what side of the House we come from and irrespective of the matter at hand, this is an issue that will have to be dealt with at some stage.  I am aware that the Garda Commissioner has referred the issue to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and it is one we cannot ignore.  I am not apportioning blame anywhere in this, because I do not know how that material left the PULSE file and ended up with various media outlets or others.  I do not know how that process happened.</p> <p> I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the weekend before last and he adamantly denied any suggestion or implication that he evaded or attempted or avoid a checkpoint.  At this stage, someone was saying that I was told about this.  I believe it was a newspaper which said it gave information to my chief of staff, but I cannot work on the basis of media sources.  I cannot verify anything without seeing the document myself.  I had a lengthy conversation last evening with the Minister.  Early this morning, with the Minister's permission, I saw the actual document.</p> <p> The Minister has made it very clear to me that he wants to pursue both issues through the mechanisms that are available to him to pursue them.  First, under the data protection process and by way of the Data Protection Commission, he is entitled to seek a correction of that particular record insofar as he believes that it does not accurately convey what transpired or that implications can be taken from it which may not necessarily be the case.  He is pursuing that.  Second, he feels the entire issue has become public because of what he sees as illegal procurement of the information.  We now know that this aspect is being investigated.  The Minister feels his rights have been transgressed and undermined in that regard and he believes he is entitled to due process in respect of both issues.  He has pointed out to me that when it was first put to him - I think it was by a reporter or member of the media - he was very taken aback by the suggestion that he had turned away from a checkpoint.  He was very adamant about that to me.  He said there was no issue made of it at the time, there was no reference to it at the time and he wants to seek to correct that aspect of it.  In that context, he was clear to me that he wants to pursue his legal rights and entitlements in that respect.</p> <p> I have kept both my colleagues in government, namely, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan, fully up to date in regard to my conversations with the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and in respect of the fact that I have seen the Garda file.  I am not at liberty to disclose the contents of that file because it is not my property and it was shared with me in that context.  That is the up-to-date position on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400004#B00200"><p>It is becoming clear that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, will have to come before the House and take questions on all of these issues.  However, for the purposes of today's discussion, I am more concerned with what the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, knew.  He has confirmed that he did, in fact, know about the Garda PULSE record and that there was an allegation that the Minister had sought to evade a Garda checkpoint.  He has confirmed that he knew that information as or before the Minister was making his statement.  I find it extraordinary that the Taoiseach would stand over a Minister who has made an incomplete statement to the D&aacute;il on a matter of this importance.  Were the Taoiseach's coalition partners, the leaders of Fine Gael and the Green Party, aware of the PULSE record and the allegation that the Minister had evaded a Garda checkpoint at the time the Minister, Deputy Cowen, made his statement?  The Taoiseach said he has had a conversation with the Minister, but the Taoiseach did not indicate that he challenged the Minister on the fact that his statement was incomplete.</p> <p>I accept the Minister's point on data protection.  That matter should be investigated by the appropriate authorities but it is not the net point here.  The net point is that a Minister is now contradicting a Garda record.  He came before the House to make what was to be a complete, no-holds-barred statement on all the material matters and did not state that this Garda PULSE record existed and that an allegation had been made that he had sought to evade a Garda checkpoint.  That is absolutely extraordinary.  It is even more extraordinary that the Taoiseach, as the Head of Government, would accept that.  Do the Taoiseach's coalition partners similarly accept that the Minister was right to come before the House and not give us all the information?  Do they also accept that he is right to challenge the Garda PULSE record?  It is extraordinary that a Minister is now openly contradicting the PULSE records.  This is not just about Deputy Cowen, because we all must rely on the truthfulness and accuracy of PULSE records.  The Minister has brought that accuracy into question but he has also failed to give a full account of events on that night.  The Taoiseach was aware that there was another twist in the tale and yet it seems he has not challenged the Minister on it.  Does he believe in full and frank statements to this House, or does he not?</p></speech>

I was not aware of the PULSE record and did not see it.  I cannot work on the basis of a journalist saying that he or she has a source or paper that shows X.  I saw the document myself this morning and having seen it, I can say that it is not quite as it has been portrayed.  Nonetheless, the document is there.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Cowen, was unaware of the record and exactly what it said until he got possession of it.  One can only comment on a record when one sees it.  For the last four years, he was unaware of any suggestion that this would be on the record.  That is his point of view.  I would not pre-emptively judge something until I saw the record for myself, and I did early this morning.  The Minister contacted the Garda during the week to get possession of the record because he did not have it.  Others had it before he did and that is also an issue for any individual in such a situation.  As regards his contribution to the House, he did not yet have the document and did not want to incriminate himself in relation to it.  All I can convey to the Deputy is that he has very serious concerns about how the whole thing has developed and how his own personal information was procured or disseminated from the PULSE record.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400005#C01500"><p>Last week, the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response met representatives from the Irish Primary Principals' Network and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals with regard to education provision in September.  I have been contacted by a large number of special needs assistants, SNAs, who have expressed their deep disappointment and despair that they were excluded from this session.  As the Taoiseach knows, SNAs have the closest contact with pupils in schools.  They effectively look after the most vulnerable students in schools and to exclude them from this session was wrong and deeply hurtful to the thousands of SNAs around the country.  They have asked that their opinions be taken into account with regard to the reopening of schools in September.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that he will work with the Minister for Education and Skills and ensure the views and opinions of SNAs will be taken into account when decisions are taken on reopening schools in September?</p> <p> Last weekend, more than 60 motorhomes and caravans were located in the village of Carlingford.  This was way above what is normal.  I note that yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, stated that visitors should not come to Ireland unless they restrict their movements for 14 days.  With respect, this type of advice means absolutely nothing unless it can be backed up by action.  Over the weekend, we saw many tourists from the USA out and about in our cities and towns.  I understand that in the USA, people from the state of Texas are unable to visit their neighbours because of Covid-19 restrictions, yet they can travel freely to Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House what action the Government intends to take to ensure visitors to our island respect and obey the restrictions in place?</p> <p> I congratulate the Taoiseach on getting the contractor back on the site of the national children's hospital yesterday.  Will he confirm to the House whether any additional conditions have been imposed by the contractor for its return to the site?  We are all aware that the spiralling costs of the hospital have gained worldwide attention.  As I come from a business background, I know how projects can overrun their budgets, but what has happened at the national children's hospital to date is simply not acceptable.  Can the Taoiseach inform the House of the current situation regarding costs?  Are measures being put in place to ensure costs are controlled?  Is the Taoiseach confident that the costs can be controlled for the remainder of the project?</p></speech>

On the first matter, I will of course speak to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, regarding the inclusion of representative voices for SNAs.  I think we have more than 70,000 SNAs in our system now.  Those posts sprung from an initiative I took back in 1998, when I served as Minister for Education and Science, with regard to special needs education.  The objective of the Government and of the Minister is to get as full an opening and return to school as possible near the end of August.</p><p>That relates to the Deputy's question regarding travel and behaviour.  If our number one priority is to reopen schools, and I believe everyone shares that as a priority, we must be extremely vigilant concerning social distancing, etiquette regarding washing of hands etc. and abiding by the public health advice.  Any slippage between now and the end of August could undermine our efforts to get schools open fully.</p><p>In the context of travel, there has been much commentary concerning the number of American visitors.  Our information from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is that the numbers coming in from the US are quite low.  From the outset of the pandemic, travel has never been banned officially or <i>per se</i>.  It has never been prohibited.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will be giving us advice.  It is meeting today and there will be a meeting of the Government tomorrow in respect of phase 4 of the roadmap.  There will also be further discussions about the travel issue, which will culminate in decisions on 20 July about drawing up a green list and strengthening our presence at airports and ports in respect of inward traffic.  </p><p>I have been speaking to the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  There are concerns regarding increases in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last fortnight.  Congregated indoor settings are presenting a problem and having 30 or 40 people in house parties is an issue.  We have to be very strong in respect of travel, especially regarding our messaging, with a view to keeping the rate of Covid-19 down.  That will be our objective in the coming weeks, with the overarching considerations being to get the schools open and to free our hospital capacity to get the non-Covid strands of medicine opened up.  I think I have covered that item for Deputy Fitzpatrick.</p><p>Concerning the national children's hospital, that is back now after the Covid-19 disruption.  There are ongoing issues between the contractor and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB.  The Deputy will have seen my comments on Friday.  There are mechanisms in the contract for resolving any contractual issues or any issues pertaining to claims and counterclaims.</p> <p>Those mechanisms should be used.  What is essential is that work continues in respect of building the hospital for the children of this nation.  The children of this nation need a modern hospital.  We are way behind in terms of getting that completed.  From the Government's perspective, working through the board, we want to protect the taxpayer, make sure that the contract is implemented and monitor that in a robust way.  Any issues should be resolved through the mechanisms that are provided for within the contract.</p></speech>

Only for the fact I am a pioneer I would buy you a drink.</p><p>I thank the Taoiseach because he realises that special needs assistants do a fantastic job.  It is important that their opinions and concerns are given expression.</p><p>The people of County Louth, especially the Carlingford area, are concerned about what is happening at the moment.  We see so many motor homes and the number of people coming to the Border area at the moment is high.  It is okay for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the T&aacute;naiste to make those statements, but it is important that if statements are made, action is taken.</p><p>We all need the children's hospital.  We are all talking about the children's hospital for the wrong reasons - the cost.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on getting the site back up and running but we have to keep an eye on the cost.  That is very important.</p><p>I congratulate the Taoiseach again and thank him for answering my three questions.</p></speech>

I have to put that on the record.  The board has kept the Minister informed in respect of the efforts it has been making in that regard.</p>  <p>  There will be significant domestic tourism activity this year.  That is important to weigh up.  Our travel advisory is consistent.  We are advising people not to travel abroad except for essential reasons.  As a result there has been a significant demand on domestic facilities, including hotels and so on.  Again, the message has to be that while obviously we want people to enjoy themselves during the summer, they should do so in a socially responsible way.  In this phase of Covid-19, personal responsibility is essential and is key to keeping the spread of the virus down.  It is a very dangerous virus.  What worries me is that the age profile of new cases is going down.  It is important to convey to people the serious potential long-term impact that getting this virus can have on one's health.  That is why, in all of the holiday locations across the country, people should be conscious of that and behave appropriately.</p></speech>

High-speed fibre broadband is a dream for everyone in rural Ireland, which has turned into a nightmare.  It has turned out to be a shameful legacy of Taoiseach after Taoiseach in this country.  The current Taoiseach has two and a half years to turn this around.  His leadership of the country will be measured in rural Ireland by many issues in this term but broadband will be top in most people's minds.</p>  <p>  The &euro;3 billion national broadband plan, NBP, was signed last year.  Many doubt if it will work, but that is something I have no wish to dwell on too much today.  What I want to dwell on is a solution.  We have it under our fingertips.  For once, it may not be Eir, Vodafone, Three Ireland or any of the national operators.  The solution to almost 100% of our problems is our local private wireless operators.  I will offer an example that, if worked on, can be a solution.  The Taoiseach could oversee this solution to the broadband problems in this country in his term in office.  One of these companies is DigitalForge, a fixed wireless broadband provider in west Cork.  It has been providing a service for 16 years and employs eight people.  It has provided a service in this time to thousands of homes and businesses in the county of Cork as well as to 60 schools.  This business has expanded without any State assistance whatsoever during that time.  The company has not increased the price of its standard package, which provides a 70 MB service, in 16 years.  The European minimum specification has been 30 MB.  We should remember the company started out 16 years ago offering a 1 MB service.  It has grown and continues to grow.  The company's network is resilient.  In the recent Storm Ophelia the longest outage some customers experienced was three hours while customers relying on the traditional hardwired system waited weeks for phone and broadband lines to be restored.</p> <p>The State sets the price for radio frequencies and by pricing these high, there is no allowance for competition, the recent closure of a Cork wireless operator, permaNET, being an example.  The licence goes to the highest bidder.  The State does not allocate the spectrum for smaller operators.  Prices are in the millions and smaller operators do not stand a chance.  <br/><br/>DigitalForge provided broadband to the Mealagh Valley north of Bantry when no other broadband provider could or would help.  It provided broadband to Baltimore and when eir came to town later to rich pick customers, almost all of DigitalForge's customers stayed with it because, as they said, they had a top-class service and somebody at the end of the phone who would immediately set about resolving any problems.<br/><br/>The areas I have spoken of have benefited from having DigitalForge in west Cork.  Gaggan in Bandon, Kilmacsimon in Innishannon, Sandycove in Kinsale and other areas of west Cork have little or no broadband.  Despite of all of the efforts to get the larger operators to deliver extra capacity, nothing has been delivered.<br/><br/> Will the Taoiseach sit down with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and try to create a level playing pitch by developing a two-tier solution?  I do not mean in any way to disrupt the national broadband dream, which can work away behind the scenes.  Rather, I ask that private wireless operators be given some small State assistance and recognition for being the only operators who can deliver broadband to well over 90% of rural Ireland.  In some cases, they provided 100% of the broadband to areas of rural Ireland for the first time.</p></speech>

I have no issue with sitting down with the Minister and discussing the issues he raised.  He might forward to me some further details on the company and its work.</p><p>  That said, the allocation of spectrum is a matter for proper procurement processes and so on.  It is not a process with which we can readily interfere.  If it is the Deputy's contention that the mechanism unduly disadvantages smaller operators, that is something that can be considered.  The national development plan is not one that will be working behind the scenes, as the Deputy suggested.  The programme for Government commits to an accelerated roll-out of the national broadband plan if that is possible.  The objective is to deliver it faster than within the seven-year period specified.  </p><p>Work between the Department and the company is ongoing.  There is still some work to be done in terms of improving on the timelines around the national broadband plan.  Towards the latter end of this year, the Government would like to be in a position to have the full assessment and costings available in regard to the idea of proceeding faster with the national broadband plan, if that is possible.</p><p>  I am aware of local initiatives, such as the digital hub in Skibbereen, which is a very good example of collaboration between private companies and the public interest, and incorporating a degree of philanthropy.  That example proved particularly effective in terms of being a catalyst for the generation of jobs and companies locating near the hub and in Skibbereen more widely.  I do not disagree with the Deputy about the significance of broadband and connectivity in respect of rural Ireland and enabling economic recovery in rural Ireland.  It is an essential prerequisite to enabling rural Ireland to fulfil its economic potential into the future.</p></speech>

That is the situation we have experienced in west Cork.  I did my best to steer away from the national broadband plan in my initial question as I do not want this to be the rock on which the Taoiseach will perish, like his predecessors.</p><p>  A few short months ago, the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, agreed to allow ComReg to give extra capacity to broadband and mobile phone companies to increase capacity in rural communities due to the increased numbers of people working at home because of Covid-19.  As far as I am aware, not one community in west Cork has had increased capacity.</p><p>Who is monitoring ComReg?  Is it a law unto itself?  At a conservative estimate, some 100,000 customers nationally are serviced by fixed wireless operators, which get no recognition from the State for what they do.  With Government support these numbers could double or treble.  The national scheme is spending &euro;5,000 per household to ensure services are available.  Small communities have no broadband and little chance of getting it for years, if ever.</p> <p>It is not financially viable to build infrastructure for them.  If 20 houses in a village are without broadband, the NBP will pay &euro;100,000 to get these homes serviced whereas a fixed wireless provider could do it for a fraction of that figure and in a significantly better timeframe.  The solutions offered by fixed wireless access operators are environmentally friendly.  They do not build huge masts or run miles of cables across thousands of poles and they frequently use green technologies such as wind and solar.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach consider creating this type of solution for many homes with little or no broadband in west Cork?</p></speech>

The Department is pretty clear in terms of the primacy of the national broadband plan as the route to creating proper broadband connectivity across the entirety of Ireland, particularly those areas that are not commercially viable.  I have no doubt the new Minister is open to any innovative suggestions or proposals that would accelerate provision and enable particularly remote locations to have access to high connectivity.  This would facilitate remote working, which is an objective of the Government and the programme for Government, and, as the recent Covid-19 experience has illustrated, is something that could be made more permanent in our workplace as an option and in enabling people to spend part of their week working from home.  That would be economically beneficial to certain communities and localities but connectivity is needed to enable that.  That is something we all share in the House.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Taoiseach about his commitment to developing regional growth centres and, specifically, to developing Sligo as one of those centres.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 makes many promises but the programme for Government is light on detail.  We are told the Government will develop the cities of Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway and there is mention of regional towns prospering.  We need a strong statement and I will tell the Taoiseach why we need a strong statement and strong action.  The European Commission has downgraded the northern and western region from the status of being developed to a region in transition.  As somebody who was involved in the Objective One status campaign I thought I would never see that day where we had gone backwards.</p>  <p>  According to EUROSTAT's GDP figures, in 2018, we were at 79% of the European average per person compared to the south at 235% and the east at 205%.  I acknowledge GDP has its limitations but even going back to 2014, our GDP has continued to fall comparatively.  We cannot just say there is a gap between the regions and that it is growing; it is ballooning.</p>  <p>  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly report published last November contains a load of figures.  I will only quote one or two, as I have quoted some of them to the Taoiseach previously.  Capital investment in third level education, for example, equates to &euro;141 per student in the north and west whereas it is &euro;197 nationally.  The spend on roads, both regional and local, are significantly lower.  I will not quote the figures because they will fry people's heads.  In eight of the past 11 years the spend on research and development is below the national average.  There are many more figures. </p>  <p>  I refer specifically to Sligo.  The number of Enterprise Ireland, EI, jobs in Sligo reduced by one third between 2010 and 2019 and in Leitrim by half.  The number of Industrial Development Authority Ireland, IDA, jobs, in Sligo remained the same but the national average increased by 40%.  Sligo University Hospital has 40 fewer beds than it had nine years ago.</p>  <p>  What measures will the Government take to redress that imbalance and ensure that Sligo is a regional growth centre?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400010#H00100"><p>First of all, as the Deputy will be aware, the national planning framework targets there being additional population of 160,000 to 180,000 in the north west which would give a population of approximately 1 million people by 2040.  In the here and now, Sligo is the engine room in many respects for the north west.  In my view, the entire higher education edifice in the region - the institutes of technology, along with St. Angela's College - is the key to economic regeneration there.</p>  <p>  Obviously, the move towards a technological university between Letterkenny, Sligo and Galway is important in increasing the level of research and development over time.  Critical mass is needed for research and development investments.  In Sligo, there are already strong research and development components; for example, in the robotics centre which is probably unique across the country in terms of its quality.  That is what helps to bring in foreign direct investment.  We have set up a new Department of third level education, research and science specifically for that purpose.  I was anxious that the Department would be established from a policy perspective because I think the future of the country depends on significant investment in education at all levels, particularly in third level and in fourth level research.  The move from institute of technology status to technological university status will enable over time a greater amount of research to take place.</p>  <p>  The town centre-based approach in the programme for Government is another avenue through which we want to bring back development to towns that have suffered significantly in recent times through a range of factors, including demographics, the movement of industries and the closure of certain types of industry.  There is a need for a renaissance and revitalisation of many town centres across the country, particularly in the north west.  The programme for Government identifies incentives to try to encourage people to develop buildings and residential homes within town centres.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;1 billion will be spent on rural regeneration over the next ten years.  The north west has been effective in tapping into quite a number of funding streams and has had a number of projects sanctioned arising out of such funds.  Fundamentally, we must build on our strengths in rural areas, such as the agrifood industry, biodiversity and afforestation issues such as the growing of native trees.  There will be investment in all of that, and retrofitting as well.  There will be a need to develop alternative industries that are amenable to grow in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Regionally, we need to rebalance the country.  I acknowledge there is an imbalance at present.  The programme for Government is clear that it wants to redress the current imbalance.</p></speech>

By the end of the year Sligo, Letterkenny and GMIT will make their application.  Two of the colleges are ready to go but there is an issue about the third.  It is allowed that two out of the three would go forward and the third could join when it is ready.  I want a commitment that this can happen because when I read the programme for Government, I see the south-east technological university mentioned, not once but twice.  I see the Magee campus in Derry mentioned, but I see nothing about Connacht-Ulster.  I have real concerns around that.  I want to know that once they reach the criteria, they can go ahead.</p>  <p>  I heard what the Taoiseach said about the different programmes.  They are all important but we need investment in our services, we need incentives and we need a 40-bed unit in our hospital.  The Taoiseach mentioned the &euro;1 billion for rural investment but we need significant real investment in those areas where we can play to our strengths.  It has not happened.  I want to hear a commitment from the Taoiseach that it will happen and, specifically, over the next number of months, how it will happen.</p></speech>

Quite a few of the delays to date have not originated at central government level but rather, as the Deputy will appreciate, while getting local entities and the various stakeholders, including the institutions, ready or persuaded to do it.  The south east is one such area.  This is why there are repeated references to it.  It has been on the agenda for quite some time.  There is a commitment to progress this project and to get it over the line.  The merger in Munster between the institutes in Tralee and Cork has effectively occurred.  The Dublin merger happened first.  Time is ticking.  Once a programme is decided upon, as this one was a number of years ago, it should be followed through.</p>  <p>  I will talk to the Minister for Health in respect of the Sligo hospital.  The Minister and I met HSE representatives last week with regard to the winter initiative and the need to prepare and plan properly for this winter, more so than any other, because we will be living with Covid-19, which will place an extra strain on our healthcare facilities and hospitals as we approach a new flu season.  I am particularly worried about that.  Any extra capacity that can be brought into the system should be brought in as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach knew that the statement the Minister, Deputy Cowen, made to the D&aacute;il was incomplete.  Astonishingly, he has attempted to justify the Minister's lack of candour before the House.  It is now very clear that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, needs to come before the D&aacute;il to make a statement and to take questions.  A senior Cabinet Minister challenging the accuracy or truthfulness of the PULSE records of the Garda is a very serious matter.  A senior Cabinet Minister attempting to evade a Garda checkpoint while behind the wheel of a car and having consumed alcohol is a very serious matter.  These are matters of public concern.  It is now imperative that the Minister come before the D&aacute;il to make a full statement and to take questions.</p></speech>

That was a mistake.  The consequence of this was a drip feed of information, which is precisely what the Minister said would be damaging.  The information which emerged over the weekend is very serious for the two reasons.  The first is that the record itself describes a supposed attempt to evade a checkpoint and the second is that the Minister has made the very serious assertion that this record is incorrect.  Earlier, the Taoiseach seemed to imply that he was not aware of that record at the time of the Minister's statement last week.  He was aware.  He may not have seen the record but he had been informed of its existence.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was aware at the time of the statement by the Minister, Deputy Cowen.

I wrote to the Business Committee this morning stating that tomorrow or on another day this week, there will need to be statements on foot of the ruling, which will come out tomorrow, of the General Court of the European Union on the Apple tax case.  This is not a small matter.  We will get a ruling tomorrow as to whether the decision of the European Commission to award Revenue &euro;13 billion in unpaid taxes plus interest from Apple will be upheld.  Regrettably, the previous Government, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, appealed that decision and supported Apple rather than taking the &euro;13 billion we need.  Whatever about the previous Government, in the context of Covid and its costs, and when we are looking at a bill for this country of up to &euro;20 billion, it would be nothing short of economic treason to appeal a decision that awards those tax revenues to this country when we need them desperately to cover the bill for the Covid crisis.  We need to hear, as do the people of this country, from the Government this week, immediately after that ruling.  I hope it will tell us it will not further support Apple in its efforts to avoid paying taxes of such magnitude owed to this country, taxes which could transform our economic and financial situation fundamentally.  That is what I believe should happen, and the Government should agree because this is too serious a matter with implications too enormous for this country.</p></speech>

There have been two attempts to change the business.  I appreciate that Members are entitled to do that.</p>  <p>  By the way, the &euro;13 billion would not be available even if there were a decision to uphold the Commission's position.  The Government's position is not to support anybody or any company other than to say this was not state aid and that the independence and credibility of our Revenue cannot be undermined.  The idea that the &euro;13 billion will be available next week is just not true and is a dishonest presentation of the situation.  The Deputy can take it that whatever happens, and I do not know what will happen with the decision, the money is not readily available to Ireland.  I think there will be others in the queue.  Of course, nothing can be accessed until the full appeals mechanisms are exhausted.  There is a potential appeal by another party to this that would basically mean that no one could access the funding.</p>  <p>  That said, I would have no issue with a debate on the Apple ruling.</p> <p>It should be an informed debate.  I am not sure how lengthy the judgment will be tomorrow and how ready the D&aacute;il will be to have a meaningful debate on it tomorrow or Thursday.  We should have an informed debate on it.  I would welcome that and I do not see any issue, but there is an exhaustive legislative programme here and the reason for that legislative programme is to underpin the economic recovery and to deal with Covid, particularly getting as much assistance as we can to small businesses and medium-sized companies in the economy through the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020 and other Bills.</p></speech>

Can I take it that the proposal for dealing with Wednesday's business is agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Thursday's business agreed to?  Agreed.  On the Order of Business, I am conscious that we have only 18 minutes now.  I call Deputy McDonald.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400015#P01400"><p>When I raised with the Taoiseach last week the need to extend maternity leave and benefit by 12 weeks for mothers and parents affected by the Covid-19 crisis, he said the matter was complicated and complex but that the Government would do the right thing.  Yesterday, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced a three-week extension to parental leave to be brought in next year under budget 2021.  I put it to the Taoiseach that that is too little and too late.  Those new mothers and families that need the additional breathing space and support of 12 additional weeks of maternity leave and benefit need action now.  They are not in a position to wait until next year for some of that relief.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to support the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion that will be brought forward and more than that to act as a Government and live up to the Taoiseach's commitment to do the right thing.  The right thing is to afford 12 extra weeks to these woman, their babies and their families.</p></speech>

That is to give parents who gave birth during the Covid period an opportunity to avail of the scheme.  The pre-existing scheme was somewhat limited and could have excluded them.  The proposal Deputy McDonald put forward in terms of paternity benefit would have required further social welfare and justice legislation and would have had to be retrospective, which would have been complex enough.  Also, the benefit of this proposal is that it is consistent and in line with policy positions that Government had adopted and the Oireachtas had agreed to in respect of parents' leave.</p>  <p>  There are other groups out there as well.  If one takes the totality of the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy, there is a substantive range of supports helping people in different groupings and different situations.</p></speech>

We also have real issues coming down the line regarding trolley numbers in acute hospitals.  The numbers released today by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation in relation to trolley numbers are scary.  The total number is 166.  In relation to University Hospital Limerick, the number is 56.  The Minister is now silent on this issue despite making a range of huge commitments on it prior to being appointed.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about this?  We are in the middle of a pandemic.  We need leadership as to how we ensure we can cope over the coming months with Covid and non-Covid illnesses, particularly in relation to acute settings and trolley numbers.  Commitments have been made.  The Minister seems to be missing.  What will the Taoiseach do?</p></speech>

It is three and a half years since the Health Products Regulatory Authority recommended that a medical cannabis programme be set up.  Last year, the law was changed in this country.  For the first time, medical practitioners could legally prescribe medical cannabis.  Since then, not one person has been prescribed medical cannabis unless they go through the licensing system.  As the Taoiseach knows, this system is extremely bureaucratic and those people have to go to Holland and so forth.  Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that this programme, which is in the programme for Government, will be commenced as soon as possible?</p></speech>

I also told the Taoiseach about a constituent of mine whose daughter is getting chemotherapy and has to pay &euro;250 per session.  The Taoiseach gave a commitment that himself and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, would look into the situation.  He used a very strong word and said that no private hospital should be profiteering.  I agree with him.  I got a phone call yesterday from another constituent of mine.  She went to a private hospital which I will not name and she has to go for an operation on 27 July.  The consultant told her yesterday she might need as many as three Covid tests.  Can I go back to my constituent and tell her not to worry, that the fee will not be there on 27 July?  The Taoiseach made a commitment last week.  Did he or the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, or anybody tackle or visit the private hospitals to do away with this fee?</p></speech>

However, I reiterate what I said last week, namely, that there should be no profiteering out of the Covid situation in respect of any patients, be they private or public.  Private hospitals should not be levying charges that are disproportionate to the costs of providing those services and which are basically unfair to patients.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is communicating that view to the private hospitals.</p></speech>

I note the comment by the deputy chief medical officer that there is a week to decide on this matter.  The Civil Service can work for a while in splendid isolation from economic realities or at least until the economy cannot afford to pay their salaries.  For small businesses, however, there are preparations to be made, including getting in new stock.  Many of these pubs are family-run businesses and the owners have to make arrangements for their families.  They need to know in advance what is happening.  We cannot tell them on Monday morning that they can open at 10 a.m. that day.</p>  <p>  When will the statutory instrument that will govern this issue be published?  Thus far, we have had relevant statutory instruments published two or three days after they come into effect.  That does not amount to the rule of law because one cannot regulate one's behaviour in accordance with something that is not published and we cannot prosecute somebody for not adhering to something they cannot even see.  When will the statutory instrument be published so that people can have certainty as to what is happening?</p></speech>

I have been contacted by numerous publicans expressing their frustration and worry concerning the lack of advice provided to them on what they must do to prepare or whether they will be opening at all.  I understand that public safety is paramount and we must do everything in our power to safeguard it.  However, we need a concrete plan for publicans setting out what they must do to reopen and what guidelines they must abide by to ensure public safety remains the top priority.</p></speech>

Stocks needed to be ordered yesterday if they are to open next Monday.  Some publicans took the gamble by ordering but more did not because they do not know where they stand.  We seem to have completely forgotten that there are 50,000 jobs on the line.  Pub owners need clarity as to whether they can open their doors.  That is what I am hearing from every publican in west Cork.  I am pleading with the Taoiseach to give them that clarity and let them order their stock and reopen their businesses.  We should bear in mind that if we have one or two pubs opening at one end of the street and none at the other end, we will have a congestion of people at the first end.  If we instead allow all the pubs in a town to open, that will at least spread out the numbers.</p></speech>

While pub and shop owners, families and everyone else have suffered, people continue to be allowed into the country from abroad.  The Taoiseach said earlier that the people are law abiding and that is, of course, true.  However, they are also furious at what is happening at the ports and airports.  The Taoiseach knows, because he was there, that I have been asking NPHET, Dr. Holohan and others, from the very start, about the ports and airports remaining open.  Deputy Shortall asked how many personnel had been assigned to those locations but she was not given an answer.  The Government was trying to fool the Irish people.  We are expected to take all the medicine while, at the same time, people from areas with scary Covid numbers are let into the country by aeroplane.  The Taoiseach is saying that the number involved is limited but it is not fair to business people, publicans, shop owners and their families that they are being treated in this way.  Pub owners need to know when they can open.  Above all, if we do not seal the airports and stop people coming in from abroad, the results will be tragic.</p></speech>

In terms of the reopening under phase 4 of the roadmap, there will be a Government meeting tomorrow to discuss it.  NPHET is meeting today and will give us its up-to-date advice.  I am taken by some of the points made by Deputies McNamara, Cahill, Michael Collins and Mattie McGrath in terms of a rules-based approach sometimes being far more effective.  I said earlier that what is of more danger than anything is a situation where we have 30 or 60 people at a house party or parties taking place on certain roads in our cities, and we will have to do something about that.  I am making the same point that Deputies Collins and Cahill were making that where there are rules, behaviour follows.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that while its members did have some challenging experiences the weekend before last in identifying breaches under Operation Navigation, the large majority of premises were compliant.  The reports this weekend likewise suggest a large degree of compliance with the rules.  That said, there are other issues arising in terms of the virus itself and its activity levels, and all of that has to be taken in the round.  We will get the advice today and will make a decision tomorrow.  I am taken by the point regarding the need to give people notice and allow them time to prepare.  I accept that point.</p></speech>

There is a specific reference on page 28 to the expected impact of increased premium levels.  I want to tell the Taoiseach about a constituent of mine who contacted me over the weekend.  He is 21 years of age and has a full driving licence with no penalties or associated convictions whatsoever.  His insurance quote is a staggering &euro;4,450.  We are not talking about a Subaru Impreza or a high-powered car here; the insurance is for a van which the young man needs for his work, which is at a small business that is looking to expand.  Unfortunately, that is the quote he has been given.  Can the Taoiseach give an assurance to this young man and to the thousands of young people who are looking to the Government for help and support with their car insurance?  The price my constituent is being asked to pay is absolutely appalling.</p></speech>

It is not sustainable for a young man going into business to take a cost like that on board.  Such costs militate against young people becoming entrepreneurs, getting into business and going out to work.  The programme for Government sets out a multipronged approach to dealing with insurance, both on the personal injuries side and in terms of making sure there is fair competition.  We will be tackling the insurance issue on a number of fronts.</p></speech>

The case I want to talk about concerns a retained firefighter with 12 years' service, based in Dundalk, who has been working for the Revenue service.  He has been told that from Monday, he can no longer engage in his life-saving work as a firefighter.  Back in September 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform facilitated a local arrangement that allowed firefighters to continue working for Revenue.  While this individual was on call, he always made up his hours, worked both of his jobs perfectly and never let either side down.  We cannot expect private employers to facilitate a necessary life-saving service like this when we have a public employer failing to facilitate it.  We are talking about a firefighter who, with his colleagues, has dealt with some of the major fires in the Cooley Peninsula and some of the very serious arson attacks in Dundalk.</p></speech>

Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; an t-&aacute;dh libh.  The Taoiseach was previously Minister for Health and his legacy in my county of Monaghan is that he was one of a successive line of Ministers who oversaw the removal of services from our local hospital.  In view of the Covid-19-related restrictive measures that will have to be applied at emergency departments in Drogheda and Cavan and in hospitals throughout the State, will the Taoiseach ensure that the Government reviews the services that are offered and services that have been removed at hospitals?  We should be aiming for a restoration and development of services such as accident and emergency services at hospitals like Monaghan.</p></speech>

I remember the decisions made by the North Eastern Health Board and we have come a long way in medicine since then.  Very often now, it is the colleges of the various clinical specialties which determine the critical mass that justifies and sustains, for example, a maternity unit or an emergency department.</p> <p>Gone are the days when politicians claim we should have an emergency department without any reference to the medical wherewithal that is required to sustain it and make it safe.  That is an ongoing battle between the political world and the medical world as medicine advances.  That said, our aim for acute and emergency cover in the north west, particularly with Covid-19, is to do everything we possibly can to develop capacity within respective hospitals, and short-term capacity in particular, because there will be pressure on emergency departments.  We cannot operate at 95% occupancy during the flu season with the potential of Covid with us as well and, therefore, the HSE is looking at how it can either procure or develop capacity quickly in certain locations to enable it to deal with the urgency of the next six to nine months. </p></speech>

This report has been further supplemented by the publication of the NEIC strategic plan 2020 to 2022, which is available on<i>www.neic.ie</i></p><p>In June 2017, the Government appointed an independent chairperson to the NEIC programme implementation board.  Members of the board include representatives from relevant Departments and agencies, business and the local community.  The board is assisted in its work by six subgroups: enhancing policing; maximising education, training and employment opportunities; family well-being; enhancing community well-being and the physical landscape; substance use, misuse, inclusion and health; and alignment of services.</p><p>The board and its subgroups continue to meet on a monthly basis to oversee and progress the implementation of the Mulvey report and the next strategic plan for 2020 to 2022.  Officials from my Department work closely with the board, the subgroups and the dedicated programme office based on Sean McDermott Street.  The chairperson of the board reports to an oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  This group, which has met 11 times, ensures strong and active participation by all relevant Departments and agencies and deals with any barriers or issues highlighted by the board.  The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will provide political oversight of the NEIC initiative.</p><p>The Government is committed to supporting and investing in the north-east inner city community and ensuring that the board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfil its ambition.  To this end, the Government made available &euro;6.5 million in funding for the initiative in 2020.  Some highlights of what the board has delivered to date include an increased Garda presence in the area, with the Garda community support van, supporting a focus on community policing, particularly throughout the Covid-19 pandemic; funding provided for establishing a Garda project focused on drug-related intimidation, which commenced in the area, continues to have positive effects; a full-time intercultural development co-ordinator was employed for the NEIC; continued operation of Ireland's first social inclusion hub in the NEIC; funding provided for the homeless case management team and a residential stabilisation programme.  Funding was also provided to a career local employment action partnership, LEAP, which supports young jobseekers into work placements and employment, as well to establish the City Connects programme and a local early learning initiative.  A green ribbon project was rolled out for environmental clean-up and litter prevention in partnership with local residents, and a comprehensive programme of sport and well-being activities has continued to support local people even throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Progress reports on the NEIC initiative are available on <i></i>for 2017, 2018 and 2019.  The Government remains committed to supporting and investing in the north-east inner city community and in ensuring that the chairperson and programme implementation board have the necessary resources to help make the area a better place in which to work and live.</p></reply>

He will recall that lives had been lost, the community, including children, was traumatised by the incidents they had been witnessed and at the time there, was an understanding that there had to be an intervention that was wider than a policing or criminal justice response.  That response had to be holistic, progressive and recognise the history and the reality of intergenerational poverty and the very specific social circumstances of the north-east inner city.  By the way, I do not argue that the inner city of Dublin is unique in that regard; sadly, it is not.</p>  <p>  I argue at this stage for a review of this initiative.  I had hoped to hear more energy and commitment in the Taoiseach's response to this issue.  This should never turn into a box-ticking exercise or something on which there is routine reporting.  If we get this initiative right in the inner city of Dublin, then we will have the potential to get it right elsewhere as well.  First, we have to establish if the approach being adopted is working.  Is the project making a substantive difference to the lives and generations of the people who live in the inner city?  </p>  <p>  I was struck last week when I was listening to the Taoiseach talking about drug use and misuse.  He very correctly spoke of things such as resilience, self-confidence and respect, all those things to which we all subscribe.  What was missing from his analysis, however, was any real appreciation or recognition that poverty is systemic, that inequality is toxic and that communities in which generation after generation suffer deprivation and marginalisation will experience real consequences.  One of the consequences that can be measured is drug addiction and drug misuse.  We, therefore, need to review this initiative.  The boundaries of the project need to encapsulate the north-west inner city as well the north-east inner city.  Critically, we need to go to the community, measure and ask if this project is making a difference and what needs to change and what needs to be enhanced.  </p>  <p>  The Government is commited to supporting and investing in the north east inner city community and in ensuring that the board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfill its ambitions.  To this end, the Governmetn has made available &euro;6.5 million in funding for the initiative in 2020.  Some highlights of what the board has delivered to date in 2020 include:  increased Garda presence in the area, the Garda community support van supporting a focus on community policing, particularly throughout the Covid-19 pandemic; funding was provided to establish a Garda project focused on drugs-related intimidation, which commenced in the area and continues to have positive benefits; a full-time intercultural development co-ordinator employed for the NEC; continued operation in the NEC of Ireland's first social inclusion hub; funding provided for the homeless case management team; funding provided for residential stablilisation programme; funding provided to local career leap supporting young jobseeker's into work placements and in employemtn; and funding provided to establish the city connects programmes; funding provided to the local early learning initiative; a green ribbon project rolling out environmental clean-up and litter prevention, in partnership with local residents; and a comprehensive programme of sport and well-being activities that has continued to support local -</p></speech>

All my life I have been committed to the idea of dealing with the vulnerable, those living in poor conditions and those in disadvantaged communities.  For example, I believe the RAPID programme of earlier years was an effective multisectoral multidepartmental approach to dealing with urban disadvantage and urban issues.  The forerunner of that programme, the drugs task force areas programme, likewise took a holistic approach to development within particular communities with some success.  Education and early intervention at childcare level and in the early years of primary education were the key with higher resources being allocated to the pupil-teacher ratio in schools in such areas.  Now the DEIS programme has replaced all of that.  Our party introduced DEIS some time ago to target resources where they were most needed and most effective.</p>  <p>  I will talk to the board about the idea of commissioning a review.  In addition, the new Minister with responsibility for community affairs will be looking at this in terms of the broader application of this model to other areas.</p>  <p>  One area we need to integrate into this programme is housing.  I remember touring the area with Senator Mary Fitzpatrick and meeting all the groups.  There is a need to look at the housing part of this to assist the local community as part of the wider level of supports that are available.  The Secretary General of my Department chairs the oversight group.  The chairperson and the board report on a regular basis to the Secretary General, so we are keeping a close eye on this with a view to ensuring the 54 actions are implemented.</p></speech>

I am keen to acknowledge the substantial amount of work done by the board and I commend those involved on it.  Nevertheless, this review has to be about the community.  It has to be about the people who live in the kind of atrocious housing conditions that the Taoiseach has himself witnessed.  Should the Taoiseach go into any of these blocks of flats and ask himself whether this is how our citizens should be living in 2020, the clear answer would be "No".  Poor housing is not only a consequence of disadvantage and poverty, but it is also a driver of further inequality and marginalisation.  I have lost count of the number of homes and flats I have been in that do not have room for a kitchen table or a place for the children to do their homework or for the family to eat a meal.  That is scandalous in 2020.  That needs to be wired in.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to another thing that should concern him - it certainly concerns me.  Goal 4 of the national drug and alcohol strategy sets out the importance of enabling communities to participate in the shaping of decisions that affect them.  Community participation is critical to driving interventions and solutions.  In the north inner city the HSE is actively undermining this.  In fact, the HSE is acting to remove participation workers from the north-east and north-west inner city.  I cannot overstate how wrong this decision is and I ask the Taoiseach to examine it.  I will write to him on the specifics of it.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and prevent that from happening?</p></speech>

I will talk to the Minister for Health on the point she has made and on what she was saying.  I am unsure of the background.  Deputy McDonald is suggesting that the HSE is undermining community participation.  We will get that looked at.</p>  <p>  I have gone into some of the flat complexes with Senator Mary Fitzpatrick.  I agree with Deputy McDonald that the conditions were poor and tight with no space.  There were significant levels of respiratory conditions.  I remember coming out of the Greek Street flats one day and looking across at modern student accommodation.  The contrast was stark although some of that is historical.  I will talk to the Minister with responsibility for housing on that and to Dublin City Council to discuss the various programmes on refurbishing and improving the quality of living conditions in some of the complexes that I visited.  Without question there is room for improvement there.  I will talk to the Secretary General about a review of the overall plan for the north-eastern inner city and how we can add to it.</p></speech>

They are not captured by the catchment area.  I am not saying this to catch out the Taoiseach at all.  I am simply raising it to reiterate the point about the catchment area for the north-east and north-west inner city.  A line was arbitrarily drawn.  I hope that as part of the review which I hope will be commissioned, those responsible look at the boundaries and accept a north inner city area of Dublin without artificial distinctions that are not helpful to landing on the right solutions.</p></speech>

The details of the roles and staffing of these offices have not been finalised to date.  Appointments to these offices will be made in line with the Public Service Management Act 1997 and will be published in due course.  These include the establishment of an office of the T&aacute;naiste and an office of the leader of the Green Party within the Department of the Taoiseach to be located in Government Buildings.  The office of the T&aacute;naiste will consist of a private office and a policy and programme implementation unit.  The purpose of these offices is to support both the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party in the co-ordination and implementation of policy within the Government.  In particular, the policy and programme implementation unit will assist the T&aacute;naiste in work relating to the Cabinet, Cabinet committees and oversight of the implementation of the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Public Service Management Act 1997, Ministers and Ministers of State who regularly attend Cabinet meetings may appoint special advisers.  The Act also provides that other Ministers of State may also appoint a special adviser.  The requirement for specialist policy input and advice is a matter for each Minister to consider having regard to the area of responsibility and the support in place in the relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  Having appointed Ministers and Ministers of State to their various portfolios across the Government, I am also considering the advisory supports I might need in my role as Taoiseach and Head of Government.  While I have not yet fully finalised the make-up of my team, it currently consists of a chief of staff at deputy secretary level, a deputy chief of staff at assistant secretary level and three special advisers at principal officer level.  It is also my intention to appoint an adviser shortly with relevant expertise on economic policy.  While not finalised, I anticipate that, in addition to Civil Service support, the office of the T&aacute;naiste will consist of approximately five or six special advisers and the office of the leader of the Green Party will consist of approximately four or five special advisers.  In line with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997 there will be two special advisers assigned to the Office of the Government Chief Whip.  It should be noted that all of the above appointments are subject to Government approval and relevant contracts.  Statements of qualifications and statements of relationship will be laid before the Oireachtas in due course.</p></reply>

However, I would caution that too many cooks can spoil the broth, as they say.  It strikes me that this is a most irregular arrangement.  Not alone will the T&aacute;naiste have an office within the Department of An Taoiseach, but we will now have an office of the leader of the Green Party within the Department of An Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has set out considerable resources.  He referred to five or six special advisers for the T&aacute;naiste.  I presume that is by way of addition to whatever resources the T&aacute;naiste will have in his line Department.  The Taoiseach might clarify that.  It is similar for the leader of the Green Party.  Is that additional to the resources afforded to him as a senior Minister?  Are there additional press resources for the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party as well?</p> <p>Critically, what is all of this costing?  How does this compare with previous Administrations?  <br/><br/>The Taoiseach has appointed 20 Ministers of State, three of whom will sit at Cabinet.  I understand, however, there are only two salaries.  How will that particular loaves-and-fishes exercise work out?  Who is going to lose out in that scenario?  The Taoiseach might make that clear for us.<br/><br/> By way of final comment, I understand that responsibility for the coherence and overseeing of the implementation of the programme for Government falls to the Cabinet as a whole.  I am very concerned that we now have a holy trinity of taoisigh, or at least a holy trinity of very senior actors, located in the Department of the Taoiseach at considerable expense to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

However, there is no transparency.  I respect the fact that he has not yet made some decisions, but there seems to be an incredible number of advisers.  There will be three people in the Office of the Taoiseach and in the T&aacute;naiste's office as well.</p>  <p>  It is, frankly, a joke that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will cost the taxpayer &euro;200,000 because he wants, of all things, a head of protocol and a Garda car and driver.  We are going through a pandemic and an economic crash, the likes of which we have never seen.  I was part of a Government that picked up the pieces of what happened in 2011.  The Taoiseach could look back on some of the comments he made during that time on Ministers, advisers etc.</p>  <p>  None of the 20 Ministers of State can have advisers.  It would be wrong to put taxpayers through that.  I do not have an issue with Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet having advisers.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out in the last D&aacute;il, unless the Taoiseach introduces new legislation, which I am sure he will not do, only two Ministers of State can get the extra &euro;16,288.</p>  <p>  How many advisers will there be for the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Green Party leader?  Will the Taoiseach cut the extra &euro;200,000 that is going to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?  Will he commit that Ministers of State who do not sit at Cabinet will not have advisers, given that they are totally unnecessary in the current economic climate?</p></speech>

They want to see through the political commitments that have been made.  That was a major turning point in how Government works in terms of the use of special advisers.  In the Northern Ireland Executive, the role of special advisers is strong and I have no difficulty with that.  We know that special advisers in Northern Ireland play a key role in advising Ministers and working the machinery of government.</p>  <p>  Not all of the advisers will be political.  Some of them will have expertise in economics or other specific areas.  My advisers have been allocated based on particular policy areas.  One innovation of the new Government is the reintroduction of some substantive Cabinet committees to work through key areas and objectives of Government, including housing, health and climate change.  </p>  <p>  Other Cabinet sub-committees, such as that dealing with economic recovery, will meet on a monthly basis to bring a more cross-sectoral and cross-departmental approach to the business of Government.  That is why there will be advisers for each party.  This approach is to ensure cohesion, genuine partnership and parity of esteem within Government.  It is not about one party lording it over another.  I have made that very clear from the beginning. </p>  <p>  The last Government had, for example, advisers for the Independent Alliance and for an Independent Minister.  It had 19 Ministers of State, and this Government has one more.  That is hardly earth-shattering.</p></speech>

There is a need and Government is becoming wide-ranging.  There are areas, such as insurance, that need specialist attention.  As we heard on the Order of Business, it is a key area and it is a good idea to have a Minister of State, together with senior Ministers, specifically charged with trying to deal with that area.</p>  <p>  That is the position.  When we get further details we will put them out transparently.  All of this information will be in the public domain.  I will have further details on how advisers will overlap in terms of the line Departments for which the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister with responsibility for climate action and Environment have responsibility.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste having, in addition to his departmental advisers, five or six additional advisers in order that he can fulfil his duties as T&aacute;naiste strikes me as absolutely extraordinary.  For the leader of the Green Party to have four or five additional advisers, as the Taoiseach said, is similarly extraordinary.  Nobody is against bringing expertise to the table; on the contrary.  We have to be very sure that things are not being over-egged and that this is not a case of sharing the spoils between the three parties in this tripartite Government.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach explain to me why the T&aacute;naiste needs an aide-de-camp?  What is the thinking behind that?  As the T&aacute;naiste is not the Taoiseach, or at least not yet, why would he require that?  I do not understand it and the Taoiseach should give an explanation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly has correctly raised issues concerning the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Where there is this kind of additionality in terms of resources, Members and, more importantly, the taxpayer need an explanation as to why all of this is happening.  The Taoiseach might answer my question on the Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet.  There are two salaries, but three such Ministers of State.  The maths of that does not really add up.  Is the Taoiseach going to bring in a third &euro;16,000 allowance?</p></speech>

Will Ministers of State have advisers?  They did not when the economy collapsed in 2011, and we are probably in a worse situation now.  The Taoiseach does not agree with that now because it does not suit him.  However, we can go back through the record if he wants to do that.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;80,000 multiplied by 20 is not a good use of taxpayers' money.  How are we to vet the advisers for Ministers and the Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet, something I do not have an issue with?  They are meant to be specialist advisers.  How will we know they are qualified?  How can we vet them to ensure they are not political appointees and are instead specialists in insurance and various different disciplines?</p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of the aide-de-camp for the T&aacute;naiste.  It is a joke.  It is an extra cost.  Why is it necessary?  We still do not know the total number of advisers for the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party.  We will get to that. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has to answer my question on Ministers of State who will sit at Cabinet.  Why is the Minister for Foreign and Affairs and Trade getting a Garda driver and car?  Why is this extra cost to the taxpayer, along with the aide-de-camp for the T&aacute;naiste, being tolerated by the Taoiseach given the current economic situation?  I do not believe we can have either of those or advisers to Ministers of State. </p> <p>If the Taoiseach wants to show example and show leadership he will not have any of them.  Their total cost is a serious amount, coming to a seven figure sum, and the Taoiseach cannot justify it. </p></speech>

I recall Deputy Howlin and the then T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Dick Spring, won a substantial number of seats.  They no longer wanted to play second fiddle to the Fine Gael party and did not go into coalition with them.  They entered into coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il and developed this idea.  We are political parties, and I do not mean political in the sense that one is just making appointments; we are parties that want to get policies implemented.  There must be proper respectful demarcation lines between full-time permanent civil servants and full-time political programmes and political input.  That was the idea at the time and it worked.  Sinn F&eacute;in are no strangers to special advisers in Northern Ireland.  We saw that in the RHI report.</p></speech>

The emails were flying to and fro on that between all the special advisers of all parties so let us not pretend that this is something new.  Ministers of State either mean something or they do not mean.  In my view, they mean something in terms of the policy areas that are under their responsibility.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability will transfer to the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is a substantive Minister of State portfolio because all of the relevant areas in health to do with disability are being delegated to that Minister of State.</p></speech>

The plan will put sustainability at the heart of our fiscal, enterprise, innovation and environmental policies.  As part of the development of the new national economic plan, my Department will lead a high-level review of the economy.  This review will seek to identify the sectors that have the greatest opportunity to grow and sustain quality employment in the future.  It will be an opportunity to consider, along with relevant Departments and sectors, how Ireland can adapt to a very changed global economy.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment has been established and first met on Wednesday, 8 July.  The terms of reference of the committee are to oversee the implementation of programme for Government commitments aimed at sustainable economic recovery, investment and job creation.  The committee will operate in accordance with established guidelines for Cabinet committees and substantive issues will be referred to Government for discussion and approval.  The Cabinet committee&rsquo;s immediate focus is the development of proposals for a July jobs initiative in line with the commitments in the programme for Government.  This will have a short-term focus on jobs as a first step towards the longer-term national economic plan to follow in the autumn.</p></reply>

If I understand it correctly, there will be a rotation between the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party.  Will the Taoiseach set that out, and the basis upon which these committees were allocated to each of them?</p>  <p>  I refer to the high-level review of the economy.  This is to be led by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, yet the T&aacute;naiste is chairing the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  I would like to know how those meet and marry.  I would also like to know who is in charge when it comes to the economy, economic planning and all of that lift that needs to be made.  The T&aacute;naiste has the line Ministry.  He chairs this Cabinet committee, his party colleague is in the Department of Finance and so on.  Is the Taoiseach answerable to them or is he, as Head of Government, in charge of this critical part of policy and this initiative?</p></speech>

As regards the make-up of the committee, the Taoiseach might give further detail as to who will be involved.  He keeps talking about specialists.  Will he bring in specialists to sit on this committee?  When I sat on Cabinet committees, specialists were brought in.  The Taoiseach seems to have a new thematic analysis of everything so I presume he will bring in people all the time.  Will he supply us with the details in this regard?</p>  <p>  The July stimulus will be the key deliverable from this committee from day one.  What quantum will be spent on that?  I do not expect the Taoiseach to go into the detail of the stimulus now but it would be rather unfortunate and it would not look good if he did not know the quantum he will spend on it.  Covid-19 has been a disruptor across a range of areas but that can deliver some positive change despite everything.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s feeling on new economic modelling that we can be generated from this?  How will hope be given to young people, in particular, and how will economic inequality be reduced?  How will it be ensured that as part of this process, through that restructuring and that disruptor effect, those who get a stimulus from this will respect the industrial architecture of the State and the various processes and the decisions we have made in regard to protecting people&rsquo;s incomes, in particular those in low-paid jobs or in the gig economy?</p></speech>

I emphasise again that three parties came together.  My overall objective is to ensure the three parties work seamlessly and in co-operation in getting the work of the nation done, and I take that very seriously.  My ego is not going to get in the way of doing the right thing.  We agreed we would share the chairing of various Cabinet committees.  I am keen to have Cabinet committees established to follow through on the implementation of the programme for Government.  I have been in government previously and if committees are well organised, they can work very effectively in pulling different Departments together to get things done.  My Department tends to be the Department in government that pulls the different Departments together, in particular its economic division.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, will chair the Cabinet committee on economic recovery.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, will chair the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change.  I am chairing a range of other committees dealing with Covid, housing, health, social affairs and equality committee, education and European affairs.  The European committee will meet before every EU Council to bring a cross-departmental approach to it, and in relation to Brexit and Northern Ireland.  There is a Government co-ordination committee involving myself, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, leader of the Green Party.  The structure is designed to enable Government to work with respect to the three parties in a seamless and effective way.  That is the objective of the exercise.</p> <p> Regarding the economy generally and the July jobs stimulus, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance have key roles and will do much of the running in taking ideas from other Departments in respect of the July stimulus.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will have the difficult task of making decisions on what will make the cut - one will excuse the word "cut" as it is the wrong word in this case because this is-----</p></speech>

I refer to the projects that will be identified and prioritised, the key as well being the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy on which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has ideas.</p>  <p>  I will not give Deputy Kelly the final quantum today because that will be announced on the day and work is still under way.  There will be a further Cabinet committee meeting tomorrow evening, specifically in respect of the July stimulus.  Various ideas and submissions have come in from different Departments.  The focus is on trying to get shovel-ready projects and endeavouring to get credit and funding to the SME sector in particular.  That is why much of the legislation this month will work in tandem with the July stimulus.  A great deal of good legislation is getting done this month thanks to the co-operation of everybody in the House, which we appreciate.  That will underpin much work that is contained within the July stimulus as well.</p></speech>

We are discussing the Chairs of the committee.  That is implicit.</p>  <p>  That is a strange tripartite division of labour.  It seems that Fine Gael will have its fingerprints all over the economic strategy and approach of this Government.  That is not something I welcome.  That certainly is not something that working people across this State will welcome because they all know from bitter experience what that will amount to.  Whatever about the initial flurry and rhetoric about stimulus, we know ultimately who Fine Gael will protect and whose interests it will advance when things get tight, and I assure the Taoiseach it is not the working families the length and breadth of this land.</p>  <p>  This Government co-ordination committee brings the three wise men, or otherwise, together.  It strikes me that the Taoiseach has an awful lot of apparatus of government.  I accept the need for expertise, but this looks clumsy.  It looks like perhaps the Taoiseach's partners in government cannot accept that he is, in fact, the Head of Government and he is in charge.  I say this because we need somebody to be in charge.  The job of Taoiseach cannot be contracted or subdivided between different political actors.  That, I say in all seriousness, is not an approach that will bring cohesion; that is an approach that will bring confusion and that, it strikes me, is born of rivalry rather than any strong co-operation.  The body charged with good governance and overseeing the programme for Government is the Cabinet as a unit in a collective fashion.</p></speech>

This will not work.  There will be confusion all over the place.  There is no consistency.  The Taoiseach will have competition between committees in respect of funding and actions and it is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>I asked a number of questions which the Taoiseach ignored regarding young people and economic models, particularly in relation to stimulus funding being given out and the <i>quid pro quo</i>being respecting the architecture of the State, sectoral agreements on wages, etc.  The Taoiseach will not answer regarding the size of the stimulus package.  I do not know whether he knows.  Is a quantum agreed at this point or not?  The Taoiseach might confirm that a quantum is agreed, if he will not tell me the amount.</p><p>With regard to capital funding under the stimulus package, in addition to shovel-ready projects, I encourage the Taoiseach to support tourism projects because in my experience this worked.  Tourism is taking a massive hit this year.  This is a way of getting funding into the regions and the tourism areas.  I refer to small capital projects where funding is being spent to improve products and facilities which, hopefully, will help them to come back next year.  There are a raft of them left over that should be used.</p><p>There is much talk about targeted VAT cuts.  I have a different opinion on this.  What is the Government's current thinking on that?  If there were changes, there would have to be some form of finance Bill in conjunction with it.</p></speech>

Having been in previous Governments, I know that co-ordination is key.  In coalition Governments - this is a three-party Government - where one has regular engagement, particularly between the three leaders and also to avoid issues that may be disruptive or may cause difficulties, it will require hard work but that is needed to maintain cohesion.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet co-ordination committee is a good idea.  It does not only comprise the three leaders.  It involves the Secretary General of my Department and the three advisers to each party leader.  The idea is to review the programme for Government, make sure it is being implemented, identify any issues that are causing difficulties and see whether a resolution can be found.  It is not the dominant committee in the work of the Cabinet.  It is there to prevent issues from festering and becoming bigger issues than they should and to develop trust between the three parties, and that is working.  It worked during the negotiations and it will continue.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy Kelly's point on the architecture of workers' rights.  We will be cognisant of that, as well as the climate.  In fairness, the July stimulus arises quickly but there is much work done.  We will publish it next week.  I refer to Deputy's point on tourism.  I would like to hear his ideas on tourism in terms of the tax measures that might be optimal for the industry.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that many people are saving at present.  There are a lot of savings in the banks and elsewhere.  One of the issues is, can we engineer greater expenditure over the next while domestically to give an impetus to the economy.  The key areas of the wage subsidy and the pandemic unemployment payment are important but other initiatives can be taken as well that could lead to jobs in the short term to deal with the disruptive impact that Covid represents.  One of the dangers is that Covid is not going away.  It could be with us for the next 12 months or more unless a vaccine arrives.  Even then, that will take time too.  We must try and fine-tune our economy and our model to meet the realities of living with Covid.</p> <p>That impacts on tourism, travel and the more global side of our economy, without mentioning Brexit, which is coming around the corner.</p></speech>

Is that the mechanism the Taoiseach uses to brief his partners in Government on all of the serious issues arising, including the contested Garda PULSE records that suggest the Minister sought to evade a Garda checkpoint?  The Taoiseach has said the co-ordination committee involves not only the leaders but the Secretary Generals of their Departments.  I understand the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach is the only Secretary General present, although the other leaders' advisers attend.  The Taoiseach says it is a mechanism by which to sort out problems and to ensure that things do not get overly contentious or overheated.  Will the Taoiseach talk us through that committee?  I presume its first task, as the Taoiseach has only just entered government, was to deal with the situation regarding the Minister, Deputy Cowen.  How did that work?</p></speech>

Ordinarily, agreement will have been arrived at.  Someone may say his party wants to consider an issue further or to push a memorandum back by a week pending resolution of some issue which has arisen.

It relates to the decision of the courts to strike down sectoral employment orders.

I congratulate her on her appointment as Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for enterprise trade and employment.  I look forward to tangling with her for the next two and a half years.</p>  <p>In June, the High Court found that SI 251/2019 was made outside of the powers of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  It was also found that the legislative framework governing the sectoral employment process is unconstitutional.  In the judge&rsquo;s ruling, it is explained that this is because of the manner in which the process is delegated to bodies outside of these Houses and the lack of clear guidance regarding how to balance competing interests in drawing up sectoral employment orders.  SI 251/2019 applied to the electrical contracting sector.</p>  <p>  As set out in the House on Thursday, 9 July, following a discussion with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and consultation with the Attorney General, it was decided to appeal that judgment.  Once the orders which must be completed by the High Court for this ruling to be given legal effect have been perfected, an appeal will be lodged in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court at the same time with a view to a leapfrog appeal directly to the Supreme Court.  I appraised the Government of this matter at its meeting yesterday.</p>  <p>  This is an area of legislation which has proven to be very litigious in the past 15 years, with significant constitutional issues being called into question.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 was major legislation brought through by the last Government which sought to deal with those issues.  We must now await the outcome of the appeal to understand where to go next with respect to this issue and before we commit to any further legislation.  </p>  <p>  The existing terms, conditions and contracts of employees in this sector stand.  They cannot be unilaterally changed by employers.  The situation is different for new entrants or for those changing employer but the terms, conditions and pay of those with existing contracts with their employers stand and cannot be reduced unilaterally by employers.</p></speech>

We were told the wages of people in employment would be protected but they were not.  I have absolutely no faith that, in the absence of sectoral employment orders, employers will act in the manner the T&aacute;naiste very kindly suggested they might.  I am very pleased to see that the Government will appeal the ruling but, in the meantime, there is an urgent need to protect the tens of thousands of workers who are reliant on these SEOs.  We have evidence to suggest that, where legal protections or minimums are removed, employers will seek to act.  We need to legislate to ensure and guarantee people these minimal rights.  We are not talking about a bonanza for those covered by sectoral employment orders; we are talking about very modest rates of pay and fairly basic terms and conditions of employment.  Nonetheless, these people require that level of protection.  Will the Minister enlighten me as to whether he plans to bring in such legislation?  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will certainly work with him to ensure its quick passage so that protection can be provided to the affected workers pending the outcome of the appeal.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the earlier comments of the Deputy's party leader, we increased the minimum wage to one of the highest levels in the European Union and to a much higher level than that in Northern Ireland, where the Deputy's party is in power.  Legislation to introduce new sectoral minima is problematic because the High Court has found that this House and the Government of the time acted unconstitutionally by applying sectoral employment orders.  We need the courts to clarify this issue.  There is now a serious point of law to be considered as to whether sectoral employment orders such as these are permissible.  Such orders have been struck down before.  Legislation to reintroduce them was passed in 2015.  They have now been struck down again, or at least the one in question has.  Our actions have been found to be unconstitutional.  We do not agree with this judgment, which is why we are appealing it to the Supreme Court.  It would not be possible, however, to bring in new legislation to set sectoral minima when the courts have found that we do not have the power to do so.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the difficulties regarding sectoral employment orders, registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, they are open to legal action and such actions have been taken on a number of occasions.</p> <p>In the intervening time, what protections does an electrical worker who is due to start work tomorrow or the next day have for his or her basic minimum rights and entitlements now that such workers are no longer set by or covered by the SEO?  We must bear in mind that this challenge was not taken by people who sought to improve the terms of the SEO; it was taken by people who sought to get around the terms of the SEO and in some instances to pay less than the SEO would have granted.  Is there a plan for the intervening time, pending the appeal?  As I stated to the Minister, we commit to working with him if there is a plan to bring in a form of legislation that will underpin the basic rights and entitlements.  The Government clearly sees the need for the SEO, as it introduced it, and I am sure the Minister believes it is a good idea.  Therefore, when it is gone something must replace it.  What will the Minister say to a worker starting on a site tomorrow morning and in the intervening period?</p></speech>

We will be seeking an early hearing by the Supreme Court so that this issue can be clarified.  In the meantime, the terms and conditions of those on existing contracts cannot be reduced unilaterally.  There is an issue, which the Deputy has identified, where people are changing employer or starting a new contract.  They will still be covered by the existing minimum wage legislation and minimum terms and conditions but not by the SEO.  That is a real problem.  For Government contracts, we are saying the SEO terms and conditions should still apply.  That is a matter of contract law but I cannot guarantee that everyone in the private sector will take the same view.  Some of the unions have indicated that they would look very dimly on any employer trying to diminish terms and conditions while the issue is under appeal and may take industrial action.  Any employers thinking of taking advantage of this High Court decision, while it is on appeal, should think about the fact that they may bring industrial action on themselves.</p></speech>

The difficulty we have is that because this section of the legislation has been struck down as unconstitutional, it is questionable as to whether this House can bring in sector-specific minimum wages, pension arrangements or terms and conditions.  With that power in question, all we can do is bring in legislation across the board but that will not work because the whole point of sectoral employment orders is that they are sectoral.  I am not sure we have a legislative solution to address this lacuna and the problem that arises, at least until the Supreme Court hears the case.</p>  <p>  We have to work on contingencies, depending on what the outcome of the case might be.  Having spoken to the Attorney General, we are confident as a Government that this House does have the authority to make sectoral employment orders.  The Minister cannot do so on his or her own but provided it is done by regulation and can be revoked by the House, then we are confident that we can but it does create a lacuna during that period, and does speak to a bigger question that we need to resolve.  One of the problems with sectoral employment orders is that they only apply to sectors and one issue we both need and want to address in next couple of years, presuming the economy allows it, is to continue to raise pay and terms and conditions for all workers, not just those in particular sectors or those who are represented by unions.  I refer to the move from the minimum wage to the living wage.  What that means has to be defined because it means different things to different people in different countries.</p>  <p>  It is also intended to introduce auto-enrolment so that everyone has access to a pension fund.  At the moment, three quarters of people in the private sector have no access to an occupational pension fund.  We have pension apartheid in Ireland when one compares the public and private sectors.  The third issue is to increase social insurance benefits more generally to every working person, so that work pays.  In recent years we have made some good progress in that regard on issues such as treatment benefit, maternity benefit and parental benefit and we need to add to that now with other social-insurance related benefits as well, so that we are raising the floor for everyone not just those in particular sectors or those who are unionised.</p></speech>

We have lived in a low-wage economy for some years.  I stated previously to the Minister previously - the Labour Party wishes to repeats the point - that statistics provided by the OECD show that 23% of workers are on low pay.  Last week, my colleague, Deputy Nash, introduced the Industrial Relations (Sectoral Employment Orders) Confirmation Bill 2020.  If the Minister were to support the legislation or to bring in similar legislation, he would be signalling to these workers that he has their backs and he is on their side.  I have been in these Houses long enough to know that when a Government needs or wants to do something, it sends out a message.  It is able to do so, regardless of what commentators might say or whether its constitutionality might be questioned.  What sort of signal would the Minister give in terms of a legislative response?  Just as the Labour Party has done with its Bill, could the Minister not do something similar in order to show the workers that he does have their backs and that he is not just going to wait for the outcome of a case before the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal?</p></speech>

We do not have to appeal it but we are choosing to appeal it because we think it is the right thing to do.  We will look at the legislation produced.  I have not seen the Bill yet, but we will examine it.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has been a Minister and he has served in government.  He knows that no Government can bring in legislation that is unconstitutional.  Producing legislation that is unconstitutional is not showing that one has anyone's back: it is showing that one is pretending to have someone's back and that is not a good thing.</p></speech>

This is legislation that has been proposed by a former Minister in this area, who brought in the 2015 legislation to which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, referred in an earlier comment.  It is not a case of playing games or doing something for the sake of it; it is legislation that has identified the issues raised in the court case and is trying to iron them out.  What I suggest is that the Minister could support the Bill or give it proper consideration and bring in his own legislation while we wait on the Supreme Court to rule on the case.</p>  <p>  It jars with me and my party, and probably with others, to hear the Minister congratulate himself on taking the case to the Supreme Court.  If the Minister were not to take the case to the Supreme Court, we would definitely see which side of the fence he is on.  In the meantime, while we wait for the stimulus package and for the outcome of the Supreme Court case, it is the responsibility of the Government to show there is nothing the Government will not do or entertain in order to protect people who are covered by SEOs, who by their very nature are in vulnerable work, and are open to exploitation.  That is the reason for the necessity of SEOs.  This is the type of message we need from the Government.  I appreciate that the Minister said he will examine the legislation that has been produced by the Labour Party, but I wish to hear a harder and more supportive message than that.</p></speech>

One is good and the other is phony.  We will look at the legislation Deputy Nash has produced.  We did look at the Bill he produced before Christmas, which was unconstitutional.  We will give the Bill serious consideration and see if it is defective or not.  What we have on behalf of the Government is intent and sincerity.  I do not know what we have from the Labour Party.  We will see whether it is just virtue signalling or not.</p></speech>

It is to ask the Minister if he will implement the legislative measures to prevent tactical insolvencies and ensure that workers are protected in insolvency situations.  The latest of quite a number of cases of this nature concerns the Debenhams workers, but there has been a litany of cases.  Every time this comes up, whoever is in government says something needs to be done, someone should do something, this cannot be allowed to happen again and when it happens again they say the same things.</p> <p>Workers are getting a bit sick of waiting, they want protection and they want it now.</p></reply>

The procedures for liquidations are set out in the Part 11 of the Companies Act 2014.  In general terms, a company is permitted to initiate a winding-up where it has complied with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.  A company both during normal operation and in a winding-up process must of course also abide by all relevant legal requirements, including the treatment of employees and creditors and disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners as well.  However, the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 provide safeguards to prevent the abuse of the liquidation system.  These include preferential payments under section 621 which provide for categories of employee entitlement such as wages owed, holiday remuneration, superannuation benefits, ill health payments and social welfare contributions.  An insolvent company is defined by the Companies Act 2014 in section 818 as a company that is unable to pay its debts and is further defined in the Act.</p><p>Therefore insolvency cannot merely be asserted: insolvency is defined in the legislation and scrutinised in the courts.  In addition the liquidator of an insolvent company must report to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, on its demise and must apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the company, unless they are relieved of that obligation by the ODCE.  Ireland has a longstanding preventative restructuring framework in examinership that provides a protective mechanism for companies that have real prospects for the future but find themselves in financial difficulty at a point in time.  When it comes to workers the Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including official notification to the relevant Minister and a 30-day consultation period to allow employee representatives adequate opportunity to consider the employer's proposals and make constructive proposals in response.  While this legislation is currently the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, it will shortly transfer to my Department under a transfer order.</p><p>On redundancy entitlements, it is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy and all other wage-related entitlements to eligible employees.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>However, the social insurance fund, under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides a safety net for employees in situations where the employer cannot pay due to financial difficulties or insolvency.</p><p>The Government has committed in the programme for Government to reviewing whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies protect the rights of workers effectively.  It has committed also to reviewing the Companies Act 2014 with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property with the result being the trading business, including the jobs, go into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business.  Additionally, it commits to examining the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.</p><p>As part of its next work programme, I will be requesting the Company Law Review Group to examine these programme for Government commitments.</p></speech>

They are not on the picket line because they want to be there, they are on the picket line because they are literally in the last-chance saloon.  They have got no option.  They have nothing, they have lost their jobs.  If one talks to these men and women, some have 20, 30 or 34 years of service to the company.  Between them, they have given hundreds of years of loyal service to a company that has simply left them, dumped them.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste may recall that my party tabled legislation in 2016.  His predecessor as Minister in responding to the legislation, the Protection of Employees (Collective Redundancies) Bill 2017, said:</p> <blockquote> 	The Government supports the broad principles of the Bill.  It is well intentioned and in line with proposals being developed in my Department in response to the Duffy-Cahill report. </blockquote>  <p>Where are those proposals now?  They were being developed in 2016.  It is 2020 now and we have another situation.  They were developed on foot of what happened to the Clerys workers, we now have another such situation.  We are going to have more of these if we do not take some action.  We have tabled legislation that is broadly in line with the legislation previously tabled, entitled the Protection of Employees (Collective Redundancies) Bill 2020.  I have sought leave to introduce it and I hope that the Minister will work with me in the spirit of his predecessor to ensure that action is taken on behalf of these workers.</p><p>Will the Minister agree to meet with a delegation of Debenhams workers?  Their trade union, Mandate, has written to him to request that.  I have spoken to them directly and they have said that if they could talk to the Minister and explain to him it might underline for him the urgency and the need to act.</p></speech>

I am certainly happy to consider any meeting request.  It is important to say that the Debenhams staff who were laid off should get their redundancy and they will.  Even if it has to come out of the Social Insurance Fund they should get it.  I know that they have not gotten it yet but redundancy payments are suspended at the moment because of Covid.  That should not stop them getting their redundancy payments and they should get them as soon as is possible, either from the company or from the Social Insurance Fund if needs be.</p>  <p>  The situations with Clerys and Debenhams are not quite the same.  Clerys had substantial property assets on O'Connell Street, Debenhams did not.  It was renting its premises and had been in and out of examinership for quite some time.  Putting the two together is a little bit inaccurate.  There are legal changes that need to be made however.  Some flow from company law and the company law Bill which we will publish in the next couple of days will deal with some of those.  When we have the employment affairs section transferred over I will look again at the Duffy Cahill report and see if we need to make some changes on foot of that.</p></speech>

It outlines again the need for changes and outlines exactly what needs to be done.  There is absolutely no dearth of information about what needs to be done and what would be the right thing to do.  Everybody knows this.  All that they are waiting on is the political will to act on it and that is why I am imploring the Minister to meet with the Debenhams workers and I welcome the fact that he will consider that.  Their trade union has written to him, I think the letter was sent last week.  They would be very grateful for a formal meeting with a delegation.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to redundancy.  As he rightly pointed out, the workers are entitled to what I, in my previous life, would have called "stat", that is, statutory redundancy.  They have a collective agreement.  They were a unionised workforce and I am conscious of the fact that I am talking to someone who has worked for probably most of his adult life under collective agreements and national wage agreements.  These workers had a collective agreement with their employer and their employer has walked away from it.  It did cover issues such as their redundancy entitlement and they are now sitting-in because there is stock in the Debenhams store and once that is gone they believe that will be it, that it is all that is going to be left to them.  Statutory redundancy after 34 years of good and loyal service is not really good enough.  These people had a collective agreement with their employer which was negotiated.  There was give and take, as there always is, on behalf of both parties but the workers should be entitled to the minimum terms that are in that collective agreement.</p></speech>

A company has to initiate a liquidation while insolvent and it cannot do so by voluntary liquidation, it must apply to the High Court.  It may be that these matters have yet to be heard in the courts and that is where they will be determined.</p></speech>

These three papers, which are available on my Department's website gov.ie, were developed in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and provide an assessment of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some other Departments also provided sectoral input based on their analyses.  The papers also drew on international analysis from organisations such as the OECD, the ECB, Copenhagen Economics and Oxford University.</p>  <p>  The economic impact of Covid-19 has not been uniform across all sectors of the economy.  Based on the analysis from the Department of Finance's stability programme update and a more detailed sectoral and labour market analysis provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the most heavily-impacted sectors are accommodation, food, construction, administration and support services, wholesale and retail and other personal services.  Evidence for this includes the number of employees availing of the temporary wage subsidy and the pandemic unemployment payment.  Sectors like finance, service activities and information and communications technology are the least affected.  These sectors rely much less on direct contact with consumers and service providers and much activity can be completed from home.</p> <p>There has also been less of a direct impact on the manufacturing sector.  Many manufacturing industries were considered as essential during the restrictions and continued operations, albeit adapting to ensure safe workplaces with social distancing.  The fall in output will be limited given that pharmaceutical and other medical devices sectors account for the majority of output.  Indeed, activity in the pharmaceutical sector largely continued throughout the restrictions.  However, production in the indigenous sector is expected to be adversely affected, reflected in an annual decline in manufacturing production in the traditional sector in February and March this year.<br/><br/>There are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy.  However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism, hospitality, arts, entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, remain in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are uncertain.<br/><br/>I am out of practice doing this.  I will get shorter replies next time.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i><br/><br/>The July stimulus package, to be announced shortly, will be of scale and speed.  In considering the analyses, I see five areas which we should focus on in helping our enterprises in the future: income support, direct grants for businesses, cheaper finance, new opportunities for future jobs and support for the hardest hit sectors.</p></speech>

It is essential this analysis is done, and continues to be done, in order that there is a targeted approach.  Is the approach of the stimulation that it will be jobs rich?  It is one thing to make sure businesses recover but it is another that they recover and that good quality employment is provided where public money is invested in that recovery.  What are the principles behind the analysis that was done?  It is very welcome that the analysis was done.  It is something that was called for at the Covid committee very recently by some of the employer organisations.  They were quite critical that it was not done until very late in the day after the last crash.  They made a point of saying it needed to be done to have a targeted approach in the recovery.</p></speech>

The truth is, as the Deputy will acknowledge, that any analysis and projection as to how Covid will impact on our economy is a good educated guess.  Nobody really knows how long this pandemic will go on for, how many waves there may or may not be or what they will look like.  It is everyone's best guess as to what the impact will be but it is better to have some analysis and projection than none.  We have to be honest with people that the analysis could change significantly over the coming months, depending on what happens with the virus and whether a vaccine is developed, and all of the things that everyone in the House appreciates already.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, if we have anything to do with the recovery, it will be jobs rich and jobs led.  The priority is to get people back to their old jobs where possible.  We acknowledge this may not be possible in all cases because some firms may fail and some sectors may not recover for a very long time.  We need to make sure alternative employment is created in other sectors, such as climate action, green tech and green energy.  It will also be in construction building some of the many houses we desperately need, and in areas such as care, where we need to increase the number of staff in that part of the public service and other parts of the public service.</p></speech>

It is simply to ensure that where a worker contracts an illness in the workplace, that illness being Covid-19, that it is notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority, which can examine the case to determine how the person got it.  I am a member of the Covid-19 response committee and I have heard from people representing workers in high-risk sectors, such as meat plants, and healthcare workers among whom infection rates are very high.  It beggars belief that this is not notifiable in the normal way that an illness acquired in the workplace is to the HSA.</p></reply>

Any infectious disease pandemic is first and foremost a matter of public health, for which a legal basis for reporting already exists under public health legislation.  Notifiable infectious diseases are statutorily reported under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 to the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health for investigation and control.  At present, under the occupational safety and health legislation the requirement to report accidents does not apply to a person who suffers a disease, occupational illness or impairment of mental health as a result of workplace activity.</p>  <p>  There are a number of considerations to take into account with regard to reporting occupational diseases or illnesses or both to the Health and Safety Authority.  These include the fact that many employers are not in a position to assess or attribute the diagnosis of Covid-19 as an occupational disease or illness with any degree of reliability since it can be acquired in a community or workplace setting.  It would also introduce an obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer, which would be seen as contrary to the protection of an individual's right to the privacy of such information.</p>  <p>  However, I do understand that the board of the Health and Safety Authority has requested a review of the reporting obligations concerning infectious diseases in the context of employers' obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  The review will include consultation with a range of parties, including the Department of Health and the State Claims Agency.  It will also examine whether a proposed change can be achieved without increasing reporting requirements for employers outside the health sector and can be aligned with general data protection regulation, GDPR, requirements.  The review will also look at the practices in other European countries on the reporting of infectious diseases by employers.  I have asked that the review be presented to the Department for consideration as soon as it is available.  I am happy to revert to the Deputy at that stage.</p></speech>

Will representatives of workers be involved in the review?  I heard the Minister of State list the stakeholders but I did not hear worker representatives on it.  If they are not involved in the review, I urge the Minister of State as a matter of priority to ensure they are.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister of State's concern for workers with regard to any responsibility that might be placed on them but their representative body, and a fine representative body it is too, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, wrote to the previous Minister to outline that the workers are more than happy to undertake that responsibility.  If a person acquires an injury or illness in the workplace it should be notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  It beggars belief.  I actually did not believe it when I read the correspondence first that it was not notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  For some people, putting themselves in the way of this disease is part of their job.  It is part of their work and it is in the transaction of that work that they acquire it.  It is not good enough to say we might not be able to determine exactly how people acquired it.  That is what the Health and Safety Authority inspectors are there to do.  They can come in and investigate how it happened.  The Covid committee has heard at length how it runs through workplaces in particular settings.  We know we have unusually high rates of infection among healthcare workers, which is very worrying.  What we need now is to give the HSA the authority to do what it should be doing and inspecting these workplaces.  However, in order to do this they have to be notified.</p></speech>

We can check this.  It is something we can also do when we get the report.  To be clear, the Health and Safety Authority is aware that Covid-19 is a risk in healthcare settings and in other settings also.  It is working with the HSE and individual employees in places of work to investigate the incidents among healthcare workers.  The HSA is also investigating fatalities arising from cases where healthcare workers have contracted Covid-19.  This is when they are called in.  Approximately 9,000 non-fatal workplace injuries and accidents are reported to the HSA per year.</p> <p>However, the report of a workplace injury or accident is for statistical analysis generally.  It is when it goes deeper that it carries out the full investigation.</p> <p> The Deputy asked why it is not included.  As recently as 2016 a statutory instrument, SI 370 of 2016, amended the health and safety general application regulations to clarify issues for employers as to what was a workplace accident by setting out that the requirement to report an accident does not apply to an accident which occurs in a place of work or as a result of work activity in respect of which a person suffers any disease, occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition.  At that time a regulatory impact assessment was carried out as part of this change to the regulations.  The regulatory impact assessment identified that the exclusion of disease or occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition was needed as employers were not in a position to assess or attribute occupational disease or illness to a workplace activity.  That is probably a fair assessment.  However, we will await the report and take matters from there.  We can discuss it in the House.</p></speech>

It is a very simple request - that the Minister of State make the necessary amendment to regulation 224 of the safety, health and welfare at work general application, amendment, regulations.  He has the power to do it.  I understand and respect that he will wait for the report and the review, but this issue has been ongoing for some time.  With the greatest respect, we should have that report and subsequent action on it without any further delay.  As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out in the previous reply, we do not have a crystal ball when it comes to this virus.  In all likelihood we will face more waves of it, so we must put contingency measures in place now to ensure workers are protected to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400027#CC00300"><p>Every effort is being made to protect workers through the back to work protocols.  That is an absolute guarantee.  It is likewise in the health service.  With regard to the changes and the biological agents regulations, this does not impact the reporting of Covid-19.  The reporting requirements in the regulations require that the HSA be notified immediately of any accident or incident which may result in the release of a biological agent which could cause severe human infection or illness in a laboratory setting.  For example, if a sample containing SARS-CoV-2 was released, this would have to be reported.  The requirement for an employer to report a case of Covid-19 in a healthcare worker is not covered, or intended, under the biological agents regulations.</p>  <p>  I can just set out what the situation is.  It is appropriate that we wait for that report.  Naturally, if the report makes recommendations, we will act.  I have committed to discussing it in the House.  We are very open on this as there is no issue with it.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the T&aacute;naiste is replying to this question, but what plans has he to review and strengthen the co-operative sector?  I ask this against a background of many promises and reports stretching over 60 years.  The legislation in this area dates back to the 19th century, with one amendment to it in the 20th century.  What steps are being taken?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400027#CC00800"><p>I will reply to this question.  The Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2018 provide the statutory regulatory basis for the formation and general operation of industrial and provident societies, primarily co-operatives, in Ireland.  The current legislative framework is largely Victorian statutory code incorporating a number of antiquated provisions.  Following a root and branch review of the existing legislative framework, which included conducting a public consultation on the operation and implementation of the current statutory code, the Department is well advanced in the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill for modernised and consolidated legislation.  I expect the Minister to bring this to the Government in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the existing industrial and provident societies legislation and to ensure that a modernised and effective legislative framework, suitable for the diverse range of organisations using the co-operative model in Ireland, is in place.  The Bill will deal with a wide range of issues that have arisen, informed by the public consultation and bilateral engagement with stakeholders, issues identified by the Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the report on the Private Members' Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill 2018 prepared by the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation in 2019.  The Bill will, among other issues, provide co-operative societies with a distinct legislative identity reflecting the co-operatives' ethos, revise the provisions on debentures, introduce audit exemptions in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014, strengthen the governance provision and revise the powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</p>  <p>  A modernised legislative framework aligned with the realities of the 21st century business and regulatory environment will ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and other legal options for structured enterprise activities.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the heads of the scheme will be published.  Forgive my cynicism, however, as I go back over 60 years of promise after promise.  Following a suggestion from Mr. Lemass, a report was published in 1964.  We move forward to a report in 1986, 20 years later, and to 2007, when there was a very good report from Forf&aacute;s.  In 2009 there was another consultation and there was a further consultation in 2016 and 2017.  Then there was the committee's report mentioned by the Minister of State arising from the Bill from Independents 4 Change, which forced some action.  Given all of that, I want a definitive answer from the Minister of State on when the Bill will be published.</p></speech>

I have said that a substantial body of work has already been undertaken.  The Deputy rightly referred to the Private Members' Bill that went through the D&aacute;il in 2018.  It was referred to the committee on business and enterprise and the committee conducted a review and produced a report on the Bill.  That has fed into the work that has been ongoing in the Department.  I ask the Deputy to judge me on my track record.  I have given a commitment in the D&aacute;il today that this is a priority for the Department.  It is envisaged that we will bring this legislation forward by the fourth quarter of 2020 to be debated in the D&aacute;il, and I will welcome the Deputy's engagement at that stage.</p></speech>

The reason 60 years was mentioned was to put it into perspective.  The legislation dates back to 1893 and gives no recognition to the distinct characteristics of co-operatives, or any reference to the co-operative principle.  The Forf&aacute;s report in 2007 highlights that the co-operative sector in Ireland is vibrant, but concentrated in certain traditional sectors.  It goes on to say that it is static.  We simply have not used the potential that exists in co-operatives.  I would have thought we would have learned from the recession and certainly we should learn from Covid-19.  If one looks at the underlying principles, they fit in with what the Government says in theory.  There are seven parts to the definition and one is particularly striking, that co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by members.  There must be Government recognition of that.  We need policy and legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State giving his word today and I will hold him to it.</p></speech>

Their work is recognised and it is on the basis of that good work that my Department has already started the work to bring forward the necessary legislative change.  That legislative change will recognise the distinct identity reflecting co-operative ethos, reduce the number of members required to form a co-operative, revise the provisions on debentures and introduce audit exemptions in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014.  The Deputy will be aware that the Companies Act 2014 required a vast volume of work.</p> <p>It took a lot of time, and now that it has been done there is the opportunity to move it at an accelerated pace in respect of this legislation.  I anticipate engaging fully in this regard with the Deputy before the end of the year.</p></speech>

At the end of 2019 almost 2.3 million people were at work.  Today approximately 1 million people are on some form of income support.  We knew that reigniting our economy after the Covid shutdown would present significant challenges.  The message from small businesses, though, is clear.  They want supports.  They do not want to take on additional debt.  They want grants.  It is important that this distinction is made.  What confirmation can the T&aacute;naiste give to the House on the plans to have SMEs reopen and get people back to work?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400028#DD00500"><p>I thank Deputy Devlin for raising this important question.</p>  <p>  As T&aacute;naiste and Minister with responsibility for enterprise, trade and employment, I am committed to playing my part to get businesses reopened and to provide grant aid, advice and access to finance as we work to get businesses open and people back to work.  A crucial part of this work will involve getting our SMEs back to capacity as soon as possible.  So far the Government has introduced a &euro;12 billion package for firms of all sizes.  This includes the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed and sole traders, grants such as the restart grant, low-cost loans, the write-off of commercial rates, and deferred tax liabilities.  All of this has helped to improve the financial position of SMEs.</p>  <p>  As business reopens, what is needed now is a plan of sufficient speed and scale to repair some of the damage that has been done and to restore confidence.  The July stimulus package, as promised in the programme for Government, will do just that.  It will save jobs and create new ones and get our people back to work.  In considering the analysis, I see five areas on which we should focus in helping our enterprises into the future: income supports for workers, direct grants for business, cheaper finance, new opportunities for future jobs, and support for the hardest-hit sectors.  It is a matter of enabling our SMEs to return to capacity, where possible, and, more broadly, strengthening the resilience, productivity and innovation of SMEs.  SMEs are the backbone of our economy and communities across the country and are key drivers of employment.</p>  <p>  Separately, the programme for Government set out our ambition to honour this commitment.  I intend to form an SME growth task force shortly.  This group will help to bring about a national SME growth plan, which will map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint well beyond Covid-19.  The national SME growth plan will be largely informed by the comprehensive OECD report, SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland, which was published last year.  The plan will include detailed proposals to help SMEs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets.  It will look at ways to make them more productive, innovative and ready to transition to the digital and green economy of the future.  It will make improvements to areas such as local entrepreneurship ecosystems and local industry clusters to drive regional development.  The plan will be brought before the Government for approval as part of the national economic plan in October.</p></speech>

They have been much needed by the businesses the T&aacute;naiste speaks of.  I also welcome and support the July stimulus package.  I reiterate, however, the difference between the grant aid scheme and the loan scheme.  Equally, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to focus on the under 25s.  Approximately 250,000 people aged under 25 are unemployed, and I hope his Department will focus on that cohort too.  It is now just four working days until the start date of the next phase of the reopening of the economy, and businesses need clarity on this.  They need to order stock, train staff and prepare their premises.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm when they can expect such clarity?</p></speech>

I cannot yet say whether the decision will be in the affirmative or the negative, but it will be made most likely tomorrow evening at our Cabinet meeting.  That would give those sectors the best part of a few days to prepare.  I hope it will be possible for them to reopen.  I know there has been an uptick in the number of new Covid cases in the past week or two, but they still number in the teens or about 20 per day.  We did think there would be a slight increase in case numbers as we eased restrictions.  I do not think the increase has been so enormous that at this stage it should prevent us moving to stage 4, but that is not a decision for me on my own.  We need the advice from NPHET, and the Cabinet needs to decide.</p>  <p>  I totally take the Deputy's point about grants and loans.  We need more of both.  One of the things that I expect will be part of the package next week will be an improved and enhanced restart grant that is open to more businesses.  A lot of businesses did not qualify for one reason or another.  I would like to expand the grant in order that more businesses can qualify and get up and running or, as the case may be, stay up and running.</p></speech>

It is important there is a balance between the two.  I wish to reiterate and focus on the fact that it is estimated that 2.1 million people will return to work.  That is approximately 90% of the pre-Covid number of people in employment.  That 90% has presented and, I have no doubt, will present challenges over the coming months, but the 10% who are expected not to return to work must not be left behind.  As I said earlier, I would focus on the under 25s.  We do not want to see young people long-term unemployed if at all possible.  We need to look at schemes and initiatives to get them back to work as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400028#DD00900"><p>I hope that Deputy Devlin is correct and that 90% of people get back to work.  I think he is correct that a proportion will not be able to return to their old jobs, if only because the companies they had been working for will not succeed or the sectors for which they were working will struggle.  It is important we have alternatives for those people, whether new jobs in areas such as housing construction, the care sector or green energy or other opportunities such as apprenticeships, higher education options, back-to-work enterprises and back-to-education options.  The Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister with responsibility for higher education are doing some good work on that in order that we have opportunities and plenty of options for people and do not have young people on the pandemic unemployment payment or jobseeker's payments for a prolonged period.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is examining community employment, which is a good scheme and can be scaled up or scaled down depending on the economic conditions.  Now is probably the time to scale it up again.</p></speech>

It was launched with a fund of &euro;250 million, as the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, on 22 May.  It was devised in recognition of the fact that some small and medium-sized companies and microbusinesses were particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of the pandemic.  The programme for Government pledged a review of the grant, which I welcome because it shows a degree of responsiveness and flexibility towards it and how it should work going forward.  Regarding that pledge in the programme, have any issues been identified by the Department as needing improvement and, if so, what might they be?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400028#DD01300"><p>The restart grant was launched on 22 May and is a critically important tool to assist small businesses in reopening their doors.  Grant payments range from a minimum of &euro;2,000 to a maximum of &euro;10,000.  The scheme was devised in recognition of the fact that microbusinesses and small businesses were and are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19.  Using funding allocated by my Department to Enterprise Ireland for the scheme, local authorities are the granting authorities in each of their respective areas.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;250 million was allocated to the scheme, and roughly 40,000 companies have applied.  That will come to a value of approximately &euro;120 million or &euro;130 million, so there is still a lot yet to apply.  Local authorities have been mixed in their capacity to pay the money out, but we are certain that more will be paid out.  What we are examining for next week is limited to companies with 50 employees or fewer.  We are considering whether the scheme should be expanded to companies with more employees.  The average country hotel will have more than 50 employees.  They need to get reopened.  Educational and other businesses can also have more than 50 employees.  In addition, it has not been open to non-rateable businesses such as B&amp;Bs.  We need to look at a few businesses like that and consider whether we can extend the scheme to them.  However, it should always be seen as part of a wider assistance package for businesses and firms of all sizes.</p> <p>The main measure is the wage subsidy scheme, which, for most employers I meet, is the one they most want to see extended.  It is the issue that is raised most with me by employers.  That has already cost about &euro;2 billion.  There is the pandemic unemployment scheme for the self-employed and sole traders.  We are encouraging them to come off it with an upfront payment.  There are low-cost loans, the write-off of commercial rates and the deferred tax liabilities.  All of these have helped to improve the financial position of SMEs.  It is encouraging that 67,000 people came off the pandemic unemployment payment last week.  Some went back into employment and some went back into employment through the wage subsidy scheme.  If we can keep up that kind of momentum in the next couple of weeks, we could be heading for a faster recovery than we might have thought possible but I think it will be a bumpy road.</p></speech>

I am speaking as a former Dublin spokesperson on the other side of the House.  We have all championed the notion of remote working but it is having consequences.  It has consequences for the city in terms of hospitality.  Walking around the city, one sees a lot of offices are not occupied and that has an impact on hospitality, whether it be restaurants, cafes, sandwich bars or pubs.  It is having enormous consequences.  While I hear the T&aacute;naiste's comments on the July stimulus and I welcome them, he seems to indicate that businesses will fail.  I know he will agree with me that almost every hospitality business in this city and its suburbs is viable, in the absence of a pandemic, and needs assistance to survive.  Is that being considered in the context of the July stimulus?  I acknowledge it is not part of the question, but if the T&aacute;naiste could humour me in answering it, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400029#EE00300"><p>The truth is that not every business was viable before the pandemic.  There were those who hoped they would become viable as the economy continued to grow.  That has not happened.  We had a pandemic instead and now the economy has shrunk so, for some businesses that hoped to become viable, that hope is now lost.  We will see businesses close in all sectors, unfortunately.  That is just the truth of it but we want to minimise the number of businesses that fail and for sectors who were hit hard, hit first and hit worst, such as the hospitality, arts and entertainment sectors, we want them to be able to at least trade through to Christmas if not to the tourist season of next year.  They will need special help to do that.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the city centre.  I am a fan of remote working.  It has huge benefits for parents and for the rural economy and rural areas.  It has benefits in terms of reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions but it is evident how quiet the city centre is at the moment.  I wonder how many of those sandwich bars, coffee shops, small restaurants and so on in our city centres - not just in Dublin - can survive, if we do not have footfall.  No amount of Government interventions, changes to VAT rates or commercial rates will replace footfall.  We will need to have some sort of return of people to their offices over the next couple of weeks, providing the pandemic is under control - perhaps people working two or three days at home and two or three days back in the office.  That will help the city centre.</p></speech>

We are paying attention to what other countries do and every country's package is different.  We compare favourably when it comes to the pandemic unemployment payment.  Not many countries are providing &euro;350 per week to workers.  That is triple what it is in Northern Ireland or Britain.  We compare quite well when it comes to the wage subsidy scheme, which will end in the UK, for example, in October.  We have not yet set a date for ours.  We probably need to do more with direct grants and in terms of our loan guarantee.  These are the kinds of things we are working on for next week and beyond.</p>  <p>   Regarding next spring, unfortunately none of us can predict the future.  I anticipate we will have spikes and clusters but I hope we will not return to a nationwide lockdown again, which will allow the economy to recover.  I hope we will get to the point where we have a vaccine, effective treatments and potentially screening at airports and so on.  That would allow a decent tourism season to happen next year.  This year will be very difficult but I hope Christmas and next year will be good and maybe there will be pent-up demand to help compensate for some of the losses this year.</p></speech>

She has raised it in the House previously and she will understand we are appealing this decision, as confirmed by the T&aacute;naiste last Thursday.  I reiterate the T&aacute;naiste's message at that time and again today to all workers and employers affected by this decision in regard to sectoral employment orders, that until the appeal process is concluded and legal certainty has been obtained, there can be no unilateral diminution of the terms and conditions of employees by employers.  In regard to contract cleaners and the other sectors the Deputy raised, they are covered by employment regulation orders, which is a slightly different part of the Industrial Relations Act 2015 and they are not impacted by this judgment directly.  In regard to meeting representatives of the workers governed by the sectoral employment orders, I intend to meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the coming weeks to discuss this and other pressing matters.  We can take it from there.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy on this but the important thing is that we appeal this at the appropriate time.</p></speech>

The reason I am putting the question in this manner is that I think there is more to protecting and advocating workers&rsquo; right than just what goes on in the courts.  There is also the ability of workers to defend themselves.  There is plan A, where one defends the rights in the courts and plan B, where the State gives workers the possibility to defend themselves.   Here I am talking about the legal right to trade union recognition where if one has a high percentage or a certain percentage - as is the case in other countries - of workers who join a union, then the employer must recognise and deal with them and give them access to the workplace, which would prevent the sort of scandals which are alleged to have happened during the Covid crisis in meat plants.  That sort of legislation that enables workers to defend themselves rather than always relying on the courts is also needed.  It is not just about appealing laws we make here but it is about enabling workers to fight for and defend themselves.</p></speech>

The Industrial Relations Act 2015 was quite a large Act.  Previously, we had 15 or 16 years of discussion and legal cases.  We tried to bring certainty to this and we acted on that with that legislation.  We have built on that since and we have shown our absolute commitment here.  The national minimum wage has been increased four or five times over the past nine years since we have been in government.  When it comes to any cases, we try to strengthen the position of employees and workers.  Naturally, we try to bring employers with us on that journey at all times and to get that balance right and that is what the legislation was about.</p> <p>It is important that we concentrate on appealing the court decision and trying to get that appeal right.  The ruling in this case calls into question the constitutionality behind the regulations and statutory instruments that were based on the relevant legislation.  We will concentrate on this issue in the weeks and months ahead, and both the T&aacute;naiste and I will engage with trade union representatives as part of that.  There is no doubting our commitment to this area.</p></speech>

I do not agree that this Government and its predecessors have done their best to defend workers' rights.  The Lockout more than 100 years ago was all about trade union recognition and we still do not have that in this country.  Several Bills were put before the previous Government, which ended up being delayed and never progressing through the legislative Stages as they should have.  No doubt we will introduce similar Bills in this term.</p>  <p>  Workers need the right to organise and defend themselves and they cannot consistently rely on the courts to uphold that right.  I refute the Minister of State's claim that this and previous governments have always had the interests of workers at heart.  We need to look again at the Duffy Cahill report in view of what has gone on at Debenhams.  What happened in that case will repeat itself in other cases.  We need to consider giving workers the ability to organise and trade unions the ability to access workplaces such as meat plants where there are contentious issues.  Construction sites are notoriously bad for bogus self-employment, precarious working conditions and low pay.  All of those practices must be addressed.  That will require a commitment from the Government to introduce robust legislation that will ensure workers can organise and defend themselves instead of having to rely on the courts to uphold that right.</p></speech>

That is the focus of a lot of our work in the Department.  The Deputy referred to a particular report.  Our officials work through all such reports and bring forward any changes that are required on foot of them.  The machinery at the disposal of the State when it comes to employees' rights is very strong.  We are proud of that machinery and we will protect it.  We will be happy to engage with the Deputy on any legislative proposals she brings forward in this area.  It is about getting the balance right.  We are all committed to protecting workers' rights and that is why we will launch an appeal to the ruling in question when it is the appropriate time to do so.</p></speech>

To assist businesses to overcome the unique and unprecedented challenges posed by Covid-19, the Government has put in place a package for firms that includes the wage subsidy scheme, direct grants, low-cost loans, the write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.  These measures are designed to restore confidence and further assist businesses in terms of their management and business continuity, thus allowing them to begin planning for the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  My focus since I took up my role has been on the July stimulus package, which is aimed at protecting the viability of the business and enterprise sector and enabling people to get back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors.  The stimulus will extend and enhance existing measures to address the impact of Covid-19 on businesses.  I am engaging with my ministerial colleagues on a range of proposals.  Helping SMEs is central to our efforts, given their pivotal role in the economy and employment.  The July stimulus package to be announced next week will be of scale and speed.</p>  <p>  In considering the analysis, I see five areas on which we should focus.  These are income supports for workers, by way of extending the wage subsidy scheme; better direct grants for business; cheaper finance for business; new opportunities for future jobs; and targeted supports for the hardest-hit sectors.  While I have emphasised the importance of preserving existing firms and jobs, the July package should also have an eye to exploiting emerging opportunities and attracting high-value projects with significant economic benefits.  Importantly, the July stimulus must position our economy and firms to meet future challenges.  In the near term, this includes helping companies further in meeting the challenges of Brexit, but we also need to include actions that will build enterprise resilience and help businesses to transition to the low-carbon and digital future.  I look forward to announcing the details with the Taoiseach shortly.</p></speech>

There is a significant focus at the moment on the July stimulus package and a lot of SME owners are waiting very anxiously for it.  Some sectors have been hit harder than others by the Covid-19 pandemic and they are particularly anxious to see what will be announced next week.  Private bus operators, small retail outlets, boutique owners and many others have suffered greatly during this period.  We are hugely dependent in this country on the SME sector and the July stimulus will be critical in rebooting our economy following the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some 65% of workers in the State are employed in SMEs, which means that getting the vast majority of those businesses back on an even keel is absolutely essential.  They are anxiously awaiting next week's announcement.</p></speech>

In all parts of Ireland, large numbers of people are employed in small firms.  When we talk about SMEs, people might not appreciate that we are talking about firms with up to 500 employees.  A company with that number of employees is quite a large firm but it is technically an SME.  We know that the public sector has been largely protected through the pandemic.  Very few people in the public service have lost their job, which is a good thing.  Employees of large multinational companies have also largely been protected.  The people who have borne the brunt of the pandemic are those working in small firms in the private sector.  That is why we need to focus our efforts on them.</p></speech>

Rural-based SMEs, although likely to employ fewer numbers than SMEs in urban areas, are nevertheless significant employers.  We need to look to the future when considering the issues they face.  Access to broadband, transport infrastructure, education facilities and further tax-based incentives will be essential in ensuring the future viability of the sector and enabling the future growth that will enable us to recover from this unique pandemic.  As the Government prepares the July stimulus, there is very significant weight on the T&aacute;naiste's shoulders in seeking to address the issues facing SMEs and enabling them to recover.  Doing so is an essential part of rebooting our economy.  I hope the stimulus package will answer the vast majority of our concerns.</p></speech>

I expect it to include actions we can implement within weeks or months, not actions that cannot be done until next year or the year after, and to amount to several billions of euro in funding.  It is important to say, however, that we are not going to fire all our bullets next week.  We will do more in October as part of the budget and as part of the national economic plan.  The proposals we publish next week will provide a multibillion euro package of measures that can be implemented quickly.  It will include measures to help businesses that are closed to reopen and help those that have reopened but are struggling to stay open.  Most important, it will maintain the connection between employers and employees so that we see more and more people going back to work over the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

Whatever shape it finally takes, Brexit will have a significant impact on the economy.  It will fundamentally change the trading environment for businesses currently trading with the UK.  In 2018, my Department published a report, entitled Strategic Implications for Ireland Arising from Changing EU-UK Trading Relations, which examined the implications of Brexit for the economy and trade.  While tariffs often spring to mind as a significant cost factor, in fact, the cost of non-tariff barriers due to regulatory divergence and bureaucracy will have a greater impact on businesses trading with Britain.</p> <p>In January of this year, my Department published a further study on Brexit impacts based on the withdrawal agreement and the revised political declaration agreed between the EU and the UK.  The findings suggest a reduction in Irish GDP of between 3.2% and 3.9% by 2030, compared with a baseline whereby the UK remains a member of the EU.  This compares with a negative impact of 7% in the no-deal, or WTO rules, scenario modelled in 2018.  Of course, both Brexit studies predated Covid-19, which has had a severe impact on the Irish and British economies, with recent forecasts suggesting negative GDP growth of around 10% this year.</p> <p> The Government has taken extensive action to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit and in each of the last three budgets, provision was made to assist businesses to prepare for Brexit.  That provision includes a wide variety of soft and harder enterprise and financial interventions delivered mainly through the enterprise agencies.  At entry level, training, mentoring and consultancy advice has been provided, leading to financial assistance by means of vouchers, grants, short-term liquidity loans and longer-term loans to assist businesses to restructure and diversify into new markets beyond Britain.  Customs is another area in which we have been actively working on putting in place training programmes, as well as the Clear Customs initiative, which is designed to build sufficient capacity to deal with the new checks, controls and documentation that businesses will need post Brexit.</p></speech>

To what degree are he and his Department pursuing the alternative markets that are currently emerging and which might become available, with a view to identifying the best possible options as we proceed?  Given that it is in the interests of businesses to keep costs as low as possible, to what extent is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied that we are on the right road and are capable of meeting any challenges we might face?</p></speech>

If one looks back far enough, Britain was once our only significant trading partner and it now makes up about 17% or 18% of our trade, though that is a misleading figure because it is so important for certain sectors such as the food and drink sector, small manufacturers and many SMEs.  While our food sector still exports about 40% of everything we produce to Britain, there was a time when that was 70% or 80%.  Much progress has been made in that regard but we need to build on it.  As we are part of the eurozone, we need to develop trading links with more eurozone countries.  There are huge opportunities in our trade agreement with Canada and more opportunities in America, China and Asia as well.  The difficulty is that much of that work has been disrupted in the past few months because of Covid, as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland offices in Asia were closed and no site visits were happening.  Much of that work is now being done online but it is not the same and that has been quite disruptive.  The good news is that some of the offices in Asia are reopening this week.</p></speech>

I have not had the chance to speak to my new counterpart, Alok Sharma, yet but I intend to do so in the next week or two.  Based on the experience I have had with Brexit negotiations up until now, I think there will be a deal but that it will come late in the day, maybe as late as October, November or December.  That is why we once again have to prepare for the risk of a Brexit with no trade agreement.  We unfortunately have had to march businesses up that hill a few times already but we need to be prepared for it if it happens and we are going to have to step that up again over the next few months.  I think there will be an agreement with the UK but whatever that agreement is, it will not include membership of the Single Market so it will be a diminution in the trading relationship and will mean checks and costs for businesses.  It will not be good news but hopefully it will be manageable rather than detrimental.</p></speech>

While I do not imagine for a minute that the answer will be easy or straightforward, it is something that should be investigated by the Department and should form part of the discussions around both the July stimulus and other measures as we move forward.  As the Minister said, this is only the first foray and then there will be more measures announced in October.  As we move forward, we want assurances from him that workers will be protected in the same way as he is going to move to protect businesses.</p></reply>

We referred to this last week.  Our number one focus is helping businesses to survive and keep their doors open and then to thrive thereafter as well.  That is the main focus but there are links to tax compliance in all the various grants, funds and opportunities given out by local enterprise offices, LEOs, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the local authorities.  Applicants have to show they have a tax certificate before the money is drawn down.</p>  <p>  Labour Court recommendations, which are not always legally binding, and outstanding Workplace Relations Commission awards are not linked to the drawdown of grants.  They are generally enforced by other sectors rather than Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or the local authorities.  There is other legislation to protect that area and those organisations do not track it.</p></speech>

We know that the Government knows how to respect workers' rights.  The question is whether it is going to use the power it has to enforce them.  I ask the Minister of State to imagine for a moment that he is a worker with an outstanding award from the Labour Court.  Such awards are rarely legally binding and are often modest.  It is a slap in the face for workers on low incomes who are awaiting payment of Labour Court awards to find their employers are in receipt of grants or special funding from the Government.  For many of those workers, their employers have simply walked away.  Would that Labour Court recommendations were legally binding but they are not, or very rarely are.  If a worker is a trade union member, he or she then has the opportunity to take industrial action in support of that decision, but that is a large undertaking, particularly for people who have just been out of work.  I ask the Minister of State to consider stitching in a mechanism that ensures the third-party mechanism of the State is respected.  I also ask that he adheres to the principle, to which the T&aacute;naiste alluded earlier, that when the State spends money, it will spend it where workers' rights are protected.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me about our agencies, whose number one job has been helping businesses survive and stay open over these last few weeks and months.  Only last week, the Deputy and many of her party colleagues were complaining that the application process for assistance was too cumbersome and involved too much red tape.  Our focus is on getting supports and help out as quickly as we possibly can.  While we expect all our applicants to honour State law and be tax compliant, Enterprise Ireland, LEOs and local authorities are not in a position to track everyone's responsibilities regarding the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission recommendations and I do not think the Deputy expects them to do so in the current climate.  She will probably be in here again next week demanding quick action and that is what we are trying to do.  A number of other agencies and people under our Department are also responsible for tracking employment legislation and employment law but they are not the ones in charge of getting the money out to the businesses as quickly as possible.  Again, our aim is to support businesses to stay open, reopen or restart and survive during these difficult times over the next six to 18 months.  They will then hopefully be in a position to grow again, expand and employ more people.  That is what we are trying to do here and we need to reach out to all those employers as quickly as we possibly can.  There is no proposal to add to the list of requirements they have to comply with to draw down funding at this moment in time.</p></speech>

"Economic growth accompanied by worsening social outcomes" is not worth having.  We fully respect and we will insist that extraordinary measures be taken in extraordinary times to sustain jobs, but it is not counterintuitive to insist that those are also decent jobs.  The recovery of which the Minister of State speaks will not be built on the back of the gig economy, precarious work or low-hours contracts.  It will instead be built on decent work, if it is to be sustainable, and he has a role in that regard.  Will he take on that responsibility?  I do not for a minute suggest that it will be easy and I also do not suggest that it should be so cumbersome that businesses will not be able to engage.  The Minister of State will have to give thought and regard to workers' rights for decent work as he proceeds with the stimulus package.</p></speech>

We take that very seriously in our Department.  We have several agencies that excel in their work in that area.  They have built up much experience and they work with our Department and other agencies.  Bodies such as our LEOs, local authorities, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have to focus on business development and growth and putting the money out.</p>  <p>  The majority of jobs created under the remit of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in recent years have been full time and high end.  Naturally, as a Government and a Government party for the past several years, we have been focused on decent jobs and wages.  Our track record will show where our focus has been and is.  We brought forward legislation on several occasions concerning industrial relations and protecting employees.  We have strengthened their position, if at all possible.  When it comes to pay and decent conditions, we have also not been behind the door in bringing forward four or five increases in the minimum wage.  We are, therefore, showing our focus by our actions.  Our focus now, however, has to be on getting the money out.  That is one arm of our Department.  The Deputy's question is about the fees concerning the action in the High Court, however, and that shows that we are very much committed to the issue of employee conditions.</p></speech>

Some businesses by their very nature, however, will not be able to get going until next year.  The events business is one of those businesses that involves crowds by definition, in many cases at big outdoor events but also big indoor events.  I refer to everything from weddings right to music events in Croke Park, St. Patrick's Day parades, etc..</p>  <p>  What are we going to do to sustain during this period businesses, such as events businesses, where opening is totally dependent on health advice?  Once things get back to normal, or whatever the new normal will be, we are going to need those events businesses.

I recognise the difficulties and concerns that events businesses are facing and those businesses that rely on events companies for trade shows, exhibitions, events etc.. to promote and sell their products.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that measures are in place to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 at organised and ticketed events with members of the public attending is first and foremost a public health concern.  The Deputy is correct, however, to identify the real concern regarding the number of people working in the events industry.  Last week, I met representatives of the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC.  It is a new group, as the Deputy will be well aware of, because its representatives outlined how helpful he has been since its formation.  The group represents  3,500 full-time and 15,000 part-time employees.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that 2020 is a write-off for these companies because of the magnitude of the events in which the industry participates.  They are now facing the issue of skills retention, as well as issues in respect of brand Ireland because these companies promote Ireland in St. Patrick's Day parades, the new year's eve festival, etc.  It is important that the July stimulus recognises that this is also a critical sector of the economy.  As the T&aacute;naiste said earlier, the July stimulus will be ambitious, it will look at how we can protect employees and it will look at how we can expand the restart grant to accommodate people not normally accommodated.  I also refer to the credit guarantee scheme enabling businesses such as event companies to refinance.  I met them in that context, but I also asked officials in my Department to meet the representative groups in the days to come to see how we can support this industry in the future.  </p></speech>

The response requires urgent, decisive and comprehensive action at EU, national, regional and local levels.</p>  <p>  At a European level as part of the early response to Covid-19 on 23 March 2020 the European Commission triggered the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact and has adopted a temporary framework to enable member states to use the full flexibility foreseen under state aid rules.  Then, the European Central Bank, ECB, launched a pandemic emergency purchase programme, which is now worth &euro;1.35 trillion.  The European Council endorsed a further comprehensive package of measures amounting to &euro;540 billion on 23 April.  That package includes three safety nets to minimise the short-term economic consequences of the crisis for workers, businesses and member states: the European Stability Mechanism pandemic crisis support instrument; the new SURE instrument, which is the main subject of today's legislation and will protect jobs, workers and people's livelihoods; and the European Investment Bank, EIB, pan-European guarantee fund to support SMEs.</p>  <p>  These initiatives are in keeping with the commitments laid out in the programme for Government for a jobs-led recovery.  This will help families and households where jobs have been lost to return to work and ensure businesses that have weathered the Covid-19 storm can now grow and rebuild.  The July stimulus package will be unveiled shortly and will place the SME sector, which is the backbone of our economy and is central to our recovery, at its core.  There will be a specific focus on offering supports for the sectors of the economy worst affected by the pandemic.  The package will help to restore employment to the end of 2020 and will fund and progress our goals of decarbonising the economy, delivering balanced regional development and preparing for a digital future.  The legislation we are introducing today can complement the stimulus package in helping the economy and the country to recover.</p>  <p>  The EIB and the European Commission have already presented a support action plan amounting to &euro;40 billion to address the economic challenges resulting from the Covid-19 crisis.  However, given the gravity of the challenges facing the EU economy it has become apparent that far more is required.  To significantly and rapidly extend the EU support for struggling SMEs, mid-cap companies as well as corporate and public entitles the EIB has decided to establish a pan-European guarantee fund.</p> <p>This &euro;25 billion guarantee fund is designed to support those enterprises by leveraging up to &euro;200 billion of additional financing.  The EIB guarantee fund is for workers and business, and is designed to finance high-risk operations that are viable in the long term but vulnerable due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.  These will be primarily private sector operations with a focus on SMEs, although mid-caps and large corporates will also be eligible.<br/><br/>Public entities providing essential services, particularly those in the health, research and education sectors, that cannot be financed under existing EIB group products will also be eligible for support under the guarantee fund.  Geographic eligibility will extend to those EU member states that have agreed to participate in the fund by way of a contribution guarantee.  The fund will be implemented by the EIB in partnership with national promotional banks, in our case the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  In managing the fund, the EIB group plans to deploy a broad mix of products, including counter-guarantees for national promotional banks, venture debt, venture capital and private equity to fund working capital for the corporate sector.<br/><br/>All 27 EU member states are invited to participate in the guarantee fund.  The contribution from each member state will be in the form of a state guarantee of &euro;25 billion in proportion to its shareholding in the EIB.  As Ireland's shareholding in the EIB is 0.66%, our liability to the guarantee fund is capped at &euro;164.7 million.  Ireland's shareholding in the EIB was recently adjusted from 0.67% to 0.66%, which led to a corresponding reduction in our liability from &euro;167.5 million, based on a shareholding of 0.67%, to &euro;164.7 million.  This adjustment occurred as a result of two events that had a material impact on our shareholding in percentage terms: the UK's departure from the EU and the subsequent withdrawal of its shareholding, followed by two member states increasing their shareholding.  While our commitment to the guarantee fund is &euro;164.7 million in actual terms, provision in the proposed legislation is for an amount not to exceed &euro;167.5 million.  This offers a degree of flexibility should further shareholding variations occur.<br/><br/>The State guarantee is required to cover a degree of losses incurred in the implementation of the commercial operations of the guarantee fund.  The fund will be formally established once member states representing at least 60% of EIB capital make appropriate commitments.  Following Government approval on 29 May, Ireland gave a commitment in principle that it will, subject to the passage of legislation in the form of this Bill by the Oireachtas, participate in the guarantee fund.  Legislative provision is required for payments to be made out of the Central Fund to cover any calls on the guarantee provided by the State.  Where losses are incurred by the guarantee fund in the implementation of its operations, a call will be made on all of the member states' guarantees at the same time, given the pooled nature of the fund.  Any delay in payment beyond five days would incur interest penalties.  However, the EIB will provide a liquidity facility to allow member states time to make the necessary arrangements to cover the call on their guarantees.<br/><br/>Repayments and advances under this liquidity facility will take place on standardised dates once per quarter.  The maturity of each advance will be for a maximum of six months.  It is envisaged that the guarantee fund will be temporary in nature, with the initial investment period in place until 31 December 2021.  A prolongation by six months could take place if the majority of contributing member states do not object.  Any further prolongation would be subject to the agreement of all contributors.  The legislation to provide for Ireland's participation in the European instrument for a temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, otherwise known as SURE, and the &euro;25 billion EIB pan-European guarantee fund established by the EIB, and to provide for related payments from the Central Fund to cover both guarantees, is set out in sections 2 to 9, inclusive, of the Bill before the House.<br/><br/>On 7 April, the Government approved the drafting of an amendment to remove an ambiguity about the ability of the SBCI to offer guarantees without breaching the insurance Acts or regulations.  This was not considered necessary up to this point because the SBCI was only involved in a small number of risk-sharing schemes up to now.  It was already clear that risk-sharing schemes were going to become a larger part of the SBCI's offering in the coming years.  The current crisis has accelerated this process.  Following detailed discussions with the Offices of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel, it was decided that the most appropriate way to deal with this ambiguity was to amend the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014.  Taking this step will aid the development and deployment of new risk-sharing loan schemes, including schemes that may be backed by the EIB guarantee fund, to which this Bill is facilitating access for Ireland.  For this reason, the amendment will be included in section 10 of the Bill.<br/><br/>On a further clarification matter, section 11 of the proposed legislation includes a provision to allow for an award of the arbitral tribunal to be enforceable before the Irish courts in accordance with the Third Protocol to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe.  This provision is for the avoidance of doubt on the matter.<br/><br/>In recent years, legal opinions have been necessary in order for the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, to borrow from the Council of Europe Development Bank.  This provision will be important in allowing for and simplifying the potential future borrowing by the HFA and other State parties from the Council of Europe Development Bank.<br/><br/>The SURE instrument is intended primarily to support member states with efforts to protect workers and jobs, and also to support some health-related measures.  In the case of Ireland, the introduction of the temporary wage subsidy scheme has been important in supporting families and ensuring businesses can continue to trade.  These are the types of essential initiatives that can now be supported on a European level.  Under the proposal, SURE will provide financial assistance to member states of up to &euro;100 billion in total.  The Commission will borrow on financial markets to finance loans to member states at the same interest rate, allowing them to benefit from the EU's strong credit rating and low borrowing costs.  The loans are targeted to assist member states in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure caused by the pandemic in order to preserve employment, such as short-time work schemes and other measures put in place for the self-employed, and certain health expenditure.<br/><br/> SURE comes with safeguards to ensure fair and equitable access to funding for member states, with no more than &euro;60 billion available to any three member states under the proposal.  The loans will be underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantees for member states and no more than 10% of all loans would fall due for repayment in any one year.  For a lending volume of &euro;100 billion under the SURE instrument, &euro;25 billion in guarantee commitments are required from all member states collectively.  This guarantee mechanism ensures member states do not have to pay any money upfront.  The instrument will not become available until all member states sign up to their guaranteed amount.  These commitments will remain in place for the full term of the loans which they are underwriting.  Each member state contributes to the guarantee in proportion to its relative share in the total gross national income of the Union.  For Ireland, this will be equivalent to just over &euro;483 million.<br/><br/>SURE was adopted by ECOFIN Finance Ministers and published in the Official Journal on 19 May 2020.  While the SURE instrument is a regulation which is directly applicable to Ireland, signing the voluntary guarantee agreement will require enabling legislation.  This requirement stems from Article 11 of the Constitution which provides that all the revenues of the State &quot;shall be appropriated for the purposes and in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities determined and imposed by law&quot;.<br/><br/>As no member state can access SURE funding until all member states have signed the voluntary guarantee, the timeline for the introduction of this Bill is urgent.  I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 1 defines the commonly used terms in the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 2 outlines the circumstances for the application of section 8.  The EIB guarantee fund can be formally established when member states representing at least 60% of EIB capital have made public commitments.  Section 8 shall not apply unless and until that occasion occurs.<br/><br/>Section 3 allows the State to enter into the SURE guarantee and associated commitments and empowers the Minister for Finance to carry out the obligations associated with that guarantee.<br/><br/>Section 4 of the Bill permits the payment of a sum not exceeding &euro;483,401,250 in aggregate out of the Central Fund under the State's obligations under the SURE guarantee.<br/><br/>Section 5 ensures all moneys received by or on behalf of the State by way of repayment of sums paid in accordance with the SURE fund will be placed in the Central Fund to ensure the Exchequer has access to them.<br/><br/>Section 6 provides for reporting arrangements on the operation of Ireland's part of the SURE guarantee.  In the event of a demand being made under the guarantee, a report will be laid before the House within one month of payment of that demand and annually thereafter.  The report will consist of any information or any sum paid by the State or repaid to the State under the guarantee.  Each subsequent demand will be reported upon within one month in the same manner and is then included in the annual report.</p> <p>The reporting arrangement ceases when the SURE instrument expires and when all outstanding commitments by or to Ireland are exhausted.</p> <p>Section 7 confers on the Minister the power to enter into a contribution agreement and fund guarantee agreement with the European Investment Bank, EIB, for the purpose of committing to the pan-European guarantee fund.  The guarantee shall be based on Ireland's shareholding in the EIB, the aggregate not exceeding &euro;167.5 million, thereby capping the State's liability.  If any amendment is proposed to be made to the contribution agreement or the fund guarantee, a draft of the proposed agreement providing for the amendment and containing the text of the amendment shall be laid by the Minister before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the amendment shall not be made unless and until a resolution approving the amendment has been passed by this House.</p> <p> Section 8 permits payments related to the contribution agreement and fund guarantee to be made out of Central Fund for an amount not exceeding, in aggregate, the sum of &euro;167.5 million.</p> <p> Section 9 allows for any payments received by or on behalf of the State by way of repayment of sums paid in accordance with the contribution agreement and fund guarantee to be received by the Exchequer and to be returned to the Central Fund.</p> <p> Section 10 amends the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014 to remove an ambiguity with regard to the issuance of guarantees by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The amendment confirms that the Insurance Acts 1909 to 2018 and regulations relating to insurance made under the European Communities Act 1972 do not apply to guarantees made by the SBCI in the furtherance of its functions.</p> <p> Section 11 includes a provision to allow for an award of the arbitral tribunal to be enforceable before the Irish courts in accordance with the Third Protocol to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe.  This will allow and simplify potential future borrowing by the Housing Finance Agency and other State bodies from the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p> <p> Section 12 provides for the Short Title, the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill 2020, and its commencement.</p> <p> I am confident the measures to be outlined as part of the July stimulus package will help us to kick-start the economy post lockdown and set us on the path to recovery.  However, Ireland's response must also take account of the wider European Union and global context for recovery.  As a small open economy with a global outlook, Ireland depends on a rule-based international order and robust global trading frameworks.  A recovery at global and European levels will in turn support efforts at national level to restore the Irish economy to growth.  Our membership of the European Union, guaranteeing access to a Single Market of over 450 million consumers and the EU's network of free trade agreements covering 72 countries, is central to our prosperity and the success of our businesses.  Ireland will work with its EU partners to restore the European economy to growth and to ensure the smooth functioning of the Single Market.</p> <p> As a member of the eurozone, we share a common currency with 18 other member states with whom we will continue to engage closely in the development of economic and monetary union.  We also enjoy uniquely close ties with the United Kingdom and with the United States, enabling Ireland to act as a bridge between three major currency areas and to attract foreign direct investment.</p> <p> The Government will also draw on Ireland's membership of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions to shape the global economic recovery and maximise opportunities and supports for Irish business.  Engaging at the heart of the European Union with our fellow member states and strengthening our ties with the United Kingdom, the United States and a range of other global partners will play an important role in the Government's pursuit of national recovery and efforts to return the economy to growth.  Participation in SURE and the pan-European pandemic guarantee fund is essential to this recovery effort.</p> <p> To summarise, this Bill allows us to participate in two important EU Covid-19 pandemic response instruments.  It supports access for workers on short-term schemes and in struggling businesses and is a strong signal of our willingness to stand in solidarity with other European Union member states.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

However, before discussing the provisions of the Bill I wish to first comment on this broader response.</p>  <p>  On 23 March I wrote to the Minister for Finance outlining the set of principles and policies that should underpin the Irish response to the economic downturn created by this pandemic.  While it centred on specific domestic measures such as an income support scheme and financial assistance to business, I also addressed what I and Sinn F&eacute;in believed was the required response at a European level.  I said that the European fallout to the health crisis was a European problem requiring a European response.  This view was not just driven by the fact that Covid-19 pays no heed to borders, it was also a recognition that our fiscal response was constrained by a common fiscal framework.  Additionally, it was a recognition that a monetary response and much else was in the sole hands of the European Central Bank, ECB.  I made clear that if the level of debt refinancing necessary to deal with this crisis was to be possible, a radical departure from the past was necessary.  As the European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Mr. Paolo Gentiloni, has said, we need to face an extraordinary crisis with extraordinary tools.  I said in that correspondence that an essential tool in the kit would be in the hands of the ECB through its bond purchasing programme and I am pleased that the ECB, through its pandemic emergency purchase programme, has learned some of the lesson from the past and acted to ensure affordable levels of debt financing for member states such as our own.</p>  <p>  It is now crucial that the fiscal response at a European level is adequate to meet the challenge we face.  The Minister will play a crucial role in that response in his new role of president of the Eurogroup and if he we here, as I did privately, I would congratulate him on his appointment to that role.  I urge him to ensure that the interests of Ireland are represented and delivered upon in his new role.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us concerns access to capital to support workers and business that have been impacted by the economic fallout of Covid-19.  In particular, it will enable the State to participate in two instruments designed at European level, namely, the SURE scheme and the EIB guarantee scheme.  I will deal with each in turn and I note 140 pages of legislation with a very tight time for it to be scrutinised and a tighter time to make amendments.</p>  <p>  On 9 April the Eurogroup agreed to a &euro;540 billion fund to tackle the social and economic impacts of Covid-19.  This fund and the measure it provided for were endorsed by the European Council on 23 April.  Among them was SURE, temporary supports to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency.  This instrument will provide up to &euro;100 billion with the fund raised on capital markets by the European Commission.  While this will allow member states to benefit from low-cost borrowing due to the strength of Europe's collective credit rating, I wish to put on record that previous schemes financed by the Commission's borrowing from the capital markets came with damaging conditions attached.  One of them, of course, was the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, and we must ensure we never return to those austerity policies of the past.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify in his summing up remarks that there are no conditions or expectations of that nature with regard to signing up to these schemes.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Bill allows the State to enter the SURE guarantee and with the Minister granted all such powers required to perform the State's obligation under the scheme.  Under the agreement provided for in Schedule 1 the State will contribute in excess of &euro;483 million to avail of loans under SURE.  These loans are targeted to assist member states in financing sudden increase in spending caused by a pandemic, in particular, spending targeting short-term work schemes such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.</p>  <p>I ask the Minister to clarify the total values of loans or contribution we would be entitled to access, the criteria for use of the funds accessed under the loans and what quantum of loans the Minister intends would be permissible to draw down under this scheme.</p> <p> Under section 4, a contribution in excess of &euro;483 million will be paid out of the Central Fund under the terms of the SURE agreement.  On Committee Stage, I will speak to amendments that my party seeks to give the D&aacute;il greater oversight over payments made to the fund but I ask the Minister in due course to address a number of issues in this regard: the expected schedule of payments, their value and when they will be made under the provisions of the agreement, and similarly, the expected schedule of loans that will be drawn down under the scheme.</p> <p> The other instrument this legislation will provide for is access to the EIB Covid-19 pan-European guarantee fund, which formed part of the fund agreed by the Eurogroup on 9 April.  The fund will amount to &euro;25 billion and mobilise up to &euro;200 billion with a guarantee provided by each member state - a condition for access to the fund.  As section 7 sets out, our liability to the fund will be capped at &euro;168 million.  For us, this fund will be administered by the EIB in partnership with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p> <p> The guarantee fund will provide working capital to SMEs, to mid-caps and corporates that have been impacted by Covid-19.  While this is welcome, a number of issues require clarification.  Up to 23% of credit through the scheme will be earmarked for companies with over 250 employees and up to 7% to venture and growth capital funds, while at least 65% of the financing is earmarked for SMEs.  What clarification can be given that this credit will be accessible for small businesses that have been unable to access credit to date from banks that refuse to lend?  Also, I would appreciate if the Minister could provide clarity as to how financing under the scheme and its associated agreements can be incorporated into our own loan schemes and business supports.  Measures taken at a European level benefit from our own contributions, but also a lower cost of financing.  This will, in turn, benefit those businesses which are able to avail of financing under the EIB Covid-19 guarantee fund.  It is, therefore, essential that the benefits of the scheme are open to Irish small and medium-sized businesses, not only big business.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will not be opposing the provisions of the Bill.  We have argued before and since this crisis began for a social Europe that invests in its people and serves the interests of sovereign member states, not only big business or unaccountable elites.  We must ensure that the European response to this crisis serves those ends and provides for the issues I have raised in this speech and ensures that they are adequately addressed.  If they are, my party will support this Bill.</p> <p> However, there are a number of clarifications required.  There is a number of further details required that we need to tease out on Committee Stage, in particular, in relation to the loan guarantee scheme and how the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which, as we know, is not a bank but a non-lender, will provide loans to the main lenders here in the State, what type of guarantees will be provided and what type of loans will we see drawn down.  There is also reference to the Minister being able to set the type of lending criteria.  We need to hear more about how that will work and, crucially, because we will deal with the credit guarantee scheme, how this will all interact with domestic legislation.</p> <p> As I argued for in March last with the Minister, Europe had to step up.  I believe Europe is stepping up.  While there is much more that they can do and while we have concerns in relation to some of the expectations as a result of this here, we need to ensure that we get support to businesses as quickly as possible.  It is clear from any fair reading that this State is far behind when it comes to supporting its SMEs, which could have devastating consequences for those small and medium-sized enterprises and more devastating consequences for the workers who are hoping to return to full employment in these same businesses at a future date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400036#NN00200"><p>The provisions of this Bill which are designed to allow Ireland to access the various European funding supports are welcome but questions remain on whether they go far enough, how they will be utilised and to what end.  According to the OECD, average employment will remain below pre-crisis levels by the end of 2021, which is the date the initial investment period of the pan-European guarantee fund ends, after which time any extension will need to be approved by the contributors.  I have concerns that were this extension to need unanimous approval at a period when the crisis could be at its height, it could become the subject of a political battle among member states at the worst possible time and thus be dead in the water.  We should not forget the turmoil of the past decade over whether the eurozone itself would survive.  We need to remember that this affects people's lives.  Come December 2021, if the OECD's unemployment predictions prove to be correct, and I fear they may be overly optimistic, there will be people standing at the edge of the cliff not knowing what the future holds.</p>  <p>  We should be clear that the host of measures contained in this package, while welcome, are at best a workaround.  The proposals for eurobonds and the mutualisation of debt still represent the best way out of this quagmire and the European Stability Mechanism remains highly unpopular among member states due to all the conditional structural reforms it entails, which is code for fiscal austerity and a recipe for economic disaster.</p>  <p>  The European Investment Bank's pan-European guarantee fund will provide working capital to SMEs, which my party believes need to be supported during the crisis as they are the backbone of our economy.  For instance, rural Connemara will suffer considerably due to lack of tourism.  We need to ensure that the small and medium-sized businesses can get the funds they need to ride out the storm of the Covid crisis and ensure that they can survive and continue to provide jobs in their locality.</p>  <p>  For mid-caps and corporates that are deemed viable in the long term but are struggling due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the guarantee fund will also make funds available.  For these companies receiving funds, the way for the State to optimise its return should be through loans that are convertible to equity for the successful firms, while making provisions which allow these firms to buy these shares back at a later date.  All talk of fiscal prudence which does not seek to maximise the return to the State is just that; talk.</p>  <p>  It is also worth highlighting that the pan-European guarantee fund allows for 7% of its funds to be allocated to venture capitalists and private equity.  Given private equity's often poor track record of saddling companies with debt, stripping their assets, raiding their pension funds and then laying off their employees, what mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that this does not happen?  From my perspective, we need to ensure that this funding goes to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>  <p>  The SURE scheme temporary support to mitigate unemployment risk is to be welcomed as it seeks to save jobs, and as we know from the previous crisis, a failure to protect jobs is a failure to protect people's livelihood and a sure-fire way to exacerbate economic inequality.  Nevertheless, it mandates that every member state contributes to the guarantee in proportion to its relative share in the total gross national income of the Union.  As a result, it is estimated that we will be putting &euro;483 million into this scheme.  As has now been well documented, GNI is a poor measure of the health of the Irish economy - something that has even been acknowledged by the Central Statistics Office which has constructed its own modified GNI measure which attempts to remove distortion from profit-shifting.  Unfortunately, for Ireland, the latter measure is not used internationally, meaning the standard over-inflated GNI measure will be utilised and Ireland is likely to contribute more and potentially receive less funding due to the inaccurate picture of the economy.  I hope the Minister will raise that with his European counterparts.</p>  <p>  In closing, I wish to raise two general concerns.  First, there is a likely reluctance on the part of the Government to draw down as much funds as possible due to its conservative ideological bias, which runs the risk of not providing enough investment to counteract the downturn.  In other words, the risk is that we do too little rather than too much.  Second, the more market-friendly approach that this Government will take means that these de facto State subsidies could be used to support the private sector's interest at the expense of public enterprise.  We should not forget the crises in housing, education and the healthcare sector.  These are the front-line staff who we were quick to clap but slow to reward.  We should be clear that what these funds constitute is massive State subsidies to Europe's private sector.  Following the previous crisis, as the public sector was forced to bail out the financial sector, that same sector then turned around and told us that the large public debts and deficits were evidence that we were living beyond our means.  This has accurately been described as the biggest bait-and-switch in history.  Today, European states will not be bailing out the financial sector, but in many cases the wider corporate sector.  I would certainly hope that many of these corporates will remember that in a few years' time when the austerians come calling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400036#NN00300"><p>I start by putting on the record a concern I have about the scale of this legislation and the tight timeframe allowed to us in opposition to submit amendments.</p> <p>This is a 142-page Bill and it is broad and complicated.  As it was only published last week, we only had two working days to submit amendments.  I know it is necessary legislation but I request that the Minister and the Department consider the difficulties this has created for Deputies and for their staff behind the scenes.  </p> <p> I will focus my remarks on the European Investment Bank, EIB, guarantee fund.   The new pan-European guarantee fund to tackle the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic is a welcome development.  The fund was endorsed by the European Council on 23 April as part of the overall EU Covid-19 response package.  It is timely to see it embedded in our own legislation so we can gain access to those funds under the new guarantee fund.  When will the contributors' committee decide on the use of the guarantee?  For what purposes will it allow the EIB guarantee fund to be used?</p> <p> The economic damage done by the Covid-19 pandemic becomes more visible every day.  Our microbusinesses, SMEs and family businesses are fighting for survival.  They need an immediate injection of liquidity.  Most of these businesses have spent a decade working through the debts and loans they accumulated during the previous recession.  As a result of this, for them it is a case of once bitten, twice shy.  These businesses are very reluctant to take on significant debt.  They remember all too well the implications of the last recession and what it was like.  The trauma has stayed with many of them.  They need a liquidity injection through grants or other mechanisms.  These are businesses that were viable.  They were closed for public health reasons rather than because they could not trade successfully.  They want to get back to work.  Liquidity injections need to be the focus of a lot of the short-term measures and must form part of the July stimulus.</p> <p> Across Europe, we see countries unveiling significant economic stimulus packages.  In Britain, we have seen a package of approximately &pound;30 billion announced to invest in the economy in order to save sectors and return them to something like their pre-Covid-19 state.  Countries such as Germany and Denmark have gone even further and are investing massive sums of money in targeted and imaginative ways to stimulate their economies.  The Germans have launched a &euro;130 billion stimulus package while Denmark aims to ensure its stimulus package will deliver a severely reduced economic contraction that will be lower than the European average.</p> <p> While the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste should look at the positive aspects of the British stimulus package, it is our European Union counterparts' economic stimulus packages we should focus on.  This will require the State to borrow; however the cost of not investing in affected sectors will be far greater and will cost the State more in both the short and long terms.</p> <p> Will the Minister of State convey to the Minister for Finance the need to follow our European counterparts and deliver an economic stimulus package, specifically targeting microbusinesses and SMEs in affected sectors, that is both expansive and imaginative and which will also allow businesses to recover, reinvest and re-employ?</p> <p> In addition to the EIB guarantee fund, we need to see more support from the European Union.  The Minister for Finance was recently elected president of the Eurogroup.  This role brings a new range of responsibilities and, we hope, opportunities.  Will the Minister of State confirm that, through his new role, the Minister for Finance will push for additional supports from the EU?  Will those appeals request a support mechanism such as eurobonds?  </p> <p> States are borrowing money and are going to have significant deficits of at least 10% of their GDP without the power to issue the currency in which their public debt is denominated.  The European Central Bank enjoys the power of monetising public debts, a privilege which eurozone members do not enjoy.  Eurobonds have been suggested as a way to tackle the financial difficulties created by the Covid-19 crisis.  They would allow states to borrow new funds at better conditions, supported by the overall rating of states across the eurozone.  Will the Minister of State ask the senior Minister to use his position as both Minister for Finance and president of the Eurogroup to challenge the opposition to eurobonds?</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose this Bill.  I hope the supports from the EU are only the first in a range of measures that will ensure social and economic progress and the recovery of member states.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400037#OO00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment and wish him well in his work and in his term of office at a very important time for our country.  I confirm that the Labour Party will not oppose this legislation.  We support its merits and what it is designed to do.</p><p>I noted with interest the book review by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in <i>The</i><i>Irish Times</i>this weekend of <i>The Economics of Belonging </i>by Martin Sandbu.  He cited a particular relevant passage, which I will read out.  It states &ldquo;Those turning against the western order are those who feel left behind in it, but not just that: they feel left behind by their own &ndash; betrayed by the elites who constructed the system and were entrusted with making it deliver.&rdquo;  The Minister noted that, according to this analysis, the causes of this challenge are primarily economic.  The Minister wrote &quot;The promise of economic advancement, through a secure job, rising income or an affordable home, has diminished for too many.&quot;  These phenomena referenced by the Minister in his book review last weekend should come as no surprise to anyone who served in the last Government, a government supported by the Minister of State's own party, albeit from the outside.  </p><p>The challenges outlined by Mr. Sandbu in that publication are very real.  Covid-19 risks further exacerbating the feelings of those left behind economically, particularly our young people, who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic fallout from this public health crisis.  As the T&aacute;naiste outlined and admitted in recent weeks, the pandemic has the potential to cause further divisive inequality, which may ultimately fuel the rise of the kinds of far-right populism and far-left populism we are seeing develop across western societies at present.  </p><p>The forthcoming July stimulus therefore has to be the start of a new social contract that restores the promise of economic advancement through a secure job, rising incomes and affordable home ownership in a new, sustainable economic model.  Short-term working and training schemes will be pivotal in providing such secure employment opportunities in the months and years ahead.  The EU Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency, SURE, scheme, which was first proposed by our collective of sister parties across Europe, the Party of European Socialists, will be a key funding mechanism to make such systems a reality.</p><p>I therefore welcome the legislation before us this evening, although it is coming two months after the scheme was initially announced at EU level.  For months now, others in the Labour Party and I have been calling, on the record of this House and in the local and national media, for a reformed short-term work and training scheme similar to the German model which proved so successful in supporting businesses and workers throughout the last economic crisis.  International evidence from the OECD suggest that the key element of its success was concurrent access to vocational training, which the current temporary wage subsidy scheme lacks.  Last month's confirmation of the incorporation of apprentices into the wage subsidy scheme is a welcome step in the right direction but it does not go nearly far enough.  Under the equivalent Dutch scheme, for example, employers are obliged to support retraining or reskilling opportunities for all employees.  Similarly, France has introduced a special training subsidy as part of its scheme to help companies undergoing structural changes that need to reskill or upskill their workforces.  </p><p>The Government must prioritise this area in the upcoming July stimulus package.  Specifically, we need to both oblige and support companies to invest in the skills of new and existing employees, for example via the uptake of accessible online training programmes.  All of the evidence shows that this will lead to greater productivity, higher wages, and greater job security as employers seek to retain the skilled workers in whom they have invested over many years.  </p><p>Ireland has one of the lowest rates of in-work training and upskilling in the EU.  It is estimated at only 5.5% compared with 17% in the UK, 20% in France, and as high as 33% in Denmark.  To take digital skills for example, despite our current status as a hub for multinational technology firms and the fact that nine out of ten jobs in the future will require a degree of digital expertise, more than half of our population lack basic digital skills and only 79% are able to use the Internet, which is one of the lowest levels in the EU.</p> <p>Digital literacy issues do not just have an economic consequence but a social and cultural impact as well.  Likewise, more than a third of workers in sectors such as financial services have not been provided with any training and development on technology according to the Financial Services Union working conditions survey of 2019.  In addition, Ireland currently spends well below its EU peers when it comes to investing in human capital and the innovative capacity of young people.  This is the real threat to our future competitiveness when it comes to attracting, sustaining and maintaining the high levels of foreign direct investment we all want to promote and maintain.  As part of the July stimulus, the Government should target schemes to immediately address the current digital skills shortage caused by years of chronic underinvestment and a lack of in-work training.</p> <p> We must also seek to develop new technological universities such as Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, in my constituency, in collaboration with the multinational corporations that locate here so that the new technological universities evolving throughout the country are delivering and instilling in young people the kind of skill sets our economic model and national industrial strategy will require.</p> <p> Another essential element of a reformed short-term working scheme that I hope can be funded through this enabling legislation must be the introduction of limitations on economic dismissals, in essence, redundancies, during the crisis.  A ban on lay-offs was introduced as early as March in Italy and Spain and later in France, the Netherlands and other EU states.  Such measures are needed to reassure workers in a period of strong anxiety while also limiting the opportunistic behaviour of some employers who have used or may use the crisis as an excuse to dismiss difficult workers.  We have already witnessed large-scale dismissals in the context of Debenhams and National Pen in my constituency, organisations which in my view have ruthlessly used the Covid-19 crisis as cover to cull workers without any meaningful consultation whatsoever.  Any reformed short-term working scheme must ensure that both workers and the public purse are protected.  For example, under the Dutch scheme to which I referred earlier, if an employer dismisses a worker on economic grounds, the employer must pay back 100% of the compensation that it received.  In addition, agreement with trade unions and worker representatives must be reached before any large-scale lay-offs of 20 or more employees.</p> <p> On several occasions in recent weeks I asked the Minister for Finance if he would consider such a clawback mechanism as part of the wage subsidy scheme, to which he replied that he had no plans to do so.  I am interested in the Minister's view on this issue and if the Department of Finance has revised its thinking on this since the Minister for Finance replied to me and if this forms part of the Government's thinking on the July stimulus package.  Likewise, I have repeatedly made the case that social and environmental conditionality should be attached to the wage subsidy scheme and other initiatives that may be undertaken by the Government and that there also needs to be a comprehensive audit of companies receiving the scheme to ensure they have met the stated criteria.  On the latter point, I am pleased that the Minister has been reasonably vocal in recent weeks on a compliance programme as part of the operation of the wage subsidy scheme.  I am interested in an update on this if it is to hand.</p> <p> Regarding the question of conditionality, governments in other EU countries such as Denmark and France, and Scotland refused to grant public aid such as wage subsidy schemes to businesses registered in tax havens.  Programmes under the SURE scheme will attract considerable funding from the State via the Union.  The states I referred to are wisely making use of aid conditionality as an incentive for the enforcement of their own fiscal rules and EU fiscal rules, and so should we, in particular in light of tomorrow's Apple tax ruling and the international crackdown on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by some multinational corporations.  Does the Department have plans to attach any kind of conditionality at all, for example, to a reformed short-time working scheme or any of the other programmes that will be brought forward as a result of the passage of this legislation and the funding of other such programmes that I expect to be announced in the coming days?</p> <p> That is an important point.  Many other countries across Europe have attached that kind of conditionality and it seems that we are entirely uninterested in doing that.  It is reasonable that we use the opportunities presented to us now to paint a picture of a better future and to attach conditions to massive State investment in the interests of achieving some positive public policy gains.  Many significant opportunities will arise for this country from the passage of the legislation and we need to use them to paint a picture of a better future and reshape our future to make sure that people are paid reasonable wages, that their rights in the workplace are respected and that the social and environmental objectives we have, which I hope we share across this Chamber, are achieved and that the post-pandemic Ireland of the future looks better than the Ireland of the recent past.</p></speech>

The Social Democrats will not oppose the Bill.  We are considering it in the most extraordinary of circumstances, at a time the economic shock from the crisis is being felt not only by Ireland or a small handful of other countries but by every nation around the world.  Covid-19 has ushered in an unprecedented time of solidarity and that is a welcome by-product.  That solidarity, which is a very welcome development, is unprecedented in European economic history.  It is a very much changed environment and changed attitude since 2008 and it has resulted in the issuance of collective debt.</p>  <p>  This is a time for new ideas and new ways forward and that is very much welcome.  I hope the Government will be part of that new way of thinking and new approaches because we desperately need them to work our way back to recovery.  It cannot be a case of going back to the old ways of doing things; we must take a new approach to ensuring that we have a vibrant economy but also a fair and vibrant society.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the use of two instruments of the Eurogroup financial package, which were agreed on 9 April &ndash; the SURE fund of &euro;100 billion and the EIB guarantee fund of &euro;200 billion.  The legislation does not provide for the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, the third arm of the Eurogroup package.  This fund is worth &euro;240 billion, just under half of the total Eurogroup package.  It is a bailout fund, established in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, which is now being deployed as a pandemic credit line to help finance health costs incurred in fighting Covid-19.  The ESM is not mentioned in this Bill or in any of the supporting documents shared with Members.  The Minister has stated that the Government has no intention at present to borrow under the ESM because we can borrow reliably from the international markets at real rates that are more favourable than the ESM.  This is good and shows Ireland's favourable standing and relative economic health.  If the circumstances arise whereby Ireland no longer has easy access to low-interest rate funds on the market and needs to avail of the ESM, do further provisions needs to be made in legislation to allow the country to draw down these funds?  Could the Minister of State confirm, therefore, that the European Stability Mechanism Acts of 2012 and 2014 make sufficient provision for access to the ESM in this scenario and that access can be guaranteed by issuing a request for assistance from the Government, which does not require further legislation?</p>  <p>  I wish to move on to our domestic circumstances.  On Friday next, the European Council will meet to discuss the economic response to the pandemic and the &euro;750 billion recovery package, which is in addition to the &euro;540 billion package this legislation is dealing with.</p> <p>There has been a good deal of discussion on this already and the compromise position contains several important changes to the original proposal.  Of particular importance for Ireland is a Brexit reserve fund of &euro;5 billion which will be set aside primarily for the benefit of Belgium and Ireland.  This is a success on Ireland's part and very prudent given the damage a no-deal Brexit may cause to our economic recovery.  However this benefit also raises an important point about the approach that the recovery plan should take.  Just as our domestic circumstances surrounding Brexit have been taken into account, Ireland should by the same measure and in solidarity, push for the domestic circumstances of other member states to be taken into account in their recovery plans.<br/><br/>The last decade showed that a one-size-fits-all form of recovery and resilience does not make sense for a diverse collection of economies like the EU.  We should not make that mistake again.  The President of the European Council has proposed that the funds will be linked to stronger enforcement of the rule of law.  This provision has provoked a strong reaction from some member states, including Ireland, which are considered to be acting outside the European law.  I urge the Minister and the Government to support this provision.  Given Ireland's commitment to the rule of law and human rights generally, we should be calling for their inclusion in the final package.<br/><br/>In planning for the overall EU fiscal response, there is a prudent discussion to be had about the value of balancing grant aid and debt-based lending.  There has been a certain amount of discussion about this at European level and whatever happens in that regard will feed into the domestic situation also.  The group SME Recovery spoke recently to the Special Committee on the Covid-19 Response, making several good points on the importance of grant-based lending for small business.  The current supports in Ireland are based primarily on debt-based lending whereas other European countries have introduced more grant supports, which in turn encourages take-up.<br/><br/>Many SMEs in Ireland are simply not in a position to take on further debt, meaning an over-reliance on debt-based lending to business will not be appropriate.  It is really important to get this balance right, and not just domestically - we need to be arguing for that at European level as well.  I support and commend what the previous Government did in its rapid fiscal response to this crisis but many of the support schemes have been adapted from plans originally drawn up for a hard Brexit scenario.  At this point, given the crisis we are facing at the moment, those schemes are not fit for purpose.  We need to focus on ensuring the schemes are adapted for the current crisis and provide sufficient grant support to SMEs, which are so vital to our domestic economy and for job creation and retention.<br/><br/>It was interesting to note that the former Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, last week urged deeper spending to combat the fiscal crisis that is looming.  He said that there &quot;should be no loss of nerve in fully deploying the financial resources of the State and its borrowing capacity&quot; and that it &quot;would be a very big mistake to use the previous crisis as a model for how the public finances should be managed,&quot;.  We ignore that advice at our peril.  Professor Honohan made the point that if governments attempt to limit expenditure once the immediate danger has passed, it will simply exacerbate the economic slump.  We have the ability now, from EU support as well as borrowing on the private markets, to borrow substantial amounts of money on a long-term basis at rates that are effectively close to zero.  This has enormous potential.  It has the potential to reposition our economy significantly.<br/><br/>We will only attract investment if we have a strong stimulus and long-term growth plan.  I was very concerned when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, spoke a number of months ago about the need to return to a balanced budget in the medium term.  That is not the kind of thinking that is required at the moment.  The then Taoiseach spoke about borrowing leading to nervousness on the part of investors, and that has no basis either.  Given the current economic circumstances, which are very favourable and benign, it makes no sense whatsoever not to borrow in significant amounts and invest in our economy.  Ensuring growth in our economy is the one sure way to attract foreign direct investment or domestic investment.  The aim has to be significant growth over the coming years.<br/><br/>Any attempt at retrenchment or any mention of austerity will simply weaken our standing and turn off investors.  We should know at this point that austerity measures stunt growth.  Ireland raised &euro;1.5 billion in debt last Thursday.  That comprised three separate issuances with terms of seven, ten and 30 years.The 30-year debt, which was raised at 0.6%, was oversubscribed by nearly three times.  This is a significant demand for Irish debt of long duration at low yields.  We should be taking full advantage of this by borrowing extensively and spending the capital now to invest in our long-term growth and prosperity.  A few weeks ago, Austria raised &euro;2 billion in a bond auction with a maturity of 100 years and that was priced below 1%.  That auction was more than ten times oversubscribed.  We should be learning from that and from what a number of our EU counterparts are doing.  We should avail of the wonderful opportunities presented to us now to invest significantly in our economy.<br/><br/>The Covid-19 committee heard from the NTMA that the State is in a very strong position to meet its borrowing requirements.  It said that most important fundamentals for investors in deciding whether to lend to Ireland and on what terms have not changed and are the country's growth potential and its fiscal policy over the long term.  All these factors point to the same conclusion.  Given the low interest rates available on Ireland&rsquo;s debt, the Government should borrow extensively and spend deeply to provide support for the economy at this time.  Deputy Nash referred to the book review done by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I would like to recommend to the Minister, and indeed to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, another book that would be well worth their while reading.  It is quite a short book called <i>Angrynomics </i>and it is by two Irishmen, Mr. Eric Lonergan and Mr. Mark Blyth.  It talks about establishing a national wealth fund.  This idea has also been promoted by a number of very respected economic commentators, including Dr. Aidan Regan in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>just last week.The idea is to establish a national wealth fund supported by the issuance of Government debt.</p> <p>The goal of the fund would be to make long-term strategic investments, which would provide a return either to the State or to the public directly.  The proposal is based on the economic theory that when the rate of interest grows faster than the economic growth rate the rich get richer and wealth inequality grows.  This is because people who are lucky enough to receive an inheritance will be able to invest their assets and see them grow in value over time, while those without an inheritance will work for years to save a lump sum, which will most likely be put forward as a deposit on an overpriced house.  They will continue to work and wait more than 30 years to pay off the mortgage debt to own that asset.</p> <p> A fair and functioning market economy should lead to a wider distribution of wealth but the reality we see is that wealth inequality and inherited wealth put the majority of our population lifetimes behind those who are born into economic privilege.  Creating a national wealth fund could combat growing wealth inequalities by having the State invest assets on behalf of Irish society and then distributing the capital returns to citizens.  There is no better time to create this national wealth fund than right now.  The Government has the ability now to issue long-term bonds at what is effectively a rate of 0%.  We saw that the debt issued last week was oversubscribed.  Even if the compound interest was only 5%, the State could repay debt issued to create the fund in less than 15 years.  At that point, the State would own all of the assets it had invested in and all capital returns would go back to Irish society.  Every citizen would have a share of the national wealth, meaning everyone would effectively have an inheritance to provide seed capital funding for a business or a house deposit, thereby being set up for future careers and prosperity.  Now is the time to take a new approach to create a fairer and more equal society.  It is within reach of the Government and would dramatically improve the livelihoods of Irish people and the long-term growth of our economy.</p> <p> It is also very important that in rebuilding our economy, we ensure the regrowth and recovery are jobs rich but also are worker centred.  There are measures beyond strict spending and taxation that the Government must take to improve our economy and public finances.  We need to focus on a worker-centred recovery in order that as people return to work and the economy reopens, people's living standards and work-life balance are also improved.  A right to collective bargaining and greater employee led decision making will not only ensure that workers have better conditions but will also lead to greater productivity and greater competitiveness in the economy.  We need to ensure that workers have the right to flexible working conditions, especially in the aftermath of Covid-19 when working from home has become the norm for so many.  Initiatives such as flexitime, a four-day working week and options to work from home on a long-term basis could also go a long way to improving working conditions.  Equally important is the right to switch off and enshrining this in legislation.</p> <p> Younger people in Ireland undoubtedly have taken the brunt of this crisis and it is very important to prioritise their needs.  People in their late 20s and 30s are experiencing a second deep recession.  They paid a significant price at a very important stage at the start of their adulthood and the start of their careers in the last recession.  They are now knocked back again.  We know from the figures that it is the younger generation who have paid the highest price in this crisis.  They must be the priority in our recovery.</p> <p> The provision of public services must be seen as a major element of any recovery and any stimulus package.  Investment in the public sector and good quality public services not only ensures that people's rights to a decent standard of living are upheld but we also must recognise that the State is a major employer and a major purchaser of services, which in turn can create a huge stimulus for the private sector.  Ensuring people have access on a universal basis to public services without cost at the point of use means we take a lot of heat out of wage demands and ensure a greater level of competitiveness throughout the economy.</p> <p> There are many other things we need to do in addition to the stimulus package but we must take the broader view.  The recovery must be person centred and I hope the Minister of State will take on board many of the proposals made this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-14a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400040#RR00200"><p>I am not sure whether my colleagues are coming in to share the time but if they do I will share it.  We do not oppose the legislation.  I welcome the fact that apparently, some lessons were at least partially learned from the follies of the response of the European Union, its member states and here in Ireland to the crisis in 2008 and the austerity that followed it.  We need not return to austerity but instead to inject money into maintaining jobs, investing in services and adopting Keynesian policies rather than fiscal austerity policies.  This is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  The two specific mechanisms or schemes we are talking about include the EU's SURE scheme, focused on supporting schemes to keep people in work, which is absolutely right and it is absolutely critical that we do so.  I understand there is also some expenditure on occupational health and the pan-European guarantee fund to support and finance small and medium enterprises primarily, although notably it also refers to middle and large scale companies.  This may be justified but I will make a few points about how we do have to distinguish in our supports between the small enterprises that really need the help and big enterprises.  We should not subsidise highly profitable entities and they should have to pay us back.  We need to distinguish between those that are very small and facing an existential threat to their survival, which should not have strings attached to that support and should get all of the support we can give to sustain their existence through this difficult period, and large companies and corporations that can often benefit from these schemes but do not need them and perhaps do not recognise their obligations to everybody else in terms of paying back that support.  In this regard, I cannot help but comment on the day that is in it.</p> <p>Much of this is still about borrowing money.  I support borrowing money and injecting it into the economy.  Interest rates are low and the various schemes are about giving low interest finance to states and to business, to schemes to keep people in work or, indeed, as the Government is also intending to do, to just borrow on the markets.</p> <p> However, we should put some provisos on the debt financing of stimulus.  I cannot help commenting on the irony of where we are.  It is not so long ago that the same EU and the Governments that included the two major parties in this country, who are now promoting this more Keynesian approach, were telling us that we had to stay with a fiscal austerity model, that one could not debt finance one's way out of a crisis, it was dangerous to do it and that it would produce an unsustainable debt burden and put us in a very vulnerable position.  Now it appears all that caution and prudence have gone out the window and it is a case of borrow, borrow, borrow.  Members should not misunderstand me.  I disagreed with the fiscal austerity model when it was proposed and some of us warned that the time was not far away when people would realise the folly of the fiscal treaty and that it would be necessary to borrow and break through the fiscal treaty parameters to deal with an economic crisis such as the one we faced.  Here we are, and suddenly all the rules can be broken.  It is difficult not to comment on the irony of that.</p> <p> However, here we are and lessons seem to have been learned.  Ironically, I now find myself in the "let us be a little prudent" camp.  Debt financing cannot go on forever.  One eventually has to pay the piper.  Somebody is always making money when one borrows money.  It is rich people who are making money.  It is the people with inherited wealth and the vast accumulations of profit, and who are looking for somewhere to sustain and increase the value of that, who are lending us the money and want to be repaid.  There is an alternative to that, and the &euro;18 billion that the EU will decide on tomorrow brings that into sharp relief.  We would not need to borrow the vast amounts of money we are about to borrow, or are in the process of borrowing, if we took the &euro;13 billion plus interest from Apple.  We would not incur this debt burden and all the interest.</p> <p> It is worth saying that because it is those accumulations of wealth and capital that we are borrowing from at interest.  It might not be Apple directly but wherever it puts its money, such as some wealth asset management outfit which lends it to governments such as ours or to the European Union and is then paid interest on it.  It is constantly accumulating its wealth.  We could, and I believe we should, short-circuit that process somewhat by just taking back the tax money it owes us.  We would not have to borrow so much, and it would transform our situation.  It is important to say that, particularly because the Government, after tomorrow, is very likely to be faced with a decision on whether it will appeal that judgment.  One cannot separate the considerations the Government has in that regard and the discussion we are having now because it has a direct bearing in terms of how much we have to borrow.  I say we should borrow less and make the big corporations pay their fair share of taxes.  We could still fund the stimulus that we absolutely must have.</p> <p> The other thing I wish to say, and there is some acknowledgement of it in these two schemes, is something we must write large.  Much of the talk on stimulus, understandably and correctly, is focused on private business, SMEs and so forth.  I agree with that.  They are on the floor, they need help and they should get that support, so Members should not misunderstand what I am saying.  However, there appears to be a complete failure most of the time to acknowledge that the public sector is part of the plan to get us out of this crisis, or it should be.  Investment in that area is critical.  Often the two are set against each other.  At the most obvious level, we must recognise that this is true.  What we learned during Covid-19 is that if our health service is not able to cope or is even threatened with the situation of not being able to cope with the health needs of our society, the entire economy, or most of it, shuts down.  That is not an equation that most people would have accepted up to now.  There was the attitude that too much money was going into the public sector and that what we needed to do was support the entrepreneur, as if the two were at odds with each other.  What we have learned, and I hope we never forget it, is that the private sector effectively shuts down if our health service is not able to cope.  We had better learn the lesson going forward - God, I hate that expression - because this could have an immediate impact on everything we are discussing here.  All the stimulus in the world of small enterprise will be meaningless if our health service is overrun in the autumn because of a second wave and the economy has to be shut down again.  It will all be pointless, and this discussion will be rendered meaningless.</p> <p> What we know, as we learned from repeated testimony at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, and what I hope we do not forget in the rush and understandable desperation to get the economy back up and running, is that our public health service is running at such critically low levels of capacity that it would not take much for that system to be overrun.  You will be aware of the famous graph, a Cheann Comhairle.  We have to raise the capacity part of that graph very significantly.  It is not just about the level of infection, but the level of infection related to the capacity of the health service to deal with it.  Critically in that regard, while some of it is capital capacity, such as building the physical infrastructure and having the ventilators, most of it is staff.  We must urgently recruit staff to the health service to increase ICU and bed capacity, to put staff capacity levels into the nursing home sector, recruit general practitioners and so forth to provide the cradle to the grave healthcare that is able to cope with the type of situation we are in at present.  If we not do that as a matter of urgency, all this stimulus will be irrelevant if there is a second wave.</p> <p> In that focus on the role of the public sector in sustaining the wider economy, one could make the same point about education.  If we have to shut down the schools and the universities again, all of this will be irrelevant.  If childcare has to shut down again, this will be irrelevant because people will be at home minding the children and unable to get out to work.  What if we have to shut down public transport?  As the Government and, indeed, the EU are considering what they are going to do with these funds, they must understand that a huge part of the stimulus programme must be a massive increase in investment in the capacity of key public services and infrastructure to deal with the crises we are facing now and in the foreseeable future.  I sincerely hope that lesson is learned.</p></speech>
