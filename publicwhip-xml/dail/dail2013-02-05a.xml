He has also said in the past that the inspection system agreed with the Commission will meet the standards required in the European Court of Justice ruling.  If it is the case that the Minister has on our behalf agreed a system with the Commission on foot of that ruling, he should then publish the plan to allow people on the ground understand how the inspection scheme is to be implemented.  That being the case, would the Minister not retrospectively extend the deadline for registration?  Why has the plan not been published?</p></speech>

Many people in the Opposition cost citizens &euro;45 in additional expenditure because they gave them very bad advice.  We have carried out a major campaign to alert people to the fact Ireland has a European Court of Justice ruling against it.  It is important to have good quality groundwater and an important part of the judgment is that people register.  Without having a database, I would say the voluntary response from people has been magnificent and I thank them for it.</p></speech>

It must be the case that in announcing his grand scheme the Minister is sufficiently satisfied the grant amounts will be sufficient to meet the demands of the inspection regime.  I accept the Minister has agreed an inspection regime with the EU and the Commission on foot of the ruling.  I accept what he stated with regard to those who have registered, whether for &euro;5 or for &euro;50, but the Minister has agreed something in Europe and will not tell the public what it is.  Why did we have to wait until now in the first instance and how much longer must we wait?</p></speech>

Inspections will not take place for several months.  The plan will be published in the coming weeks and I have no difficulty agreeing this with the Deputy.  It has been the subject of much detailed investigation with the Commission by the EPA and it was forwarded to the Department in recent days.  It will be a national risk-based inspection plan and local authorities will be responsible for carrying out the inspections in their functional areas.  Based on the number of people inspected, which will be a low enough percentage of those registered, people have nothing to fear; all they must do is ensure the system they have, under the conditions in which it was installed, is working.</p></speech>

Preparing the necessary primary legislation, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is now under way and a priority for the Department.  I intend to bring proposals to Government in this regard in the coming weeks.  It is my intention that the Bill will be published and enacted in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>  I previously announced the appointment of Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor, formerly chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as chairman of the Pyrite Resolution Board, the establishment of which was also a recommendation of the pyrite panel.  I am also appointing to the board Paul Forde, joint managing director of DBFL Consulting Engineers; Sean Balfe, a structural engineer with the National Standards Authority of Ireland; and Caroline Gill, a former Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland and deputy Financial Services Ombudsman.  I will also appoint a representative of the entity being established by the construction sector to undertake a remediation programme as the final member of the board.  The board will thus have membership with the particular range of skills and experience necessary to oversee the successful operation of the remediation scheme and to ensure the public interest, and the interest of the affected homeowners, is well served.  Given the focussed nature of its particular role, I do not propose to include a representative from the Pyrite Action Group on the board.  I am, however, confident the board will have the requisite mix of skills and experience, including in regard to consumer protection, to ensure an efficient and effective remediation process is delivered to all affected homeowners.</p></reply>

Only the quarry and insurance industries are being levied.  Part of the recommendation was to include the building industry.  Why is it not included with regard to the levies?  It is important that we move quickly because many people are stuck in the situations in which they find themselves.</p><p>Given what the Minister has said, we have agreement from the banks to a &euro;50 million fund.  Surely we can get that fund in place and work with the residents while we are sorting out the necessary legislative issues.  I am sure that can be done.  It is disappointing that we do not have a balance on that committee.  I would like to have seen someone representing consumers, not just skilled people and those who are part of the industry.  It is disappointing that we do not have a counterbalance in that regard.</p></speech>

I would have expected that he would be supportive of the speed with which we are acting and getting money from those who are culpable in this regard - namely, the quarrying and construction industries and the insurance sector.  Homeowners' interests will be represented with great effect by Ms Caroline Gill, who is a former insurance ombudsman.  She has a lot of consumer experience and has also been a member of the directorate of consumer affairs.</p><p>  Contrary to what the Deputy has said, I will be proceeding as speedily as possible with the necessary legislation.  For the first time, my Department will be acting to try to help homeowners who have been affected, which is what this is all about.  In addition, the Department will be monitoring the industry and those who are culpable regarding the type of product material that was supplied in this instance, which has contributed to the homeowners' problems, as well as the financial institutions that will be making the necessary financial response to this matter.  Although it is not directly responsible on behalf of the taxpayer, the State will be facilitating this process.</p></speech>

The new service would be provided using a new housing assistance payment or HAP.</p><p>  It is envisaged that, unlike rent supplement, HAP would be paid on the tenant's behalf directly to the landlord within a stronger regulatory framework, with rental contribution from tenants set by reference to the differential rent for the local authority area.  Some of the specific objectives of HAP included the following: to give local authorities greater flexibility to provide assistance to those in need of social housing support; facilitate removal of barriers to return to work for rent supplement recipients under a progressive graduated system; facilitate better regulation of the private rented sector, leading to improved standards of accommodation, better enforcement of levels of registration with the PRTB, and strengthened processes for ensuring tax compliance by landlords; and secure better value for money for the Exchequer in ensuring that rental payments are conditional on adherence to improved standards.  The County and City Managers Association, which is represented on the project steering group, provides ongoing advice on the resources required by housing authorities to implement the new housing assistance payment.  This input will continue as the detail of the scheme is developed this year.</p><p>  It is intended that the scheme will be piloted by a number of housing authorities in the second half of this year, subject to the necessary housing and social welfare legislative provisions being in place including in regard to facilitating deduction of rents at source from welfare payments.  After the pilot phase is complete, the scheme will be implemented generally, commencing in 2014.</p></reply>

In this regard I fully acept that there are property traps within the rent assistance scheme.  However, I note this is the single most prominent issue that arises in my interactions with individuals and I am sure it is the same with most Deputies, particularly in big urban areas.  The housing list issue is not universally as bad nationwide as it is, for example, in Dublin, Kildare, Galway or Cork, which are really serious black spots.  However, when the new scheme is being piloted, I ask that this take place in areas in which there is such a profile to enable the Department to ascertain what are the flaws in the system.  For example, it takes months to process the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, in locations such as Kildare but yet it is very difficult to get landlords to come forward with their properties and-----</p></speech>

One measure must come from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to introduce housing assistance payment, HAP, and the other must come from the Department of Social Protection with particular regard to deductions at source.  As for the pilot areas, my Department is considering what would be appropriate pilot areas at present.  I take Deputy Murphy's point that the Department should ensure it conducts its pilot schemes in areas in which genuine difficulties exist in order that we establish what are the problems and can learn from the pilots before implementing the full scheme.  On her point regarding the lack of details, until the legislation is available and until the work with the County and City Managers Association has been done, this is as much detail as is available.  However, more detail will be forthcoming as the year goes on and I will be happy to share it with Deputy Catherine Murphy and other Members of the House.  On resources, deduction at source will be a big issue in terms of making it easier for the local authorities but obviously there also are other resource issues.</p></speech>

Moreover, it is intended that all or some of those who currently are engaged in processing the rental assistance fund will be transferred to the local authorities?  The kind of pressures that people are under in one local authority with which I am familiar is evident to me and there certainly will be a resourcing issue if this initiative is to be dealt with in a manner that produces the kind of results I believe everyone seeks.</p></speech>

However, it is intended that it will replace the RAS system because the housing assistance payment will be a similar way of paying, with a differential rent-type way for the tenants to pay.  In effect, it will duplicate the RAS system and will take over from it.  On the question regarding staffing, again this issue is under discussion.  I acknowledge the local authorities will be under pressure but issues with regard to staffing have not yet been finalised.</p></speech>

The programme was launched in 25 urban areas in February 2001.  It was extended to 20 provincial towns in February 2002.  Ballyfermot was added in 2006 and in late 2009, following an independent review of the findings from the 2006 census returns, five new areas were brought into the programme, namely, Ballina, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Mullingar and Rathkeale.  This brings the number of designated RAPID areas to 51.</p><p>  RAPID seeks to bring about significant improvements in the lives of the residents in RAPID areas and does so in three main ways, namely, giving, where possible, priority access to available resources to RAPID communities, improving the delivery of public services through integration and co-ordination and improving the opportunities for communities to participate in the strategic improvement of their areas.</p><p>I have not made any changes to the RAPID programme since coming to office.  My Department officials last met the RAPID chairs and co-ordinators at a conference in February 2012 and the national monitoring committee has not met in the past two years.  As part of my continuing engagement with both the local development and local government sectors, I have met many of the chairs and co-ordinators at different times and in various forums.</p><p> I will circulate a table indicating the funding provided for the RAPID programme for the years from 2004 to 2012.  An indicative allocation of more than &euro;2 million will be made available for RAPID in 2013 and it will be principally used to meet my Department's existing contractual commitments on RAPID projects throughout the country.  These are mainly sports capital top-ups and CCTV systems, jointly funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality respectively.</p></reply>

The Deputy was associated with leverage schemes and we had to seize the leverage that money could provide with regard to projects like traffic calming, graffiti removal and provision of play groups.  That came from other Departments because of existing financial commitments.  Social inclusion measures will continue to play a major role and I will ensure this is the case with local authorities when RAPID and other agencies are more closely aligned with the local government sector.</p></speech>

This time last year, he promised the Bill would be ready before the summer.  The summer came and went and we did not see it.  He then published a roadmap and promised the legislation, which is in the programme for Government, would be ready by Christmas.  This Bill was a Fine Gael priority in opposition and is also a priority for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  The effects of climate change are no longer disputed.  It had a serious impact on farm incomes last year when weather conditions caused farm incomes in some areas to fall by up to 20%.</p><p>  Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Council and the Minister noted that we must meet our EU commitments on climate change.  Last Thursday, I published a climate change Bill very similar to one to which the Minister put his name previously.  The Government repeatedly challenges the Opposition to produce solutions.  Sinn F&eacute;in has produced a solution to this issue and we ask the Minister to examine it.  Will the legislation the Minister proposes to introduce include legally binding five year targets?  Will it provide for carbon budgets to ensure the Government does not kick the can down the road, as previous Governments did, and leave a future Government to face a carbon cliff at some point?  I do not want the Minister to continue this practice of putting off dealing with climate change.  Will the legislation provide for clear, science based targets for 2050?  Will an independent advisory commission be established to advise the Minister and Taoiseach on these matters?  Will the legislation provide for accountability to the D&aacute;il?  Those are the questions I want the Minister to answer. </p></speech>

The Deputy failed to refer to his document, which is the outcome of a process that involves the various stakeholders drawing up the necessary policy options and doing an analysis of how Ireland will achieve mitigation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a sectoral basis against a background of economic difficulty.  There are challenges which legislation alone will not solve.  People in various Ministries and sectors must produce solutions to ensure we meet the legally binding targets set out in EU legislation.  We must comply with certain targets provided for in legislation as failure to do so would result in the European Commission bringing a case against Ireland for infringements to the European Court of Justice.  Some of Deputy Stanley's ideas will feature among the proposals being put to government.  However, I must secure the agreement of the Cabinet before I can inform the House.</p></speech>

I am pleased he will introduce legislation relatively soon.  Sinn F&eacute;in is putting him under pressure on this issue because we believe it is important.  Notwithstanding that the country is in economic difficulty, as the Minister noted, this issue is affecting incomes, particularly farm incomes.</p><p>Climate change is having a negative effect on their sector.  Will there be an independent advisory commission and is the target being set for 2050 80% or, as with other EU countries, between 80% and 95%?</p></speech>

If we are out of step with them and fall behind the leaders, it might damage our competitiveness.  We are working in step with our EU partners to comply with targets to which we are legally bound.</p><p>  The outline heads of the low carbon Bill will be brought to the Government next week.  I will then be in a position to inform the House of its precise details.  Many of the ideas mentioned in the course of Deputy Stanley's contribution - I am sure I will hear them from Deputy Catherine Murphy on Friday - will form a major part of any proposal tabled by the Government.  I acknowledge the contribution made in the previous D&aacute;il by the Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, which did a significant amount of research on this matter.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has engaged with stakeholders and put together policy analyses and options for various Departments.  Hopefully, all of this work will feed into a broad consensus in the House on where we need to be in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions for our society and economic development.</p></speech>

The local authorities and the Housing Agency have been working systematically with NAMA to determine if there is a social housing demand for properties identified as potentially suitable for social housing, including the need for accommodation for those who are homeless.  Of that 3,949, some 981 units have been identified as unsuitable by housing authorities.  A further 652 have been withdrawn, usually by property owners as circumstances change.  For example, units are sold or leased privately and, therefore, are no longer available.</p><p>  Demand or suitability has been confirmed by housing authorities for some 670 units that are at various stages of negotiation.  Efforts are being made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing.  It will continue to be my Department's objective in 2013 to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available.</p><p>  By the end of 2012, some 203 units had been sourced through NAMA, 179 of which were delivered for social housing purposes.  These units were delivered through a variety of funding mechanisms by local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, as follows: 65 through direct leasing arrangements; 57 purchased directly by local authorities; and 57 purchased by AHBs using funding under the capital assistance scheme.</p><p>  While progress has been made to date in terms of delivering units for social housing purposes, it has not been achieved at the rate originally envisaged.  In the main, this is due to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints.  I hope that the establishment by NAMA of a special purpose vehicle in 2012 to facilitate the leasing of units will accelerate delivery in 2013.</p></reply>

The delivery in terms of social housing has been disappointing, to say the least.  Some 203 units have been delivered overall.  In 2011, it was claimed that almost 2,000 units had been identified, but these were whittled down to a small number.  Another claim of 3,879 identified units has also been whittled down because some of those units have been sold.</p><p>  More than 100,000 people are on the housing waiting list.  Families included, we are discussing a couple of hundred thousand people.  This disaster is building.  More and more people are attending our clinics about housing issues.</p></speech>

The mechanism might be complicated.</p><p>It might have a lot of legalities attached to it.  I accept the Minister has set up the special purpose vehicle to deal with the issue.  However, we need action.  We must get the mechanism up and running, identify properties, secure agreement and convert them into social housing or bring them under the remit of voluntary housing groups.  The situation is urgent.</p></speech>

As he accepted, that is largely due to a couple of factors on which we have been working hard.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, and I met with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, on a number of occasions last year.</p><p>  The special purpose vehicle is important because it involves gathering units into it which then can be passed on through the voluntary housing sector or the local authority sector.  There was a problem with leasing, namely, some difficulties on agreeing leases with voluntary housing bodies.  They have now reached an agreement with NAMA on an appropriate lease that appears to satisfy everybody.  That will speed up matters as well.</p><p>  We got a specific allocation in the budget, to which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, referred, to ensure that we would have funding this year.  To give some indication of figures, while we have more than 200 over the line, between 600 and 700 are being processed.  I hope we will have the majority of those through this year.</p><p>  I was in Scotch Hall in Drogheda last Thursday and met with residents who had moved into some of the units.  The experience has been positive.  When the various bodies involved with NAMA &ndash; owners and receivers &ndash; realise that this can be a positive development, and where we have local authorities and voluntary housing bodies working with us, I am confident that we will see an acceleration.  I am driving the process.  I wish to ensure that we get those units because as the Deputy said, many people are waiting for social housing.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that we have not made more progress.  I accept there are problems in terms of the legalities and I hope the special purpose vehicle will address most such issues.  I am interested in learning more about what is entailed in the leasing agreement.  To date, leasing agreements are being entered into for a period of 20 years to 25 years with voluntary housing groups and then there is a possibility that the properties would return to the owners.  That is unacceptable.  They should belong to the State.  NAMA is a State company and such units should be in State control.  I cannot envisage any circumstances in which they should return to a developer in NAMA.</p></speech>

As Deputy Ellis indicated, NAMA is a State company which means it is owned by the citizens of the State.  The problem is that we have taken on the liability but now NAMA seems to be in hock to the developers, in the sense that it is leasing from them.</p><p>  I have a suggestion that could be examined.  We have estates full of empty houses.  The Minister of State is familiar with Gleann Alainn and other estates in County Laois.  In some estates only a few houses are occupied and there are dozens of empty houses.  Could the Minister of State examine the possibility, through NAMA or the Department, that where bonds have not been paid or developers have absconded that houses could be secured in lieu of a bond?  If, for example, there were 30 empty houses, could ten of them be secured in lieu of the bond in order that the estate could be finished?  The local authority would get ten houses and the State would receive a dividend.  The State is taking all the risk.  Joe and Mary Taxpayer are taking all the risk.  I accept that the Minister of State has said she is trying to accelerate the process.  I saw her on the television recently in Drogheda.  I welcome what took place there.  It is a good news story.  However, as Deputy Ellis stated, the problem is that the liability still rests with the taxpayer and the money is still filtering back to developers.  Where they have not finished estates, could some of the houses be taken in lieu?</p></speech>

We are examining all of them.  The difficulty with NAMA is that as part of its legislative remit it must return an economic dividend to the State.  At the same time they have a remit on a social dividend.</p></speech>

In fairness to NAMA, it has put several million euro into restoring and bringing these various units up to a level where they can be taken over.  We will continue to meet with NAMA.  We have not met with it yet in 2013 but we will do so.  We will ensure that we get the best possible dividend from it.  I understand there are still a number of empty properties throughout the State-----</p></speech>

Does she not recognise that the progress being made in this area is pathetic given that the census of population identified that there were 340,000 empty houses and having regard to the number of people on the housing waiting list, namely, some 100,000 families?  It is unbelievable that so little progress has been made when the housing waiting list is longer than it has ever been and we have more empty housing units that we ever had in the State.</p><p>  The Minister of State does not seem to acknowledge that NAMA and the number of empty houses identified are not a panacea because there is a shortage of housing in areas such as Dublin and the surrounding areas in of some of the bigger cities.  There must be some direct building of social housing if we are to make even a dent in addressing the record length of the housing list.  It is unacceptable.  Some families in my area have been on the housing waiting list for 13 years.  What proposals has the Government to reduce that waiting time to acceptable levels?  Nobody should have to wait longer than two or three years on a housing list.</p></speech>

Neither is it easy for NAMA to sell units all the time.  There are complications about selling units under many of these projects.  Many of these housing units or apartments would not necessarily suit social housing but many of them would.  Does the Minister of State agree that currently, large stocks of apartments or houses that are being sold off, be it by NAMA or by the banks, at less than what it would cost to build the units tomorrow, even if one were to get the land for nothing?   The notion that the State would sell property that could be used for social housing purposes in order to bring in some money, even though the units are being sold for less than it would cost to build them, does not make sense.  It is a good time for the State to use these assets to provide for its people and to direct them towards social housing provision rather than selling them off to bring in some funds.</p></speech>

Therefore, we have to get the best possible value for money.  While I would love to be do what Deputy Boyd Barrett has suggested and provide for the building of a large number of local authority houses - I hope we will do that again - we are not in a position to build them on the scale he mentioned.  We have to use the various mechanisms available to address the needs of people in whatever way we can, whether it be acquiring units from NAMA, which we are doing, leasing arrangements and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, with which the Deputies are familiar.  There is also the method I discussed with Deputy Catherine Murphy, on foot of her priority question, around transferring rent supplement to the local authorities whereby we would have all of the long-term housing requirements under the one system.  We are moving to reform measures in whatever way we can.  We are using whatever available mechanisms we have to house people.  When we restore the country to economic sovereignty and start to build up the economy again by all means we will return to much more substantial housing building than we have currently.  The Deputy who said that there is beginning to be a shortage of accommodation in the Dublin area is right.</p></speech>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p> It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.  A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and rate payers are, in the main, very familiar with and generally accepting of the operation and practice of the rating system.  Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p><p> A property-based tax such as rates has a distinct advantage over any tax based on profits or incomes as it is generally found to be easy to collect and difficult to evade.  A system having regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base.  Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.</p><p> I am conscious that local authorities have exercised restraint in setting their annual rates on valuation, ARV, in recent years and the average change of ARV across the 88 local authorities has shown a decrease - admittedly small -  in each of the last three years.  I have asked local authorities to continue to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013.</p></reply>

The Government is failing to acknowledge and take action on what is an enormous crisis facing small and medium enterprises, which the Government itself constantly says will be the driving force and the motor behind our economic recovery.  There are 4,000 family-owned businesses in this country employing around 90,000 which are on the line of survival now.  Those businesses need a break.  Commercial rates are a very serious burden on them.  Different countries have different rates models.  In Britain businesses are given rates holidays, while in Scotland a differential rates scheme has been introduced.  Spain and Italy have models which are bands-based and the rates are related to turnover and profitability and to the notion of giving support to small businesses in town centres and so forth.  I urge the Government to examine these models or to consider some model which distinguishes between small businesses and, for example, high street banks.  Is it not ridiculous that Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank or Tesco pays the same rate per square metre as a local butcher or florist?  That is ridiculous and something should be done about it in order to give a break to the small businesses that the Minister says he supports.</p></speech>

That is the basis by which commercial rates are levied by local authorities.  The question of a differential rate for small businesses as opposed to the larger entities that can better afford some of the commercial rate charges is something which I will keep under review.</p></speech>

Many of them say their biggest problems were rent and rates.  After that came car parks and overhead costs.  I have spoken to small business owners in my own constituency.  Even on the outskirts of the city they are paying the same rent per metre as the big stores in the centre of the city.</p><p>  I spoke to the owner of a small business where only two people are employed.  The business is paying &euro;8,000 in rent per year.  That may not sound like a large amount but it is a great deal of money to a small business with only two people trying to make a living out of it. </p><p>  The introduction of a differential rent scheme is a reasonable request for small businesses to make, considering what huge shopping centres can pay.  The big centres may also be experiencing difficulty but not to the same extent as small businesses, so many of which have been foreclosed.</p></speech>

Small businesses in a provincial town contribute a substantially higher proportion of their profit to their local authority than in a major town or city.  There is a case to be made and I am prepared to look at any opportunities, with the help of the Minister for Finance, to deal with these matters.  The Valuation (Amendment) Bill should give us the legislative basis to do that.  We may make representations to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to see what can be done to find the legislative basis to do so.</p><p>  Local authorities have shown flexibility, in so far as they can, to keep businesses open.  I have asked them to be as flexible as they possibly can.  Where a premises is not being used to the maximum I have asked them to show flexibility in reducing the rates burden, to tide us over the current difficult financial situation when the decline in trade and throughput means the disposable incomes of businesses are not what they were.</p><p>  The development levy scheme was recently announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  The development contribution scheme is now under review by the local authorities.  Where improvements need to be carried out in core strategy areas and town centres, local authority members now have a chance of reducing development contributions.  There is not the same level of activity in those town centres at present and some respite or reduction in the development levy scheme could generate much needed economic activity in the form of improvements to premises and employment opportunities in those areas.</p></speech>

We will park that failure.</p><p>  With regard to commercial rates, however, does the Minister know that commercial rents have come down in many provincial town by as much as 70% in the last four years?  Commercial rates have come down by, at most, 6%.  Does the Minister agree that the correlation between the two should be closer, in line with commercial reality?</p><p>  The Minister referred to the Valuation (Amendment) Bill.  Is it the Government's intention to overhaul the archaic commercial rates system as part of the programme for putting people first, devolving power to local authorities and changing the way they do business?</p><p>Is less more?  It can be in this instance.  The Minister must take some risks in this area to address the terrible conditions and atmosphere in the small business community.  The correlation should be a lot closer than 70% and 6%, and if the Minister agrees, it is incumbent on the Government to honour its commitment to overhaul the commercial rates system.  It is archaic, does not work and pays no dividends to those we represent.</p></speech>

My experience is very different.  Dublin city is undergoing revaluation at present and we were told that material change of circumstances would be taken into consideration.  Now, however, the Valuation Office is going on physical appearance only when, surely, turnover should be a factor.  There is no consistency in the way revaluation is done on properties and we do not know what the criteria are.  Currently rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation, which is based on the 2011 rent, by the multiplier that is set annually by Dublin City Council.  We were not even asked what our rent was in 2011.</p><p>  For the record, I have a caf&eacute; in Dublin 1 and following revaluation, the rates will be going up 37%.  I have a wine bar and restaurant in Dublin 1 and the council wants to increase the rates by 25%.  I have a wine bar and restaurant in Inchicore and there will be an increase of 42%, and on the North Circular Road, which is not exactly Grafton Street, the council is increasing the rates by 79%.  There is no logic to what the council is doing, and there are no transparent criteria or accountability.  How can the council work these figures out when it did not contact us beforehand?</p></speech>

If shops and businesses close down because the increase in rates has made them unviable, dereliction and job losses also become issues.  There must be a whole of Government response to this.  When the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill reaches Committee Stage, what input will the Minister have on nuance?  Will the Minister insist only on a secure funding source or will he take a broader look at a more nuanced approach to the changes that might be made?</p></speech>

One of the problems small businesses are having is that if a premises is vacant for a period and a business takes it over, the rates carry over.  The Minister often talks about the North and I am delighted he is starting to make comparisons between the two parts of Ireland.  In the North, the rates are related to the business itself.  Unpaid rates from a previous business do not carry over to a new start-up, although they do in this State.  That causes a lot of problems.  Also, it does not make sense to have the euro shop paying the same per square foot as Allied Irish Banks.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the Valuation (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill on a number of occasions but there are problems with it.  There has been an inordinate delay in bringing it before us.  Six months is the difference between a small business going under and surviving.</p><p>  My experience is that local authorities are not flexible.  They tell people they are mandated to implement the regulations as they stand and they have no flexibility at all.  In interventions I have made on behalf of small businesses in my area, the response is that the local authority knows things are difficult and that a business might not have the money but if it owes rent or money to the bank or suppliers, it should give the local authority that money and leave the others short.</p><p>That is what we are dealing with.  The matter will not be resolved unless there is an input from the Government.</p></speech>

The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is working its way through the Upper House and I hope it will be in the D&aacute;il in this session.</p><p>  There are many anomalies.  I am sure that all of us, from our direct experience with constituents, come across them on a regular basis.  I would be anxious to work, perhaps with the relevant Oireachtas committee, to see what changes could be made through making a submission to the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  It is too important for small businesses in the context of survival for many of them.</p><p>  The differentiation of the rate is a suggestion that should be examined.  There are many cases, of which Deputy Wallace and, I am sure, everybody in this House could give examples, where they are trying to rebalance the rate base rather than giving a fairer system.  Where there is an increase in the rates levied arising from a valuation, such as the ones mentioned, that is done for the purpose of giving a break somewhere else.  That is not always apparent and it depends on the criteria and the factors that are taken into account, which I will not go into today.</p></speech>

Maybe Deputy Wallace is not aware of that.  The hotel sector is a significant employer as well.</p><p>  The point Deputy Wallace makes, with which I agree, is that there is a significant problem here.  The Valuation Office is too slow to carry out revaluations, the appeals system is not satisfactory and the basis on which commercial rates are levied needs to be looked at.  There are a number of issues.</p><p>  Deputy Halligan and Members from Limerick and Tipperary will have an interest in the following.  Limerick is a good example of where efficiencies have been generated already arising from the merger.  There is a 5% reduction in its commercial rate in 2013.

In introducing the Act, the Government has been keen to ensure that equity is seen to be preserved and that all sectors of society are required to make a fair and equitable local property tax contribution.  In that regard, the relationship between the value of a residential property and the amount of the local property tax liability is important, as is liability for certain categories of social housing.</p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 sets out the position concerning residential properties and liability for the local property tax.  Under the Act local authorities and approved housing bodies are, in general, liable for residential properties under their ownership.  The existing arrangements for determining local authority rents are currently under review, under the relevant provisions of Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, in terms of providing for new rent schemes in 2014, and I anticipate that these new schemes will provide for an appropriate contribution to be made by tenants of liable social housing properties.</p><p>  Section 7 of the Act provides that owners of residential properties which are charities or which are bodies established by statute are not liable for the tax provided that such properties are used solely or primarily to provide special needs accommodation.  Certain accommodation provided by local authorities and by approved housing bodies would therefore be exempt from the local property tax.</p><p>  Consideration is being given to the mechanisms for the pay over of social housing related local property tax liabilities, and associated issues are receiving attention, informed by ongoing contact with the local government sector and approved housing bodies.  I am working with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, with a view to implementing a set of arrangements that are effective, efficient and equitable.  Local authorities and approved housing bodies will be informed of these arrangements in due course.</p></reply>

There are a number of Deputies who want to contribute.</p><p>  There is confusion and concern here.  The confusion is that, although I am opposed to household charges of any form, when the household charge and the property tax were introduced, the indications were that these would not be placed upon those living in local authority houses.</p><p>The concern is that this may very well no longer be the case.  It could be sneaked in under the guise that each local authority will be lumped with a bill that would be the equivalent of the property tax rate on its local authority houses.  All that will happen is that it could very well force local authorities to increase rent on hundreds of thousands of already struggling families living in local authority houses, many of whom are unemployed or on low incomes and not in a position to pay any more to anybody.  We need some clarity and we need to know the certain categories that will be exempt.  Can the Minister state categorically that somebody living in a local authority house will not pay the property tax and that it cannot be imposed on them in another form such as rent increase or otherwise by the local authority?</p></speech>

The regulations for the implementation of this tax will form part of that Bill in coming weeks when it will become clear.  However, there is an issue of equity here.  Some people in local authority estates, perhaps in tenant purchase schemes, are paying a contribution under the household charge or the property tax while somebody paying rent to a local authority is paying nothing in terms of making a contribution to the provision of services in his or her estate.  There is an issue here that needs to be addressed and how it will happen is a matter that needs to be worked out between the Minister for Finance and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the context of the finance Bill.</p></speech>

The same report was given by council officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council at pre-budget meetings and was, I believe, confirmed again at a meeting last night.  We need clarity on the issue.  If rent increases are to be imposed on local authority tenants, it makes a mockery of the claim that this is a property tax as the Minister suggested - it is not.  It will mean an extra burden on people who do not own property.</p><p>  Can the Minister confirm that a special committee has been established between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the County and City Managers Association?  What is the status of discussions and deliberations among that group on this issue as to whether the full cost of the property tax will be imposed on local authority tenants' rents and what that burden is likely to be?</p></speech>

A steering group made up of all the Departments and agencies he mentioned is considering this issue and will report to the Minister for Finance in the context of the finance Bill.</p></speech>

In my area we have Respond, Cluid and Circle.  Increasingly housing will be administered by social landlords.  The availability of housing is really bad at the moment and if we shrink that and put that housing stock at risk, it will have the very serious knock-on effect that the State will need to pick up on the other side.  This needs the most careful consideration.  I reiterate the point Deputy Boyd Barrett made that it clearly demonstrates that people of no property - they have no property if they are renting houses - will be paying a property tax.  It is not a property tax and should be called what it is.</p></speech>

It is now proposed to increase the rent paid by these people.  Given people are already struggling and will not be able to pay, the local authorities will have to meet this cost from their funding, leaving them with less funding for everything else, including maintenance.  That the Minister is going after people in local authority housing is an outrage.  It can be argued that these people are different, have different lifestyles and in many cases do not have the same opportunities as others.  Many of them are low paid, unemployed or are senior citizens.  Given the amount which the local authorities and approved housing bodies are required to find is an additional &euro;25 million and &euro;3.5 million, respectively, these people will be asked to pay an additional &euro;4, &euro;5 or &euro;6.</p></speech>

The dogs in the street know that cost will be passed on to tenants.  Many local authorities have already done so.  Against the backdrop of massive rent arrears, how will this benefit local services at local authority level?  The Minister said that tenants of local authority houses do not contribute to services in their areas.  Tenants in many areas pay management fees and taxes and should be entitled to the same services as everybody else.</p></speech>

The chief technology specialist of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland said at that time that he was stunned by the outcome of that particular test last October, which had been an outside of the box type exercise.  It has now been revealed that a burger produced at another processing plant contains 75% horsemeat, which makes a mockery of the Minister's theory at that time that this equine DNA was perhaps caused by something in the air.  We can now dismiss that earlier assessment by the Minister.</p><p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the primary instinct of the Government and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been to protect the industry as opposed to vindicating the right of the consumer who eats the burger in the belief that it contains what is stated on the package.  The customer has been profoundly let down by these revelations.  This drip feeding of revelation has sapped confidence in the industry and the capacity of the system to bring clarity to the situation.  The Minister's approach to this issue has been tardy and has lacked coherence, clarity and certainty.</p><p>  It is worth recalling the initial response of Tesco to the revelations of three weeks ago, namely, that this was either the result of illegality or gross negligence.  Perhaps the penny should have dropped then.</p></speech>

Why is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na only now being brought into this situation?  This issue has been ongoing since last October, yet these two units are only now being brought in.</p><p>  On the previous occasion I raised this issue, I asked for transparency and that all documentation be revealed to the House.  It was not.  I also asked who was heading up the investigation.  We still do not know that.  A request was made today to the Department for a report on the matter.  The Department said no report will be published following the declarations of last weekend by the Minister.</p><p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that what is required now is a full, transparent, comprehensive and independent inquiry, at one remove from the industry and Department, to get to the bottom of this issue once and for all.  That is the only way to protect the customer and the industry.</p></speech>

It is because of the nature and the accuracy of these tests that this came to light in the first place.

The Minister has requested a special investigation unit at the Department to pursue this along with the Garda.  Obviously there is information which leads the Department and the Minister to make this decision.  The focus is on the full supply chain involved.  The Minister has been before the committee since 3 p.m. dealing in a full, transparent and comprehensive fashion with all of the questions which need to be asked and answered to ascertain the truth about this.  He has also been in contact on a very regular basis with the Polish authorities and has invited a Polish team to visit Ireland to assist in the inquiries on how this could have gotten into the system in the first place.  The FSAI is liaising with the Northern Ireland food safety authority.</p><p>  It is important not to prejudice the outcome of any investigation in any way by jumping to conclusions which might not be accurate.  The FSAI has indicated there is no reason to suggest there is any food safety concern involved.  I heard statements about that this morning.  Rangeland Foods itself notified the Department.  The Department inspectors entered the plant last Friday and took samples, as the Deputy is aware, which confirmed 75% equine DNA in a Polish-labelled raw material ingredient.  In this case the Polish-labelled raw material was imported through a meat trader based in Ireland.  Production has been voluntarily suspended at Rangeland Foods pending the outcome of the investigation.  The company has indicated that none of this product has entered the food chain and that only Irish ingredients are used for product here.  The special investigation unit is investigating this serious issue in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the FSAI.  I would not like to prejudice the outcome of this.</p><p>  As Deputy Martin is well aware, the FSAI has an exceptional name in terms of its independence, the way it does its business and the very high level of testing which now applies here.  Changes will apply from this situation but it is necessary in the interests of the consumer, the industry and the jobs in the industry that the veracity be established, the truth be known and that action be taken quickly, conclusively and comprehensively.  This is the situation being dealt with by the Minister.</p><p>  I heard Pat McDonagh on the radio this morning speaking about Supermacs which carried out its own testing which was similar to that carried out by the FSAI.  Clearly no equine ingredient was found there, which is reassurance for his very many consumers.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is correct that the FSAI has been at arms length.  It should be at arms length.  It was established under the Minister for Health in the first instance to avoid capture by the industry after previous experiences.  Originally we were told the source of the raw material in the ingredients could have been Dutch or Spanish but now it has moved to being Polish.  Last night the Minister stated he was confident it was from Poland.  This has been nuanced to "Polish-labelled ingredients".  Will the Taoiseach identify the meat trader involved?</p><p>  The real crunch issue is that everyone keeps saying the food is safe.  Scientists and experts in Britain have queried this ringing assertion on the basis we do not know the origin of the horsemeat.  Let us forget about DNA; this is horsemeat with 75% in this particular burger and 29% in the burger three weeks ago.</p></speech>

There have been many revelations about the illegal slaughter of horsemeat in this country.  Can we be absolutely sure that horsemeat legally or illegally slaughtered in the country is not now finding its way into the food chain?  Can we say this with any confidence given what has occurred?  I note the comments of the deputy chief inspector of the veterinary body in Poland who stated they are not getting positive results in the tests they have carried out in the facilities flagged to them by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need an independent and transparent inquiry into this to give confidence to people, because there have been so many different stories in recent weeks that people do not believe anything at present.  They are particularly concerned about the food they are eating because the authenticity of the food is at risk and the veracity of food labelling will be in shreds if something is not done quickly.</p></speech>

This is different to the way Deputy Martin presented it and he should get it right.  It is also important to note that in the case of Silvercrest there is a clear paper trail involved which suggests the product was purchased directly from Poland, but in the case of Rangeland Foods a Polish-labelled raw material ingredient was sourced through a meat trader in Ireland.  This needs to be authenticated and verified.</p></speech>

We know that it continued from the foundation of this State until 1996.  An estimated 30,000 women were detained in these laundries, which were run by Catholic religious orders.  The State failed these women comprehensively.  Religious orders used these girls and women as unpaid labour.  Women incarcerated in these institutions worked for no pay, whilst the orders ran the laundries on a commercial basis in brutally harsh conditions.  Those who tried to escape and were apprehended by garda&iacute; were returned to the institutions.</p><p> Disgracefully, the Magdalen women were excluded by the State from the 2002 residential institutions redress scheme.  In May 2011, the Government - represented by the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward - appeared before the UN Committee Against Torture.  At that time, the State claimed that the laundries were private institutions, that they were voluntarily occupied and that they were outside the scope of State responsibility, bar one exception.  They persisted in this lie that nothing was known about the enslavement and brutality experienced by women in these institutions.</p><p> I very much welcome, at last, today's publication of the interdepartmental committee's report on the Magdalen institutions.  That report underlines the fact that there was substantial State involvement in these laundries and substantial State negligence in the duty of care to these women.  Therefore, the women have been vindicated.  After all, they told the truth which is that the State failed them.  When does the Taoiseach propose to offer - on behalf of all of us and of the State - a full apology to these women?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500019#R00200"><p>First of all, I want to thank Senator Martin McAleese, his assistant Ms Nuala N&iacute; Mhuircheartaigh and the team involved in putting together the McAleese report into the Magdalen laundries.  It is important to note that it was only in July last year that this Government initiated action to have such a report compiled and produced.</p><p>  Clearly, Deputy McDonald has not yet had an opportunity to read this report.  The 1,000-page report deals with the facts, as was the mandate given to Senator McAleese and his group.  It deals with them in a way that is very different from the impression that many people might have of what happened.  The number of people involved was not 30,000 but 10,012.  The number of known admission from 1922 onwards was 14,607 which clearly meant that a number of women re-entered the Magdalen laundries on a number of occasions.  </p><p>  The admissions for which routes of entry are known are stipulated in the report at 8,025.  The number of those referrals that were made, or facilitated, by the State was 2,124 or 26.5%.  The average age at the time of entry was 23.  The median age at the time of entry was 20.  The age of the youngest known entrant was nine, while the age of the oldest known entrant was 89.  Some 35.6% were there for less than three months, and 47% for less than six months.  Some 61% were there for less than a year and 68% for less than 18 months.</p><p>  I suggest that we need to absorb this report and reflect on its findings.  It is 1,000 pages long so I suggest that we should take the opportunity to have a D&aacute;il debate on this matter in two weeks' time.  In the interim people will have had time to read it, reflect upon it and understand its findings.</p><p>  The overriding requirement, as identified by Senator McAleese and his team, was to deal with the stigma attached to those who worked in Magdalen laundries and stayed in the accommodation there.  It is important to recognise that in many ways Ireland in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s was a harsh, uncompromising and authoritarian country.  That is reflected in the stories of the women who had the courage to come forward and say their piece.  </p><p>  It is clear from the report that there is no evidence of sexual abuse in the Magdalen laundries.  There is one reported case of abuse by one resident on another.  The stigma of branding together all 10,000 residents in the Magdalen laundries needs to be removed and should have been removed long before this.  I really am sorry, and I regret, that that never happened.  I am conscious, however, of the clarity of this report by Senator McAleese and his team.  </p><p>  Residents went into the Magdalen laundries through a variety of ways.  Some 26% of them did so through State intervention or State involvement.  I am sorry for those people that they lived in that kind of environment.  We have seen what happened to the women who underwent symphysiotomies, or Thalidomide victims, or those who were in mental hospitals - or lunatic asylums as they were referred to in those days - or many other places.</p><p>  I admire the courage of those women for speaking out to Senator McAleese.  I advise Deputy McDonald to read the report carefully because there is material there that has never been seen by the public.  In putting this report together, Senator McAleese has had access to information, including the financial accounts of the sisters, religious orders and the laundries.  The report has been well worthwhile producing and I am grateful to Senator McAleese for so doing. </p><p>  I am sorry that this release of pressure by, and understanding of, so many of these women was not done before now.  They were branded as fallen women and were often referred to as such in this State.  It was not until July 2011 that the initiative was taken by the Government to deal with this matter in a comprehensive way.  I want to see that those women who are still with us - I understand there are between 800 and 1,000 - are provided by the State with the best facilities and supports they need in their lives.</p><p>  The report is comprehensive and detailed, and the statistics speak for themselves.  Far from jumping to conclusions, everybody should read this report carefully and reflect on it deeply.  It refers to an Ireland which was a very hostile environment in the far off past.  These women who came forward with their testimonies to Senator McAleese spoke with courage of their involvement in, and the routes they took to, the Magdalen laundries.  We should treat this report with a measure of calmness and consideration, which it deserves.  We should return in two weeks to debate it in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach spoke of the courage of the women coming forward to tell their true stories.  I join with the Taoiseach in recognising their courage.  I only wish that their courage could be matched by some courage on his part.</p><p> I have been greatly alarmed by what the Taoiseach had to say in the Chamber today.  Everyone understands the report must be studied carefully but let us not forget that a huge amount of  historically verified information and testimony was already in the public domain prior to the establishment of the McAleese committee.  In fact, the present Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, spoke in 2009 of the irrefutable evidence of State involvement in the running of these institutions.  Consequently, the time for the apology is now and one should not try to put some kind of positive gloss on what happened.  These people were not residents voluntarily offering their services and labour but were young, vulnerable women who were held in institutions - in their minds imprisoned- and exploited.  This is what happened and the figures are stark.  Moreover, the Taoiseach is aware that two of the laundries have been excluded from the calculation of the number the Taoiseach put forward in the D&aacute;il today.</p><p> Members must reflect on the report and I welcome that there will be a D&aacute;il debate but I am disappointed for the women, that is, for the survivors, that the Taoiseach cannot say the State was culpable and negligent, that the women told the truth and the Government believes their stories and for that, it collectively says &quot;Sorry&quot;.  The debate will be held in two weeks' time.  When the apology and when then the issue of redress and compensation for these women?</p></speech>

I am sure the Taoiseach also is aware of the anger that now is building up among public sector front-line workers over the Government's plans to savage them even further in a so-called extension of the Croke Park deal.  My question to the Taoiseach is to ask whether these circumstances and pressures explain the rather odd goings-on within the Government over the last few days.  I refer to the way in which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade travelled to Latin America and told European Union officials the Government is in jeopardy unless it gets a deal on the promissory notes issue and the way in which the Minister of State, Deputy White, stated on national television that there may be no Croke Park deal unless the Government gets a deal.  Is this something of an elaborate charade on the part of the Government to create a bit of drama about whether we get a deal on the promissory notes issue to sweeten the bitter pill of the attacks the Government is planning on workers over the next number of months?  Was the game not given away on this little charade by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, when he stated that regardless of whether we get a deal, it will make no difference to the level of cuts or austerity that will be imposed in future budgets?  Is it not the truth that the Government - and the Labour Party in particular - are treating Members to an elaborate charade to deflect attention away from the cuts the Government now seeks to impose yet again on public sector workers-----</p></speech>

It is equally important to understand that the public finances must be rectified.  This is the reason the Government mandated the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to talk to the trade unions about achieving further savings of &euro;1 billion by 2015, including &euro;300 million in the course of this year.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware that the public service pay and pension bill represents 35% of expenditure, which is an important element of rectifying Ireland's public finances over the period ahead.  It is equally important to follow through on the discussions taking place at the ECOFIN group and the Eurogroup with regard to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and the consequences of the decision arising from the European Council's decision to break the link between sovereign and bank debt.</p><p>  These are three important elements of what it is the Government is about in this regard.  I remind the Deputy that the management - on behalf of the Government - and the trade unions entered into these talks freely.  That is an important consideration in this regard and I am glad to note the comments from the representatives of ICTU about the position that now applies.  While these talks are challenging, complex and difficult, Deputy Boyd Barrett should note that decisions must be made because the position will not be rectified by itself.</p><p>  As for the Deputy's comments about the consequences of a deal on the promissory note having an impact on our public finances, as I have stated, that deal will ease the exit from the programme in which Ireland is engaged, because the interest rates applying would be lower and there would be access to finance for banks to lend and provide credit for business and therefore stimulate investment for employment and the creation of jobs.</p><p>It is not a case of an elaborate charade but rather straight negotiation with a number of different groupings, including the trade unions, the European Central Bank and the ECOFIN group.</p><p> The Deputy is aware that the non-core pay bill, including overtime, allowances and premium pay, came to approximately &euro;1.8 billion last year, with another &euro;200 million in increments.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his team are negotiating directly with trade unions on the issue.  The Government has set out its stall and we want to achieve &euro;1 billion in extra savings by 2015.  These choices are not easy but the problem will not rectify itself, which is why negotiations are taking place.

I spoke with British Prime Minister Cameron last week in advance of his speech on the EU and UK relations.  I also saw him and spoke to him briefly at the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Outside of the European Council meetings, I expect to meet bilaterally with him, probably in March, for the first of our annual summits to review progress on the relationship between Britain and Ireland following the joint statement that we concluded together last March.</p><p>  Although I welcome the fact that the level of  public disorder has significantly diminished over the past number of  days, this does nothing to lessen the urgent requirement for political solutions to the current situation.  I remain deeply concerned at the street violence in parts of Belfast since late last year, the attacks on members of the PSNI, including the attempted murder of police officers, and the widespread attempts to intimidate public representatives and their families.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke in detail about the situation during a topical debate three weeks ago in the House and I know it is one that concerns many Deputies.</p><p>  On Friday, 18 January, I met David Ford, MLA, Northern Ireland Minister for Justice and leader of the Alliance Party, some of whose members were targeted by loyalist groups in the aftermath of the decision by Belfast City Council.  Let me emphasise that security and co-operation on the island has never been stronger.  The Minister was in Dublin at our invitation to attend an EU informal Council of Ministers meeting on justice and home affairs, which illustrates the strength of our relationship with the Northern Ireland  Executive.  Other Ministers have been invited to further EU informal meetings and Presidency events.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, met the First Minister and Deputy First Minister last Thursday at a PEACE programme conference in Brussels hosted by European Commissioner Johannes Hahn.  I also plan to meet the SDLP next week.</p><p>  We will continue to work closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the British Government and with all political representatives to help identify ways to address not just the current unrest but its underlying causes.  In this regard the T&aacute;naiste is in regular contact with  political leaders in the North and travelled to Belfast  on Thursday, 17 January, to meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  The meeting provided an opportunity to discuss the flag protests and violence in Belfast and to review developments towards calming the situation.  The T&aacute;naiste made clear that the Government will provide all support necessary for Executive Ministers and local politicians to help find solutions to the current crisis and to work closely together to identify ways to address not just the current crisis but its underlying causes.</p><p>  I attended the 19th summit meeting of the British-Irish Council, BIC, in Cardiff on 26 November last, which was chaired by the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones.  The council discussed the current economic situation in the different member Administrations, with a particular focus on the important role of investment in capital infrastructure to support recovery and growth.  The council also noted the latest figures on youth unemployment and requested all BIC work sectors to consider the issue of generating employment opportunities for young people in their work programmes where appropriate.  The next BIC summit takes place in Derry on 21 June.  The next North-South Ministerial Council plenary session, which I will host, will take place in Dublin on 5 July, after our EU Presidency has concluded.</p><p>  I have not been asked recently to meet with Mr. William Frazer, although I did meet him as part of a delegation led by Northern Minister Danny Kennedy, MLA, and the Kingsmill families when I met them in Dublin in September.  I have not discussed the reduction in the rate of corporation tax with Prime Minister Cameron.  This is  a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Treasury.</p></reply>

The consortium is very concerned that the British Government is deliberately long-fingering this issue because of Tory objections to the idea of a bill of rights and because elements of political Unionism are not in favour of a bill of rights for the North.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the British Government used the work of the Commission on a Bill of Rights in the UK as an excuse for not delivering the bill of rights for the North that was agreed and outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.  The final report of the British commission, which was released in December, accepts the importance of a bill of rights to the peace process.  It states the commission does "not wish to interfere in that process in any way nor for any of the conclusions that we reach to be interpreted or used in such a way as to interfere in, or delay, the Northern Ireland Bill of Rights process."</p><p>  When the leader of my party, Deputy Gerry Adams, raised this issue with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on 19 December, the Taoiseach indicated he would read the report and gave a commitment to follow up on the matter with the Northern Executive and British authorities.  Has the Taoiseach read the report?  Did the Government raise the issue with the British in recent meetings?  Will the Taoiseach outline how he intends to secure progress on a bill of rights for the North?  As he will be aware, this is an ongoing issue and a cause of frustration for those who seek progressive change in the North.</p><p>  In respect of the protests related to the union flag controversy and unrest on the streets of Belfast, it is important to repeat, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, that the decision on the flying of the union flag was democratically taken by the elected representatives of Belfast.  He will also be aware from his visits to the North that Belfast is very much a changed city.  It is, if one likes, no longer a haven of Unionist strength but very much a shared city.  The manner in which flags and emblems are to be treated under the equality provisions of the Good Friday Agreement is to give life and affirmation to the notion of shared spaces and nowhere more so than in the city of Belfast. </p><p>  I share the concern expressed by the Taoiseach for public representatives and refer specifically to Naomi Long, MP, of the Alliance Party, as well as others who have been threatened.  I also share his concern for PSNI officers.  There is, however, one particular community in the east of Belfast, which is being placed under particular pressure during the illegal loyalist demonstrations and parades.  I visited the Short Strand a couple of weeks ago and sat in homes, many belonging to elderly people, which are being routinely stoned and petrol bombed at a time when peace and reconciliation are the order of the day.  I note the T&aacute;naiste was in Belfast recently but did not, unfortunately, visit the Short Strand.  It was not lost on the residents of the area that the Secretary of State and many other people paid visits to the area, while they still await a visit from a member of the Dublin Government.  Although officials have visited, it is important that the T&aacute;naiste or Taoiseach or, ideally, both of them, pay a visit to the Short Strand.</p></speech>

We have tried to group together questions on Northern Ireland, the British Prime Minister, European issues and so forth, which was not the case previously, as far as I can recall.  Deputies were anxious that we do this.</p><p>  In so far as a bill of rights is concerned, the Government is a co-guarantor, with the British Government, in respect of the Good Friday Agreement and we would like the agreement to be implemented in full, including its provisions on a bill of rights.  As the Deputy correctly noted, the Westminster Commission on a Bill of Rights, which was established to report on a United Kingdom wide bill of rights, stated it did not want to interfere in the process in Northern Ireland.  While I do not know what are the differences of opinion among the parties in Northern Ireland, the Government is anxious to move ahead with the provision of a bill of rights.  However, some discussion is needed on the issue with the parties and I will do this.  I do not have any difficulty visiting places in Belfast such as that to which the Deputy referred.</p><p>  The Government will continue to work with the other co-guarantor - the British Government - and the Northern Ireland Executive.  I would like to hear from the parties in Northern Ireland as to what are their views about moving on with this issue.  Deputy McDonald does not want to impose her views on parties that have been democratically elected to the Executive.  As a part of the Good Friday Agreement, of which the Government is a co-guarantor, we would like a bill of rights to be implemented.</p><p>  On the issue of flags, it would be simplistic to state that the level of violence was consequent on the democratic decision taken by Belfast City Council on the flags issue.  Dealing with the past and other current contentious issues, which are, if one likes, manifestations of the same legacy, presents challenges for us all.  This issue must be at the core of the work of Northern Ireland leaders and the Executive and Assembly for some time.  The Government will engage with all of them in as positive and constructive a manner as possible.  Just this week, I raised the issue of the peace dividend at European level and I hope to do so again during the forthcoming discussions on the multi-annual financial framework, which are to be held on Thursday and Friday.  The First and Deputy First Ministers were in Brussels last week where they had a good engagement with personnel in the different parties and sectors on maintaining a peace dividend in the European Union budget.</p><p>  It is clear that the parties in Northern Ireland need to resolve a number of issues around flags and symbols in a respectful and agreed fashion as we work towards having a society that understands that more issues unite us than divide us.  As we have all stated previously, it is important to have recognition of difference and tolerance for traditions.</p></speech>

I have been saying for well over 12 months that there has been a lack of proactivity by both Governments, particularly the Irish Government, in respect of events in Northern Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement should be more than just the absence of violence.  What we are beginning to witness are underlying factors coming to the boil, as has been the case in the type of outbreak we are having.  While I acknowledge that various factors are involved, addressing health and educational inequalities in the North will be fundamental to moving on.  I do not believe these issues have been adequately addressed by all concerned in recent years.  One in two children in west Belfast is born into poverty and the area has one of the highest rates of poverty in this country or Britain.  Early school-leaving rates are high in loyalist areas where school completion is not as strong as elsewhere.</p><p>These issues create medium to long-term problems on both sides of the community divide.</p><p> A far greater scale of input is required in terms of anti-sectarian initiatives, the reconciliation projects and building cross-community relationships.  During the past decade or so, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has consistently provided money to community and sporting groups that have as part of their remits bridging community divides and working in interface areas.</p><p> The Northern Ireland Executive and both Governments need to work together to develop a more comprehensive plan, somewhat on the scale of our RAPID initiative and the drugs task force initiative that predated it.  The plan should require all agencies of the state to integrate and co-ordinate their work and resources to reduce educational disadvantage and health inequalities.  This is a painstaking, but more effective way of dealing with the emerging issues.</p><p> For many onlookers, it is frustrating to see more parading, flags and emblems.  Is this the sum total of what politics is about in the North?  Parading has been an issue for some time.  We believed that it was being resolved and that, following agreement on the devolution of justice powers, the main players would fundamentally move forward.  Alas, this has not occurred.  One almost feels that it sometimes suits the Executive's key players to play to their electoral bases as opposed to stepping beyond those to forge a shared agenda and a shared future within the North.</p><p> The Short Strand's residents have a strong case as regards protection from attacks and illegal marching.  The PSNI must be robust, objective and fair in protecting residents from such attacks.  However, this cuts both ways.  Political parties or groups cannot dictate to the PSNI who should or should not be arrested.  Doing so would send wrong signals to the other side.  When the PSNI recently arrested an individual, Sinn F&eacute;in picketed its headquarters.  What signal does this send to communities when one is also asking them to support the PSNI in its endeavours to find the murderers of prison officer Black, for example?  Within the same week, Sinn F&eacute;in protested because it did not like the PSNI's action.</p><p> The reform of policing under the Patten report and so on has been an essential element to emerge from the peace process.  The Governments, the Executive and the parties of the Executive must be careful to protect it.  Criticisms can be made, but there are forums for doing so.</p><p> I have tabled five questions.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach has answered 14 questions together as opposed to the potential 38 questions that I feared he would lump in altogether.  Whereas the bulk relate to the North, I beg the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence to allow me to revert on the question relating to Prime Minister David Cameron, which was not tabled in the context of the North.</p></speech>

I do not think that there is any major disagreement about anything that he has said.  Clearly, in vulnerable communities the issues of inequality, opportunity and education are absolutely critical, no more so than has been demonstrated in so many places around the world.</p><p>  In the last 12 months, there have been 50 different meetings between myself, the T&aacute;naiste and different Ministers and our counterparts in Northern Ireland about issues arising there.  That has been more than ever since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council.  We have had some success and progress following the signing of the strategic partnership agreement with Prime Minister Cameron last year, which I hope to build on when I have the opportunity to speak to him again in that context early in March.</p><p>  I have to say that I was astonished.  As Deputy Martin well knows, in this House we have no hierarchy of victims.  Yet I noticed that, in whatever context, Deputy McDonald's party, Sinn F&eacute;in, seems to have a difference of view between a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a member of the PSNI-----</p></speech>

As I will be at pains to explain to the survivors of Kingsmill, Fermanagh and Ballymurphy when I meet them, we do not have any hierarchy when somebody is shot, blown up or killed.  There is no discrimination in the sense of loss for whoever that might apply to.</p><p>  It is necessary as well that we show and have a respectful approach to commemorations.  The T&aacute;naiste launched this initiative on the decade of commemorations when he invited First Minister Robinson last year to speak at Iveagh House.  I had the privilege of attending the remembrance ceremony in Enniskillen in November.  I have also met recently with other political representatives who represent people, like Northern Ireland Executive members Danny Kennedy and Arlene Foster.  I have referred to that in the House before.</p><p>  Deputy Martin quite rightly referred to the community groups.  This is important.  I see a value in engagement with vulnerable communities and cross-peace line initiatives.  The reconciliation and anti-sectarianism funds awarded grants to 130 organisations.  They are important.</p><p>  A great deal of practical assistance and co-operation is going on between the Department of Health, different agencies and the Department of Education and Skills.  There has been quite extensive engagement between the Ministers, Deputies Reilly and Quinn, and their counterparts on this.</p><p>  It is hoped we will secure expenditure for the peace initiative if a budget is agreed on Thursday or Friday and have it in place for the next seven years.  We should, as is happening with a number of the groups in Northern Ireland, particularly in Belfast areas, look at what has been successful in other vulnerable communities to see what might give the best impact.  I saw some of them when I had the opportunity to be up there on the last occasion.  They do practical work with young boys and young girls in a sense of understanding, that they might be different in many ways in terms of their upbringing and beliefs than other boys and girls across the line, but that there is no reason for them not to grow up understanding that and yet having an understanding of the environment and the areas in which they grow up in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  There is a great deal of co-operation between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope that that bears fruit in the sense of apprehending those who murdered Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe recently.</p><p>  From that point of view and in so far as the peace process is concerned, economic, political and security co-operation are very strong and at a very high level.  There is absolutely no room for any complacency, as the Deputy well knows, nor will there be.  I intend to travel up there in the not too distant future.  I am waiting to meet with the people from Ballymurphy.  They have actually requested a meeting with officials again before I do that.  We will have that opportunity.  We would like, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to see if we can follow it through to its implementation, but clearly it is not only in our hands.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach referred to the protests and used the words &ldquo;underlying causes&rdquo;, which suggest that while there were reactionary loyalist hard-liners stirring up sectarian divisions many young, working-class Protestants were involved and there was support initially from a wider strata of the Protestant population.  Is the real underlying cause that the peace process has not delivered a transformation of life for working class people whether Protestant or Catholic?  We have a considerable economic crisis and suffering as a result of that among working class people right across the spectrum.</p><p>  Is the institutionalisation of sectarian division that is enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement not glaringly obvious in the flags issue?  When Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP raised the flag issue, there was no groundswell of pressure coming from within the Catholic community, yet the Unionist bloc embraced with gusto what it saw as the challenge from an opposite perspective and went with 40,000 leaflets to stir it up among the Protestant people.  What we had was establishment politicians on both sides in the Executive and the Assembly stirring up divisive issues on a sectarian basis and cynically diverting attention from their failure to address the real issues confronting working class people, namely, unemployment, the housing crisis, poverty and the grim future for young people which affects both Protestants and Catholics.  It also diverts from the Welfare Reform Bill &ndash; a vicious attack on social welfare recipients - which was not vetoed by a single party in the Executive when it was passed last autumn.  Is it not reckless for political parties to manipulate issues in this way and to stir up sectarian divisions, which is the reality, to divert attention from their own failures and shortcomings?</p><p>  Equally, is it not in the interests of working class people and working class youths &ndash; Protestant and Catholic &ndash; not to be divided but to come together to address the real issue, but also to oppose the austerity that is decimating society in Northern Ireland, as the Government&rsquo;s austerity is decimating society in the Republic by continuing such a programme?  Working class people should come together across the divide to address these issues with radical solutions rather than be divided by manipulating politicians.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500024#W00200"><p>I agree that there should be a convergence of view and a sharing of the objective of growing the economy of Northern Ireland in order that jobs could be created and that the inherent, underlying contributory causes of what has happened could be addressed.  As Deputy Martin pointed out, a number of successful programmes have operated in this jurisdiction in difficult areas with assistance from Europe.  What Deputy Higgins said is true.  It should not be any factor involving political parties for political reasons.  Politics is always about people and the focus must be on making changes that impact to the benefit of people&#8217;s lives.</p><p><br />  The protests by loyalists at the removal of the Union Jack began on 3 December when Belfast City Council voted that the flag would fly from City Hall on designated days throughout the year, and it continued through January except for a lull over the Christmas period.  While the majority of demonstrations passed off without incident, some resulted in serious rioting and approximately 130 police officers suffered injuries.  The impact, which went around the world instantly, did damage community relations.  It severely curtailed economic activity in the pre-Christmas period.  It conveyed a deeply negative impression of Northern Ireland to international audiences, which I very much regret.  That countered the positive campaigns to promote tourism and to attract investment.</p><p><br />  I understand the cost of policing the protests was of the order of &pound;7 million and the loss of trade is estimated to have cost &pound;15 million.  Other areas will have gained as a consequence of that unfortunate position.  The <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> has launched a &quot;Backing Belfast&quot; campaign to attract business to the city.  Reports indicate that restaurants and businesses were returning to normal levels of activity over the previous weekend.  I support that strongly.</p><p><br />  A total of 130 police were injured up to 30 January.  It was indicated that 158 arrests took place - 50 of them were of people aged under 18 and the youngest was aged 11 &#8211; and 128 people were charged.  I do not want a society where 11 year olds are being arrested for activities on the streets.  That means investment in communities and even greater efforts to engage with communities, young people and their parents.  The arrests that have taken place involve people who blocked roads.  It is clear that the PSNI has identified participants through the use of CCTV.</p><p><br />  There were accusations that loyalist paramilitary organisations orchestrated the protests, but the protests were portrayed as being spontaneous and were organised on social media platforms such as Facebook.  Some criticism was levelled at the PSNI for not taking action against those using social media to encourage people to break the law and for posting sectarian remarks.  There has been one arrest for remarks made on a website associated with the flag protest.  A man was arrested on 2 February in north Belfast over comments he made on social media.  He was subsequently released on bail.</p><p><br />  The most significant development in the reduction in rioting was the intervention of loyalist leaders in east Belfast two weeks ago, calling for an end to the violence, although not to the protests.  Following the statement, as Deputy Higgins is aware, 5,000 leaflets were delivered to homes in the east Belfast area calling on those involved in current rioting to stop.  That was endorsed by church leaders, community representatives and paramilitary organisations including the UVF, the UDA and the Red Hand Commando.</p><p><br />  Members referred to the Short Strand, which emerged as a flash-point for protestors returning to east Belfast from City Hall.  Serious incidents occurred there on Saturday, 12 January.  A nationalist resident was granted leave to seek a judicial review over claims that the police had allowed illegal marches every week from east Belfast to the city centre.  The resident has brought a challenge against the PSNI and the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers.  The Parades Commission is seeking to clarify the legal options on flag protest marches to Belfast City Hall.  It indicated in a statement that it had been notified of 14 flag protest parades but not about any of the Saturday protests in Belfast.  The commission said the situation raised questions about implementing the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998.</p><p><br />  The first meeting of the new Unionist Forum, which was organised before Christmas, was proposed by the DUP and the UUP, and took place on 10 January.  The forum set up a task force to engage with the wider community and also set up eight working groups on subjects across the Unionist spectrum.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party called for an all-party, cross-community response to the protest at the violence.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke to the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, on the matter on 17 January.  The quad met at principal levels only, including the Minister of State, Mr. Penning.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State emphasised the need for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to work together to address the current crisis and building a shared society.</p><p>A group called the Ulster People's Forum was set up at a meeting on 3 January to co-ordinate the protests.  This group is seen as the alternative to the DUP-UUP forum.  A contributory factor to the falling support for the protests is the obvious apparent disunity among those organisers.</p><p> I share Deputy Higgins's view that what is needed is real involvement at community level in order that young people can understand there is a better way than having to organise, or be involved in, riotous behaviour, which does no good for anybody and which does down the national and international perception of the people of Northern Ireland and their efforts, and they are many, to build an inclusive and a shared society where differences are understood and at the same time where the objectives of greater economic development for everybody can be achieved.  In so far as we can assist in this, the Government and its agencies will work with our counterparts in Northern Ireland for the development of those kinds of programmes that have been proven to be beneficial in very sensitive areas not only in this country but in other places abroad.</p></speech>

There will have to be a bit of soul searching by the political establishment in the North and by the political establishment generally as to why that happened.</p><p>  The Taoiseach said that the protests were largely spontaneous but there was some element of stoking it up by loyalist parliamentary groups initially.  I suggest there was another significant factor, which the Taoiseach has not acknowledged but he should acknowledge, and our comrades in Sinn F&eacute;in should also acknowledge this.  The Deputy First Minister's party, the DUP, and the Official Unionist Party put 40,000 leaflets around east Belfast and Protestant areas, stoking up the issue.  This was a major contributory factor to an explosion of violence and anger among young people.</p><p>  I certainly do not believe it was a coincidence that was done at the same time when, for example, the Minister, Nelson McCausland, announced the plan to effectively privatise the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.  That is pretty telling.  If we remember back to the history of the most recent phase of violence in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the North, how did it begin?  It began on the issue of housing, housing allocation and discrimination in the allocation of insufficient housing for the least well-off.  Housing remains a massive problem in the North and now the Northern Ireland Executive is planning to privatise social housing, to outsource it, not in a dissimilar fashion to the way the Government is doing here with leases to property developers, except in the North it will be to housing associations and rents are likely to increase.  In addition, there is a massive 25% youth unemployment and cuts have been imposed in hospital services and so on.  These factors and deliberate stoking up of these issues along tribal lines helped focus youth alienation and anger felt by the less well-off sectors of society in the North along sectarian lines.</p><p>  In addition, the structures of the Northern Ireland political set up are a form of institutionalised sectarianism which guarantee that politics tends to be expressed in a sectarian fashion.  The arrangements and quota systems in terms of balancing Nationalist and Unionist in the North are almost exactly the same as those that were set up by the French in the Lebanon in 1920s which led to decades of sectarian conflict there-----</p></speech>

This Government in making its case to Europe for continued assistance for areas like this will continue to work with the Executive and the agencies at cross-Border level with particular reference, as I have often said in this House, to vulnerable communities where this kind of approach and assistance needs to be given.</p><p>  It is the case that there is a period of relative calm there now and no time should be lost or no complacency shown in redoubling efforts to work with communities in their own interests.  I find there is a great sense among numbers of people to  work at that because they see the value of it, and we should never lose sight of that.  Nobody wants to see riots anywhere.  Obviously, this involves the entire community, political leaders, organisations, communities and community leaders continuously striving to build on what has been a fragile peace.  As the Deputy well knows, during the past 30 years many people have given extraordinary amounts of time to work within their communities to build that and we have to ensure that is continued and resourced where that can be done.</p><p>  I have talked to numbers of people in those communities where they can see the benefit and the results in the young people because they see the benefit of education, of opportunity, of involvement and of taking a different road.  There should not be a situation where 11 year olds are out on riots in the streets of Belfast.  We have to focus on the future of community involvement with state support to ensure those communities can develop and thrive.</p></speech>

Without trying to take for a second from the very deep social problems in many areas across the Six Counties, statistics reflect that while the indices of poverty and deprivation are found in loyalist areas, they are predominantly within what would be termed Nationalist or republican areas.</p><p>Poverty is poverty, want is want and there is no doubt we need a strategy to deal with that.  However, the issue of the flags exposed in quite a dramatic way a failure within political unionism - the DUP has been mentioned - to really grasp the notion of equality.  The flags issue did not just come out of nowhere on 3 December.  These are issues that we have debated long and hard, they are sensitive but we have an agreed approach now and it is about parity of esteem and sharing.</p><p> Undoubtedly the DUP and other forces within unionism, for their own ends, stoked up the kind of reaction that was seen on the ground.  It would be entirely wrong for it to be left unchallenged in this D&aacute;il that somehow there was a stoking up on both sides of the community divide.  That did not happen.  People in the North, of the Unionist tradition have a perfect entitlement and right that their emblems and flag are respected.  I say that out loud because it is entirely reasonable.  Equally, people who are not of a Unionist persuasion, Nationalists and republicans in the city of Belfast, in their city, have a right to have a sense of a shared space as well.  The proposal coming from the council was  modest and in fact is reflected in other areas, some of them Unionist, across the six counties, with the flying of the Union flag on designated days.  We agreed to that compromise because it was the right thing to do.</p><p> I wish to encourage the Taoiseach again on the bill of rights.  I know he wants to hear other people's views and opinions but, in his own words, he is the &quot;co-guarantor&quot; of the Good Friday Agreement.  The bill of rights is not an optional extra.  Like the concept of equality, a bill of rights will serve the rights, entitlements and opportunities of all.</p><p> Finally, I wish to say in response to one of the Taoiseach's remarks that I would acknowledge absolutely the trauma for any family and every family, irrespective of who they were, arising from the loss of life in the course of the conflict, be they a police officer, a soldier, an IRA volunteer, a UVF volunteer.  Whoever they were, the loss of human life and the scale of it was an immense tragedy and failure of politics.  However, I would remind the Taoiseach that the RUC was disbanded and it was disbanded for a good reason.  In fact, this State and the Good Friday Agreement to which we are signatories and to which the Government is a signatory, recognised that fact and was the vehicle for disbanding it.  Can I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should not insult An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by saying that it is an equivalent of the RUC.  It simply was not and that is not to take for a moment from the human tragedy of any loss of life.  The RUC was disbanded, discredited, swept away and a new policing dispensation, on which we are still working, was introduced.  The Taoiseach knows that as well as I do so I ask him not to use that matter to have a cheap jibe at me.  If he is going to have a go at me, he should make it more substantive.</p></speech>

The idea that, as happened last week, one would try to distinguish between the murder of a garda on this island and the murder of an RUC person on this island was incredible and basically, it was wrong.  We are on an island.  We want to try to develop a shared future.  Part of that is the need to own up and be honest that the war of terror was, without question, not justified.  The murder of RUC officers was not justified and Deputy McDonald's  public statement last week to the effect that it was different because it was "in the course of the conflict" is an unacceptable position to adopt.  It can also be provocative, in the context of what we have been discussing today, about rioting and the outbursts from different parts of the community.</p><p>  It has been put to us that we should join the call for a Border poll.</p></speech>

Overall, it would enhance the attractiveness of the island for inward investment.  Some people might have concerns about North or South of the Border but I believe, overall, it could be a positive in terms of the island and the marketing of the island from a foreign direct investment perspective.</p><p>  When he met Prime Minister Cameron, did the Taoiseach raise the issue of the Prime Minister's proposed referendum on exiting the European Union?  I warned the Taoiseach some time ago that Prime Minister Cameron would soon start talking about exiting the European Union and that has now come to pass.  He is going to put the issue, an in-or-out question, to the British people.  That brings to mind the need for this country to adopt a position on the British position on the European Union.  It is not enough for the Government to say it is going to be damaging and so forth.  We know that.  What is our national position on the demands of the British Government regarding the European Union?  What preparations are we making in case they go ahead with this vote in a number of years?</p><p>Are we preparing an Irish position on the future of the European Union itself?</p><p> Finally, I appreciate the efforts the Taoiseach is making with regard to peace money for special support programmes for the North.  It would be helpful if the First Minister and Deputy First Minister adopted, for once, a pro-European stance in this regard.  I remember negotiations some years ago when the advisers both to the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in were delighted by the failure of the first Lisbon treaty referendum.  It was the one thing they agreed on, despite the enormous sums of money that went to Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

It is, however, wrong to give the impression that the predominance of suffering and poverty is on one side.  For reasons of history and geography, and because of residues of sectarian discrimination, there are differences between the two communities.  However, 19% of the Protestant population and 26% of the Catholic population live in poverty.  In the years up to 2010, some 28% of working age Protestants were not in paid work, compared with 35% of Catholics.  This is common misery.  Neither community is privileged.</p><p>  It is shameful that the establishment politicians, by whom I mean Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the DUP and UUP, have no address for these crises but to implement austerity dictated by the Liberal and Conservative Government and divert attention from it by dividing people further.  Working class people need representation by an independent party that will challenge and resolve the crisis of this system, whether the capitalist austerity is North or South, and have a real transformation for their people.  That is what is needed.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding those fault lines, the Taoiseach did not respond to the point that someone who is supposed to be on the respectable establishment wing of politics in the North, Peter Robinson's party and the Official Unionist Party, put out 40,000 leaflets stoking this crisis up and then panicked when chaos resulted with a damaging impact on business and tried to close it down again.

I do not put the comrades of Sinn F&eacute;in in the same category with regard to doing that sort of thing.  I am not suggesting they are doing that, but where the underlying problems are unemployment, youth alienation, housing, health and all the stuff that is being done to working class people in the North, is it a useful response to talk about parity of esteem between communities or about flags and emblems?  I do not think it is.  It fuels sectarianism.  We need to fight tooth and nail against the austerity measures that are causing that level of alienation.  There is not parity of esteem, but parity of lack of esteem-----</p></speech>

It is astonishing that Sinn F&eacute;in would still hold that view.  When Queen Elizabeth spoke in Dublin Castle, she said history teaches us many lessons and that, in hindsight, some things might have been done differently and some things might not have been done at all.  We must learn the lessons of history and move on to the future.</p><p>  I discussed the question of corporate tax rates with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the context of the island of Ireland.  That is a matter for the United Kingdom Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  They will hold discussions in their own time.  I am not sure when they might make that decision.  In making such a decision, the government might take into account the fact that there is to be a referendum in Scotland in 2014.</p><p>  The Prime Minister rang me the day before he made his speech on Europe in London and I also spoke to him briefly in Davos, where he was making a speech to an audience.  I made it clear to him that we have a very close relationship with Britain.  It is our largest trading partner, there has been considerable movement over and back for many years and we want that to continue.  I made the point that Ireland voted 60:40 in favour of the fiscal stability treaty and of our link to the euro and the European Union with a clear path to the future.  I also made the point that Britain has always been a driver of the Single Market and that the opportunity now presents itself, even during our Presidency, to get a mandate to start discussions on free trade between the EU and the US over the next number of year with potential to grow economies by at least 2% with 2 million jobs resulting in Europe, as an assessment, and to conclude trade agreements with Canada and countries in the Far East.  It is important to have Great Britain involved in these developments and this is recognised by all other European leaders.  I put those points very strongly to the Prime Minister.  He also set out his stall.  </p><p>  Holding the Presidency, we have made the point that the leaders of Europe need to make decisions and build a sense of trust among ourselves about what we want to do.  It is unacceptable that 26 million people are unemployed in the European Union.  This must be addressed by implementing political decisions.  Decisions are being implemented on the digital market, data protection and content, trade opportunities and opportunities to grow our economy even further, particularly our exports and services which recent figures show are going in the right direction.  </p><p>  The British Prime Minister speaks for the British Government, even though his junior partners have a different attitude to Europe.</p></speech>

As far as Ireland is concerned, we want to keep movement in trade, investment and opportunities between here and Britain alive.  I was glad to see the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources recently signed the memorandum of understanding on our capacity to sell energy directly to the British market.  Europe without Britain would be very much weaker and no one wants that.  I hope the time ahead will allow the European Union to address many of its own challenges by political decision and grow that union.  It has 500 million people and enormous potential.  Provided a decision is made this week to have a multiannual financial framework, MFF, I hope we can run an effective Presidency in the interests of the European Union that will also have benefits for our own country.</p></speech>

St. James's Hospital is to face the biggest cut of &euro;9 million and it is hard to understand how it will cope with the pressures given the case mix of that hospital.  The allocation appears to be more about getting rid of the deficits of existing hospitals.  Where does the community budget within the HSE lie?  Sums of &euro;5 million are being taken from Temple Street and Crumlin children's hospitals as well.  The health (amendment) Bill is due but it must broaden its compass in terms of eligibility and community issues.</p></speech>

I think of the 10,000 residents.  They know their stories, they have told their stories and their stories have been believed.  Many of them lived with an undeserved stigma that was of great disservice to the experience of these women.  That stigma has been removed by the report, which was long overdue.  As I said to all of those women, I am sorry the State did not act sooner and that this investigation could have been carried out many years ago.  I regret in particular that many who suffered have not lived to see this day, when such a report is published, removing that stigma and letting the true facts finally emerge.  As the report is comprehensive and contains much new information, I expect we can discuss with the Whips on how long should be allocated to the topic and what date in two weeks it should take place.  It is a comprehensive report that deserves deep reflection and consideration.  We will see it gets that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1023" speakername="John Lyons" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500029#BB00500"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for attending.  The issue I propose is the use of social clauses in public procurement contracts, including quotas to employ jobseekers who are long-term unemployed.  As the Minister of State may be aware, I published a social clause Bill late last year and have met a number of experienced professionals who have drafted social clauses into contracts.  This is an issue in which I have a strong interest as, being a resident of and a representative for Ballymun, I have seen how significant public expenditure in areas can transform the physical environment without fully addressing the issues of long-term unemployment.  In the short time available, I want to look at how to use public contracts for infrastructure, such as schools and retrofitting, to help the long-term unemployed back in to work.  I also want to suggest some ways to overcome some of the issues in implementing these clauses based on Irish examples.</p><p>  The number of long-term claimants on the live register in January 2013 was just under 190,000, approximately two thirds of whom being men who mainly used work in the construction sector.  As we all will be aware, this is a structural unemployment issue.  As well as retraining options, we need to maximise the employment opportunities for those jobseekers from public spending in the economy.</p><p>  I listened with interest to the Minister of State's discussion on social clauses in recent weeks and his support for examining the future use of social clauses.  In particular, he outlined the key challenges to introducing social clauses and he mentioned four issues.  These include the need to ensure a value-for-money approach; compliance with EU treaties and procurement directives, such as contracts that would not be discriminatory; ensuring no cost burden is added to businesses in applying for tenders; and the difficulties in the monitoring of compliance with social clauses.</p><p>  The Minister of State also outlined the areas on which to focus to best achieve our aims in this area.  He mentioned three issues: focusing on social clauses for services and work contracts rather than supply contracts; applying social considerations as contract performance conditions; and using social clauses to support labour activation policies.  I have looked at all of these issues in detail and I believe we can achieve this balance using the experience of similar examples already available in Ireland.  In the Grangegorman DIT plan, for instance, there was an employment opportunities study carried out to see how this long-term project could benefit Dublin's north inner city.  This study proposes local labour partnerships be set up to work with contractors and sub-contractors to identify their skills needs and to provide the training and up-skilling needed for the workers.  It also proposes long-term strategies around up-skilling so that the community benefits from the post-construction phase.  Similar partnerships could be set up for large infrastructural projects such as Limerick regeneration and the national children's hospital.  For smaller works, the linkages with local job centres could provide knowledge of the skills and experience in an area before a project starts which would help with local access for work with contractors.</p><p>  All of these are excellent ideas but to get the long-term unemployed back into jobs, we must look at quotas.  The evidence shows that the longer someone is out of work, the harder it is for him or her to come back into the labour market.  If we apply quotas for the long-term unemployed to public infrastructural projects, we would not be using a &quot;hire local&quot; social clause and, therefore, would not be using discriminatory ways.  Also, to implement and oversee the contracts, we could look at staging the tenders, or making them smaller, to provide us opportunities for oversight by including past compliance in the assessment of new tenders.  I hope these points can be taken into consideration in the context of social clauses in public procurement in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500029#BB00600"><p>I thank Deputy Lyons for raising this matter.  I also thank him for the interest he has shown in this issue and for the legislation he published in his own right.  As he correctly stated, the matter of social clauses in public contracts is something that I have been examining closely in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Social clauses can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other member states.</p><p>  The European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement, including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards.  This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU treaty principles and the procurement directives.  The EU procurement directives primarily envisage that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract.  For example, the EU directive states that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of those experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment.  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that value for money is not adversely affected, additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers, and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.</p><p>  Deputy Lyons is aware that proposals for a revised set of EU directives governing public procurement are being considered.  The inclusion of social considerations in public procurement procedures, specifically at the contract award stage, is an issue that is being addressed in the reform of the procurement directives.  In this regard, the revised directive, when implemented, should provide greater scope and legal clarity on the use of social criteria at contract award stage.  Reaching agreement on the public procurement dossiers is a key priority for the Irish Presidency of the European Union.</p><p>  The proposal that all public procurement contracts include a requirement that a quota of long-term unemployed be employed in the delivery of all procurement contracts poses a number of significant risks.  In the current economic climate, in particular, bearing in mind the difficulties in the construction sector, businesses have for obvious reasons been reducing their existing work force rather than taking on new employees.  Consequently, it is likely that, where a business is awarded a public contract, in particular a small scale contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business.</p><p>In such circumstances a social clause requiring that a number of long-term unemployed people be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford or result in an employee of the supplier being let go in favour of a long-term unemployed person. </p><p> The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would therefore appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and could be linked directly to the contracting authority&rsquo;s policy or strategic plan, as the Deputy mentioned in his contribution.  Experience in other member states would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause - this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another member state.</p><p> Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, my Department and the national procurement service are examining a targeted approach to the use of social clauses focused on contracts in parts of the capital area where employers are likely to be hiring additional workers to deliver the contract.  This is likely to mitigate the risk of displacing workers already in employment while offering the opportunity of assisting with labour activation measures for the long-term unemployed.</p></speech>

I agree with what he has said in many respects.  In the case of some of the obstacles we have seen, such as the possible displacement of people who are working full-time, we need to look beyond the obstacle and see the solution in order to address that.  As the Minister of State and I both know, retraining alone will not give everybody a job.  The State is a big spender - it will build numerous schools and many other infrastructural projects over the lifetime of this Government.  Please God, work will shortly commence on the new national children's hospital, not to mention Limerick regeneration which is under way.  We have not yet lived up to the opportunities that are before us.  I am glad we are changing our view of how social clauses can be used to address the number of people who are unemployed.</p><p>  Of the 190,000 long-term unemployed, almost two thirds are men and were working in the construction sector.  We have a ready-made workforce and have shovel-ready projects.  I admire the creative thinking coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this and I look forward to seeing some attempt to address quotas and getting people who are long-term unemployed back into the workforce.  We need to learn from best practice.  Some of the experts involved in the public procurement process, whom I have met, have advised that we can do it even as the legislation stands from an EU perspective.  Hopefully, the forthcoming EU legislation and objectives will open horizons and expand opportunities for offers of social clauses for people who are long-term unemployed in particular.</p></speech>

He highlighted the challenge of unemployment.  Effectively half of our unemployed are considered long-term unemployed, which is a dreadful statistic when so many people have lost their jobs.  I understand that approximately 60% of people who lost their jobs in the past four years were directly or indirectly related to the construction sector.  We are looking at this in a creative way.  I do not want this navel-gazing exercise to go on forever and I want to see action on it.  I have told my officials that I want to get this over the line.  I believe we can do it under existing legislation and EU directives.  When one considers that between 2013 and 2016 the Government plans to spend more than &euro;13.1 billion on construction, there is clearly an opportunity to do something here.</p><p>  We will spend approximately &euro;1.3 billion on public private partnerships.  We would argue that those are additional infrastructural projects.  We are considering starting in that area to see if we can make progress.  The approach needs to be targeted and legal.  We cannot restrict people from other European Union member states, as the Deputy knows.  We do not want a displacement effect of putting out of business people who are working in another area, and who are viable and not debt-ridden as many other construction companies are.  The social clause consideration fits best in cases where a contractor who has won a contract by the State needs to employ additional workers.</p><p>  As the Deputy rightly points out this needs to be compatible with EU law, but we want to get it over the line.  I appreciate the opportunity he has given me today to give out the public message to the Department and others to get on with this so that we can get it in place.  This is something we will do.  Obviously it needs to be legal and correct, but I am satisfied we can get this over the line.</p></speech>

A report in this morning's<i> Irish Independent</i> informs us that a new Cabinet sub-committee is being established with additional senior Ministers drafted into it to deal with the mortgage arrears crisis.  It paints a picture of distinct unhappiness in Government circles over how the crisis is being handled.  The Department of the Taoiseach appears to be frustrated with the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance seems to be frustrated with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank seems to be frustrated with the banks and the most frustrated of all are the customers in distress with their mortgages who cannot get a solution identified and put in place.  That is the kernel of the problem.</p><p><br />  We all need to accept that the only solution to this crisis is for the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to identify a suite of options that can be deployed and then for the banks to put in place a targeted solution for each individual mortgage customer who is in distress.  I fully accept there is no silver bullet and the problem will not be solved easily.  The only way to solve it is for the banks to get down and dirty, and deal with each file on an individual basis.  As is the case with all my colleagues in this House, I am dealing with individual cases of borrowers in mortgage distress and it is utterly frustrating for the people concerned because the banks are not facing up to their responsibilities.  Whatever fine words might be uttered in this House, the reality is altogether different.</p><p><br />  It is now 18 months since the Keane report was published.  That report identified a number of innovative solutions that could be put in place.  The record since then of the banks in dealing with mortgage distress is that just 12 split-mortgage arrangements have been put in place in those 18 months.  Up to December 2012 only one mortgage-to-rent transaction was completed - we were told a number of others were in the pipeline.  The bottom line is that the banks are hoarding their capital and not facing up to the problem, as they should.  Customers are not being facilitated in getting a solution to their problems.  It is just lingering on with significant damage to the economy and to the lives of the people concerned.</p><p><br />  The Minister of State knows the scale of the problem.  According to the last official figures, 180,000 residential mortgages were in some form of trouble - either in arrears or had been restructured and had not yet fallen back into arrears.  That is almost one in four residential mortgages in distress, which is a national emergency.  The Government has undertaken initiatives but they are not working so far.  The figures keep on getting worse.  Some 44,000 mortgage holders are in arrears of more than a year.</p><p>Almost half of them are in arrears of two years or more.  In the majority of cases, people will not be able to work their way out of that situation without the bank coming to the table with a solution.  That is what I want to see happening.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response, which I hope will clarify the role of the new committee and how its work will differ from that of the existing banking and mortgage arrears committee.  It is hoped we will soon get some solutions to this problem.</p></speech>

A special Cabinet sub-committee was put in place in March last year to address the mortgage arrears problem.  This committee, chaired by the Taoiseach and including all relevant Ministers, reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area.</p><p>  At official level, the Department of Finance is taking a lead role and in that context, a high level steering group, chaired by the Department's Secretary General, was established to drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Keane report.  The Government's strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around measures in four distinct areas, namely, personal insolvency, a mortgage advisory service, the mortgage-to-rent scheme and engagement with the banks.  Considerable progress has been achieved across this agenda.</p><p>  The Keane report indicates that given the recourse nature of mortgages, personal insolvency reform and, in particular, the introduction of new more accessible insolvency resolution frameworks are essential for the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem.  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 is now law.  This should be a catalyst to incentivise banks to reach an agreed solution with individual borrowers in resolving mortgage arrears cases.  It is expected that the majority of agreements between borrowers and lenders can be made outside of the provisions of the Act as bilateral agreements between borrowers and lenders, without recourse to the new insolvency frameworks or the courts, would, in many cases, be in the interest of all parties.  However, the new insolvency framework will be necessary for some cases and the insolvency service is now urgently preparing the ground to make them operation as soon as possible.</p><p>  An extensive independent mortgage advice framework has also been put in place by the Minister for Social Protection, comprising an enhanced website, a mortgage arrears information helpline and the provision of free independent one-to-one professional advice to borrowers when considering a long-term forbearance-resolution offer from their lender.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning has now put the mortgage-to-rent scheme on a nationwide basis.  Protecting the home of the most distressed mortgage holders through a mortgage-to-rent scheme whereby the ownership of the house passes to an approved housing body is a key social back stop housing support for those with distressed mortgages.  The existing owner then becomes a social housing tenant.  This option is now available in appropriate cases and will be of benefit to low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable to allow them remain in their homes.</p><p>  The Central Bank, under its MARS project, has been intensively working with lenders for some time to ensure that they have a range of longer term options, such as trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and sale by agreement or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders for their distressed mortgage customers and that they have the capacity to implement these in an effective manner.  While progress in this area has not been as rapid as desired, greater effort and resources are now being deployed across the banks to this issue and real engagement on resolution options should now be further enhanced.</p><p>  In addition, the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears remains a key framework to govern the relationship between mortgage holders experiencing difficulty and their bank and it offers very worthwhile protections for distressed households.  The code provides that each bank must put in place a formal mortgage arrears resolution process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.  The Central Bank has commenced a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears which will involve a public consultation process.  The review of the code will have to take account as appropriate of recent developments such as the new insolvency legislation.</p><p>  The Government is committed to building on the progress made and further intensifying its efforts to address the mortgage arrears problem and in that context is proceeding on the basis of the recommendations of the Keane report.  However, banks and other lenders also have a very significant obligation and responsibility to address mortgage holders experiencing genuine mortgage arrears.  Given that lenders extended the credit in the first instance, they can be regarded as having the primary responsibility for addressing the debt problems now facing their customers and for resolving the position in a sustainable way for those customers experiencing genuine difficulty.</p></speech>

The problem is that while there is engagement between the banks and their customers, it is not real engagement.  I have assisted many borrowers with the completion of the standard financial statement form.  While some get a response weeks or even months later, others do not get a response, leaving them not knowing where they stand.  Meanwhile, the overhang of debt is causing major problems for them, including stress, lack of certainty and fear of losing their homes.  All of this is also acting as a drag on the overall economy.  The evidence in this regard is in the official published figures.  More than 99% of mortgage restructures to date comprise the standard instruments of interest only repayments, reduced payments for a period of time, extension of the term, capitalisation of arrears or a payment moratorium for a short time.  The innovative solutions identified are not being rolled out.</p><p><br />  The Minister of State is duty bound to say in this House today that the Government is not satisfied with the manner in which this issue is being dealt with.  High level officials in Government and the Central Bank briefed the <i>Irish Independent</i> about their concerns.  This issue is not being dealt with.  The banks are not facing up to their responsibilities.  It is about time we called a spade a spade.  The banks have been recapitalised by the people.  They are hoarding that capital and are not facing up to the bad debts on their books.  I acknowledge that the solution will have to be on a case-by-case basis.  However, it must be within the context of the suite of measures which have been identified, rolled out and supported by Government and the Central Bank.  This is not what is happening on the ground, which is my reason for raising this issue again.</p></speech>

The Government has put in place the building blocks.  The banks must now engage with people who have distressed mortgages.  The legislation in terms of insolvency is in place.  The code of conduct is also in place.  The banks, as the Deputy knows, have been well capitalised.  As I have repeatedly said, they are better capitalised than Swiss banks in terms of their capital reserve ratios.  The banks have been given the money to either write down, write off or restructure debts in accordance with the original capital assessments completed more than 18 months ago.</p><p>  The Central Bank has agreed and accepted the suite of measures put in place to allow each of the institutions deal with this issue.  The Government wants this year to be the year when deliberate and extensive actions is taken by all of the financial institutions to bring this over the line and to get on with the task of restructuring people's mortgages, where appropriate.  Deputy McGrath is correct that this will have to be done on a case-by-case basis.  The banks have been given the tools and capital to address the issue.  It is now the task of Government to drive this process forward and to ensure the banks are accountable to the people who have well capitalised them over a period of years.  The Government expects extensive delivery on this programme in 2013.  The matter is being monitored at Government and departmental level.  The Department of Finance is involved on a daily basis with bringing this issue to some conclusion.  We expect to see results this year.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, for attending in the D&aacute;il.  I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has much on his hands at present.</p><p>  As chairperson of the all-party interest group in the D&aacute;il on sexual and reproductive health rights and population and development, I raised this issue last year with some of my colleagues hoping to ensure we would use our EU Presidency to prioritise gender equality and maternal and child health.  I raise it again at the start of our Presidency to encourage the T&aacute;naiste to highlight the importance and urgency of these issues at the various opportunities which will arise for us during the Presidency, namely, the EU budget discussions, the post millennium development goals, MDG, framework discussions and at the conference we will host in April on health, nutrition and climate change.  Specifically I want this issue fresh in the mind of the T&aacute;naiste next week when we host an informal meeting of EU development aid Ministers and the High Representative.  These are talks in advance of the global discussions on the post-2015 development framework.  The Minister of State is aware, as are we all, that the EU contributes a staggering 55% of all world aid so what we prioritise and what we want to bring to the fore carries weight.  We need to use our position to focus specifically on sexual and reproductive health rights which have been losing focus and support in recent times with absolutely catastrophic results for millions of women throughout the world.</p><p>  The prime development goal is to end hunger and poverty.  Ireland has always had a particular and historic motivation in this regard.  Ending hunger crucially depends on a healthy educated female population in the developing world.  Reproductive health care and access to family planning allow women to have some say in the number of children they have and when they have them.  Without this, they and their children are subject to a cycle of poverty which no amount of food aid can ever alleviate.</p><p>  The recent report on the mapping of EU development aid and population assistance showed the total population assistance from the EU institutions is less than 2% of overseas development aid.  It also shows, and I am very sorry to have to say this, that Ireland's population assistance as a percentage of overseas development aid is declining.  It may be only a marginal decline but it shows that population assistance generally is losing priority even in our aid programmes.</p><p>  I do not want to suggest that other goals are less important.  Rather I contended that achieving all of the MDGs depends on access to contraception by women, who are for the most part the breadwinners, farmers and providers in their societies.  Countless millions of lives depend on the good health of these women.  This is not just my contention; it is an established fact that access to family planning goes hand in hand with improvements in health and increased prosperity.  Giving women control over their fertility and better reproductive health care is the single biggest contribution we can make to sustainable development in the poorest countries and this is what overseas development aid is all about.  This is the message I hope will be brought to the informal EU aid Ministers' meeting next week so it is prioritised in the development of the post-2015 development goals.  In fact, it should be more than prioritised; it should be central to the framework because it is fundamental to the achievement of the other goals.</p></speech>

He thanks Deputy Mitchell for raising this very important issue and apologises that he cannot be here.  He will monitor the debate and the Deputy's contribution.</p><p>  The provision of reproductive health services, including family planning services, is essential in tackling the continuing high rates of maternal mortality in the developing world.  The position Ireland takes on sexual and reproductive health is based on a firm commitment to the programme of actions agreed at the international conference on population and development, ICPD, in Cairo in 1994.  The ICPD set out a number of principles on reproductive health issues including the importance of gender equality and the empowerment of women to reduce poverty and vulnerability; the right of all women to the information and means to make autonomous decisions about their fertility; and the link between women's control over their own fertility and the wider empowerment of women in economic, social and political life.</p><p>  Ireland has a strong record of support for the provision of family planning services for women in developing countries, through our funding and our policy work at EU and global levels.  We assist access to family planning services in countries where such services are considered inadequate, including in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and Somalia.  In 2011, as Deputy Mitchell is aware, Ireland spent &euro;6.75 million on reproductive health services.  At a global level in the past six years, Ireland has contributed more than &euro;34 million to the reproductive, maternal health and family planning programmes of the United Nation's Population Fund, UNFPA, and is one of its top core funders.  In addition to specific support for reproductive health services, we also invest heavily in building up national health systems to ensure the sustainability of all health services.</p><p>  As the Deputy stated, the EU is also a major supporter of reproductive health services through its geographic support instruments and through thematic funding.  For example, since 2007 the EU has allocated &euro;580 million to health programmes including reproductive health programmes under its thematic programme Investing in People.  The EU and its member states are the largest providers of development assistance in the world, providing more than 55% of global overseas development aid.  This will remain the case under the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  The Irish Presidency supports President Van Rompuy in his efforts to secure a deal on the MFF and we have sought to ensure that a fair proportion of the EU budget is allocated to development assistance.  Ireland's EU Presidency comes at a crucial period for international development policy as discussions commence on the framework for global development after 2015, the target date for the millennium development goals.  A key priority for Ireland's Presidency will be to ensure the EU adopts a strong coherent position and takes a lead in the discussions on the future of development policy and practice.  As the international community opens discussions on the framework for global development after 2015, we will continue to highlight the MDG targets where least progress has been made, including maternal mortality.</p><p>  On 15 and 16 April, the Government and the Mary Robinson Foundation-Climate Justice will convene in Dublin an international conference on hunger, nutrition and climate justice.  The objective is to listen to and learn from the experiences of local people, particularly women, and to inspire innovative thinking and solutions to inform a new approach to addressing hunger, nutrition and climate change.  Women are essential drivers of positive change in our fight against hunger, undernutrition and negative effects of climate change.  They play a crucial role in tackling these major global challenges, not least because the majority of smallholder farmers in the developing world are women, but also because women have primary responsibility for producing and preparing food for their families and caring for children.  Empowering women and strengthening their decision-making role at household level and giving women the same opportunities as men to boost their agricultural productivity to meet the food and nutritional needs of their families and adapt to climate change will be central to the conference discussions.  The Government will continue to prioritise women's reproductive health and family planning and we will work closely with our EU, UN and other partners to ensure improved access to family planning services for women and girls is central to the post-2015 development agenda.</p></speech>

Ireland has always had a human rights-based approach to development.  If we want to eliminate hunger and poverty, as I have repeatedly stated we do, we must include the rights of the poorest women in the world to equality of opportunity.  Without sexual and reproductive rights and access to family planning services these women have absolutely no opportunities, never mind equality of opportunity, and cannot pull themselves and their children out of the cycle of poverty to which they are condemned.</p><p>The MDG-5 target is now the furthest from being attained and progress is slowest in sub-Saharan Africa.  Over 250,000 people are dying annually in childbirth due to the lack of maternity care.  The awful thing is that instead of improving, the rate of progress is slowing down.  Failure in this area is at least partly due to the fact that the target 5b, which was to ensure universal access to reproductive health, was initially omitted from the millennium development goals.  This time it is essential that, far from being a tag-on, it is central to the new post-2015 development framework.</p></speech>

We are already in discussions on the multiannual financial framework, or MFF, negotiations which is the financial envelope for the EU over the next seven years.  Within those discussions it is crucially important that we continue to have the overseas development aid budget enhanced and supported in circumstances where there is real pressure on that expenditure.</p><p>  As the Deputy has rightly articulated, there is precious little use in having that money unless one can tie it to the reproductive and maternal rights of women, in such countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  Deputy Mitchell has articulated the Government's view and that is the position we will be advancing during the EU Presidency.  It is something the Government holds dear, that with funding and support, rights must come for women in their own countries.  In order to make the kind of progress we all want to see, those rights must be enforced by those countries that are giving the money in the first instance.  It is something we take very seriously in the context of the negotiations of which we are a part.</p></speech>

This facility was to provide community nursing home beds in one of the most disadvantaged areas, which includes a large ageing population.  The facility contains state-of-the-art facilities, yet it remains closed for its intended purpose.  It was built as part of an overall plan to regenerate St. Michael's estate, as well as being next to the primary health care unit which is going well.  The latter unit is a credit to those who had that vision.  At the time, the community nursing home facility was part of an overall plan to provide public nursing home care not only in the 50-bed unit in St. Michael's estate, but also in Br&uacute; Caoimhgh&iacute;n where additional beds were to be built, and the Meath Hospital.</p><p>  There was an overall plan that all these beds would surround St. James's Hospital, which is one of the busiest hospitals in the country.  They were being provided to facilitate the release of patients who required convalescent aftercare, rather than being stuck in acute beds thus blocking the transfer of patients from accident and emergency units and elsewhere.  Newspaper reports have referred to them as &quot;bed-blockers&quot;.  I do not believe they are bed blockers but they do need a different level of care.  The facilities to which I am referring are within a mile of St. James's Hospital.  It is illogical, economically and otherwise, to have a facility of this size sitting unused in an area that is crying out for it.</p><p>  Over the past year, I have visited many patients in St. James's and Tallaght hospitals.  Many of them needed to be transferred to a nursing home, but the system puts them into private health care.  This is the privatisation agenda which has been carried on from the last Government to this one.  I appeal to the Minister of State to announce that these beds will be opened, so that patients can be transferred from a public hospital to a public community health care facility.</p><p>  It beggars belief why such a building is there.  Anyone who visits it will see that it is a beautiful building on the grounds of the old St. Michael's school next to the primary health care centre.  At some stage, this Government or a future Administration will have significant scope to regenerate the area, which has suffered the trials and tribulations of being disadvantaged and ignored for many years.  </p><p>  The financial logic of opening this facility is that it would allow beds to be freed up in St. James's Hospital so that it could become more effective and efficient in the use of hospital space.  In that instance, one would not see the Minister for Health cutting &euro;9 million from St. James's Hospital because it would prove it is well capable of delivering efficiencies.  </p><p>  We carried out a petition in the local area, asking local people what was happening.  They had raised the issue with us on quite a number of occasions in the past few years.  I will be presenting the Minister with a petition tomorrow containing over 600 signatures.  That was just from the near vicinity and we did not go beyond that.  We asked them what their demands were concerning this facility.  The primary demand was to open it now and not leave it sitting there closed.  It is a living disgrace.</p></speech>

Apart from it being within my own remit, I know something about this particular community nursing home in Inchicore because Deputy Catherine Byrne is continually raising the matter.  There is concern in the area as to how a state-of-the-art building - which cost &euro;10 million, not &euro;12 million, although it is a substantial figure - could remain closed.</p><p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that patients receive the highest standard of care in the appropriate settings, be they acute, community or residential.  As the Deputy is aware, these are challenging times for the Health Service Executive in respect of all services.  In the case of community nursing units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  In this regard, all developments have to be addressed in light of current economic and budgetary pressures.  Any decision taken by the HSE must have regard to this and the current recruitment moratorium, which is significant concerning this particular unit.  </p><p>  The 50-bed community nursing unit at the former St. Michael's estate in Inchicore was planned as one of a network of units across the Dublin mid-Leinster region to address the projected demand for future long-term care provision.  The public sector moratorium has severely limited the HSE's ability to commission new staff-intensive services and this has delayed the commissioning and opening of the Inchicore facility.  </p><p>  During 2012, the HSE proposed to move staff and patients from St. Brigid's Hospital, Crooksling to Inchicore thereby allowing for the closure of the older unit at St. Brigid's Hospital.  However, having regard to the wishes of the patients at St. Brigid's Hospital and the need to maximise the level of service provision in the region, it was decided to maintain services at Crooksling and to explore alternative proposals for the Inchicore unit.  I am sure the Deputy was involved in that as well.</p><p>  In light of the public sector moratorium and significant additional reductions in staff numbers required over the next two years, one option being pursued is that of a public private partnership agreement.  The HSE has successfully used this model to open a 100-bed unit for older persons at Ballincollig, County Cork.  This unit delivers real cost benefits and value to the system which would not be possible through direct employment.  It also deals creatively with the moratorium. </p><p>  The current position is that a project team has been appointed within the HSE to progress this project, including representatives from general management, human resources, finance and procurement.  A detailed draft specification has been prepared on the service requirement for the Inchicore unit, to be used in the tendering process with the preferred provider panel.</p><p>In addition, a detailed briefing note and associated documentation is being finalised at present in preparation for an engagement with the relevant trade unions in line with the requirements under the public sector agreement.  The engagement with the unions, which must be completed before proceeding to tender stage, will commence shortly.  Once the tender process commences, the HSE anticipates that a tender should be awarded within three months.  The Inchicore building has been used by HSE services until recently and these services have been relocated in preparation for its opening as a community nursing home.  I know this will be welcomed by the Deputy.</p></speech>

There were construction costs, site costs, site development costs and equipment costs of &euro;8.6 million, &euro;1.8 million, &euro;1.4 million and &euro;0.6 million, respectively, amounting to &euro;12.4 million, not including whatever costs have arisen subsequently during the two years in which it has been sitting idle.</p><p>  This unit was not originally meant to be a replacement for St. Brigid's Hospital and nor was it intended to be a replacement for the 50 beds located in Br&uacute; Caoimhgh&iacute;n.  This unit was meant to provide an additional 50 beds into the system but now it appears as though it will result in the addition of 50 beds to the private system-----</p></speech>

Would it not be more logical to grant the facility to St. James's Hospital, if the HSE no longer wishes to have anything to do with it, and allow that public hospital to run it to service its needs?  I have to hand figures indicating that in October 2012, St. James's Hospital had more than 50 patients awaiting discharge and placement in long-term care beds and I do not believe the situation has improved greatly subsequently.  These patients obviously would take up all the beds contained in this unit.  Moreover, as it is located one mile down the road, were any issues to arise with those patients, they could be transferred quickly back to St. James's Hospital.  In addition, more than 20 patients in Tallaght hospital were awaiting precisely the same placement in long-term care beds.  All such long-term care beds are being facilitated in the private sector and this constitutes the privatisation of the health service.  I appeal to the Minister of State, as a Labour Party Minister in particular, to oppose any privatisation, whether through public private partnerships or by way of subsidising private nursing homes in such a fashion.  I appeal to her to open this facility as a public-run unit available to members of the public.  It is illogical for it to sit there.  While it is welcome that the Minister of State is contemplating action, I note the action is for it to be run not as a public facility but as a private facility paid for by the public.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500034#GG01600"><p>When setting out the 1986 legislation, Ministers of the day spoke of the need for public trust and confidence in the operation of a State lottery and they were absolutely correct in this assertion.  The fact that An Post has held the national lottery licence over the past 25 years has in itself instilled trust in the lottery and an affinity with the brand.  Understandably, there is concern about the new licence holder and a question as to whether the public interest will be of concern to the new operator and whether the integrity of the lottery will be upheld.  The response to this question is not straightforward.  Moreover, failure to engage with beneficiaries of national lottery funding before and after the introduction of this legislation has only added to this concern.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, seeks to change significantly the national lottery business model, making it more commercially attractive, as he perceives it, with the objective of generating the much-talked about upfront payment.  This naturally makes people jumpy.  It no longer will be a method by which citizens can take part in a lottery hoping to win a cash prize for themselves while at the same time contributing financially to their local communities.  Under Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the national lottery will become a mechanism by which the Government can generate additional revenue.  This completely undermines the ethos of the lottery but is completely in line with the Administration's small government view of the world.</p><p>  Concerns have lingered over the years that national lottery funding for communities has in fact replaced funding of services that should be paid for directly by the State and such concerns undoubtedly will heighten under the current regime.  The bord snip nua report of 2009 by the economist Professor Colm McCarthy only served to heighten these fears when he recommended to the Government that the Exchequer element of national lottery funding should be removed, thereby saving a miserly &euro;1.8 million annually.  Concerns remain that while the Government has not publicly signed up to this proposition, it may instead quietly act on Professor McCarthy's recommendation.  There also are missed opportunities that may arise.  For example, the Bill does not include the provision of moneys that could have been generated and allocated for the decade of centenary celebrations.  In 1988, the lottery provided &pound;700,000 towards the celebration of the Dublin city millennium and again in 1992 for Ireland's participation in Seville's Expo.  The Government could have worked with An Post to create a really exciting engagement with citizens to encourage their participation in raising funds to celebrate our great history locally and nationally.  Time and time again, the Government fails to embrace big ideas and real opportunities.</p><p>  The Government's capital programme announcement of late 2011 stated boldly that it intended to use the upfront payment from the new national lottery operator to fund the national children's hospital.  It appears as though this capital funding commitment has now been watered down to receipt of just one third of the projected proceeds from the upfront payment.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify the purpose to which the Government intends to use the balance of the proceeds from the aforementioned upfront payment and how much of it will go towards the construction of the hospital.  The failure of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to provide for the national children's hospital in the capital expenditure budget probably tells one all one needs to know about the Government's attitude towards children.  It is a fact that since Fine Gael and Labour Party entered government in 2011, low-income households have become worse off.  Single-parent families, the majority of whom are headed by women, have been a particular target.  The bottom line is that priority projects such as the children's hospital must be budgeted for in real capital expenditure.</p><p>  The Minister has spoken at length about stimulus and job creation but as always, he has done little about it.  Over the past year, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have created slightly more than 10,000 net jobs.  That equates to one job for every 33 people who are unemployed.  It is clear the actions of the Government do not reflect the scale of the problem.  Despite the potential for capital investment and the unemployment crisis, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have cut the capital expenditure budget.  While there have been successive announcements of so-called stimulus and capital projects, little is happening by way of delivery.  Even Europe has warned against the withdrawal of capital investment.  In May 2012, the European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi, specifically called on national governments to deal with deficits without interfering with capital or investment expenditure.</p><p> The Minister cut the 2012 capital expenditure budget by &euro;775 million, which would pay for the St. James's Hospital site proposal nearly twice over, according to the figures from the Minister for Health.  If protecting children was a policy priority of the Government, the children's hospital would be front and centre in the capital budget.  It is not and we all know why.</p><p> Retailers have been central to the success of the national lottery over the past 25 years, advocating the brand and copper-fastening its integrity.  Small retailers have become increasingly dependent on the modest margin paid as the crisis has bedded in.  The Bill does not provide for specifics about the margin to be paid to retail agents and this offers no comfort to small local businesses who need every little bit of support they can get.</p><p> The Retail Grocery, Dairy and Allied Trades Association has stated the organisation was assured by the Minister and his officials that the modest margin of 6% paid to retail agents would be ring-fenced in this legislation, but it is not.  Did the Minister make this commitment to the association and, if so, on what basis did he renege on his promise?  If the 6% margin is to be protected within the licence agreement, why can it not also be included in the legislation?</p><p> As stated earlier, the Minister has offered no solid reason to establish the office of a national lottery regulator.  Could this role be fulfilled by his Department instead of creating another office of public administration at arm&rsquo;s length from Government responsibility?  The operator will fund the regulator's office by way of a levy, but the consumer will ultimately carry the cost.  I note section 15 allows for a 12-month &quot;cooling off&quot; period after a person has ceased to be the regulator, but why is the period just 12 months?  The programme for Government makes a commitment to amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant, including political appointees, or Minister can work in the private sector in any area involving a potential conflict of interest with a former area of public employment until at least two years have elapsed after leaving the public service.</p><p> I do not understand the lack of consistency by this Government in adhering to its own commitments.  To date, the Government has not made any effort to action this promise and in some instances it appears to be ignoring it completely.  Over the past couple of weeks, a member of the shareholder management unit in the Department of Finance, seconded from the National Treasury Management Agency, has resigned and been appointed as a chief executive in the Bank of Ireland.  Before leaving the Department of Finance the former head of the shareholder management unit dealt with the sale of &euro;1 billion of capital contingency notes held by Bank of Ireland.  Such a scenario in the private sector is absolutely inconceivable, and middle and senior managers have par for the course cooling off period clauses in their standard contracts in small and medium enterprises and multinationals alike.</p><p> Will the Minister confirm that national lottery winnings are to remain tax free?  Section 49 of the Bill allows for the sharing of information with both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  The Minister announced last year that his Department was working with financial advisers, Davy, to structure the new licence to ensure an &quot;alignment of interests between good cause beneficiaries and the new operator&quot;.  Will the Minister provide a little more detail as to what this involved and perhaps a sample of the good cause beneficiaries Davy dealt with?  Will the Minister confirm that potential operators who have expressed an interest to date in the national lottery licence are not also clients of Davy?</p><p> Rehab has brought a High Court challenge against the Minister for Justice and Equality&rsquo;s decision to phase out the charitable lotteries scheme.  Charities received &euro;6 million under the scheme in 2011, of which &euro;4.4 million went to Rehab.  I do not expect the Minister to comment on the case but it would be helpful to understand if the case will hamper the efforts of the legislation before us today.</p><p> I have raised a number queries during the course of my contribution and I hope they will be addressed when the Minister wraps up the debate.</p></speech>

Studies recently done by lecturers in University College, Cork, have suggested that the national lottery is socially regressive as the least well-off play it most and pay the most, although they do not receive the same amount of benefit as expended on lottery tickets.  The good causes which the lottery finances do not adequately compensate for the cost or expense of buying lottery tickets in working class areas and poorer sections of the community.  We should consider this study as the lottery is now established, whether the idea was good, bad or indifferent, and it has become a means to fund or otherwise resource good causes of various kinds.  There is no doubt that it has done that in many areas, including sports, community development, heritage, tourism and transport.  It has undoubtedly provided significant benefit to all sorts of groups and good causes.  We should nevertheless examine more closely the issue of where the money that is generated is being targeted.  Although many people play the game, it is played more, with more money spent, by people with the least.</p><p>  We should be honest because to a certain extent the appeal is precisely to people who are struggling in the hope that a big win in the lottery might get them out of a life of struggle and toil, or just about being able to manage to pay the bills or the mortgage or look after the kids.  The attraction is greater to the least well off, and the statistics and figures bear this out.  If this is where most of the expenditure on tickets is coming from, most of the benefit for good causes should go back to those sections of society that are less well off.</p><p>  Given that the lottery is established and is probably here to stay, the Government's position is that nothing is changing with the lottery licence.  It would have been put out to tender again and whoever offers the best deal will get it.  There is no big change in that regard, although we will get a bonus of financing the children's hospital.  We should be absolutely clear and we all want to see the children's hospital being built, and it should be funded as a matter of priority.  To attach the two issues is not sufficient to justify a move to privatise a State asset for the benefit of people in the private sector.</p><p>Ultimately, the losers will be the economy, society, the retailers who act as lottery sales agents and the players of the lottery who, as I noted, tend to be disproportionately centred in the less well-off sections of society.</p><p><br /> When the lottery was privatised in the United Kingdom, Camelot, one of the companies in the mix for our national lottery licence, won the contract and significantly increased the price of lottery tickets, to the point that it provoked a major boycott of the lottery.  As a private company interested in profit, Camelot decided to jack up prices because it believed it had a captive market of people who wanted to play the lottery.  As is the case with most private corporations, it also started to pay enormous amounts of money to its executives.  In one year, Camelot set aside &pound;8 million to pay bonuses to those at the top of the company.  As is usually the case where there is a large cash cow, the corporate executives at the top milked the British lottery for everything it was worth.  There is no reason to believe this will not occur under the new terms the Government is proposing for the award of the national lottery licence. </p><p><br /> Significantly, the Government is proposing to allow for an annual profit line, whereas the current position is that An Post, a semi-State company, receives &#8364;2.7 million per annum for managing the national lottery.  We know how much An Post receives under the licence, whereas under the new terms it will be possible to adjust the annual profit line.  If the company awarded the licence makes such an adjustment, there is no doubt it will take a bigger slice of the cake, boost salaries for executives and apply pressure to increase the price of lottery tickets.  These changes are inevitable if the licence is awarded to Camelot or another private corporate interest.  </p><p><br /> The Government has tried to argue that under its proposal it will not make any difference if An Post is awarded the national lottery licence or if it goes to Camelot or a similar company.  There is, however, a big difference because as a semi-State company, the activities of the former in respect of how it runs and manages the lottery are subject to a much greater degree of control by the Government, Minister, elected representatives and members of the public than the activities of a fully private, for-profit corporation.  </p><p><br /> Retailers are another group that could potentially be affected by a new dynamic operating in the lottery if it is run by a company such as Camelot.  As I noted, the national lottery sales agents are concerned that the 6% of sales they receive may no longer be guaranteed.</p><p><br /> In light of my concerns, I do not accept that it is a good idea to move towards what is effectively a full-scale privatisation of a State asset.  The Government will, I am sure, argue that the sale of the national lottery will deliver upfront cash for the national children's hospital.  The figures in the Bills digest provided by the Library and Research Service show there is no reason the children's hospital could not be financed through current contributions to good causes from the national lottery.  In 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the national lottery provided &#8364;267 million, &#8364;263 million, &#8364;243 million and &#8364;231 million, respectively, to good causes.  For the past five or six years, therefore, it has consistently provided roughly &#8364;250 million to good causes.  There is no reason to believe, given the consistency of these figures, that the national lottery will not continue to provide funding of this magnitude to good causes, especially given the potential for expansion through online sales and so forth.  If it is certain that this sum will be generated for good causes every year, we could earmark &#8364;50 million per annum for five years to pay the estimated &#8364;250 million cost of the children's hospital.  Why can we not do this and maintain the current arrangement under which the national lottery is run and managed by An Post?  This option has the advantage of having a set management fee of only &#8364;2.7 million compared to the proposed moving profit line, which will benefit the likes of Camelot and other private interests. </p><p><br /> We can secure a better deal by simply deciding to allocate &#8364;50 million of lottery revenue towards the cost of financing the children's hospital.  The Government's argument that we need to go down the road of privatisation to finance the children's hospital does not stack up because this objective could be as easily achieved by maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  Choosing the latter would also allow the State to maintain more control of the national lottery and allay the concerns of retailers and the workforce of the national lottery.  The latter is another significant group in this process and they are deeply worried about their future as a result of the move to award the contract to another entity.</p><p><br /> The Government does not need to proceed with its proposal.  Its argument about the national children's hospital is a red herring because, as matters stand, the hospital could be built using national lottery funding.  If the Minister of State was not aware of that, he is now because I have just told him that it could be achieved by allocating &#8364;50 million of the &#8364;250 million we are virtually guaranteed to receive every year to the hospital project for five years. </p><p><br /> There is no need to dispose of this State asset.  The national lottery workforce and An Post have done a good job and we can get a children's hospital without messing with a formula that has worked.  The Government should not let its ideological inclination towards privatisation colour the fact that the current deal is fine.  We do not need to go down this route to get a hospital or continue to finance the good causes funded by the national lottery.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1090" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500036#JJ00200"><p>I am pleased to speak to this Bill, which has a number of worrying aspects.  To pick up on the contributions of previous speakers, why fix something that is not broken?  I hope the Government will not use the old flogging horse of the children's hospital.  Goodness knows, that project has been delayed for far too long and far too much money has been wasted on consultants and planners.</p><p>As the Acting Chairman knows from his county, a good pre-planning meeting with planners is recommended regardless of the size of the project.  How in God's name and after so much time and money have been spent did we decide on a site that is out of kilter with what the parents want?  I ask an honest question - who is codding whom?  In the final analysis, the sick children and their parents are suffering.  It is outrageous that so much money could be wasted on a vital project with nothing to show for it.</p><p><br /> Unfortunately, this is a continuation of what occurred during the Celtic tiger years.  So-called consultants and experts have built up a gravy train industry of codding people and relieving private citizens and, in this instance, taxpayers of their hard earned revenue in return for a ball of smoke.</p><p><br /> The national lottery was set up in 1986 or 1988.  I fully support it, but I seldom buy tickets for it.  I have a small story to tell of how I realised how much of a catch it was.  It was a wet, stormy Saturday evening and I was called out by Waterford County Council because a tree had fallen across a road.  The Acting Chairman would be aware of the place.  There was no hope of removing the tree.  It was a major road near Clonmel.  We were going okay, although traffic needed to be turned back and people were inconvenienced.  Two old dears arrived in a Mini Minor at 7.50 p.m.  When we explained to them that the road was closed and they did not have a hope of getting through, they were furious.  I thought that they were going to mass or somewhere else, but they wanted to go to a shop to buy a ticket for the lotto before it closed.  This is why I want the real impact of the lotto and why people are interested in playing it investigated.  It is a form of gambling.  People have issues with gambling.  In the main, however, and taking Deputy Boyd Barrett's remarks on the common good and the amount of funding for projects, community groups and clubs in all of our constituencies, it must be supported and protected.</p><p><br /> The lotto was set up in 1986, drawing on the success of similar projects in other countries.  This is an important point.  When legislation was brought before the Oireachtas, the then Minister of State, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, stated: &quot;The function of the lottery will be to generate surplus funds that will benefit our community in a number of ways, without the need for recourse to taxation or other compulsory revenue raising measures.&quot;  We were just out of a recession at the time - it was a long time ago - but those words were no more appropriate than they are today.  We have taken the recourse to taxation and introduced legislation as a result of the devastating crash in the economy, orders for this and that, pension levies and who knows what else.</p><p><br /> We must be extremely careful lest we denigrate the good work done by people in the national lottery and An Post in handling the lotto.  We had the surety of the costs that An Post would receive every year.  We have closed the stable door after the horse has bolted too many times.  Let us step back in these punitive and recessionary times and ensure that we do not give away another golden jewel or allow another group of consultants who were appointed to look into this matter for us to recommend separating agencies from the State.  Maybe some of their friends worked for those agencies yesterday, last year or whenever or might work for them next year.  This merry game has gone on for too long.  We need to make haste slowly.</p><p><br /> After prizes and expenses have been paid, surplus funds are to be used for sport and other recreational activities, national culture - including Gaeilge, sin go hiontach ar fad - the arts, the health of the community - an important project - and such other purposes and in such amounts as the Government may determine from time to time.  This bit can be worrying, as we have all lobbied.  As a backbencher, I lobbied the last Government for groups.  That was what we were elected to do.  I will not say too much about it.  For &quot;such other purposes&quot;, public notice must be given in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  It covers youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.</p><p><br /> These areas embrace the entire range of society.  We have seen the benefits that national lottery funding has brought to the arts.  It has certainly brought benefits to sports and recreation.  We all know clubs that do not have facilities.  There are some sad cases.  There is one in Clonmel, a boxing club with which I have been involved and that has not been successful.  Many hundreds and thousands of clubs have state-of-the-art facilities and are of considerable social benefit to their communities.  We must protect, enhance and support this aspect.  We can never allow room for fat cats to get fatter.  We must have surety of tenure.  I see from the Bill that the licence will last for 20 years instead of ten.  We must ensure that we do not make a mistake and that consultants do not bring in glossy reports to hoodwink officials and elected politicians, as they often seem capable of doing.</p><p><br /> From the graph given to us, money for good causes amounted to &#8364;173 million in 2002.  In other years, the amounts were &#8364;187 million and &#8364;191 million.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett stated, more than &#8364;250 million was provided over a couple of years in the boom times.  The provision was still standing strong at &#8364;243 million in 2010 and at &#8364;231.9 million in 2011.  These are considerable amounts.  They have given a lifeline to many a club, society and arts group in RAPID areas when RAPID funding was being cut.  Projects were supported by the national lottery with funds that deprived areas would never have seen otherwise.  They could not expect to get anything through philanthropy.  They paid into the lotto and enjoyed having a flutter on it.  There might have been some excessive cases, but people felt that the lotto money was a payback into their communities.  While some studies have found that lower socio-economic groupings did not get as much as they should have, that the money was ploughed into community groups has been seen with a great degree of respect, understanding and appreciation.</p><p><br /> I regularly salute the doers in communities.  They are the enablers.  We would have a far poorer country if we did not have club and social committee activists, entrepreneurs in social housing, sports committees, sports clubs and so on.  Look at our playgrounds and everything else.  These people are volunteers.  We must be one of the best countries in this area.  For this reason, we must not change the law and allow significant wages to be paid to the chief executives of boards.  Another regulator with a framework is being set up.  We cannot allow growth in this area or support to be pulled back from communities.</p><p><br /> I was in London yesterday with a committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We frankly and honestly discussed credit unions.  I am convinced by my conclusion - British credit unions are not of the same ilk as ours.  Ours are of the people, for the people and by the people.  In England, there is a different attitude and credit unions are not as bottoms-up in structure.  For that reason, this money is imperative if we are to allow the enablers to continue working on valuable projects across a range of areas from sport to health in their communities.  Some years ago, there was a healthy community project in Ballingarry in my constituency.</p><p>It was a fabulous project.  We can see what has been achieved.  We can also see the transformations that have been achieved in association with the "John Murray Show".  This work was being done and was funded and supported by the HSE in communities a decade or more ago.  We must be careful in what we do.  One could ask why one would draft legislation to introduce a change to allow a resource as valuable as the lottery to be eroded or undermined.  It behoves all of us to take such a stand.</p><p> I will stray a little from the Bill if the Acting Chairman allows me.  Challenges face the Waterford Leader Partnership and the two Tipperary Leader Partnership programmes.  They are enablers.  The system was set up by the Government and led the way with a bottom-up approach.  Groups apply to them for money and they spend it willingly.  Sometimes they got money in this area as well.  We must challenge the attack on such partnership programmes because they know what is happening and they can deal with it.  I disagree with the intention to hand over responsibility in this area to county councils.  I was a member of a county council for ten years and I do not knock local authority officials.  However, county councils are regulatory bodies.  People see their role as levying rates, granting planning permission and controlling waste management, not as a front-line stimulator of community projects.  The Minister and his officials are making a fundamental mistake in that regard.  We must support and nurture those fledgling organisations.  The one group that was doing such work was the enterprise boards and latterly the development companies.  They have done tremendous work.  The South Tipperary Development Company had considerable difficulties during its gestation period but we got over it.  We have a fabulous CEO and great staff who give above and beyond the call of duty.  One could ask why we would do anything to damage the good models that have been created.</p><p> To return to the Bill, the same is true of the national lottery.  Perhaps the lottery needs fine-tuning but we do not need to give it to a company that would see it as a vehicle to improve its balance sheet.  We do not need uncertainty on the cost of running such a project.  Neither would we have to set up a regulator and team to conduct investigations.  I accept regulations are required and penalties for wrongdoing.  I salute the retailers of rural and urban Ireland who handle the sale of lottery tickets.  We all have a chance to enjoy such entertainment as we had at the weekend in Tipperary when we thought Lar Corbett had become a multimillionaire.  He had to deny it on Twitter.  That could only happy in a small rural town or village where everyone knows everyone else and everyone knows what is going on and can see the benefits.  It appears that Lar was not the winner so he will have to go back into training and play more games.  I wish him well.  I also congratulate him on his wedding.</p><p> While I accept that we must make some changes, we must make haste slowly.  We must support and enhance the system.  Whether one is in the heart of the city or the most rural part of the country, we must consider the benefits that have been achieved by community groups with the support of lottery funding.  Much lottery funding has been wagered in communities where tickets have been bought.  The lottery is a success story.  Great satisfaction has resulted from it.  Sports capital funding grants for this year are to be revisited again.  They bring great succour and support to groups that are hard-pressed.  We must return to the words of the then Minister of State, Jim O'Keeffe, when he set up the lottery because the words were never more appropriate than they are now: &quot;The function of the lottery will be to generate surplus funds that will benefit our community in a number of ways without the need for recourse to taxation or other compulsory revenue-raising measures.&quot;  That says it all.

If ever we needed to sweat our assets it is now in Ireland&rsquo;s hour of greatest need, or what we hope is our greatest need.  I am conscious that we are coming under a certain amount of pressure from the troika to get on with the sale of State assets to which the previous Government committed.  The troika must be conscious that the timing of the disposal of assets generally, not the lottery in particular, but of any asset, is crucial to its outcome and success.</p><p>  As I understand it, in this case and probably in all cases of asset disposal, the proceeds will go at least indirectly towards paying down debt.  We also have approval from the troika to use at least half the funding in job creation measures.  It is only through getting people back into jobs that we will have any hope of paying down and keeping down our debt in the long term.  As others have stated, some of the proceeds at least will go towards funding the badly-needed new children&rsquo;s hospital.  That in itself will be a major construction project with a significant and welcome employment content.  It will be most welcome in an industry that has been devastated by the recession.</p><p>  While I support in principle the concept of raising funds by way of a long-term licence, I have some concerns about the fact that we are giving a licence at the same time giving the opportunity for the exploitation of the Internet for the first time not just to buy tickets for existing games, but also for new and possibly lucrative new games.  The potential has not been explored to date by An Post, perhaps because it is precluded from doing so by the legislative arrangements governing the lottery.  Internet potential is being specifically opened up now.  The Minister said some time ago that it is being done specifically, understandably, to make the lottery more attractive to potential bidders.  My concern is that if we offer a 20-year licence at a time when we have no idea how lucrative the Internet games might be, that if they turn out to be successful beyond our wildest dreams, we will feel aggrieved that we have possibly undersold the present day value of a 20-year flow of substantial income.  Perhaps it would be more prudent to opt for a slightly shorter period, for example ten years, to give us an opportunity to gauge the potential of greater Internet usage by the national lottery.</p><p>  I am fully cognisant of the need for a capital lump sum and of the need to pay down debt, but I am also cognisant of the need for an annual income that would help close the &euro;15 billion deficit that is dragging us down.  It is an important judgment call for the Minister to make the choice between the certainty of a substantial upfront payment and the possibility of a substantial new flow of income as a result of more successful games through the use of the Internet and a greater flow of income.</p><p>  I hope the Minister has access to the best advice and expertise as well as knowledge of the experience elsewhere in determining the minimum acceptable tender in these slightly unknown circumstances.  Ideally, in a perfect market, and assuming a sufficient number of tenderers who are familiar with Internet potential, the tendering process itself should throw up the best price, factoring in the potential, if any, of enhanced Internet usage.  I hope that will be the case.</p><p>  I am also conscious that in a sense what is not in the Bill is of more intense interest to Members than what is in the Bill.  I find that somewhat frustrating.  I understand that many of the issues in which we as politicians are interested relate to the contract between the regulator and the prospective operator and are not matters for the Oireachtas but, nevertheless, they are issues that have been discussed by others.  I refer, for example, to the anticipated upfront value that is being sought from the sale, the percentage that will go to prizes and good causes, as well as the agent&rsquo;s remuneration and the profits for the operator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.458" nospeaker="true" time="19:35:00" ><p>These are all matters of intense public interest to Members of this House, members of the general public and to those who will impacted by whatever is the expected largesse.</p><p>An issue covered in the Bill is the requirement that a minimum of 50% of revenue would go to prizes and that is fair enough, but there are no figures for other issues such as the amount that would go to good causes or what would go to profits.  The import of the Bill is to set up the framework for the national lottery regulator, who will procure the new operator and determine the acceptability of proposed games remuneration and generally supervise the activities of the operator as well as managing the lottery fund.</p><p>The Minister mentioned that he has power to determine criteria to be considered in evaluating licences, but I am conscious that it is undoubtedly the case that the more prescriptive the criteria and the greater the attempt to control the ultimate outcome and the breakdown of the distribution of revenue, the less attractive and probably the more expensive it is for any operators and therefore it will affect the bidding.  It would not make any sense for us to insist that the current agents be retained.  I mention this because there has been some lobbying in this regard.  It would be a nonsense to insert such a provision in any contract because the new bidder may not have any agents or it may have a network of agents.  We must be careful about the conditions we insert.</p><p>The original purpose of the lottery was to support good causes without putting further pressure on the taxation system.  I would expect in setting criteria or in evaluating bids that the original purpose of the lottery would be a priority.  It is something of which we should not lose sight in the anxiety to get an upfront payment.  The main purpose of the lottery must remain the good causes.  The continuing success of the lottery depends on that.  The lottery began in the very depths of a recession in the 1980s and it was an instant success and has grown over the years.  Well done to An Post for making it the success that it is despite the difficult times we have had.  During the years it grew its revenue and while the attraction was largely the prizes, its success was in no small way due to the goodwill people had towards the lottery because they felt they were supporting all these good causes.  As was mentioned, the clubs, charities and organisations around the country that have benefited and continue to benefit from it are numerous.  It is encouraging to note how little impact these difficult times have had on lottery revenue.  Its revenue has fallen but not nearly as much as the fall in other items of discretionary spending.  I am confident that if the lottery survives this recession it can survive, prosper and grow again with the economy.</p><p>I have a number of queries about the legislation's main import, which is the setting up of the regulator's office.  I may be wrong on this but the usual role of a regulator is to ensure standards and fair competition where there is a limited number of players operating in a sector.  We have a single entity and a regulator and the operator will pay for the regulator.  That appears to be a very dependent situation; it seems there is one boss and one paymaster and the boss is being paid by the person they are supposed to be regulating.  I wonder is that the best way to go about it.  I may be nitpicking but this is something new, a departure, and it is as well to get it clarified and to have potential issues ironed out or at least anticipated.</p><p>If I had more time I would like to talk about the position of An Post and what would happen in terms of it being a possible bidder in conjunction with another bidder.  I assume it would come under this new legislation but I may get another opportunity to speak on that.</p><p>A number of Members mentioned fears about gambling.  In the original debate on the introduction of the lottery, fears were expressed about the effect it may have had in terms of gambling.  The introduction of the Internet element may bring up that spectre again as a problem but the Internet is here to stay and with supervision in that respect, we have to maximise the benefits that are available to us.  Also, it is happening in every other country.  Taxpayers have never been more pressed and account must be taken of any potential there may be to raise funding for good causes.  I fully support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500039#MM00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill.  Since the national lottery's establishment in 1986 it has provided &euro;12 billion for good causes throughout the country.  It has changed the face of the voluntary sector through the funding of such an array of deserving causes.  There is not a town or village one passes through where one does not see the beneficial effects of the national lottery and that is to be welcomed.  It has been fantastic.  An Post has done a wonderful job in overseeing the national lottery for the past number of years.  Given the precarious nature of its financial situation, it would be hoping to retain the lottery licence.  I would have a concern about the implications of the possible loss of the licence to An Post for services that the lottery benefited throughout the country in terms of the closing of small retail outlets or post offices.</p><p>  A total of &euro;231 million was provided to good causes in 2011, the last year for which we have figures.  That figure demonstrates the benefits of the national lottery.  A grant of &euro;100,000 was awarded to the cystic fibrosis organisation in my constituency which is being used to provide for cystic fibrosis facilities at Mayo General Hospital.  This will help people with the condition in that they will have the facilities they deserve and need and they will have them sooner than if the national lottery was not in place.  That provision of those facilities would have taken another two or three years to complete were it not for the grant the organisation was given, which I welcome.  The same is the case throughout the country.</p><p>  I welcome the discussion on this Bill.  I also welcome that the development of the national children's hospital, which we all want and the country badly needs, will be facilitated through this measure but I hope that will not impact on the money that will be available to other good causes as many of them are also important health facilities.</p><p>  Deputy Mitchell spoke about the public being able to buy lotto tickets on the Internet.  This is common practice in other countries but I would be slightly worried about this development for a different reason from that mentioned by the Deputy.  The explanatory memorandum states: &quot;The playing of lottery games on the internet is seen as the most likely area of growth for lottery sales in the future.&quot;  As we all know, there is a short jump between buying a lotto ticket online and developing a habit of gambling online.  As a society, we are seeing the devastating effect of gambling on families and the accessibility of online gambling sites is simply too much of a temptation for some people.  In saying that, I do not want to be a spoilsport.  The retail outlets, shops, supermarkets and the post offices very much depend on this business as well.  I hope the projected growth in Internet sales would not be at the cost of the outlets that depend on these sales for their business.  We need to be careful about how we approach this.  Do we want to be seen to be actively encouraging the buying of tickets online?  If one buys a ticket over the counter the old fashioned way, at least there is more scrutiny and it is easier to scrutinise the age of people buying tickets.  I hope there would be strict regulations, structuring and warnings given to people who go online and tend to stay online using their credit cards to chase that big win.  We do not want to solve one problem and create another.</p><p>  Another area that needs to be examined is the proportion of the revenue that will go to good causes.  I note that figure is not included in the Bill.  I understand that proportion of the revenue will not be ring-fenced and I would be a little concerned about that.  I also note that the provision of a sales margin of 6% for shopkeepers, post offices and so on will not be included in the legislation.  Are we going to see a situation where a company gets the licence and then dramatically cuts the commission to a retail trade that is already suffering and on the edge?  </p><p>  In general, the Bill is to be welcomed but there are some little warning signs that need to be looked at and teased out.  We must ensure that there will be funding for good causes, that it will be ring-fenced and that there will be a network throughout the country, in shops and so forth, where the national lottery will be available.  We must also look carefully at the growth in online sales so that we do not solve one problem and cause another by taking in enormous profits but causing massive problems in terms of addiction to gambling.</p></speech>

Perhaps Deputy McGrath would convey a welcome to the Whips of the Opposition, of whom there are three, but none of whom has managed to man the benches in the House for the last three quarters of an hour.  It is an indictment of the Opposition that we are continuously seeing Opposition benches unmanned while there are three Whips in Opposition, all of whom are probably receiving an allowance.</p></speech>

This Bill also gives us an opportunity to focus attention on the National Children's Hospital, which has been the subject of controversy for many years, particularly with regard to the funding required to build it.  A previous speaker said the national lottery was being sold.  Obviously he did not read the Bill or perhaps he read one of the leaflets he distributes on O'Connell Street on Saturday afternoons before he came in here because the national lottery is not being sold.  Rather, there will be a tendering process for the licence in order to generate money to build a children's hospital.  I do not see how people would have a difficulty with that, given that the National Children's Hospital is needed and is long overdue.  The aim is to put a State asset to good use, for a fixed period of time, in order to generate revenue.  That was one of the founding principles of the National Lottery in the sense that it was established to fund good causes.</p><p>  I agree with the sentiments of the two previous speakers, Deputies Mitchell and O'Mahony, regarding regulators.  At a recent meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, the regulator for An Post appeared and, as Deputy Mitchell correctly pointed out, that office is regulating a single entity and is often dragging An Post in and out of the Four Courts on spurious issues.  One such issue, for example, related to vanity postal addresses.  At the end of the day, the regulator pushes the cost of the legal expenses onto An Post, a company which is already struggling.  We all know the service that An Post provides in rural communities.  In that context, I would be worried about the creation of a regulator, for want of a better word.  As Deputy Mitchell rightly pointed out, this entity will not be competing with anybody.  We did not have very good experiences with regulators that were established by the previous Government, with the support of some of the Independent Deputies in the D&aacute;il, for energy and telecommunications.  We were led to believe that prices would be reduced but in actual fact they went up.  That is the legacy of the last Government and the Independents who propped it up.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the national lottery makes a considerable contribution to local communities.  The last round of funding allocations by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, blew away another cobweb or legacy of the last Government in that clubs and organisations did not have to be based in the constituency of the Minister in order to receive funding.  There was a much fairer distribution of the national lottery funding this time around, which was the original intention and clubs in my constituency and all over the country have benefitted.  In that context, it is important that we maintain the percentage of funding for good causes, going forward.  We should also distribute the funding on a much more regular basis, annually if possible.  In that way, clubs that are not successful are given an opportunity to apply again within a 12 month period.  There was a gap of a number of years in the distribution of funds and it is important that those who are not successful are at least able to know when it is likely that they will be able to reapply for funding.</p><p>  I am concerned about the office of the regulator, in terms of its size and cost.  Reference is also made to fees that might be incurred from engaging consultants.  This was a practice that ran out of control in this country under the last Administration.  We must make sure, in the context of constraints placed on the regulator in the legislation, that it is clear that its role is to maintain the national lottery, to ensure it is run properly and effectively and that persons who are underage are not allowed to purchase tickets.</p><p>  My final concern relates to the small shops and retailers around the country who have provided a service for many years.  As an Oireachtas we owe them a debt of gratitude for facilitating the sale of national lottery tickets, as well as engaging with local communities.  It is essential that the existing network is maintained and that we do not have a situation whereby a new company that bids for the licence can cherry pick locations for the installation of machines.  For instance, I would not like to see foreign multiples controlling the points of sale for national lottery tickets as a way of ensuring that people do their grocery shopping in their outlets rather than in small, local shops.  I would be very conscious of that issue and would be concerned that we do not cosy up to large retailers or multiples that might engage in anti-competitive practices.  If the regulator does nothing else, he or she should maintain the very local dimension to the distribution network.</p><p>  The Bill provides us with opportunities but I am somewhat worried about the post office network.  I wish An Post well and hope that the service it provides will continue.  The originators of the national lottery, former Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Donal Creed, deserve much praise because it has been very successful over the years.  This Bill is about providing a national children's hospital.  Deputies McLellan and Boyd Barrett would have us take out a metal detector in the hope that we might find some coins, similar to those found in Carrick-on-Suir, in order to build a children's hospital.  That is not going to happen.  We must put our State asset to use and this is a good use.  However, I have some concerns about the details of the legislation, as I have outlined here.</p></speech>

Before I go into the details of the legislation, it is important to state that the national lottery has been of great benefit to this State and its citizens.  I know that some of the nanny-State brigade have a problem with people betting a few euro or gambling a bit in an effort to win a few bob, but that is in our genes.  The Irish people like to gamble and to get a bit of fun out of life.  Then, if they lose their few euro, at least the money goes to good and deserving causes.  That is why I am concerned about any attempt to give away or sell off our State asset but in fairness to this legislation, this does not appear to be the case.  Nonetheless, we should all reflect carefully on this, particularly as some assets, like our forests, could be put to better use and generate income for the State in a downturn.  We must be extremely cautious in that regard.</p><p>  The Bill is being introduced in the context of the next licence to operate the national lottery.  The current licence expires at the end of June 2013.  The national lottery was set up by the National Lottery Act 1986 and has been run under licence by An Post ever since.  The Bill will repeal the original 1986 legislation and will establish an independent national lottery regulator.</p><p>Beyond this, it updates the legislative provisions of the licence and operation of the lottery, although with few major alterations.  Many of the details of the operation of the lottery and distribution of funds will be determined by the contents of the next licence.  </p><p><br /> These are the main issues in the Bill.  I will deal with its sections later.  It is important to get this legislation right as it will be in existence for the next 20 years.  Efficiency, accountability and delivery to the most genuine and needy cases should be the priority.  There must be no messing around or slush funds for Ministers.  That is something we all must focus on in the legislation.  </p><p><br /> To date, there has been little amendment to the original legislation governing the national lottery.  In 2011, there was a transfer of responsibility from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The terms of the licence are not included in the Bill although, under the Bill, the licence should be published and publicly available, apart from commercially sensitive information.  It is expected that the licence will be extended in duration from the current ten year period to a 20 year period, an upfront payment will be made by the new operator to the State and the current management fee will be replaced by the operator's fee, producing more company profits, although none of these terms is specified in the Bill. </p><p><br /> The rationale for this approach is to help generate funds to build a new national children's hospital.  I welcome that part of the proposal.  No figure has been adopted although figures in the region of &#8364;400 million and &#8364;600 million have been mentioned.  The primary change in the Bill is to establish an independent national lottery regulator, who will be paid by an annual levy paid by the licensee.  The Bill itself will repeal the National Lottery Bill 1986.</p><p><br /> We must zoom in on the real agenda.  The money raised will be used to build the national children's hospital.  This is a positive thing.  As an independent Deputy, I welcome that.  We have to get a move on building the national children's hospital.  There is cross-party support for the hospital.  There were differences of opinion regarding the location.  My own preferred location was the Mater hospital site.  The people of Dublin North and of Dublin bay north and across the north side of Dublin preferred that option.  The decision has been made, however, and we need action.  We need to put the protection of children at the top of the political agenda.  This issue cannot become a political football.  We have excellent staff, doctors, consultants, nurses, porters and caretakers working in our health service.  It would be fantastic to have a national children's hospital that would be an example of good practice internationally and would save children's lives.</p><p><br /> I commend the Government's brave and decent decision to introduce the new drug, kalydeco, for cystic fibrosis patients.  It is a very costly drug, but the Government has done a compassionate thing for the 120 patients directly affected.  If there is a funding issue in the future, some scheme should be put in place with all-party agreement.  I met representatives of Vertex, the company that manufactures kalydeco, when they came to Ireland and met a group of Deputies last summer.  I was impressed by their submission.  They went to the Minister for Health and the HSE, and the political decision was then made by the Minister and the Taoiseach.  I welcome that.  The duty of an Opposition Deputy is to hold the Government to account but if the Government does the right thing, there is nothing wrong with commending it.  I commend the Government on this action.  As someone who has been working on the cystic fibrosis issue for many years, this is an important decision and good luck to all the families affected by cystic fibrosis.  They deserve it.   </p><p><br /> Sections of the Bill deal with issues such as communities and health.  This morning, I was in the Darndale estate, an area in the new constituency of Dublin bay north, which could do with money for youth services, the drugs issue and housing and health issues.  Last Monday, I attended a public meeting in Howth to deal with the development of the town of Howth.  Let us look at sensible proposals for putting excess money into places like Darndale and Howth to develop the economy.  There is significant potential here.  The national lottery is an investment fund and should be used in a commonsense manner.  </p><p><br /> Under section 5 of the 1986 Act, the surplus funds remaining after prizes and expenses have been paid are used for sport and other recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts, the health of the community and such other purposes and in such amounts as the Government may determine from time to time.  For such other purposes, public notice has to be given in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, and these categories include youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.  This could be linked into a stimulus package.  It would not rate as a major stimulus package but it could be very helpful.  Many people are involved in the arts and we have many talented people who find it difficult to find work.  We should not hold back on doing something about this.  We must also develop sport as part of our national health policy.  Too many people need more exercise and we need to deal with the obesity issue.  We should not be afraid to look at mental health projects and do something about the crisis in that area.</p><p><br /> Such surplus funds are paid into the Central Fund, which is administered by the Department of Finance, and are paid out of money provided by the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance had the responsibility for the distribution of the national lottery fund.  It is now administered by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p><br /> Let us deal with every case on its merits.  That is all I ask.  In the past, the national lottery has been used as a slush fund.  That must be challenged.  This was also the case under the previous Government.  I know it has been the case since I entered the D&aacute;il in 2002.  National lottery funds should be distributed on the basis of need.  I have mentioned projects and places, such as Darndale and Howth, that need extra funding to kick-start the local economy.  I have also mentioned sport, the arts and health, especially health of the community which is mentioned in section 5 of the 1986 Act.  It is important, in an economic downturn, that we look seriously at the health of the community so that when we come out of this dark hole we will have a healthy population that is prepared to take up new forms of employment.  These projects can be used for employment. </p><p><br /> The national lottery is currently operated by An Post.  It holds the licence which was put out to tender in late 2001, under the previous Government, and which An Post won following a competition held between 1999 and 2001.  The licence is due to expire at the end of June 2013.  A subsidiary company of An Post, An Post National Lottery Company, manages the running of the national lottery.  There is a management fee for An Post National Lottery Company of approximately &#8364;2.7 million.  </p><p><br /> I was supportive of the company and was glad An Post won the licence in 2001.  In much of the current debate, however, there seems to be an attitude that is anti-public sector and opposed to semi-State organisations.  Some sections of the public service are efficient and progressive.  They can be involved in developing the economy as much as anyone in the private sector.  This is often lost in public debate, particularly in the debate on banking.  It was areas of the private sector, such as banking and property development, that damaged the country to the extent that the troika had to come into the State.  </p><p><br /> Companies such as An Post have a crucial role to play in Irish society.  If other State or semi-State bodies have creative or radical new ideas, let us not be afraid to develop them.  Many years ago, Aer Lingus and the ESB developed our economy.  We must think outside the box.  Semi-State companies have significant potential to develop the economy and create jobs.  This is not to say there is no role for the private sector.  Of course there is.</p><p>The way forward, and this has been proved internationally, is a mixed economy.  If there is a mixed, efficient, healthy public sector and a small business private sector, the whole economy can be developed in a constructive and positive way.  That is my experience of life.  It does not come from an ideological point of view, and we should consider it.</p><p> When we look at the amount of money involved, we see the potential of the national lottery.  In 2002, sales were &euro;533 million, with costs of &euro;79 million, prizes of &euro;281 million and good causes receiving &euro;173 million.  In 2011, sales were &euro;761.4 million, with costs of &euro;104.3 million, prizes of &euro;422.5 million and good causes receiving &euro;231.9 million.  We could do a lot of good with that sort of money.  I do not know the figures for 2012 but with a budget of &euro;231 million, imagine what we could do.  I mentioned the cost of the drug for cystic fibrosis patients, which is in the region of &euro;20 million per year.  In a crisis situation, some funds could be used to develop these situations if we are in a hole.</p><p> My only concerns in the past related to the breakdown of where the money went.  The Department of Justice and Equality received 1.8%, while the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government received 36.1%.  The Department of Education and Skills received a very low share, which was a surprise, while the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport received 19.4%, the Department Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht received 21.4%, the Department of Health received 3.9% and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs received 17.3%.  Those figures have the potential to prioritise certain issues.  We must be honest and put issues like public health and safety above any economic agenda when it comes to the State looking after its citizens.  The 3.9% that is distributed to the Department of Health is very low compared with the other Departments.</p><p> In the current situation every euro and cent must be accounted for.  People are crying out for accountability and efficiency.  We saw the waste in the past and it was an absolute scandal.  Now, everyone and all parties are agreed.  Those of us who had the honour of being elected in 2011 know that at every second house when we were canvassing, we were told to go into the D&aacute;il to fix things, do our best and be honest with people, not to be wasting things and to do our jobs.  That was our mandate.  They also gave us a mandate for reform and change.  Any party, be it Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in or Independent, got that message on the doorsteps.  People wanted reform, change and common sense.  They did not want any petty bickering for the sake of political points scoring.  I make this point because there are aspects of the legislation that are progressive and I welcome them.</p><p> The national children's hospital is an important part of this debate.  The programme for Government pledges to protect health capital investment.  The review delivers on that commitment and includes the funding for the development of the new national children's hospital.  Reflecting the importance of this project, a large upfront payment arising from the new national lottery licence will complement Exchequer funding.  That is where I go back to the national children's hospital; this is the key issue in this debate.  My preferred option was the Mater Hospital site but I accept the democratic wishes of the people.  It has been decided and we must go ahead.</p><p> We must get on with the job now and build the hospital because there is also huge potential in the building of the hospital.  Construction costs will be in the region of &euro;400 million to &euro;600 million, but great opportunities exist for electricians, plumbers and other skilled construction workers, with a potential 2,750 jobs during the construction phase.  That is a massive boost for any economy.  The Government, however, has taken its eye of the ball recently and I worry that I have not heard much about it.  I would like the Government to get on with this.  I will support the national lottery being used for this funding so that the children's hospital can be built.  That also fits in with the talk of a stimulus package.  Dublin would get a great lift from 2,750 jobs in the middle of the city, particularly the many people I know who are unemployed in Dublin Bay North, my new constituency.</p><p> The powers of the regulator are very important.  Under section 38, the regulator can appoint persons to examine generally the running of the national lottery and make recommendations to the regulator.  This would appear to be separate to provisions on consultants and advisers under section 2, or disciplinary investigations.  Beyond this, under section 32, where the regulator is of the opinion that there is an apparent breach by the operator or a member of the operator's staff, he can appoint an investigator.  These are sensible provisions.</p><p> When it comes to sanctions, where these measures are insufficient to stop a breach, then under sections 34 and 35 there is a two-tier process of financial sanction, where either the regulator imposes a sanction of up to &euro;250,000, or the matter is taken before the High Court.  People might say that is a very serious sanction but I would agree with it because it will weed out any messing about with this legislation and with the spending of money given by people.  In the past we have seen too much corruption in politics and in the last few days we have seen the massive corruption in football across the world.  There is nothing wrong with heavy sanctions to deal with these issues.  We must also keep an eye out for the shopkeepers.  They need a break in the current climate and their margins must be protected.</p><p> I welcome this debate.  The Bill has some constructive provisions and I look forward to discussing it further.</p></speech>

The national lottery has been extremely successful since its establishment in 1987.  Unfortunately, as was the case when the lottery was established, the country once again finds itself in an extremely difficult economic position, indeed significantly worse than was the case in the 1980s, when at least we had control of our economic sovereignty.  It is this overriding factor that means the Government must think outside the box when dealing with the expiry of the current lottery licence in June.</p><p>  One of the main reasons the national lottery was so successful is that the public bought into the ethos behind it.  As far as I recall, there has never been any hint of scandal with regard to the national lottery.  People know it is run in a fair and transparent manner.  They are also acutely aware that lottery money is a source of funding for many important projects in local areas.  I was particularly pleased a number of important projects in County Monaghan received funding as part of this year's national lottery allocation.  This included an allocation of &euro;25,000 for Ardaghey Community Development to enable it to expand its current community facilities.  I visited the community centre in Ardaghey last year and the work that is going on there is a credit to all involved.  It provides services to young and old and the centre is the bedrock of the local community.</p><p>  The meals on wheels service from the Aontas centre in Castleblayney received &euro;4,000 in funding.  This is an excellent service for the Castleblayney area and is a vital resource for elderly people in the area.</p><p>Furthermore, Enable Ireland received &euro;2,000 in funding while &euro;1,500 was provided to Cavan Monaghan Carers.  These are not considerable sums, but they are critical to sustaining these important projects which are of significant benefit to local communities in County Monaghan and across the country.</p></speech>

For a long period of time the Government has been conducting a negotiation which has been singularly unsuccessful.  There is evidence, from the international media, from Europe and from leaks from the European Central Bank, ECB, that already the Government's proposals have been rejected out of hand by the powers that be in Europe.</p><p>  It seems that the danger of humiliation before 31 March is extremely acute.  The Government is proposing that the promissory notes' repayments should be extended for many years and instead of the Government taking a political hit now, that the children and grandchildren of Ireland should take the hit for them, in other words, they are seeking a solution which spares their own political blushes in the immediate period but means that future generations must pay for the blunders of bankers in the past.</p><p>  The motion looks for a fundamental change in Government policy in its approach to the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  It is wrong for anyone to state, as the amendment does by implication, that it is too late.</p><p>  In March 2012, a deal was cobbled together at the last minute to save the Government's face.  This year there is still time - nearly eight weeks - for the Government to go to the ECB, the Commission, Chancellor Merkel and others and state it has changed its policy, it no longer believes it pays to be craven, to be good Europeans and to be the poster boy of Europe, that it is taking a stand on behalf of the people of Ireland and, for once, it will put Irish people first.</p><p>  It seems that the negotiations are now in chaos.  If international reports are to be believed, only a few days ago - maybe a week or two - the European Central Bank threw out the Government's long-term proposal that there should be a long-dated bond of perhaps 40 years which would extend the loans for a period, which would relieve the Government of embarrassment but which would not make any difference to the capital sum, which we are asking to be changed in this motion.</p><p>  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, can tell the House, because there is so little information coming from the Government today, whether a Government plan was torpedoed after 13 months by the ECB within the past few weeks.  Did they say, &quot;No, this is monetary financing&quot;, in other words, printing money?  Did they say, it is not acceptable and to go back to the drawing board?  Is the Government in a position where it will come to the Irish people within a few weeks and present a completely new deal as some great triumph?</p><p>  No doubt a deal will be done but it will be a humiliation for Ireland unless the Government takes note of this motion.  What we have seen in the past 13 months, after a series of false dawns, new promises and over-egged puddings, is a pattern of humiliation.  It is not only what happened this time last year when we had been promised so clearly that a deal would come and that it would be presented to us, that at the last minute they had to cobble something together.  It is the number of deadlines that have been missed as politicians from the other side of the House, Ministers and others, have stated that a deal is nearby.  We were promised one in October.  We were promised one later.  We have been promised optimistic noises.  That pattern, I suggest, is about to come to a climax when at the end of this month we get a very bad deal which will be portrayed as some sort of a triumph.</p><p>  That pattern is being repeated as well in the story of the legacy debt which, in May last, was greeted as a game changer.  Ever since then, that pattern has been repeated as the Government has been in retreat in the face of opposition from the Finns, the Germans and the Dutch who have stated that issue of legacy debt is not one on which they share the Government's interpretation.</p><p>  The chickens are coming home to roast for us because, consistently as a nation, we are back-tracking in our dealings with the European Union and with the ECB.  Thirteen months of negotiation have yielded nothing.  The Government is in a position where somehow it must come up with something to present as a triumph.  It will be interesting to see if the Government can do so.</p><p>  We on this side of the House are looking for something far more radical.  We are looking for the Government to challenge Europe - to say not &quot;Yes&quot; but &quot;No&quot;, to say not that we will do what we are told but that we are a nation that has ideas and that stands on certain principles one of which is that this debt, for which the promissory notes are some palliative, is not a debt owed by the Irish people.  It is a debt which is owed by the banks, both of which have gone bankrupt, and which the Irish people should not be paying and have no moral obligation to pay.</p><p>  One need only observe the panic that has existed in political circles in recent weeks to realise that what I am saying is evidenced by statements from Ministers.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gilmore, went out to South America and was reported there as saying that if a deal was not agreed, it would be catastrophic.  He was informally reported to have warned, in various capitals of the world, that if a deal was not agreed, the Government might fall and there would be a general election.  Of course, that contrasts strongly with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte's, statement that a deal would be done.  I think Deputy Rabbitte is correct.  A deal - the colour of the deal will be humiliating - will be done, but why would a Minister of the Government regard it as a threat to his European partners that the Government would fall?  Why should they care?  They care because they regard the Government as complicit, an easy mark, and made up of Ministers who negotiate with their hands behind their back and accept.</p><p>  It is an effective weapon to play, if one is the puppet of European leaders and the people are one's pawns, and that is the position in which, I am afraid, we find ourselves.  If the Government's only weapon is to go out and state, &quot;If you let us down, we will go out of power&quot;, it is playing the wrong game.</p><p>I do not believe Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande or any of the other powerful people in Europe want to see this Government out of power.  Why should they?  They will never get another Government as compliant to their wishes.  It is a pushover in negotiations in Europe not only on the legacy debt but also on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  It is time it stood up for Ireland and said that we are unwilling, as this motion states, and unable as a nation to pay this debt.</p><p> The Government will come back and claim that the ATMs will be empty and that there is a threat of terrible economic war from the ECB and Europe.  I wonder.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, was asked that question at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  He said that the ATMs would continue to work.  The threat of economic war is one that has never been tested or challenged.  However, we want to transfer this problem.  We want to say that the debt should be shared among the European nations because it is not solely ours.  At the moment the Government's attitude is quite simple.  It claims that debt is the debt of Irish people and we accept it.  I do not accept it is the debt of Irish people nor do others in our group.  We believe it should be shared by the heads of the nations of those who are equally responsible because others were responsible for lending at a banking level, not at a people's or taxpayers' level.  It is bankers who were responsible for making these loans and the governments of all the nations of Europe bear a responsibility for this.</p><p> We should not be ashamed about asking for a write-off and we should not be intimidated.  I am sick and tired of that being painted, in a derogatory way, as default.  Let us go in and negotiate it.  Let us not pay it because it is not ours.  Let us be unashamedly in favour of sharing that debt with others.</p><p> We have seen a long pattern of a Government over-egging the pudding.  We have seen the hopes of the Irish people being raised extraordinarily high.  The statement by Ministers that a good deal would be done is a terrible hostage to fortune.  The Government, which has raised people's expectations to such a high level, now finds it may not be able to deliver.  There will be a high price to pay if people are disappointed by this because the expectation in people's minds is that if a good deal is done on the promissory notes, relief will come to Ireland's taxpayers and social welfare recipients in the next budget.  That patently will not happen if we pursue the course we are pursuing at present.  It patently will not happen if we do not get a deal which involves write-off.  What is so disappointing about Government policy is that the Taoiseach threw in the towel before he even started and never even looked for a write-off.  That means the Government is simply looking to extend and pretend.</p><p> I believe we are on the brink of signing up for a very long-term economic disaster.  We should think of future generations before we take this extraordinary step.  Before we transfer the debt we should think of the consequences for people down the line, some of whom are not even born yet.</p><p> I am deeply disappointed by the Government's amendment, which is bland and uninformative in stating: &quot;recognises that the current negotiation approach is the best course of action in order to achieve agreement with our European partners&quot;.  I want to hear from the Minister for Finance what the current approach is.  What has been achieved in the past 13 months?  What has the Government got and what will it offer the people before 31 March?  I believe we need a radical change in policy - a U-turn that puts the interests of the Irish people first and not those of Europe, which challenges the powers that be in Europe and tells them it is not our debt, we will not pay it and we cannot pay it.&quot;</p></speech>

I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is in the Chamber to listen.  The Government has tabled a feeble amendment to the motion.  As I told the Minister's leader a few weeks ago, even Ministers' body language tells the tale that they have thrown in the towel and are not fighting the good fight.  They are not wearing the green jersey and they are not delivering.</p><p>  We have the Presidency of the European Union, on which I wish the Government well.  I even got the nice tie in my pigeonhole today but Ministers should be ashamed to wear it because they are not standing up for the people of this country.  We heard all about it last year and we heard the deal was applauded.  I was in the bar that evening and heard people comment on how excellently the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had done.  We all believed and hoped, but we were sadly let down.  The Minister's party leader used chilling words in Chile, but they were not half as forceful as those he used when he was when he was in opposition, when it was going to be Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.</p><p>  Those who are hurting are the public, especially those who voted in large numbers for Labour and Fine Gael, because, sadly, they have been let down.  They do not even see a fight or a bit of gusto.  When responding to me during Leaders' Questions recently, the Taoiseach spoke about good speeches from the back of a trailer.  He would want to get on a trailer or something else and assert himself.  Along with the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, he needs to tell the other countries that this is not our debt.  We are not reneging on anything, and are a proud people and entitled to be respected for that.</p><p>  This debt was incurred here recklessly by foreign banks of EU countries.  When they knew the game was up, they, along with speculators, kept shovelling money in here and they got away scot free.  They have been rewarded and will be further rewarded on 31 March if this promissory note is paid.  We should really change the date to the following day, which is 1 April, April Fools' Day, because that is what we will be - the fools of Europe and they will be ag magadh f&uacute;inn.  The Minister is codding the people and letting them down.</p><p>  We are passing this down not only to our children, but to our grandchildren and their children.  What legacy is that for the Minister to leave?  I respect his longevity in politics and his contribution.  What legacy is that?  Is passing this debt down to future generations the legacy the Government wants left after it?  Why did it not assert itself and take up the cudgels?  Is the best it can say that it will continue negotiations with the European Central Bank and that the current negotiation approach is the best policy?  Nobody believes that; the Minister does not believe it.  One can only negotiate so far at which point one needs to get belligerent.  The Minister needs to fight for the country's interests, which is what he was elected to do and what he is paid to do.  The Government should not force the country into penury and destroy the fabric of society with the different pieces of legislation it is introducing.</p><p>  Deputy Ross referred to a threatened abyss.  I do not say we should default; I say we should stress this is not our debt.  Half of it is and we will pay that.  I was one of the people who, along with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was summoned to Dublin some years ago to vote for the bank guarantee, and I did so.  When I questioned it, I was told about the abyss, the big black monster and the hole into which we would fall.  We did not fall into any hole, thank God.  I voted for it and it was the biggest mistake I ever made.  It was the sorriest day of my life when I saw the treatment we have got ever since.  We had many of the same officials and advisers in the Department and now we are paying outside groups such as Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and others.  It was a disgrace that the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan Jr., got such advice at the time and then passed on to us.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing.  It is a bigger disgrace for the present Government to fall into the same trap even though Ministers told the public they would do it differently.</p><p>They told the public it would be Labour's way and not Frankfurt's way.  Some members even voted against it.  They then put on the clothes of their predecessors and are now even better boys in Europe.  They are the best boys in the class and have been given awards and kudos in magazines around the world for being such good people.  The longer they remain in office the further, not into the black hole of default but into the abyss, they will lead the people.  They should consider their positions and go back to the people.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work done by Deputies Shane Ross and Stephen Donnelly in bringing this motion before the House.  </p><p><br />  I want to live in an Ireland of rights and responsibilities.  My first question, therefore, is, how is it the responsibility of the Irish nation to pay &#8364;3.1 billion for Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes?  Second, what right has the Government to take this on when it is obvious it is unfair?  Third, is it fair that Irish people should pay for something in which they had no hand, act or part?  </p><p><br />  We are repeatedly and relentlessly told that the promissory notes scheme is the only means by which Ireland can get back on its own two feet and the backbone of the State, namely, the banks, can be saved.  I believe the people are the backbone of this State and they should not be sacrificed for the greed, recklessness and self interest of others.  More than enough has been asked of people.  Asking the same people to pay more is, in my view, arrogant.  Where is there a moral obligation on the State to pay this?  Surely the moral obligation is to address the needs of the people.  Where is the sense of moral obligation on the part of those individuals from the various banks and organisations, who are household names, to accept responsibility for what they have done?  I would like to know if they are in any sense paying for what they have done and the mess they have created.  They appear to have lost considerable wealth yet exist on incredible levels of income and resources.  Many other people are making sacrifices and losing so much in terms of jobs and houses.  We know the effects of this on people's mental and emotional health and how all of this contributes to their sense of powerlessness.</p><p><br />  Who are these promissory notes protecting?  It appears they are protecting shadowy figures from various banks in Germany, France, Holland or Britain.  This is the Famine of the 21st century -  there is plenty of food and wealth for some but starvation and poverty for others.  I support the notion that it is time for Ireland to declare that this &#8364;3.1 billion will not be paid and that it demand a negotiated write-down of the debt, with fair sharing of the burden across the eurozone.  I am sure a deal will emerge.  However, it will not be enough if not as provided for in the motion.  If not, it will be humiliating for Ireland.  We deserve far more than a face saving exercise.</p><p><br />  It is hard to accept that payment of the promissory notes is required for our economic survival and is the only means of achieving same.  They could be rejected and ripped up and we could look at other ways of paying our lawful debts, including by way of the corporate tax or financial transaction tax.  There have been similar disasters when property speculators had their way and Governments could have used these two measures rather than impose austerity on the poor and lower income groups.  Pursuing these notes is walking around the wealth elephants in the room towards the cents and limited resources of the poor and low and middle income people.</p><p><br />  There is a carcass of a building in Dublin central which was supposed to have been the headquarters of the new Anglo Irish Bank.  Some people believe should it remain as a reminder of what can and does go wrong.  It is interesting that the community which took on that bank remains.  We all now what happened to Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

Like him, I have no confidence in the rich and political parties they fund to resolve the current crisis in the interest of the Irish people.  In Connolly's time, the rules of capitalism were relatively simple, namely, if the wealthy invested wisely they made money; if they made bad investments they lost money.  Now we have a Single Market and the wealthy can invest throughout Europe without any barriers.  Reagan and Thatcher boasted that capitalism had gotten a new lease of life and that the market was king and would resolve all problems.  Due to the God-like properties of the market, only light touch regulation was necessary.  In Ireland, former Deputies Mary Harney, Michael McDowell and Charlie McCreevy took up the mantra and former Deputy Bertie Ahern traipsed after them.  Privatisation was in and State enterprise was out.  State involvement in business was bad and an intrusion.  There was no opposition to this from Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  This so-called revived capitalism would reward success and punish failure, making us all more efficient and competitive.  </p><p>  Then came the bust and the great apostles of the free enterprise were on their knees to the previously despised State to intervene urgently in the banking business to save their bacon.  The market could not be allowed to punish its failure.  The rules of capitalism are always changed to suit the wealthy.  While profits had been privatised through low taxes on business the debts were now to be nationalised to protect the rich and afflict the common people.  Pensioners with a little nest egg in bank shares were wiped out while large investors who invested through bonds and other big money instruments were bailed out.  The bulk of this large investment came through banks and finance houses outside this State and the vast majority of those being bailed out by Irish citizens were not Irish.</p><p>  James Connolly was correct when he said that the capitalists, the ranchers and their hangers-on in the labour movement cannot be trusted with Irish sovereignty and the well-being of the Irish people.  Paying the promissory notes is not only a massive drain on Irish resources, it is an act of national betrayal.  The &euro;64 billion borrowed by Ireland owing to the banking collapse was used to rescue investments of mainly European banks and finance houses.  This debt should be the debt of the entire European financial system and should be neutralised.  Anything less than this is a betrayal of Irish sovereignty and will merely transfer part of the European-wide debt onto the shoulders of generations of Irish people while European bondholders laugh all their way to German, French and British banks, where were and are being bailed out by the Irish people.</p><p>  Government spending between 2008 and 2012 resulted in an increase in debt, from &euro;2 billion to &euro;6.5 billion.  This will rise to &euro;8.1 billion in 2013.  Money borrowed to cover the debts of private banks should not be repaid.  A considerable portion of the debt interest payment arises from this source.  Interest on capital repayments will make debt servicing a crushing burden over decades on our children and grandchildren.  The ESM made matters worse.  An additional &euro;4.5 billion will have to be paid every year from 2015.  Any illusory savings through extension of the repayment period on bank debt and replacement of the promissory notes with a long dated bond will be drawfed by these crushing repayments.  This Government's austerity policy will ensure that there is no significant growth to ease the burden.  The EU must be forced to agree to declare the bank related debt of all countries in proportion to their GDP a burden.  It should be neutralised.</p><p>  This country is in social and economic crisis.  The policies of this Government are damaging ordinary people and their families.  We have our own Margaret Thatcher here in the form of Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who is the cause of the same widespread despair and hopelessness in this country as caused by Thatcher in Britain.  Children are cold and hungry at school and more are living in poverty.  The Minister's attacks on children are surpassed only by her attacks on the elderly.  Just like Margaret Thatcher she is dismantling all the benefits that made life bearable for the elderly.  The vulnerable, young and old, are being targeted while bankers and bondholders get off scot free.  Stopping the repayment of the promissory notes is a first step in the reconquest of Ireland for the people.</p></speech>

The Government amendment states it is trying to negotiate the best possible outcome for the Irish people.  It is clear now that any deal will not change this reality.  Irish people will be stuck with the bulk of the bill in bailing out greedy bankers and speculators in the bond markets.  This sell-out of the Irish people cannot be masked by the huffing and puffing of the Labour Party.  If it was serious about putting it up to the ECB and the EU Commission it would vote for the motion and stick to its guns and to what it said prior to the election.  Otherwise it was elected on a lie.</p><p> The Government has repeatedly and publicly accepted the &euro;30 billion payment for defunct banks will be paid.  Its real concern is to get a deal which pushes payments out so the Government will not have to fork out &euro;3.1 billion, or possibly &euro;6.2 billion considering the three-card trick it pulled last year, next March and the year after.  The same goes for the smoke and mirrors trick with regard to the interest payment on these notes.  These notes are used as collateral for money lent to the IBRC by the ECB.  The interest rate for the money is 0.75%.  A long-term bond to replace the notes would hardly be at a lower rate.</p><p> When the Government came to power it had an opportunity to carry out its election promises to burn the bondholders and negotiate a write-down on the bank bailout debt.  Instead of showing some liathr&oacute;id&iacute; - as people say - it opted to be the poster child of austerity.  The Minister of State must see the reality every day in communities where austerity is breaking the backs of many Irish people.  It has been brutal, with long-term unemployment increasing and people feeling the effects of cuts impacting brutally on household economies and the emotions of families.  Disabled people have been affected by cuts to grants.  Old age pensioners come to our offices pointing out their incomes have been cut by up to 15% through all the little cuts implemented in recent years.  The household package was cut and the phone allowance will be cut this year.  Limits have been placed on medical cards and they are also affected by the universal social charge.  The health service has been cut drastically, with the abominable revelation that St. James's Hospital's budget will be cut by &euro;9 million because it kept within its budget.  This is unbelievable.  A paltry number answered the Government's call for 1,000 nurses to take up &euro;21,000 jobs.  Fair play to the INMO for launching its outstanding campaign.  Workers have been hit by the universal social charge, the pension levy, cuts in wages and bin and household taxes and their pension funds have been raided.  The property tax is not based on an ability to pay or on people paying stamp duty.  A water tax will be introduced which will probably be based on assessment only and not on what the criteria would have been for water meters.</p><p> Families live on less than &euro;50 per month.  Austerity is impacting more and more on communities.  We have yet to see the detail of the finance Bill due before the House on 14 February.  Ironically the Minister will introduce a tax on maternity benefit on 14 February.  Electricity prices are increasing while the price of food is not decreasing and people are feeling the effects of this.  I call on all workers, those unemployed and those affected by the cuts to be out on Saturday, 9 February in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Sligo and Limerick to get behind the campaign against austerity.  Do not just stop there; demand of our unions that they move further and demand that the bailout be stopped.</p></speech>

On the contrary, the entire eurozone benefited in some way through some financial stability, yet Ireland pays 42% of the total cost of the European banking crisis.  If the burden had been shared equally throughout the eurozone it is estimated the amount owed by Ireland would decrease to less than &euro;1 billion.</p><p>  I am particularly keen to hear the Government's views on the morality of this debt.  We can argue back and forth about the legality of restructuring, defaulting on the debt, and about whether it is sustainable to effectively keep burning the millions being saved by pillaging Irish society but the Government has been very quiet on whether there is a moral case for making the ordinary citizens pay the debt of the casino banks.  This payment has no basis in equity, social justice or justice of any type.  It certainly has no basis in morality.  Repaying the gambling losses of investors who backed the out of control bankers who brought the country to its knees and maturity extensions to facilitate more borrowing next year and lumber future generations with yet more overall debt will mean nothing to the approximately 250 people leaving the country every day.  Nor will it do anything to ease the burden of the people who are at risk of becoming homeless because they cannot afford to pay the massive mortgages and bank loans borrowed in 2006 and 2007 at a time when the Government would not tell the Irish people the truth about the economy.</p><p>  The moral question demonstrates just how much the Government cares about the welfare of ordinary Irish people, who are bearing the burden of the mistakes made by international financial markets at a staggering cost of &euro;9,000 per person.  Any Minister in touch with the people knows there is widespread social consensus that this payment is unjust and unjustifiable.  Parking it for a while will not solve the problem.  All that will work is a very comprehensive deal on the debt.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, in a debate with me on &quot;The Week in Politics&quot; on Sunday stated there is widespread unity among the people for a deal on this debt.  Does he live in the real world?  There is widespread unity among the people for a write-down of this debt.</p></speech>

As a legislator in the D&aacute;il part of my legacy will not be that I did not stand up and oppose what the Government proposes to do in the coming 15 to 20 years to our children's children's children, which is to pass on an immoral debt which is no moral responsibility to the children who live here today and those who will be born tomorrow and in years to come.  I will not have anything of it.

Neither would it be appropriate for me to state that the Government is going to default.  Let me be clear - if the motion before the House is passed, it would effectively send a view to the markets that Ireland was on notice of default.  To adopt such an approach would jeopardise all of the work that has been done by our people, and their patience and resilience, in recent years.</p><p>  As the House is aware, this Government has been involved in discussions for some considerable period of time on reducing the burden of debt associated with the recapitalisation of Irish banks.  In recent months, the focus of discussions has been on the promissory note arrangement that was put in place to fund the IBRC.  This is an arrangement which requires the State to make cash payments of &euro;3.06 billion each year to the IBRC.  These discussions are complex.</p><p>  There appears to be an attempt by one of the opposition parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, either to ignore or forget the origin of the promissory note, so I would like to remind them.  The promissory note was a Fianna F&aacute;il design.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il attempt to develop a funding instrument to provide the IBRC with the necessary capital to cover its loan asset book.</p><p>  Given the massive financial cost that these losses in the IBRC imposed on the State, Fianna F&aacute;il opted to put a promissory note in place instead of government bonds.  It is a legacy that we have been left to clean up and that is exactly what we intend to do.  The technical details of the promissory note are that the interest rate on the note was set by reference to prevailing government bond yields at the time of the issue.  The yields at that time were considerably higher than now.  Yields on Irish Government bonds are now considerably lower as the Government has improved Ireland's image abroad and succeeded in attracting international investors back to Ireland.</p><p>  A further adjustment to the interest rate was also necessary to allow for the interest holiday agreed by the last government.  As a result of this interest rate holiday, the rate for the note's remaining term is correspondingly higher at about 8%.</p><p>  As a non-standard funding instrument the IBRC promissory notes are inadequate and require bi-weekly approval for collateral purposes for the IBRC from the ECB.  All parties to the current discussions could gain from an agreed approach to this issue.  It is in this context that the Irish Government has been working extremely hard to secure an agreement.  I can reiterate that we are optimistic that an arrangement, agreeable by all parties, can be found in the context of the current discussions.</p><p>  The key objective of any new arrangement will be to make the banking related debt more sustainable.  This is central to the Irish position on all negotiations with our European partners.  The ongoing discussions should provide the best possible means of dealing with the significant IBRC banking related debt.  However, we must all be fully aware that the majority of the national debt is related to the provision of public services and that it is entirely the responsibility of all in this House to make it more sustainable.  The Government has real policies to make this debt more sustainable through economic growth and balancing the public finances.  </p><p>  I now turn to the core of the amendment before the House - the Government's extremely constructive engagement with our European partners and how we approach these discussions.  I have previously stated that I am working to achieve a solution before the next scheduled instalment of the promissory note.  That remains the case.  Given the critical point at which we now find ourselves, it would not be in our best interests to declare our hand by drawing lines in the sand, especially lines that could undermine hundreds of thousands of jobs in our economy.  Instead we must work towards the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer and this is best done by an agreed approach.</p><p>  The politics of ultimatum is a dangerous business where the options that face this country are limited.  We seek agreement, not some unilateral position which is based on playing some gigantic game of Russian roulette with all our futures.  It has been through agreed approaches that the considerable achievements of this Government concerning the programme of assistance have been achieved to date.  A stated objective of the programme for Government is the overall aim of renegotiating, which must be seen to secure a programme of support and a solution to the banking crisis that is perceived as more affordable both by the Irish people and international money markets.  There has already been significant renegotiation of the programme of assistance which has meant real economic improvement and real savings for our citizens.  These include reinstatement of the minimum wage - something we were told would not happen before the last election by everyone on the benches opposite and we have managed to reinstate it - and renegotiation of many conditions of the programme.  The then Minister for Finance told us that would not happen, but we have made it happen.  They also include a reduction in interest rates on EU money, saving almost &euro;10 billion.  We are also in negotiation with the Commission on an extension of the maturities.  Both of those issues are crucial in terms of the bulk of the money that has come from the EU.  There was also the agreement to retain half the proceeds from the sale of State assets for investment in job creation projects; the agreement of 29 June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and the State, and the specific reference to improving the sustainability of our programme; the clear recognition of Ireland's special position by our external partners; and a commitment to review our position with a view to further improving the sustainability of a well performing adjustment programme. </p><p>  An agreed basis for the re-negotiation of the IBRC promissory notes will be the next step on the road to achieving full market access for Ireland by the end of this year.  I have already referred to how the Opposition's motion proposes that Ireland engage in a sovereign default.  This Government has made it clear that it will not countenance a sovereign default as part of its plan to work our way back to economic sovereignty and fiscal independence.  </p><p>  It has become too easy to suggest that a default provides some sort of economic panacea.  Closer examination of the often quoted Argentinian approach, or that of Iceland, are suggested as examples to follow.  I find it unlikely that any Member of this House would suggest that the savings and investments of private Irish citizens be wiped out, because this has been the experience of the default in the aforementioned countries.</p><p>  In case some Deputies think that the Icelandic solution is still worth pursuing, they should fully inform themselves of the structures of the Irish and Icelandic economies and their significant differences.  Foreign direct investment plays an important role in our economy, supporting 250,000 jobs directly and indirectly.  The Icelandic economy is based on its natural resources of fish and cheap energy.  A proposal to follow the Icelandic approach would involve the use of strict capital controls, which would wipe out overnight literally thousands of jobs in the foreign direct investment area in this country.  </p><p>  Capital controls severely affect the normal functioning of a market economy with severe implications for investment, market access and financing costs.</p><p>For Ireland, restricting capital controls would restrict investment and make it practically impossible for exporters to conduct their business here.  This is especially relevant as Ireland exports more than 100% of its GDP.</p><p> Ireland remains open for business and is an attractive place in which to invest.  Defaulting would damage investor confidence as a key time in our efforts to turn the economy around and would have a serious impact on job creation.  In addition, the wider contagion of a default, with consequences for other State contracts and implications for the financial markets, would be too severe to countenance, particularly given the lengths the Irish State and its people have gone in implementing the adjustment programme over recent years and the extent to which this has been recognised by the markets.  The success of Ireland's programme implementation to date has been recognised by the financial markets.  Its ten-year bond yields have remained below 6% for a number of months and have been under 5% since late last year, while the NTMA has been engaged with the markets to some extent in recent months.  In addition, Bank of Ireland and AIB have successfully re-engaged with the markets on the back of their own asset covered securities.  These all are positive indications and the reduction in sovereign debt related to Irish bank recapitalisation, although a small fraction of the overall total, still is an explicit good news story for Ireland.  In particular, the sale, for profits of &euro;1 billion, of Bank of Ireland convertible contingent notes earlier this year reflects renewed belief in the sustainability of the Irish pillar banks.  Each of these positives reflects our resolve and progress towards emerging successfully from this programme at the end of this year and to resume financing ourselves in the international money markets.  If one considers Ireland's own position, we are in receipt of substantial support from the European Union mechanisms under the EU-IMF programme of financial support.  This provides funding at rates well below those which would be available were we obliged to fund ourselves in the international money markets.  In addition, the ECB continues to provide substantial liquidity support to the Irish banking system.  It should therefore be clear that European solidarity is in our interests and to our benefit.</p><p> The Government's programme is working.  It has met all its targets to date and has met the quantitative fiscal targets.  It has implemented financial sector restructuring and has achieved banking recapitalisation at a significantly lower cost than was initially envisaged.  It imposed burden sharing on junior debt holders and is implementing structural reforms with a view to enhancing the growth potential of the economy.  The Government is introducing fiscal reforms to improve the management and control of the public finances.</p><p> The motion before the House tonight seeks to force Ireland's hand in the current negotiations while discussions with our European partners are ongoing.  The Government's amendment reinforces the current approach to the issue of the IBRC promissory notes and avoid placing a restriction on the potential benefits of an agreement.  The Government continues to engage constructively in these negotiations and views them as a central concern for the Government.  It is confident of success and opposes the failure addicts and those opposite who only wish for this country to fail.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="21:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500048#VV00300"><p>I second the amendment and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Two years have elapsed since the Government took office and its fundamental aim at all times has been to stabilise the perilous economic situation in which it found itself, as well as to get Ireland back to a position from which it can emerge from the recession it was in and from which people of all ages can look towards a future with renewed confidence.  Stabilising employment levels has been crucial to achieve this and I acknowledge unemployment remains as a huge issue.  The Government also has been obliged to stabilise the banks and while the issue last year of the promissory note for the bank formally known as Anglo was averted, this year it must be dealt with before the deadline of 31 March.</p><p>  If one considers the huge cuts to the budget it has been necessary for the previous Government and the present Government thus far to implement, as well as the toll that has taken on the Irish people, it is important that a deal is struck and that the &euro;3.1 billion promissory note is not paid on 31 March.  I agree wholeheartedly with the approach being taken by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in dealing with the ECB and our European partners.  It is imperative that Europe not only talks a good game but that such goodwill is turned into a positive outcome for Ireland, which will demonstrate tangible European support to enable Ireland to get back on its feet quickly.  I am sure no one in this Chamber has forgotten that even without the promissory note or the bank debt, the country still has a &euro;15 billion deficit that must be addressed.  The concern at present is the public has been fed the line that doing or not doing a deal on this issue is the be-all and end-all.  The suggestion is that if a deal is secured, everything will be easy thereafter but alternatively, the country will fall apart if no deal is reached.  However, this is not the case, as a great deal more must be done in respect of the deficit.  A positive deal on the forthcoming promissory note would send an important signal to investors in Ireland and abroad that Ireland is getting back on track, that its debt is sustainable and that it is back in business.  Stable public finances are essential for job creation and economic growth in Ireland.  However, some Members on the benches opposite appear to have forgotten that we only will be successful in the long term if the international markets believe that our debt is sustainable.  This is not about the short term or the lifetime of the present Government but is about putting Ireland back on a sustainable footing for the long term.</p><p>  It also is very important that our European partners understand fully that this is not simply about getting Ireland a good deal.  Instead, it is about Ireland the best deal possible, namely, a fair deal, which sets us properly back on track towards prosperity and growth.  It also must be remembered that the money which washed through Ireland during the years of the boom materialised from within Europe and therefore, our European partners must shoulder some of the responsibility when dealing with this issue.  I note there has been quite a lot of talk in recent months and years on possible further European integration within the institution, whether a banking union or in other areas.  It is important to sort out this problem first.  The countries which are in trouble should be put back on their feet first and that conversation can be had further down the line when economic growth has returned to the majority of Europe.</p><p>  I cannot support the motion before Members this evening because with almost two months of negotiations still to take place, it is completely premature.  Moreover, as Members speak, the Minister and the Taoiseach are pushing hard for a positive deal for Ireland.  Were such a deal to be concluded, the Minister for Finance would explain it in detail to Members.  However, until such time as a deal has been concluded, such speculation is idle.  If passed, the motion before the House would undermine completely the Government's negotiating position and would not be in the best interests of the Irish people.</p><p>  To date, the Government has achieved a number of important successes, including the renegotiation of many of the conditions of the bailout programme, as well as a significant reduction in interest rates on European Union funds.  It is all too easy for Opposition Members to be negative at all times.  They have the luxury of being able to knock every positive suggestion and to criticise deals yet unmade.  It is not their responsibility to make the difficult decisions that must be made to balance this country's budget.  They can call for the non-payment of this promissory note safe in the knowledge that it will not fall to them to assess the repercussions of not so doing.  I believe that with more than seven weeks remaining before the deadline, the right and proper thing for the Government to do is to get on with the hard behind-the-scenes work of negotiating the best deal possible for Ireland and I wish them well in their endeavours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-05a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="21:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020500048#VV00400"><p>I join Deputy Connaughton in commending the current actions of the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance with regard to seeking to obtain a better banking deal than that which Ireland has obtained to date.  However, I also commend the actions of the T&aacute;naiste, as a diplomatic initiative and offensive clearly is required to reverse or seek to renegotiate the deal that was agreed by the previous Government in respect of the Anglo promissory notes.  If one turns to the actual wording of the motion before Members I note it states, "That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann ... [should] assert that the debt is not the moral obligation of the Irish people".  I understand that Deputy Ross may have been the prime mover of this motion and note he moved it this evening.  I understand that Deputy Ross worked in more than one stockbroking firm before taking his place in this House and perhaps he still does.  My question is, what does morality have to do with the international markets?  What did morality ever have to do with the international markets?  I fully agree that this bank debt, no more than the bank debt of the pillar banks, is not the moral obligation of the Irish people.  However, it is the legal obligation of the Irish people and this sovereign State acts in accordance with its legal obligations.  I agree it was a mistake to give the bank guarantee on that fateful night but I do not propose to lecture Deputy Michael McGrath on the mistakes of the past and I certainly hope he will not lecture Members on this side on what the present Government has not achieved, given the enormity of the task facing it when it took office only two years ago.</p><p>It is a clear legal obligation on the Irish people to pay the bank debt in the form negotiated, which is the promissory note process.  It might be morally repugnant but it is a legal obligation until there is a change.  There can be no unilateral change, as unilateral action got us to where we are today.  We do not know the truth as there has not been a proper banking inquiry but we have been told the unilateral action was taken by four or maybe six men gathered in Government Buildings in the small hours of the morning, guaranteeing all the bank debt in the country, including that of Anglo Irish Bank, which is the subject of tonight's motion.</p><p> The differences between us and Iceland are stark.  In Iceland the banks defaulted on their debt and they were then nationalised.  In Ireland, we nationalised the debt, and we are now talking about defaulting.  It is far too late for this and the horse bolted not two years ago but almost five years ago.  We are not talking about the legal obligation of banks but rather the legal obligation of this State.  Iceland also sped on its road to recovery by devaluing the kroner, which led to a devaluation of both the savings and debts of Icelandic people.  We do not have that option, unless the proposers of the motion are seeking to exit the euro.  If that is the proposal, I would like to hear how they will see us trading, given our dependencies on Europe for trade, which are completely different to Iceland.</p><p> Iceland has overcome its major hurdles to expect a surplus next year by reducing its deficit.  Nevertheless, every effort this Government made to reduce its deficit, including by reducing spending, has been resisted by Deputies like Deputy Halligan, who is very opposed to any reduction in Government spending.  Deputy Ross would be very opposed to any increase in taxation because it would affect his constituents.  We can all pander to our constituents but we must reduce the deficit, regardless of what happens with the promissory notes, if the country is to have an economic future.</p><p> On that basis I cannot possibly agree with the motion, although I agree that the bank debt is not the moral obligation of the Irish people.  The rest of the motion is &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; economics.</p></speech>

We are living in unprecedented economic turmoil, and we are witnessing it on a global scale we have never seen in history.  The mettle of many nations is being tested and the challenge we face in this country will bring the fallout as described by Deputy McNamara.  We will have to try to bridge a big gap between public spending and what is to be taken into the Exchequer.  Aside from the banking issue, we have nowhere to go for money, which can be easily forgotten.  We know the bankers caused a problem but this other issue remains.</p><p>  We are facing these challenges within the European Union and our fortunes are interdependent.  Our economies have developed in a way different from history because we are now part of a global village; whatever happens in one economy has a ripple effect on others, as can be seen with the eurozone.  There is collateral damage when these issues are not handled correctly, which can be seen with the case of Greece.  We do not want to see such events in this country.  It is a bit like open heart surgery and we cannot make jerky or rapid movements with the scalpel because it will cause a problem.  Everything must be done with a delicate touch.  We will either have a smooth course towards the country's recovery or a rough journey if we take on board the ideas behind tonight's motion.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in and others on the other side of the House do not want to face up to responsibilities, which is a disingenuous course of action to take.  Whether the responsibilities are moral - or whether they should have been put on people in the first place - is beside the point, and there are legal responsibilities.  We cannot have all the benefits of a small and open economy, with foreign direct investment and multinationals coming here to create jobs, while arguing that we do not like the fact that the State signed up to an agreement.  We cannot tear that up.  Either we are big boys and girls or we are not.  This is business and if we want the benefits of business to trickle down to people, either through welfare or taxes, we must know how to do business internationally and particularly with European partners.</p><p>  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, are taking this approach, for which I commend them.  I have the fullest confidence in them and I hope they achieve the deal that is best for this country and which will get the longest term for the debt.  I hope we get breathing space that can bring about economic recovery.  A special case can be made for our country, as nobody has taken on the burden of banking debt more than our taxpayers.  The banking debt is intertwined with sovereign debt, and we have dealt professionally with what is a legacy issue.  Whether we like it or not, we pay for the sins of the fathers; this can be seen in my constituency with the Corrib gas field, where things were not done correctly.</p><p>  I will not repeat the points that have been made.  At this time it is imperative that IBRC, the former Anglo Irish Bank, is wound up.  It is a dead bank and what else is it doing?  At least with the other banks people can see retail or commercial banking activities.  I have taken advice on the issue and spoken with bankers and rather than bearing the costs of consultants, staff etc., it should be wound up and dismantled.</p></speech>

I noted the comments of the Minister of State and Deputy McNamara about the origin of the promissory note.  I am not in the business of lecturing anybody but I will address the issue at the outset.  It is all too easy to point to the bank guarantee of September 2008 as being the cause of all evil with bank debt.  As we all know, it was a two-year guarantee and Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January 2009, with the action taken with no knowledge of the scale of losses being carried by the bank at the time.  The promissory note was put in place in 2010 when the scale of losses emerged, and it was done at a time when in Europe and Ireland there was no bank resolution regime in place to deal with dead banks or defunct financial institutions.  There should have been and there is no question that the losses carried by Anglo Irish Bank were far too big for the State to handle.</p><p>  We must recognise that even since the current Government came to power, there was over &euro;16 billion of unguaranteed, unsecured bondholders left in the system and they will receive every single cent of the money.  That will happen because the European Central Bank will not allow this Government, as it did not allow the previous Government, to impose any losses on senior bondholders.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il wants to see the net cost of the bank recapitalisation reduced and we genuinely wish the Minister well in these negotiations.  I doubt anybody in the country wants to see Ireland pay this money at the end of March.</p><p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I recently outlined to the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi, the case for taking action to reduce the burden of bank debt being carried by Irish people.  This is the time for a deal to be done as we will not have a better opportunity to resolve the issue of the legacy debt at Anglo Irish Bank.  The momentum that has been building provides us with a once-off opportunity to secure the right deal.  Our message to the European Central Bank must be that a deal is needed and it must be the right deal.  The Government will not have the luxury of returning to this issue one year from now to restructure this aspect of our banking debt.</p><p><br /> A deal can be done now for a number of reasons.  First, there is undoubtedly a more pragmatic leadership in place at the European Central Bank under its current President, Mr. Mario Draghi, than there was under his predecessor, Mr. Trichet.  Second, the principle of a banking union, including a bank resolution regime, has been agreed at European level.  Third, economic recovery has not taken root in Ireland, as envisaged, and our ability to carry bank related debt is weaker than was anticipated.  Fourth, Ireland is sticking rigidly to the EU-IMF plan and is in compliance with all of its conditions.  Finally, Europe needs a success story and Ireland is its best shot at achieving one.</p><p><br /> The Government must engage in intense negotiations over the next eight weeks and this engagement must take place at the highest political level.  The Minister for Finance must personally lead the negotiations and must meet the ECB President as often as is necessary before the end of March to secure a deal.  Officials acting on the Government's behalf have taken this issue as far as they can and the technical issues are well known to the Government at this stage.  The matter has become a political issue and for this reason, the elected Government must drive negotiations with the ECB President. </p><p><br /> I do not care if the negotiations go to the wire provided we secure the right deal.  The Minister must make the point very clearly to the European Central Bank &#8211; I accept this will be done in private &#8211; that, in the absence of a deal, there is nothing inevitable about the Government making the &#8364;3.1 billion payment at the end of March.  He must go further and explain that the economic, social and political reality in Ireland is such that non-payment is a live option for the Government.  If I were in the Minister's shoes and the right deal for Ireland was not on the table at the end of March, I would recommend to the Government that the promissory note payments be suspended until negotiations had concluded.</p><p><br /> Ireland's case for a deal on the promissory note is both moral and practical.  This country has undergone the largest budgetary adjustment compared to all other so-called &quot;peripheral economies&quot;, proving both our capability and commitment to facing up to challenges and implementing reforms.  More than &#8364;28 billion in tax rises and expenditure cuts have taken place.  As Deputies are well aware, these have led to a considerable reduction in living standards for the majority of citizens.  Pressure on public services has increased and significant hardship is being felt by wide sections of the population, not least by those in unemployment and householders struggling with mortgage debt.</p><p><br /> At the time the banking crisis emerged, there was no EU-wide mechanism in place to help deal with the difficulties Ireland faced and to this day an EU-wide bank resolution regime is still not in place.  Despite agreement in principle on implementing such a mechanism, none will commence for some time yet.  When the Taoiseach was asked why Ireland is a special case and how he is explaining this message to other European leaders, he stated Ireland is &quot;unique&quot; because it had &quot;the European position imposed on it&quot; and this had resulted in the sovereign having to take on the debts of all the banks.  In effect, he is arguing that we have a strong moral case to put to our European partners.  I say this in full acknowledgement of decisions made by the previous Government. </p><p><br /> The promissory note alone comprises nearly half of the &#8364;64 billion cost of bailing out the banks.  As a result, this &quot;IOU&quot; amounts to 20% of GDP and continues to place an enormous burden on the Irish people.  As Deputies are aware, members of the public have displayed a remarkable level of resilience in the face of extremely painful measures but their patience and understanding is wearing thin.  There is a widespread view that while people have done all that has been asked of them in terms of measures to return the economy to a sustainable footing, this is not being reciprocated by action from our European partners to underpin what has been achieved to date.  As well as the practical case I have outlined, there is a very strong moral case for significant relief on the promissory note.</p><p><b></b>It is in everyone's interests that Ireland turns out to be a success story and I believe we can be a success.  In contrast to all other programme countries, Ireland&#8217;s economy is capable of returning to sustainable levels of economic activity.  If a country that follows EU-IMF conditions to the letter subsequently fails to successfully return to the markets with its creditworthiness restored, what kind of example will that scenario set for others?  Movement on the promissory notes could significantly cut Ireland&#8217;s funding requirements in the years ahead as we seek a sustainable return to the markets.</p><p><br /> I propose to address the claim that the Government did not pay the promissory note instalment that was due last March.  Repeated by a number of Government Ministers recently, this claim is simply untrue.  The European Central Bank's only concern last March, and a position it maintains, was that the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, pay off the money it owes the Irish Central Bank.  It is instructive to examine the following statement made by the ECB at the time.  It states:<blockquote>It is very important that the Irish state will honour the 3.06 billion euro amortisation of the promissory notes.  This will reduce the emergency liquidity assistance which IBRC receives from the Central Bank of Ireland and thus the Eurosystem.  </blockquote> What happened last March was that the Government was essentially given a loan by Bank of Ireland for one year, although it may be rolled over for a longer period, and IBRC used this cash to pay down some of the money it owes the Central Bank.  The ECB did not budge one inch on its position and insisted the exceptional liquidity assistance, ELA, be paid down as quickly as possible.  At the time, the renowned economist Karl Whelan put the matter well when he stated: <blockquote>What has been achieved?  In essence, the government has delayed paying out the cash for this year&#8217;s &#8364;3.1 billion but the IBRC (and hence the state) now has to repay Bank of Ireland this amount next year . . . Because the ECB have fully achieved their goal &#8212; getting a full &#8364;3.1 billion ELA repayment &#8212; calling this &quot;a deal&quot; with the ECB is hardly appropriate.  </blockquote>It is important to remember this in the current negotiations.  If and when a deal is concluded, and I believe there is a good prospect for securing agreement, it must be transparent and its impact readily quantifiable.   We must not have a repeat of the farce we witnessed last March when the Minister came into the House on the eve of the payment being due, issued a convoluted statement and refused to accept any questions from Opposition spokespersons.  It subsequently emerged through replies to parliamentary questions that the so-called deal added &#8364;90 million to the general Government deficit in 2012 and more than &#8364;400 million to the general Government debt.  This House must be treated with a little more respect and any deal concluded must be properly scrutinised and debated. </p><p><br /> We will quickly find out the market reaction to any deal.  Since the summit of 29 June 2012, Irish bond yields have been falling as the market priced in a substantial reduction in our absolute debt levels and the cost of servicing our debt.  If, following a deal, bond yields are stable or fall further, we can assume the market believes our debt sustainability has been improved.  However, as we all know well, bond yields are remote from the lives of most ordinary citizens.  What people are truly concerned about is the scale of tax increases, spending cuts, increased charges and reduced services they face.  The Government is planning &#8364;5.1 billion in new taxes and cuts over the next two budgets.  It is imperative that any deal on the promissory note is accompanied by a solidarity dividend to citizens.  For ordinary people, the litmus test of any deal is whether it will result in easier budgets, if it will put more money in their pockets, if the domestic economy will begin to recover and whether money will be available for investment in job creation initiatives. </p><p><br /> The Government is planning to take a further &#8364;3.1 billion out of the economy in 2014.  In cash terms, a deal on the promissory note could conceivably result in a significant reduction in this fiscal adjustment.  This would make a real difference, one that people would feel, without compromising efforts to achieve the 3% deficit target by 2015.</p><p> In the short term, the true cost of the promissory note is the rate at which the Central Bank borrows from the ECB, that being 0.75% or thereabouts.  The rate will not be officially confirmed.  While the interest rate on the promissory note itself is high, the interest is paid to a State-owned institution in what is essentially a circular transaction over the fullness of time.  Where the cost rises for the State is when it must go to the market to borrow the money required for the annual repayment of the promissory note.  The longer we can get the interest rate of 0.75%, the cheaper the overall cost of the banks.</p><p> The Minister for Finance has confirmed to us and I am sure others via parliamentary questions that no agreed schedule exists for the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, to pay down the exceptional liquidity assistance, ELA, that it owes to the Central Bank.  This is a fundamental point, as it undermines the ECB's argument on monetary financing.  &quot;Monetary financing&quot; is an elastic term and the ECB seems to be able to bend it in whatever way suits its agenda at a particular point in time.</p></speech>

As such, we have a legitimate case to make in respect of the issue of monetary financing.</p><p>  From what we can gather from media reports, the Government's preferred solution is to kick this matter as far into the future as possible via a very long-term bond that is serviced by an annual coupon rate.  Such a proposal is consistent with the way the ECB has been interpreting the question of monetary financing under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p><p>  I could go on, but I will not.  I genuinely wish the Minister and the Government well in their negotiations.  This is a one-off opportunity and Ireland has momentum behind it.  The Government has accrued considerable international political support.  This now needs to be leveraged.  While the ECB guards its independence closely, it is not immune to political influence.  If we can get the right deal, it will make a tangible difference to our economic recovery.</p><p>  Exiting the bailout is one matter, but it will not make much of a difference to people's day-to-day lives.  What will make a difference is shaping the fiscal decisions of the House through a proper deal on the promissory notes to take the sharp edge off the next number of budgets.  This is eminently doable and I wish the Government well in its efforts in this regard.  Speaking on behalf of my party, the Government will receive constructive support if it achieves a proper deal.</p></speech>

The signing of the promissory note has been a disaster for the State.  The opportunity cost is significant.  The money could have been spent on jobs, hospitals, education, housing, transport infrastructure and Garda stations.  The note directly translates into water charges, home taxes and higher rates of PRSI, universal social charge, income tax and VAT on the hundreds of thousands of families living on the edge.  The wealth of the nation is being retrospectively swapped for defunct, toxic private debt.</p><p>  This year, the State is literally falling over the 120% debt-to-GDP sustainability ratio, but neither the Taoiseach nor the T&aacute;naiste can summon the nerve to follow through on the mandate they received at the election to seek a write-down.  The reality of people's lives jars grossly with that of our overpaid negotiators, such as the Minister for Finance, who is telling us not to get too excited about the two months remaining in which to get a deal.</p><p>  Today, I met a student from west Dublin called Se&aacute;n.  He is representative of hundreds of thousands of people who are living on the tipping point.  Banking debt and austerity have pared his family's earnings to the bone.  He is concerned about whether his family will be able to pay for him to attend a third level college.  The fees would tip the family over the edge as regards earnings versus expenditure.  Se&aacute;n asked the question why the Government would pour billions of euro into banks that destroyed the country instead of investing his family's hard-earned tax money in educating the next generation.  I could not give him an answer.</p><p>  In the main, Se&aacute;n's generation will judge this Government on whether it writes down the debt or shares the burden with a generation that has not even been born yet.  Two years ago, the Government parties broadly agreed with Sinn F&eacute;in's current position, but the Government's inability to negotiate and its singular strategy of ingratiating itself with the ECB have sorely let the country down.</p><p>  The Government needs to outline the objectives clearly and to communicate real red lines, pivotal to which is that there should be no deal without a write-down.  It must also demonstrate our deeply held intent to reach a resolution on this issue with the ECB.  Equally, it must show our preparedness to walk away from the March payment of the promissory note if no fair resolution is forthcoming.  If the economic self-interests of larger EU member states are more equal than the economic self-interests of smaller member states, we are in a bad state.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il made catastrophic blunders in the bank rescue process, but Ireland's total bailout price tag reflects actions compelled by the ECB.  Some claim that monetary financing is outside the legal remit of the ECB, but the truth is that the ECB has often tailored its rules to suit circumstances.  For example, the bond buying programme, long-term refinancing operations and the ongoing manipulation of collateral requirements have long blurred the line between fiscal and monetary policy.</p><p>  Most Deputies enter the Chamber with a desire to leave something lasting behind for future generations.  Unless the Government gets real about the promissory note, the Minister of State's legacy will be a generation scattered throughout the world and a broken Ireland left behind.  Ireland cannot carry this burden by itself.</p></speech>
